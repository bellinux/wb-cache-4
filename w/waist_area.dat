Evanescent field-based sensors {{depend on the}} tapered area geometry {{which is one of}} the important factors for optimising the sensor performance as well as achieving better sensitivity and higher resolution. Tapering fabrication process needs to be controlled properly in order to achieve the optimal design. A two-dimensional model of the tapered sensor is proposed and simulated using Finite Element Analysis software, COMSOL Multiphysics. The light scattering phenomenon is visualized for taper and <b>waist</b> <b>areas.</b> The effects of the taper length, the waist length and the waist diameter have been explored in order to find the optimal geometries design. The model provides initial data to the designer to program and control the taper ration and the taper length the fabrication process in order to obtain the highest penetration depth at the highest resolution. The results show that the evanescent field is significantly high when the core diameter is close or below the wavelength. The output graph illustrates that when the tapering ratio decreases, more light propagate into the surrounding making the sensor more sensitive to the ambient changes. The simulation shows that the profile of the sensor can be fine-tuned by changing the tapering ratio of the waist and the length of the taper in order to obtain high performance, ultra-high-resolution evanescent field sensor...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Construction Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2010 The {{construction}} industry adopts various methods {{to bring about}} the required structure. Typically, in every construction project, health and safety of workers will remain a major concern on site due to accidents, fatalities and illnesses which occur regularly. Despite these incidents raising a concern, construction site activities still involve workers in manual handling of heavy material and repetitive body movements which constitute ergonomic problems; The purpose ofthis study is to investigate the potential impacts of prefabrication and pre-assembly on {{the health and safety of}} construction workers. The objectives of this study were (l) to examine the health and safety hazards associated with traditional construction methods in South Africa; (2) to investigate the merits of prefabrication and pre-assembly in terms of their impact on overall health and safety improvements when compared with traditional construction methods; and (3) to investigate how construction clients perceive the use of prefabrication and pre-assembly as alternative construction methods that positively impact the overall health and safety of construction workers on site. Literature pertaining to the content of this research was extensively reviewed. An exploratory study was undertaken to examine the merits of prefabrication and pre-assembly in reducing ergonomic challenges associated with traditional construction methods, where construction workers were observed and interviewed. A self-administered questionnaire survey was used for construction clients, designers and contractors. The study revealed that 80 % of clients in the sample reported that they preferred traditional construction methods instead of prefabrication. It was also found that clients selected prefabrication and preassembly for other reasons which were not associated with particular improvements ofhealth and safety in construction project. The study found that labour intensive methods also commonly known as traditional construction methods exposed workers to physically demanding activities that posed risks to their health and safety. Reportedly, 76 % of workers experienced pain in their <b>waist</b> <b>areas,</b> 70 % had pain in their shonlder and 66 % had back problems while they were involved in traditional construction. Workers sometimes had to handle heavy material manually, worked at heights and experienced noise caused by heavy construction equipment. However, a case study focused on bricklaying activities and prefabrication insulation wall fixing revealed that prefabrication reduced the exposures of workers to both ergonomic challenges and ergonomic problems. The findings also suggest that traditional construction methods were more hazardous than ones involving prefabrication. Further research is needed to determine whether the use of other forms of prefabricated and preassembled components would reduce ergonomic and health and safety hazards associated with traditional construction methods...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many health indices have a {{relationship}} with anthropometric indices. This research attempts to provide a new measurement: a chronic disease risk fac-tor score built into the regression model. This new model will help people visualize their health status and get multiple information during the process of the healthy examination. Methods: Data from 8, 034 subjects were collected from the data bank of the Health Examination Center in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Related anthropo-metric indices and biochemical factors were selected and used to construct a regression model. The anthropometric indices used were body mass index, waist hip ratio, <b>waist</b> hip <b>area</b> ratio, health index, waist leg ratio and trunk leg ratio. Biochemical data included blood pressure, glucose, triglyceride, cho-lesterol and uric acid, combined to form an anthropometric chronic disease risk factor score. Results: Subjects under 45 years of age had the highest chronic disease risk factor score, and were selected to construct a regression model. The R-square of this model is 0. 355; its predictive error is near 12 %. After verification with a testing group, the regression model could be used to predict health status. Conclusion: The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a new anthropometric chronic dis-ease risk factor score by combining anthropometric indices and biochemical data.

40|$|BackgroundObesity {{epidemic}} {{is related to}} industrialization and urbanization, that have lead to changes in nutrition, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status. However, information on the trajectory of the obesity epidemic in populations experiencing rapid economic development is limited. We therefore investigate trends in obesity from 2002 to 2010 in a southern Chinese population experiencing world's fastest economic developmentMethodsBetween 2002 and 2010 four standardized surveys were conducted in a population of 85 million residents in Guangdong, China. Multistage cluster sampling was adopted to recruit representative samples. Weight, height and waist circumference {{of the participants were}} measured in a standardized way. The analysis included residents aged between 18 and 69 years. The number of participants included in the present analysis for Surveys conducted in 2002, 2004, 2007, and 2010 were 13, 058, 7, 646, 6, 441, and 8, 575, respectively. ResultsFrom year 2002 to 2010, the age-standardized BMI insignificantly changed from 21. 7 kg/m 2 to 22. 3 kg/m 2, and the prevalence of overweight and overall obesity from 15. 8 % to 16. 6 % (both P> 0. 05). The age-standardized waist circumference increased from 73. 7 cm to 78. 4 cm, and prevalence of abdominal obesity increased from 12. 9 % to 23. 7 % (both P< 0. 001). In urban areas, BMI and overall obesity changed little during the eight-year period (BMI from 22. 6 to 22. 7 kg/m 2 and overall obesity from 23. 7 to 21. 4 %), whereas there were slight increases in rural areas (BMI from 20. 8 to 22. 1 kg/m 2 and overall obesity from 8. 2 to 13. 3 %). Waist circumference and abdominal obesity increased significantly in both areas, but the increase was more pronounced in rural areas (in urban <b>area,</b> <b>waist</b> circumference from 75. 1 to 78. 5 cm and abdominal obesity from 16. 8 to 26. 5 % in rural <b>area,</b> <b>waist</b> circumference from 72. 2 to 78. 3 and abdominal obesity from 8. 8 to 22. 0 %). ConclusionsBMI and overall obesity in this population, which has experienced the world's fastest economic development over the past three decades, has been leveling off, while waist circumference and abdominal obesity, independent predictors of cardiovascular risk, have continued to rise. Our findings suggest that obesity epidemic transition in rapidly developing populations may be much faster than what has been observed in Western countries.
