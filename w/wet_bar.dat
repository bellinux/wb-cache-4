In the center is a lounge area with a <b>wet</b> <b>bar</b> and several groups of seats. The stairs to the lower level are located here as well. At the other end are swivel chairs. The lower level contains a bathroom, additional tables, and a snack bar. As built, the lounges had seating for 73. The cars were built with an electric piano in the lower level, which has since been removed.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 Martín Fox {{arranged}} a special Club Tropicana tourist package: Cubana Airlines' Tropicana Special began a round-trip flight that ferried club customers from Miami to the Tropicana and returned them to Florida at 4am the following morning. The plane featured a <b>wet</b> <b>bar</b> stocked with {{a bevy of}} cocktail selections, {{as well as a}} scaled-down version of Armando Romeu's orchestra for anyone brave enough to dance in the aisles.|$|E
25|$|In North America {{receptacles}} {{located in}} places where an easy path to ground exists—such as wet areas and rooms with uncovered concrete floors—must be protected by a GFCI. The US National Electrical Code has required devices in certain locations to be protected by GFCIs since the 1960s. Beginning with underwater swimming pool lights (1968) successive editions of the code have expanded the areas where GFCIs are required to include: construction sites (1974), bathrooms and outdoor areas (1975), garages (1978), areas near hot tubs or spas (1981), hotel bathrooms (1984), kitchen counter receptacles (1987), crawl spaces and unfinished basements (1990), near <b>wet</b> <b>bar</b> sinks (1993), near laundry sinks (2005) and in laundry rooms (2014).|$|E
50|$|Fridges, microwaves, <b>wet</b> <b>bars,</b> popcorn machines, {{ice cream}} machines, soda fountains, and classic soda coolers can {{sometimes}} be found in recreation rooms.|$|R
50|$|The {{second type}} of activity, though {{probably}} more heavily attended than the circuit parties, is simply sitting on the beach. There are literally thousands of large shade tents and dozens that are elaborately outfitted with themed decors, full <b>wet</b> <b>bars,</b> and hand-dug jacuzzis. Most of this crowd begins to arrive around 6:45am {{in time to see}} the last circuit party-goer leaving.|$|R
5000|$|Sitting in the {{bow area}} can be enjoyable because it allows people to catch a breeze and enjoy some of the spray kicked up by the {{progress}} of the boat. The view from a bow rider is also excellent, as passengers can look straight ahead without any obstructions. A more luxuriously outfitted boat can include padded seating, small <b>wet</b> <b>bars,</b> and other features which are designed to enhance passenger comfort and enjoyment.|$|R
500|$|The arena {{features}} 70 Suites and 8 Skyboxes {{each with}} a seating capacity of 22 guests. [...] Suites include amenities such as a <b>wet</b> <b>bar,</b> catering, a private restroom, multiple television monitors, and a sound system. [...] Suites may be rented on a yearly or single-event basis; yearly renters of suites are given access to all Moda Center events. [...] The arena also features modular party suites, which can be configured either {{as a pair of}} 44-person Super Suites, or as one 88-person mega suite.|$|E

2500|$|The TV {{room in the}} {{basement}} is where Elvis often watched three television sets at once, and was within close reach of a <b>wet</b> <b>bar.</b> The TV room's west wall is painted with Elvis' 1970s logo of a lightning bolt and cloud with the initials TCB, for 'taking care of business in a flash'. The south wall has three built-in television sets, a stereo, and cabinets for Elvis' record collection. [...] Opposite of the TV room is the billiard room; Elvis, an avid billiards player, bought the pool table in 1960 and had {{the walls and ceiling}} covered with 350–400 yards of pleated cotton fabric after the two basement rooms were remodeled in 1974. [...] To this day, the pool table sports a tear in one of the corners, reportedly the result of a failed trick shot by one of Elvis' friends.|$|E
60|$|The {{other wagons}} were brought across without mishap; but the dogs {{did not come}} with them. Jones called and called. The dogs howled and howled. Finally I waded out over the <b>wet</b> <b>bars</b> and little streams to a point several hundred yards nearer the dogs. Moze was lying down, but the others were whining and howling {{in a state of}} great perturbation. I called and called. They answered, and even ran into the water, but did not start across.|$|R
60|$|The {{secret was}} out, and I {{wondered}} no more. At once {{the stream and}} <b>wet</b> <b>bars</b> of sand took on a different color. I removed my boots, and waded out to a little bar. The sand seemed quite firm, but water oozed out around my feet; and when I stepped, the whole bar shook like jelly. I pushed my foot through the crust, and the cold, wet sand took hold, and tried to suck me down.|$|R
50|$|All in all, {{even with}} {{reported}} attempts to retain original floor plans {{as much as}} possible, the former 63 rooms were reduced to 28 in the restoration. This supposedly resulted in some rather unusual rooms with odd shapes and angles and a larger version of the original rooms from 1895. Modern plumbing and renovation brought the baths in from the hallway, and all rooms are equipped with private baths. Some luxury rooms are reported to have Jacuzzis and <b>wet</b> <b>bars</b> as well.|$|R
2500|$|In 2001, {{the house}} was {{purchased}} by Robert Niosi, Sally Lee, and their family, and Niosi undertook a major renovation of the home: he expanded the kitchen and changed {{the door to the}} servants' quarters into a bookshelf. He also renovated the master bedroom upstairs but left the circular windows alone, expanding the front door window to let more light into the front hallway, and he copper-paneled the front Dutch-style door. In addition, the outdated boiler system was replaced, and the entrance to the living room was widened. Niosi left the exterior relatively unchanged, but he said that when he bought the house, it was very [...] "austere" [...] inside—the walls were simple white or beige in color, with no ornamentation; the only decoration was on the unique Harrison-designed spiral staircase to the second floor, which had brass bamboo supports that Niosi left alone; he stated that the staircase had been built in Japan and exported in one piece. Niosi had previously lived in a Victorian apartment, decorated both inside and out, so when he moved to this Harrison-designed house, it was initially cold and unwelcoming with its simplicity and lack of decoration. To address this, Niosi added more traditional 1930s Mackintosh Arts and Crafts interior wood paneling and William Morris wallpaper in order to decorate and soften the interior of the house and make it more warm and inviting. This redecoration gave this residence a unique combination of a conventional 1930s Arts and Crafts interior design with an unconventional early Modernist exterior. He also had many walls and doors removed that were deemed unnecessary, and raised ceilings and added windows. The house's kitchen, with an adjoining maid's room and bathroom, was replaced with a modern kitchen. The living room was split to include a home theater and the <b>wet</b> <b>bar</b> was replaced to accommodate a film collection. After the remodel, parts of the house were featured in Ladies' Home Journal and Parents.|$|E
50|$|Wet {{bars are}} found in homes for {{entertainment}} purposes. A finished basement is a typical location for a <b>wet</b> <b>bar.</b> Wet bars are relatively simple to build, and, thus, many homeowners have turned the <b>wet</b> <b>bar</b> into a do-it-yourself project. Recently, hotels have been incorporating wet bars into rooms, {{in which case the}} customer must pay to use the <b>wet</b> <b>bar</b> per drink. Including a refrigerator beneath the bar or cabinet is a popular option. This is useful for making chilled drinks and preserving previously made mixtures.|$|E

5000|$|The {{refurbishment}} {{of the two}} athletics buildings {{was especially}} important. Bruce Parker, MSU's associated athletics director, said funding for these projects was directly attributable to the president: [...] "None of the athletics renovations would have happened without Mike Malone". The stadium renovation included new public-area seating, three tiers of skyboxes, and a camera deck to permit televising of games. Inside the stadium were a new second-floor banquet room, third-floor bar and concessions area, and handicapped-accessible seating, doors, restrooms, and other areas throughout the structure. Every skybox contained indoor seating for 12, outdoor seating for 12 (with overhead radiant heating elements), and blue-and-gold floor tiled <b>wet</b> <b>bars,</b> and cost $7,000 to construct. Two-thirds of the skyboxes had been rented {{by the time the}} renovations were complete.|$|R
50|$|Seventy suites were {{completed}} with <b>wet</b> <b>bars,</b> closed circuit monitors and leather upholstery. Averaging over 650 sq ft, the suites {{are the largest}} in the country for this type of facility. All the activity was generated by over 50 subcontractors and 2.3 million man hours without a single injury. Known as Broward County Civic Center during construction, the naming rights were won in July 1998 by National Car Rental—a company purchased by Huizenga in January 1997—leading to the venue being named the National Car Rental Center. A certificate of occupancy was given on September 12, and the arena opened on October 3 with a Celine Dion concert. The next day, Elton John performed, and on October 9 the Panthers had their first home game at the new arena.|$|R
40|$|Cat's {{whiskers}} or {{known as}} java tea is a herb plant. Scientific name of java tea is Orthosiphon stamineus.

50|$|A <b>wet</b> <b>bar</b> is a {{small bar}} used for mixing {{alcoholic}} beverages, which differs from a regular bar in that it includes a sink with running water. A <b>wet</b> <b>bar</b> can increase {{the rate at which}} drinks are served because of the sink, which allows for glasses to be cleaned immediately. The sink may also be used for adding water to drinks.|$|E

60|$|In {{the wood}} the wind rumbled and roared hoarsely overhead, {{but not a}} breath stirred among the saddened bracken. An {{occasional}} raindrop was shaken out of the trees; I slipped on the <b>wet</b> paths. Black <b>bars</b> striped the grey tree-trunks, where water had trickled down; the bracken was overthrown, its yellow ranks broken. I slid down the steep path to the gate, out of the wood.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{released}} on 12 July 1999, and supported by a string of appearances on television shows such as CD:UK, The Pepsi Chart Show and Top of the Pops. However, it did not pick up {{a great deal of}} airplay amid fears that it contained inflammatory lyrics about London, and the line [...] "sushi <b>bars,</b> <b>wet</b> fish, it just sucks the life out of me" [...] was removed for the radio edit. It peaked in the UK charts at number 20.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to [...] "The Homer Simpson Show"'s surprising success, Krusty's show is eventually cancelled by Channel 6. Lisa suggests that Homer put {{his power to}} good use, but ironically, ratings decline and Homer's show is also cancelled thanks to Lisa's suggestion. Meanwhile, Krusty pitches his Bar Mitzvah to the Fox network. When the Bar Mitzvah ("Krusty the Klown's <b>Wet</b> 'n' Wild <b>Bar</b> Mitzvah"), featuring Mr. T as a guest, airs, it becomes a ratings smash, but the spectacle disappoints his father. Krusty feels guilty, and after the show, he holds a real Bar Mitzvah the traditional way at a Jewish temple.|$|R

5000|$|Magnesium is sold {{in stores}} in shaved or bar form. Shavings burn white-hot, are {{impossible}} to smother with carbon dioxide or sand, and can ignite even <b>wet</b> kindling. Solid <b>bars</b> are impossible to ignite under normal conditions (and difficult even with a welding torch), and are thus very safe to carry. Magnesium powder and shavings are pyrophoric (they oxidise rapidly when exposed to the air). It is dangerous to carry pre-shaved magnesium [...] - [...] at best, it loses potency, at worst, it can spontaneously ignite and is then nearly unquenchable. Magnesium bars are sometimes sold with a length of ferrocerium cast into one edge.|$|R
50|$|From 1931 to 1943 {{the stadium}} {{underwent}} three major rebuilds as Chandler strived {{for the perfect}} stadium. The kennels and paddock were situated between {{the third and fourth}} bends with a veterinary room and trainers room at either end. Between the first and second bends was the Senior Club sandwiched by two stands. The back straight had one large covered stand but the home straight had another Senior Club which was located under the upstairs ballroom and dance band. There were two tea rooms and a <b>wet</b> and dry <b>bar</b> in the main grandstand and sixteen tote buildings. The track was 440 yards in circumference and was described as the slowest and most difficult course in London. The hare was an 'Inside Sumner' and there was an artesian well near the fourth bend used for watering the track.|$|R
5000|$|Snow powder (or snow sugar) is a non-melting form of {{icing sugar}} usually {{consisting}} of dextrose, starch and anti-binding agents, useful for retaining its structure when dusted onto cakes or pastries that require refrigeration. It is mostly used for decorative purposes. There is also titanium dioxide in it, which {{gives it a}} vibrant white colour. Use of this sugar is for visual appeal without the sugar melting into the pastry from moisture. It is mostly used on baked goods that are slightly <b>wet</b> like fruit <b>bars</b> and tarts. It will not melt {{even if it is}} sprinkled on whipped cream or ice cream. Snow sugar is less sweet than regular powdered sugar because dextrose (a type of sugar made when starchy plants are broken down into monosaccharides using enzymes) around 205% less sweet than regular sugar.|$|R
