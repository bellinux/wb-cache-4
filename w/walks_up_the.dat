500|$|The song is {{performed}} on the Speak Now World Tour. Clips of the performance {{can be seen in}} the music video for Swift's single [...] "Sparks Fly". In the clips we see a bride wearing [...] "a gown shaped like a pastry" [...] as she <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairs to the groom and preacher. Swift {{can be seen in the}} background making a scene during this clip. Other clips show the bridesmaids waving, the bride getting onto them while the groom is clapping and the groom running off with Swift. According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV.com, the performance is [...] "a very theatrical moment" [...] in which [...] "Swift acted out crashing a wedding. She eventually stole the groom away, as she sings in the song, and the pair ran through the crowd together." ...|$|E
500|$|More than 20 years pass, {{and it is}} 1927. An aged Joe on the Cotton Blossom sings a reprise of [...] "Ol' Man River". Cap'n Andy has {{a chance}} meeting with Ravenal and {{arranges}} his reunion with Magnolia. Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the Cotton Blossom with Kim, who has become a Broadway star. Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated, Charleston version of [...] "Why Do I Love You?" [...] Ravenal sings a reprise of [...] "You Are Love" [...] to the offstage Magnolia. Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back, Magnolia, who has never stopped loving him, greets him warmly and does. As the happy couple <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> boat's gangplank, Joe and the cast sing the last verse of [...] "Ol' Man River".|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{appears in}} the video as a hooded wizard who enters an Egyptian palace and {{attempts}} to entertain the Pharaoh's bored Queen. Two other entertainers have failed, and she has sent them to be executed. The Queen sees that this wizard is different — instead of juggling or eating fire, he <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steps to her throne and sings to her, asking her if she [...] "remembers the time" [...] they were together. The Pharaoh (played by Murphy) hardly appreciates this move and summons his guards. Jackson runs away to another room and begins elaborate, Egyptian-style choreography with the Pharaoh's servants. When the guards find him, Jackson [...] turns into golden sand. [...] In the video, Jackson {{was dressed in a}} costume made of gold satin. He wore golden chain mail, a white skirt with a phallic dangling sash, black pants and black boots. This video features a physically complicated dance routine that became the centerpiece of other videos from the Dangerous album.|$|E

500|$|Exterior {{shots of}} the Luthor Mansion were shot at the Hatley Castle in Victoria, two hours west of Vancouver by ferry. Time {{constraints}} forced scenes, which were shot from multiple angles, to sometimes be shot at separate locations. A scene involving Whitney (Eric Johnson) and Lana (Kristin Kreuk) sitting on her porch was shot at two different locations. Close-ups of Whitney were shot under a football stadium, while close-ups of Lana were shot in a potato-processing factory. Unable to shoot at the house being used as the Lang residence, the crew built Lana's front porch inside a sewage processing facility for the final scene of the episode where Lana <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairs to her house. The local sewage treatment facility is also {{the site for the}} LuthorCorp pesticide plant, which Lex was sent to Smallville to manage. The crash site of Clark's ship was shot at the sandpits where Mission to Mars was filmed. Smallville's Main Street was filmed in both the town of Merritt, which is three hours east of Vancouver, and in the town of Cloverdale. Most of the filming took place in Cloverdale, since the town had a long stretch of vacant buildings that could double as Smallville's Main Street. When the production crew came to film the opening teaser, they had to decorate the town with ribbons and balloons, as well as paint some of the buildings to attain Millar's idea of [...] "Smalltown, USA". Two sets were built just for the pilot. The Kent storm cellar was built as a cover set inside the farm's barn. For the cemetery scene between Clark and Lana, production designer Bernard Hides built the entire cemetery from scratch in an empty field.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day before}} Commencement, the seniors walk in {{procession}} to the Bema, a natural amphitheater in College Park. [...] After a humorous {{history of the}} class and other speeches, the class <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill to the stump of the Old Pine, where they hold a farewell ceremony. [...] Students began conducting such ceremonies at the Old Pine in the 1830s, according to alumni of that period. [...] For more than 140 years, the ceremony included the smoking of what were designated [...] "peace pipes"; the offensiveness {{of the practice of}} smashing the pipes on the pine, introduced in the 1880s, caused the seniors to omit the smoking element in the early 1990s.|$|E

Mrs Warren pretends to laugh, but looks after him with perceptible concern. Then, she whispers to Crofts] Whats the matter with him? What does he take it like that for? ...|$|E
