5|$|As Secretary, Jewell {{approved}} {{the first phase}} of the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP). The DRECP focuses on renewable energy and land conservation in California's desert. At the signing ceremony, held September 16, 2016, at the Santa Rosa & San Jacinto Mountains National Monument Visitor Center, Secretary Jewell stated phase one was intended to streamline approval for solar, <b>wind,</b> <b>and</b> geothermal projects. The DRECP also aimed to preserve 4.2million acres of land. Conservation groups viewed the initiative more favorably than did <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> solar developers, who criticized the DRECP for removing some public land designated for development.|$|E

5|$|Due to the Bay Area's diverse topography, {{the result}} of the clashing tectonic plates, the region is home to {{numerous}} microclimates that lead to pronounced differences in climate and temperature over short distances. Within the city of San Francisco, natural and artificial topographical features direct the movement of <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> fog, resulting in startlingly varied climates between city blocks. Along the Golden Gate Strait, oceanic <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> fog from the Pacific Ocean are able to penetrate the mountain barriers inland into the Bay Area. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and fog. The microclimate phenomenon is most pronounced during this time, when fog penetration is at its maximum in areas near the Golden Gate strait, while the South Bay and areas further inland are sunny and dry.|$|E
