5|$|A Ghost Is Born is {{the fifth}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band <b>Wilco.</b> Released on June 22, 2004, it features singer Jeff Tweedy on lead guitar more than any previous <b>Wilco</b> album. The band streamed the album online free, and offered a five-song EP to purchasers.|$|E
5|$|A.M. is {{the debut}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band <b>Wilco,</b> released on March 28, 1995, by Sire Records and Reprise Records. The album was released only {{months after the}} breakup of Uncle Tupelo, an alternative country band that was the predecessor of <b>Wilco.</b> Prior to its release, there was debate about whether the album {{would be better than}} the debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Tweedy was {{preoccupied with}} trying to {{establish}} <b>Wilco</b> as a viable band on the Reprise label and decided to add another guitarist to the band. Brian Henneman, the lead singer for The Bottle Rockets, was brought into the recording sessions as a lead guitarist. Steel guitarist Lloyd Maines and bassist Daniel Corrigan {{also contributed to the}} album. Corrigan also photographed the band for the liner booklet. Howie Weinberg mastered the album, while Barbara Longo provided graphic design. Brian Henneman had to leave the band shortly after recording the album, and was replaced by former Titanic Love Affair guitarist Jay Bennett. Tweedy also attempted to create a more collaborative environment than Uncle Tupelo, requesting songwriting contributions from other members. John Stirratt submitted three songs, hoping to become a secondary songwriter for <b>Wilco.</b> However, although the songs were recorded as demos, only one ("It's Just That Simple") was selected to appear on the album, and was the only Stirratt song, and the only song by <b>Wilco</b> not to have lyrics written by Tweedy, to appear on any <b>Wilco</b> album.|$|E
50|$|The Invisible Way is {{the tenth}} {{full-length}} album by Low, released in 2013 by Sub Pop. It {{is produced by}} <b>Wilco's</b> Jeff Tweedy and recorded at <b>Wilco's</b> studio in Chicago.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wilco's</b> eighth studio album, The Whole Love, was {{released}} on September 27, 2011. The first single of the album is titled [...] "Art of Almost". The B-Side to [...] "I Might" [...] is a cover of Nick Lowe's 1977 song [...] "I Love My Label". The single was shown at the <b>Wilco's</b> 2011 Solid Sound Festival at MassMoca and was met by positive reviews. The entire album was streamed live on <b>Wilco's</b> official website for 24 hours between September 3 and 4, 2011.|$|R
50|$|This {{album is}} a {{favorite}} of <b>Wilco's</b> Jeff Tweedy.|$|R
5|$|While <b>Wilco</b> was {{recording}} tracks, Jay Farrar {{formed a}} band of his own, Son Volt. Son Volt signed to Warner Bros. Records and began recording their first album (also produced by Paulson), Trace, in November 1994. The fact that both <b>Wilco</b> and Son Volt began working on album almost immediately after the Uncle Tupelo breakup caused debate among critics, fans, and Warner Brothers about {{which would be the}} better band. Joe McEwen, who originally signed Uncle Tupelo to a Warner subsidiary, felt that <b>Wilco</b> was taking a step backwards from the material on Anodyne. McEwen urged Richard Dodd, who had recently mixed Tom Petty's Wildflowers, to remix the album. Dodd emphasized Tweedy's vocals to increase the chances of success on radio.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wilco</b> began touring {{before the}} album was released. Their live debut was on November 27, 1994, at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, a venue where Uncle Tupelo had first {{received}} significant media attention. The band was billed for that concert as Black Shampoo, {{a reference to a}} 1970s B-movie, and the show sold out. <b>Wilco</b> continued to tour for two hundred shows, culminating in show at the South by Southwest Music Conference in Austin, Texas, in March 1995. A.M. was released on Reprise Records on March 28, 1995.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wilco</b> {{had planned}} on {{releasing}} Yankee Hotel Foxtrot on September 11, 2001, but Tweedy {{did not want}} a change in record labels to significantly delay {{the release of the}} album. Within weeks of being released from the label and Jay Bennett leaving the band, MP3s of all tracks from the album began to appear on file sharing networks. In a decision aimed at discouraging the downloading of lower quality unlicensed MP3s and having some control over how the album was distributed, on September 18, 2001, <b>Wilco</b> began streaming the entirety of the album on their official website. The wilcoworld.net website registered over 50,000 hits that day, eight times as much as typical daily traffic. Traffic to the website quadrupled the normal traffic over the next few months. The following tour was a success financially, and members of <b>Wilco</b> observed that fans sang along with unreleased songs from the album.|$|E
50|$|Together at Last is {{the first}} solo album by <b>Wilco's</b> Jeff Tweedy. It was {{released}} on June 23, 2017 by dBpm Records. It marks the first release of a proposed retrospective series titled Loft Acoustic Sessions that will see Tweedy revisit songs from <b>Wilco's</b> catalog, {{as well as from}} his Golden Smog and Loose Fur side projects.|$|R
5000|$|The {{theme music}} to Jarret's Room is <b>Wilco's</b> [...] "I'm Always In Love".|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the release}} of Circles Sansone has joined Stirratt as part of <b>Wilco's</b> current six-man lineup.|$|R
5|$|Both {{independent}} and major record labels {{bid for the}} right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he {{wanted to be able to}} put the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100,000 records. <b>Wilco</b> decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, <b>Wilco</b> recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate.|$|E
5|$|Following Uncle Tupelo's final tour, Tweedy {{encouraged}} his bandmates to {{join him}} in a new group, while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own. Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle Tupelo lineup, and created <b>Wilco.</b> <b>Wilco</b> began rehearsing {{a few days after the}} final Uncle Tupelo concert, and by August 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album, A.M.. Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band, Son Volt; Boquist was a multi-instrumentalist who had performed with Joe Henry as the opening act on Uncle Tupelo's last tour. Boquist also recruited his brother Dave, and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave Belleville to join the group. Farrar's new four-piece began recording their debut album Trace in November 1994.|$|E
5|$|Loose Fur is an American {{rock band}} {{comprising}} <b>Wilco</b> members Jeff Tweedy and Glenn Kotche, and <b>Wilco</b> collaborator Jim O'Rourke. The trio first convened in May 2000 {{in preparation for}} a Tweedy performance at a festival in Chicago. Tweedy was offered the opportunity to collaborate with an artist of his choosing, and he decided to work with O'Rourke. O'Rourke brought Kotche to a rehearsal session, and the trio recorded an album's worth of songs. The trio have since released two albums, 2003's Loose Fur and 2006's Born Again in the USA, for Drag City. The band has only toured once.|$|E
50|$|Two {{strategy}} guides {{were released}} that contained novelizations {{of the first}} five games from Roger <b>Wilco's</b> perspective.|$|R
5000|$|Tipitinas is {{featured}} prominently in <b>Wilcos</b> Ashes of American Flags documentary {{and the accompanying}} downloadable live album ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at SnowGhost Music in Whitefish, Montana http://www.snowghostmusic.com and [...] <b>Wilco's</b> Foxtrot Studio in Chicago, Illinois.|$|R
5|$|Only {{days after}} the breakup, Tweedy decided {{to form a new}} group. He was able to retain the lineup of Uncle Tupelo sans Farrar, and rechristened the band <b>Wilco.</b> In mid-May, the band began to rehearse songs in the office of band manager Tony Margherita, and hired {{producer}} Brian Paulson, who produced Anodyne. <b>Wilco</b> first recorded demo tracks for the album at Easley studio in Memphis, Tennessee, in June. Stirratt recommended the studio based on previous experience as a member of The Hilltops, and Tweedy had heard of the studio through a Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recording. Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, signed Jeff Tweedy after hearing the tapes, and recording for the album continued through August.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack was {{released}} under Hollywood Records on August 11, 2009. The soundtrack features tracks from <b>Wilco,</b> The Burning Hotels, Velvet Underground, Peter Bjorn and John, Seventeen Evergreen, Honor Society, the Daze, Nick Drake and David Bowie.|$|E
5|$|Being There is {{the second}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band <b>Wilco,</b> released on October 29, 1996 by Reprise Records. Despite its release as a double album, Being There was sold at a single album price {{as a result of}} a deal between lead singer Jeff Tweedy and the band's label Reprise Records. The album was an improvement for the band in both sales and critical reception, in contrast to their debut album A.M. (1995). Taking its name from the 1979 film of the same name, the self-produced album featured more surrealistic and introspective writing than on A.M.. This was due in part to several significant changes in Tweedy's life, including the birth of his first child. Musically, it juxtaposed the alternative country styles songs reminiscent of Uncle Tupelo with psychedelic, surreal songs. It was the only <b>Wilco</b> album with steel guitarist Bob Egan, and their last with multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston.|$|E
50|$|They {{will release}} Tuscumbia in 2017. It was {{recorded}} at FAME Studios and mixed at <b>Wilco's</b> Loft Studio in Chicago.|$|R
5000|$|Kids These Days 2012 debut, [...] "Traphouse Rock," [...] was {{produced}} by <b>Wilco's</b> Jeff Tweedy and mixed by Mario C.|$|R
50|$|Cornellà {{collaborated with}} visual {{designer}} Stefania Lusini in 2016 as an illustrator {{for the cover}} of <b>Wilco's</b> tenth studio album, Schmilco.|$|R
5|$|<b>Wilco</b> began touring {{in support}} of Ghost even before the album had been released. Multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band after the {{recording}} sessions to join a theater production, so <b>Wilco</b> added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to replace him. Sansone had been playing with The Autumn Defense, a side project led by bassist John Stirratt. However, the tour to support the album had to be abridged. In May 2004, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago, Illinois due to chronic migraine headaches, anxiety attacks, and clinical depression. In the process of treating the ailments, Tweedy became addicted to prescription painkillers. His rehab led to the cancellation of the European stage of the tour and a delay in the album's release date. Intended for release on June 8, 2004, the album was officially released on June 22, 2004.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wilco</b> {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Nonesuch Records in November 2001 after a lengthy dispute with Reprise Records over the release of the band's fourth album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Foxtrot was welcomed with positive reviews from The Village Voice—where the album was rated by the critics as the best album of 2002—and Rolling Stone. It sold over 590,000 copies, earning a Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Jeff Tweedy {{provided}} the lead vocals for the album and John Stirratt, {{the only other}} original member of the band, played bass guitar and added backing vocals. Lead guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone performed here on a <b>Wilco</b> album for the first time. Glenn Kotche performed on the drums and other percussion instruments, and Mikael Jorgensen played keyboards. Other instrumentation was provided by Patrick Newbery (trumpet and flugelhorn), Nick Broste (trombone), and Rick Parenti (baritone sax).|$|E
50|$|Tweedy {{worked with}} the psychedelic-influenced garage rock group White Denim on their {{upcoming}} record, recording some songs at <b>Wilco's</b> Chicago studio The Loft.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2009, it was {{announced}} that she would make a guest appearance on the track [...] "You and I" [...] on <b>Wilco's</b> seventh album.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wilco's</b> album A Ghost Is Born (2004) {{contains}} [...] "Less Than You Think", a 15-minute track containing ~12 {{minutes of}} droning ambience {{after a brief}} piano-based melody.|$|R
5|$|In 2001, AOL {{merged with}} Time Warner to form AOL Time Warner. Time Warner's {{market share of}} the music {{industry}} had dropped almost five percent from the mid-1990s, and the new executives ordered the termination of 600 jobs. One of those jobs was Reprise Records president Howie Klein, who had been a big supporter of <b>Wilco</b> on the label. Klein's dismissal placed head A representative David Kahne in charge of the decision whether to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the country}} music charts were {{dominated}} by pop singers with only tangential influences from country music, a trend that has continued since. The 1980s saw a revival of honky-tonk-style country {{with the rise of}} people like Dwight Yoakam and the new traditionalists Emmylou Harris and Ricky Skaggs, as well as the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo. Later alternative country performers, like Whiskeytown's Ryan Adams and <b>Wilco,</b> found some mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|Josh Grier, Wilco's lawyer, {{was able}} to {{negotiate}} a buy-out of the band from Reprise. The band would keep {{the rights to the}} album if they paid Reprise $50,000. Before <b>Wilco</b> could accept the deal, Reprise called the band and changed their offer to give the band the rights to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot for free. Despite Reprise's efforts to accommodate Wilco's departure, the process marred public relations after an article in the Chicago Tribune described what had happened.|$|E

5000|$|The album Still was {{produced}} by <b>Wilco's</b> Jeff Tweedy and recorded at <b>Wilco's</b> The Loft Studio in Chicago. [...] Thompson approached Tweedy as he wished to shake up his approach to making records, stating that [...] "Jeff is musically very sympathetic. Although some of his contributions are probably rather subtle to the listener’s ear, they were really interesting and his suggestions were always very pertinent.” [...] Tweedy stated that [...] "Richard's {{been one of my}} favorite guitar players for a very long time...he's also one of my favorite songwriters and favorite singers".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wilco's</b> {{music has}} been {{inspired}} by {{a wide variety of}} artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. <b>Wilco's</b> musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current [...] "eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres." ...|$|R
