25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could not have done better.|$|E

60|$|To {{keep up the}} circulation, I {{ran around}} the island a dozen times or so, and clambered across its rocky {{backbone}} as many times more-- all of which was of greater service to me, as I afterward discovered, than merely to warm me up.

60|$|We {{finally got}} away {{at two in}} the morning, and when I turned out at six, we were {{rounding}} to at a rocky point where there was an old stone warehouse--at any rate, the ruins of it; two or three decayed dwelling-houses were near by, in the shelter of the leafy hills; but there were no evidences of human or other animal life to be seen. I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had forgotten the river; for I had no recollection whatever of this place; the shape of the river, too, was unfamiliar; there was nothing in sight, anywhere, that I could remember ever having seen before. I was surprised, disappointed, and annoyed.|$|E

Of one thing I was determined--that if the call came it should not find me deaf. Yet all the while I was horribly afraid.|$|E

60|$|When I reached home I {{stopped before}} the big mirror that hung {{in the hall and}} did what I had never done before in my life--looked at myself very scrutinizingly and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had any beauty.

Of course I prospected for the arched gate and was there at nine. The same Nubian attendant opened the gate promptly on time, and I went inside and {{sat on a bench}} by a perfumed fountain with the veiled lady. We had quite an extended chat. She was Myrtle Thompson, a lady journalist, who was writing up the Turkish harems for a Chicago newspaper.

It was she who spoke the first, for I was tongue-tied; I could not open my lips.|$|E
