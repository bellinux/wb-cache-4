This has been effective in identifying the sites of a CSF leak <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a CT scan, lumbar puncture, and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E

5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch.

They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create {{a whole series of}} well-structured songs.

The threshold for making the ballot is 15% and the party announced that Baker had thus received the nomination <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a primary election. However, Fisher argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank votes are not counted {{for the purposes of}} determining the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make the ballot. He sued the Massachusetts Republican State Committee and was certified for the primary ballot after a lengthy battle. In the primary election held on September 9, Baker defeated Fisher with 74% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would always get through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about West Alseks {{subsequent}} civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers for testing purposes.

This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically injected into the boilers <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.|$|E

In 1919, tax revenue from oil production surpassed $1 million ($ in today's terms) and in 1929 it reached $6 million ($ in today's terms).
