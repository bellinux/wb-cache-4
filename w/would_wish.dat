5|$|However, Judge Langlois {{receives}} a letter informing {{him of the}} genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially.|$|E

She complained about the blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> to order fried and spicy foods. She occasionally ("more than once") feasted on chocolate in her old age: sometimes over a kilogramme (2.2lb) of chocolate per week.|$|E
5|$|The PC {{version of}} Worms Armageddon was {{critically}} successful. Whilst writing that veterans of Worms 2 {{would find the}} game to be similar, Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game for being easy to play and control and humorous and the game's graphics, physics, and seemingly endless customization {{as well as the}} game's WormNet. He also likened the single-player missions to the classic game of Lemmings in that the missions often required the player to precisely utilize a limited supply of weapons and tools to accomplish the objective. Among his only criticisms are that the AI-controlled worms do not utilize their full arsenals and that the player <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> that there were more weapons, more diverse graphics and sound, and more content. Matthew Pierce of PC Gamer UK commended Team17 for addressing the problems of single-player (i.e. the missions and AI) that the original Worms and Worms 2 had always been criticized for.|$|E

500|$|The King {{signed the}} Instrument of Abdication on 10 December 1936, in the {{presence}} of his three surviving brothers, the Duke of York (who would ascend the throne the following day as George VI), the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent. Special laws passed by the Parliaments of the Dominions finalised Edward's abdication the following day, or in Ireland's case one day later. On 11 December 1936, Edward said in a radio broadcast, [...] "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties as King as I <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> to do, without the help and support of the woman I love." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{its first}} several publications, [...] "Metzengestein" [...] {{included}} a line about the mother's death by consumption. The young baron says: [...] "It is a path I have prayed to follow. I <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> all I love to perish of that gentle disease." [...] When Poe {{was still a}} child, his own mother, Eliza Poe, died, presumably of consumption. His wife Virginia also had tuberculosis and died in 1847. After her death, Poe altered his personal view of fictional heroines who were sick and idealized sick women while wishing for their death. This more romantic view of death was not uncommon in writing, as in John Keats's [...] "Ode to a Nightingale", which may have inspired Poe.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title and style of a prince, {{explained}} his decision to abdicate in a worldwide radio broadcast. He famously said, [...] "I have {{found it impossible to}} carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> to do without the help and support of the woman I love." [...] Edward departed Britain for Austria the following day; he was unable to join Simpson until her divorce became absolute, several months later. His brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, succeeded to the throne as George VI. George VI's elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth, became heiress presumptive.|$|E

500|$|The Shakespeare Gallery, when {{it opened}} on 4 May 1789, {{contained}} 34 paintings, {{and by the end}} of its run it had between 167 and 170. [...] (The exact inventory is uncertain and most of the paintings have disappeared; only around 40 paintings can be identified with any certainty.) According to Frederick Burwick, during its sixteen-year operation, the Gallery reflected the transition from Neoclassicism to Romanticism. Works by artists such as James Northcote represent the conservative, neoclassical elements of the gallery, while those of Henry Fuseli represent the newly emerging Romantic movement. William Hazlitt praised Northcote in an essay entitled [...] "On the Old Age of Artists", writing [...] "I conceive any person would be more struck with Mr. Fuseli at first sight, but <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> to visit Mr. Northcote oftener." ...|$|E
500|$|Virginia is {{also seen}} in Poe's prose. The short story [...] "Eleonora" [...] (1842)which {{features}} a narrator preparing to marry his cousin, {{with whom he}} lives alongside her mothermay also refer to Virginia's illness. When Poe wrote it, his wife {{had just begun to}} show signs of her illness. It was shortly thereafter that the couple moved to New York City by boat and Poe published [...] "The Oblong Box" [...] (1844). This story, which shows a man mourning his young wife while transporting her corpse by boat, seems to suggest Poe's feelings about Virginia's impending death. As the ship sinks, the husband would rather die than be separated from his wife's corpse. The short story [...] "Ligeia", whose title character suffers a slow and lingering death, may also be inspired by Virginia. After his wife's death, Poe edited his first published story, [...] "Metzengerstein", to remove the narrator's line, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> all I love to perish of that gentle disease", a reference to tuberculosis.|$|E
500|$|Taube {{was born}} November 30, 1915 in Neudorf, Saskatchewan as the {{youngest}} of four boys. [...] His parents were German ethnics from Ukraine which had immigrated to Saskatchewan from the Ukraine in 1911. [...] Growing up, his first language was Low German. [...] In the 1700s, Catherine the Great encouraged Central European farmers to settle in Russia. [...] As the rights afforded to these settlers by Catherine were gradually diminished, many of the settlers headed to North America, with Saskatchewan offering good farmland, and other incentives for immigrants. Taube reflected fondly on his experiences growing up in Saskatchewan, noting: [...] "Certainly, there is nothing about my first 21 years in Saskatchewan, taken {{in the context of}} those times that I <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> to be changed. [...] The advantages that I enjoyed include: [...] the marvelous experience of growing up on a farm, which taught me an appreciation of nature, and taught me also to discipline myself to get necessary jobs done..." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1668, the King {{appointed}} Rupert {{to be the}} Constable of Windsor Castle. Rupert {{was already}} one of the Knights of the Garter, who had their headquarters at the castle, and was a close companion of the King, who <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> to be suitably entertained at the castle. Rupert immediately began to reorder the castle's defences, sorting out the garrison's accommodation, repairing the Devil's Tower, reconstructing the real tennis court and improving the castle's hunting estate. Rupert acquired his own apartments in the castle, which were recorded as being [...] "very singular" [...] with some decorated with an [...] "extraordinary" [...] number of [...] "pikes, muskets, pistols, bandoliers, holsters, drums, back, breast, and head pieces", and his inner chambers [...] "hung with tapisserie, curious and effeminate pictures". King Charles II and Rupert spent much time together over the years hunting and playing tennis together at Windsor, and Rupert was also a close companion of James, the Duke of York. Rupert was considered by Pepys to be the fourth best tennis player in England.|$|E
500|$|Crowley was bisexual, and {{exhibited}} a sexual preference for women, with his homosexual relationships being fewer and clustered {{in the early}} part of his life. In particular he had an attraction toward [...] "exotic women", and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions; Kaczynski stated that [...] "when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but the passion was typically short-lived". Even in later life, Crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers, largely due to his charisma. During homosexual anal intercourse, he usually played the passive role, which Booth believed [...] "appealed to his masochistic side". Crowley argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation, commenting that a person [...] "must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> he were otherwise." [...] On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude; he opposed abortion on moral grounds, believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the film}} was not without its detractors. Richard Roeper gave the film a C+, saying [...] "This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets." [...] Stephen Whitty of Newark Star-Ledger gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and said [...] "The artwork is accomplished, and intricate. The G-rating is genuine, without any gross-out gags. And there's none of the usual winks to the adults with tired, pop-culture references." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote [...] "Both the {{originality}} and stirring emotional complexity of Monsters, Inc., with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world, are missing." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said [...] "This {{is not a bad}} movie, and to small children {{it will be a very}} good one, but it's closer to average than one <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> from the company that gave us Up, WALL-E, The Incredibles, and the Toy Story series." [...] Rene Rodriguez of Miami Herald gave the film two stars out of five and wrote that it [...] "feels half-hearted and lazy, like they weren't even trying. At least show a little effort, guys." ...|$|E

500|$|The North Jersey Media Group {{gave the}} DVD 2.5starts out of five, saying that Madonna {{felt to be}} [...] "overly" [...] {{attached}} to her contemporary songs than her classic releases. They added [...] "that plodding through overlong arrangements of inconsequential songs— from the annoyingly vocoder-treated 'Revolver' early to the throwaway dance cut 'Celebration' at the end— will leave listeners wondering why so many substantial hits were given only a nod, if anything at all." [...] A review by Kevin Taft in online website [...] "Edge on the Net" [...] was overall negative. Taft noticed that Madonna's vocals were altered and mixed {{so much that it}} sounded disembodied and did not match the singer's lips. He was [...] "shocked" [...] to find that the audio CDs also contained the badly mixed songs. The reviewer explained that [...] "The choice to have the backing track turned down so low doesn't help much either. In fact, it makes it sound as if Madonna is on a cabaret stage with a five-piece band... For the six months it took Madge to edit her concert, one <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> she got her vocals to match her lips." [...] However, Taft commended the overall show and the technical brilliance accompanying it.|$|E
500|$|Akira Toriyama loosely modeled Dragon Ball on {{the classic}} Chinese novel Journey to the West; but also redeveloped it from his 1983 {{one-shot}} manga Dragon Boy. He {{has said that the}} fighting was influenced from movies by famous martial arts actor Jackie Chan, as he wanted to create a story with the basic theme of Journey to the West, but with [...] "a little kung fu." [...] Since it was serialized in a shōnen magazine, he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something, without thinking of what the characters <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> for. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at readers older than those of his previous serial Dr. Slump. He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in Dr. Slump, deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought. The island where the Tenkaichi Budōkai is held is modeled after Bali, which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around Bobbidi's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa.|$|E
500|$|While in Buffalo, McKinley had {{two days}} of events: [...] On Thursday, September 5, he was to deliver his address and then tour the fair. [...] The {{following}} day, he was to visit Niagara Falls, and, on his return to Buffalo, meet the public at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds. [...] Part {{of the reason for}} bringing McKinley repeatedly to the fair was to swell the gate receipts; the popular President's visit was heavily advertised. [...] The public reception at the Temple of Music was disliked by his personal secretary, George B. Cortelyou, who, concerned for the President's security, twice tried to remove it from the program. [...] McKinley each time restored it; he wished to support the fair (he agreed with its theme of hemispheric cooperation), enjoyed meeting people, and was not afraid of potential assassins. [...] When Cortelyou asked McKinley a final time to remove the event from the schedule, the President responded, [...] "Why should I? [...] No one <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> to hurt me." [...] Cortelyou warned McKinley that many would be disappointed since the President would not have time to shake hands with all who would line up to meet him. McKinley responded, [...] "Well, they'll know I tried, anyhow." [...] Unable to persuade the President to alter his schedule, Cortelyou telegraphed to authorities in Buffalo, asking them to arrange extra security.|$|E
