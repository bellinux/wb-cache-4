5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|E
25|$|Whilst in England the Court of Chivalry (which last met in 1954) {{is a civil}} court, in Scotland the Lyon Court meets {{often and}} has {{criminal}} jurisdiction. Lord Lyon is empowered to have assumed coats of arms, and <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> affixed to, destroyed. As an example, when Leith Town Hall, now used as a police station, was renovated during the 1990s, several of the coats of arms decorating the Council Chamber {{were found to be}} attributed to the wrong person. The police were given special permission to retain the display, on condition that the tourist guides pointed out the historical anomalies.|$|E
25|$|Benthic spawners: deposit their spawn on or {{near the}} bottom of the sea (or lake). They are usually {{demersal}} fish such as cod and flatfish. These species typically spawn without ceremony; they do not engage in elaborate courtship rituals. Each female is usually followed by several males who fertilize the eggs as they are released. Various strategies ensure the eggs and embryos remain in place, and do not drift with the current. The eggs can adhere to other eggs or to <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> deposited on, or the eggs can be laid in long strings which are wrapped around plants or rocks. Some eggs take on water after they are released, so they can be dropped into cracks where they swell and wedge themselves in place.|$|E

500|$|Many {{other word}} classes exist in {{different}} languages, such as conjunctions like [...] "and" [...] that serve to join two sentences, articles that introduce a noun, interjections such as [...] "wow!", or ideophones like [...] "splash" [...] that mimic {{the sound of}} some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have classifiers that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in Japanese, the general noun classifier for humans is nin (人), and it is used for counting humans, <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> called: ...|$|E
500|$|A post-RTM build of Windows 8, build 9364, {{was leaked}} in March 2013. The build, which was {{believed}} to be of [...] "Windows Blue", revealed a number of enhancements across Windows 8's interface, including additional size options for tiles, expanded color options on the Start screen, the expansion of PC Settings to include more options that were previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, the ability for apps to snap to half of the screen, the ability to take screenshots from the Share charm, additional stock apps, increased SkyDrive integration (such as automatic device backups) and Internet Explorer 11. Shortly afterward on March 26, 2013, corporate vice president of corporate communications Frank X. Shaw officially acknowledged the [...] "Blue" [...] project, stating that continuous development would be [...] "the new normal" [...] at Microsoft, and that [...] "our product groups are also taking a unified planning approach so people get what they want—all of their devices, apps and services working together wherever they are and for <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing." ...|$|E
500|$|For Filipinos, {{music and}} dancing {{is said to}} be a way of life. Natives of the Philippines are {{reported}} to have a tendency to [...] "sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations". Thomeczeck stated, [...] "The Filipinos love music and they love to sing and dance. <b>Whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in a natural way, they can continue that habit in prison." [...] Despite other colleagues' enthusiasm about the dancing, chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing, as CPDRC was undermanned. Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center's Operations Manual, Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen. [...] "As a jail officer, I got worried when I saw it", Rubio commented. The inmates were not fond of the idea either, pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison. Prisoners eventually agreed to dance, but admitted that the routines took awhile to master. [...] "It was difficult at first, but eventually we inmates got used to it", inmate Mario Benito revealed. [...] The program began as an experiment and, after six months, prison chiefs concluded that it was a successful one.|$|E

500|$|... "Disposable Heroes" [...] is an anti-war {{song about}} a young soldier whose fate is {{controlled}} by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, {{it is one of}} the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of [...] "Leper Messiah" [...] challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of [...] "Lie!". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song [...] "Ziggy Stardust". [...] "Orion" [...] is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with a fade-in bass section, heavily processed to resemble an orchestra. It continues with mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass solo at half-tempo. The tempo accelerates during the latter part, and ends with music fading out. Burton arranged the middle section, which features its moody bass line and multipart guitar harmonies. [...] "Damage, Inc." [...] rants about senseless violence and reprisal at an unspecified target. It starts with a series of reversed bass chords based on the chorale prelude of Bach's [...] "Come, Sweet Death". The song then jumps into a rapid rhythm with a pedal-point riff in E that Hammett says was influenced by Deep Purple.|$|E

He dislikes the term anti-globalization being used to describe what he regards as a movement for globalization of social and environmental justice. Chomsky understands what is popularly called [...] "free trade" [...] as a [...] "mixture of liberalization and protection designed by the principal architects of policy {{in the service of}} their interests, which happen to be <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in any particular period." ...|$|E

[...] Matthew Continetti, also writing for CBS, said that conservatives [...] "dismiss the movement as a fringe collection of left tendencies, along with assorted homeless, mental cases, and petty criminals."

2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of your}} ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E
2500|$|Penn and Teller {{often have}} skits and stunts {{performed}} {{with them on}} set or use stock footage to combine reasonable arguments with straightforward, entertaining ridicule. For example, the [...] "Sex, Sex, Sex" [...] episode may be satirizing the media's obsession with sex appeal by having the hosts constantly surrounded by naked actors and actresses. Penn and Teller often close episodes with an impassioned ethical plea against <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> debunking, summarizing how this particular belief is harmful and should be resisted. The presenters distinguish between believers (often explaining that Penn and Teller themselves {{would like to believe}} these things are true, and showing compassion to the people who do think the things are true) and those they see as charlatans out for money or to advance a political agenda, at whom their anger is directed. For example, in their premiere episode, they debunk the idea that psychics can talk to the dead. While expressing the utmost sympathy towards people who are desperate for a chance to speak to a loved one who has died, they explain that charlatans take advantage of this love to get money from people, and deliver false messages {{that have nothing to do}} with the genuine character of the departed.|$|E
