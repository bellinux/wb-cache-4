[...] She continued, [...] "It's not {{something that you can}} be given or that you can just get or that you're born with. It's something that you have to work on." ...|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{enjoyed the}} process of making the film: [...] "The TV {{schedule}} is tight, and you don't always {{have a lot of time}} to <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> drawings." [...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story." [...] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.|$|E

40|$|While MEPDG is an {{effective}} pavement design tool for INDOT, low volume LPA projects may not require that level of complexity. Many agencies have long been comfortable with the 1993 AASHTO Guide for the Design of Pavement Structures and the associated software known as DARWinTM. However, DARWinTM is no longer available, and local agencies and consultants {{are faced with a}} lack of well-supported pavement design tools in the marketplace. PaveXpress is a free online tool to help you create simplified pavement designs using key engineering inputs, based on the AASHTO 1993 and 1998 supplement pavement design process.

60|$|I {{honestly}} {{tell you}} my sentiments and intentions: I {{do not wish to}} <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> fears, but on your sense and affection. It would destroy every comfort of my life to know that you were married to Lady Susan Vernon; it would be the death of that honest pride with which I have hitherto considered my son; I should blush to see him, to hear of him, to think of him. I may perhaps do no good but that of relieving my own mind by this letter, but I felt it my duty to tell you that your partiality for Lady Susan is no secret to your friends, and to warn you against her. I should be glad to hear your reasons for disbelieving Mr. Smith's intelligence; you had no doubt of its authenticity a month ago. If you can give me your assurance of having no design beyond enjoying the conversation of a clever woman for a short period, and of yielding admiration only to her beauty and abilities, without being blinded by them to her faults, you will restore me to happiness; but, if you cannot do this, explain to me, at least, what has occasioned so great an alteration in your opinion of her.|$|E
