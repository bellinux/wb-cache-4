25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
2500|$|However some {{editors and}} journalists believe, Hungarian comics have the {{potential}} of recruiting more comics fans and reaching a cult status in Hungary. Editor, Antal Bayer speculates in a forum comment: [...] "At the same time, I'm convinced that a really 'up-to-date' Hungarian comic could reach the cult status, then maintain massive popularity. We've seen how Napirajz moved the people, but <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> more than that for breakthrough. I can hardly wait for the Hungarian comic book which will be received with as much enthusiasm as the latest Rejtő/Korcsmáros reissue." ...|$|E

5000|$|John Paul Young {{said of the}} recording, [...] "We {{actually}} did 'Love Is in the Air' because <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> for the German market. 'Standing in the Rain' became a hit in the clubs over there {{and then on the}} charts, so <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> a follow-up. I'd been to Germany and heard the music. It was electronic mania, all clicks and electronic buzzes. So George and Harry gave it the treatment." ...|$|R

[...] "The nerve-force {{in the brain}} may flow just as {{naturally}} down one nerve as down another. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> more than a fixed Law of Nature to settle which nerve shall carry it. That 'something' is Free-Will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And it {{is exactly}} that point of wickedness I have arrived at," [...] the doctor said, again {{dropping}} into the brogue. [...] "In the first place, sha'n't <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>something,</b> to kape us from dying entirely of nothing to do at all, at all, in this wearisome old place? We are fresh to it, {{and we are not}} tired, yet, of the oranges and the wine and the cigars, and the quare people you see in the streets; but the regiments that have been here some time are just sick of their lives. Then, in the second place, how am I going to learn my profession, {{if we are going to}} stop here, quiet and peaceful, for years? Didn't I come into the army to study gunshot wounds and, barring duels, divil a wound have I seen since I joined. It's getting rusty I am, entirely; and there is the elegant case of instruments my aunt gave me, that have never been opened. By the same token, I will have them out and oil them, in the morning." ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{too much}} facile misrepresentation, too ready a {{disposition}} on either side to accept caricatures as portraits and charges as facts. However tacit our understandings were in the past, with this new kind of Labour, this young, restive Labour of the twentieth century, which can read, discuss and combine, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> {{in the nature of}} a social contract. And it is when one comes to consider by what possible means these suspicious third-class passengers in our leaking and imperilled social liner can be brought into generous co-operation with the second and the first that one discovers just how lamentably out of date and out of order our political institutions, which should supply the means for just this inter-class discussion, have become. Between the busy and preoccupied owning and employing class on the one hand, and the distressed, uneasy masses on the other, intervenes the professional politician, not as a mediator, but as an obstacle, who must be propitiated before any dealings are possible. Our national politics no longer express the realities of the national life; they are a mere impediment in the speech of the community. With our whole social order in danger, our Legislature is busy over the trivial little affairs of the Welsh Established Church, whose endowment probably is not equal to the fortune of any one of half a dozen Titanic passengers or a tithe of the probable loss of another strike among the miners. We have a Legislature almost antiquarian, compiling a museum of Gladstonian legacies rather than governing our world to-day.|$|E

But it took Sully weeks {{to come up with the}} lyrics, and he wasn’t even happy with it ‘cause we had to rush it, ‘cause <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> for this Motley Crue tour. The 3 of us loved it, but Sully was kind of irritated with it ‘cause he knows it could have been better".|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{qualifying}} session, Gordon stated, [...] "That's {{quite an}} accomplishment. I'm just {{so proud of}} this DuPont Chevy team. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> to boost our morale and something positive because we've had a rough year so far. This is a surprise. We {{did not expect to}} be sitting here now talking to you about a pole, and I think it's ironice that we've got the DuPont paint scheme, which is celebrating 20 years and then we win a pole for the 20th straight year." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....For 'Night Fever' {{the group}} had the hook-line and rhythm - they usually pat their legs {{to set up a}} song's rhythm when they first sing it - and parts of the verses. They had the emotion, same as on the record. We put down drums and {{acoustic}} guitar first, so the feel was locked in. The pianopart was put on before the bass, then the heavy guitar parts. We had the sound, but <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> there to shake it so we used the thunder sound. Albhy Galuten ...|$|R

5000|$|Hank {{has spoken}} about human dreams of success. On the topic, Hank has stated, [...] "There are {{problems}} with the institutions of dreams, but I am in favor of them. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> to push us to work 16-hour days sometimes. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> to drive us to be better, and weirder, and different, but I think if we let that one thing drive us, it's a failure of imagination, and we miss opportunities." [...] Hank would add, [...] "In the end, it's not about finding success, it's about building the number of things you're capable of, because then you could do more interesting things, and we need people to do interesting things in the world." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{told the}} actors that I felt {{something}} was lacking and that <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> more explicit, a novelty. I opened {{a kind of}} contest and each one gave different options. Jorge Sanz {{came out with the}} idea of the handkerchief. The production was successful team collaboration. From the beginning at the preparation of the film, there was a spirit of team collaboration, something very positive that made our work fun. I don’t know why, but we all knew we were making a film {{that was going to be}} important.|$|R
500|$|When {{asked about}} Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, [...] "I think {{at some point}} along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people {{something}} to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren’t always easy, but I think we found a way." ...|$|R

Peter Baumgartner, chief commercial officer for Etihad Airways, said he was [...] "looking forward to witnessing how the Etihad brand name reached across {{the world through the}} music of Strings." [...] Vocalist Faisal Kapadia said, [...] "It is not only about free air tickets. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> like this to promote the true image of Pakistan. We want to do concerts internationally, but it is very expensive. This deal will help to overcome that".|$|R
50|$|The poem is {{essentially}} an analysis of hope. Dylan sets the scene by describing the stressors of everyday life and the myriad of challenging choices we have to make. These stimuli can, essential, cause us to feel alone, lost and without hope. Dylan then explains the function of hope and how <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> to give our lives meaning. He then finishes the poem by suggesting that Woody Guthrie {{is as much a}} source of hope and beauty in the world as God, or religion.|$|E
50|$|Thompson {{finds his}} role as a {{cultural}} historian to be a potential vehicle for transcendence:Anything can deliver us from our lost memory of the soul; science, history, art, or the sunlight on the grass taitami mats in the Zendo. And anything can enslave us: science, history, art, or the militarism of a Zen monastery. But if we are lost in time and suffering racial amnesia, then <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> to startle us into recollection. If history is the sentence of our imprisonment, then history, recoded, can become the password of our release.|$|E

It's like this: We felt as if we'd gone the very limit, and nothing ever would come right again. But it's just like when we were a young married couple and {{scrapped}} and were so darn certain we'd have to leave each other. That's the way it's been with us lately, and <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> big like this to get our nerve up, I guess.

50|$|In 2005, Veitch made a {{short-lived}} return to sketch comedy in Let Loose Live. Prior to the show's debut, Veitch {{had said in}} an interview with the Melbourne Age... I think that there is a hunger for comedy. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> to hold the mirror up and look at the familiar in a different way. So much of the world is presented to us as a kind of impervious block of information, and what satire does is say well, actually, no, you don't have to look at everything the way that society wants you to look at it.|$|E

You {{have to do something}} that’s gonna balance it."

5000|$|... "When {{you have}} {{something}} essential like energy that you can't ration just on price - you have to ration it in a more equitable way. So I would suggest for the high reduction rates that we now need, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> based on equity and whether it's personal carbon trading or whatever, {{we have to make}} sure the poorer parts of our communities have access to energy regardless of price. So that means for the rest of us, who consume lots of energy we are going to have to make significant reductions to our levels of emissions - there is no way round this." ...|$|E
50|$|What <b>we</b> <b>need</b> is <b>something</b> {{that looks}} highly respectable outwardly. The American Mercury is almost perfect for that purpose. What {{will go on}} inside the tent is another story. You will recall that the late P. T. Barnum got away with burlesque shows by calling them moral lectures.|$|R
5000|$|Dehn {{grew up in}} Russia and {{was trained}} as a ballet and modern dancer {{in the style of}} Isadora Duncan. She was exposed to jazz as a child but didn't think much of it until, at the age of 20, she saw Josephine Baker perform in Paris. She was thrilled with the {{vitality}} of the style: [...] "Before, European couple dancing was very formal—too pleasing and too relaxed. But life was not like that. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> to energize us, to give us abandon. The Charleston gave us the spice of rhythm and syncopation." [...] She began to incorporate it in her work and even put on a jazz concert in Vienna in 1925. In 1930, seeking the homeland of jazz, Dehn immigrated to the United States.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the game}} was not {{considered}} to be substantive enough simply with the real-time battles; Simpson recalls that [...] "the problem was that the battles themselves were very short, and <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> to tie it together and make people care about the battles". The result was the introduction of the campaign map, intended to provide the player with a broader strategic perspective and context for the battles. A feudal Japanese setting was chosen; in addition to being thought of as [...] "cool", the Sengoku period was selected as it allowed for several different factions who could have potentially won the conflict, and due to the introduction of gunpowder to Japan, also allowed for rapid change for the game's technology tree.|$|R
5000|$|Graham welcomed Georgina's return {{following}} her previous arc that began during the episode, Southern Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. [...] "Of course, {{to balance the}} cute <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>something</b> evil and no character manages that better than good old Georgina Sparks. Her mere moments in the episode rank as my other high point as {{not only do we}} discover that the Poppy Lifton issue has been resolved. (The only problem with this scene: HOW did she resolve the issue?) but also that she will be back!"With the return of Georgina in the finale, Graham expressed high hopes for her character for the next season, stating [...] "Perhaps this will be the spark (no pun intended) required to shake Blair’s cobwebs off and get her back to her queen bee fighting weight." ...|$|E
5000|$|You {{know how}} the Grammys used to be, all straight-looking folks with suits. Everybody looking tired. No surprises.

Tupac Shakur With that statement on February 28, 1996, Tupac Shakur introduced the original Kiss lineup, in full makeup and Love Gun-era stage outfits, to a rousing ovation at the 38th annual Grammy Awards.
