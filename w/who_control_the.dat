5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) speaks of a group of seven Mothers <b>who</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata is rooted in the group of seven females depicted on Indus valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E

The Elementals consist of Rok-Ko, a temperamental and rock-headed earthbending mask who controls earthquakes and landslides, Wa-Wa, a waterbending mask who controls thunderstorms and floods, Py-Ro, an easily perturbed firebending mask who controls volcano eruptions, and Lo-Lo, a joke-cracking airbending mask who controls tornadoes.|$|E

Meanwhile, Roxas, Sora's Nobody, is trapped in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town, created by DiZ to merge Roxas with his original self to restore Sora's power. DiZ's plans are threatened when Nobodies led by Axel, Roxas's former friend in Organization XIII, infiltrate the virtual town. However, Roxas is able to repel the Nobodies and finally merges with Sora. Sora, Donald, and Goofy wake up in the real Twilight Town and meet King Mickey and Yen Sid, who send them on another journey. Their goal is to find Riku and figure out the plans of Organization XIII, <b>who</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> Nobodies—the empty shell left over when a person with a strong heart is turned into a Heartless. Afterward, Maleficent is resurrected and joins with Pete to continue her quest for power.|$|E

500|$|In Occupy, Chomsky explores {{both the}} context to the Occupy movement, and {{highlights}} its primary aims. He {{describes it as}} a reaction {{by members of the}} working and middle classes to the [...] "class war" [...] that has been waged against them by the upper class <b>who</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> commercial sector since the 1970s. During those 30 years, Chomsky argues, the nation's wealth has become increasingly concentrated among a tiny percentage of the population, primarily those in control of the financial sector. Chomsky argues that this process has been furthered by government policies implemented by both the Republican and Democrat administrations, with both parties being financed by that same financial and commercial sector. According to Chomsky, while the wealth has been increasingly focused in the socio-economic elite <b>who</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> financial sector, {{the rest of the population}} have suffered higher workloads, unsustainable debt, a weakening benefits system and stagnating incomes and real wages, causing them to be [...] "angry, frustrated, [...] bitter". It is this inequality [...] Chomsky argues [...] that has led to the Occupy movement.|$|E

500|$|Chomsky's main {{argument}} in Hegemony or Survival {{is that the}} socio-economic elite <b>who</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> United States have pursued an [...] "Imperial Grand Strategy" [...] {{since the end of}} World War II in order to maintain global hegemony through military, political and economic means. He argues that in doing so they have repeatedly shown a total disregard for democracy and human rights, {{in stark contrast to the}} US government's professed support for those values. Furthermore, he argues that this continual pursuit of global hegemony now threatens the existence of the human species itself because of the increasing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.|$|E

However, after the end of World War II, they began to fight amongst themselves, and the organization broke down.

500|$|In the future, {{society is}} divided between 'low-drives' that equate with the labouring classes and 'hi-drives' <b>who</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} and media. The low-drives {{are controlled by}} a constant broadcast of pornography that the hi-drives are convinced will pacify them, though one hi-drive, Nat Mender (Tony Vogel), believes that the media {{should be used to}} educate the low-drives. After the accidental death of a protester during the Sex Olympics gets a massive audience response, the co-ordinator Ugo Priest (Leonard Rossiter) decides to commission a new programme. In The Live Life Show, Nat Mender, his partner Deanie (Suzanne Neve) and their daughter Keten (Lesley Roach) are stranded on a remote Scottish island while the low-drive audience watches. Mender's former colleague, Lasar Opie (Brian Cox), feeling that [...] "something got to happen", decides to spice up the show by introducing a dangerous element to the island, and The Live Life Show is deemed a triumph.|$|E
500|$|Scribner's {{published}} the novel on 22October 1926. [...] Its first edition consisted of 5090 copies, selling at $2.00 per copy. Cleonike Damianakes illustrated the dust jacket with a Hellenistic {{design of a}} seated, robed woman, her head bent to her shoulder, eyes closed, one hand holding an apple, her shoulders and a thigh exposed. Editor Maxwell Perkins intended [...] "Cleon's respectably sexy" [...] design to attract [...] "the feminine readers <b>who</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> destinies of so many novels". Two months later the book was in a second printing with 7000 copies sold.

500|$|In July, Clark held {{another set}} of congressional {{hearings}} on the issue, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators John Stennis and James Eastland (both staunch segregationists), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described [...] "an unwritten policy {{on the part of}} those <b>who</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death." [...] When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, [...] "We seem to be able to send airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi." [...] Kennedy openly expressed his frustration with Johnson administration officials' perceived inability to understand the extent of the Delta's problems and other bureaucratic complications, saying, [...] "It seems to me we are floundering around a great deal." ...|$|E
