5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on September 6, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was ordered back to Pusan {{in order to}} travel to Japan and merge with other Marine units to form the 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated {{disagreement}} between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. <b>Walker</b> <b>said</b> he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur {{said he could not}} conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the 17th Infantry Regiment, and later the 65th Infantry Regiment, would be added to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter {{at a time when it}} was unclear if it would hold.|$|E
5|$|Walker had protested in vain against {{releasing}} the brigade, believing {{he needed it}} and all the troops then in Korea {{if he were to}} stop the North Korean offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. The order prompted a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. <b>Walker</b> <b>said</b> he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning two newly arrived units of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 17th Infantry Regiment and the 65th Infantry Regiment to Walker's reserves. Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective, and believed the transition endangered the Pusan Perimeter {{at a time when it}} was unclear if it could hold back the North Koreans. The brigade moved to Japan and merged with the 1st Marine Division. It was deactivated as an independent unit for the last time on 13 September 1950.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, Walker spoke by {{telephone}} with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command, in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter {{and said the}} most serious threat was along {{the boundary between the}} U.S. 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. <b>Walker</b> <b>said</b> he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the U.S. 2nd Division and ordered a coordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished.|$|E

5|$|At 09:35 September 2, {{while the}} North Koreans were {{attempting}} to destroy the engineer troops at {{the southern edge of}} Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang, Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry Divisions. He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. <b>Walker</b> <b>said</b> he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them.

500|$|The game's visuals {{were also}} commended, with Tyrrel calling the game's world {{gorgeous}} and vivid, {{as well as}} calling its procedurally generated animation a [...] "fantastic example of how movement can speak volumes more than words".

500|$|In August 2010, Walker {{signed for}} Watford on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract, with Watford having the option {{on a third}} year.

Robbie Daw of Idolator called the [...] "not so subtle" [...] and [...] "randy" [...] song {{one of the}} album's [...] "standouts", and recommended it {{for use as a}} single. MTV's John <b>Walker</b> <b>said</b> of the song, [...] "There's something so goofily erotic about telling someone 'you were in my sex dreams.' It's such a cumbersome phrase, yet Gaga somehow makes {{it one of the most}} erotic lines you'll heard [...] all year. The half-giggled 'I really shouldn't be telling you this' line at the song's climax— no pun intended— really seals the deal." [...] Walker humorously rated the song 5 out of 5 [...] "vaguely vaginal Georgia O'Keeffe orchids".|$|E
500|$|The {{score is}} mostly low-key, with the {{exception}} of the suspense and death scenes. It was performed by a union orchestra, obliging New Line Cinema to grant the film its own score. Walker described her score as [...] "very theme-driven, conservative music that covers the range from bizarre animal noises with stronger visceral impact to stirring emotional music with well-defined melodies that evolve through the storytelling". The [...] "Main Title" [...] piece, used for the opening credits, was rare for opening a film aimed at a youth audience at the time. [...] "What a treat for me to get to write a piece that calls you into the movie and lets you know something bad is going to happen from the get go", <b>Walker</b> <b>said.</b> According to Walker, [...] "Main Title" [...] consumed most of her time, due to its [...] "dark theme and counter melody which carries throughout the score".|$|E

If Walker is killed by the patrol, he dies in a pool of blood, recalling a conversation between himself and Konrad during the War in Afghanistan where Walker casually remarked about returning home, but Konrad criticized him, claiming soldiers [...] "do what's necessary" [...] and then die. If Walker kills the entire patrol, he uses their radio to greet Army command with [...] "Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai", one of the first statements <b>Walker</b> <b>said</b> to his team as well {{as one of the first}} statements 'Konrad' said to Walker.

500|$|On 27 November 2014, Newsquest {{announced}} plans for the Friday edition, published the following day, to be expanded to 40 pages to accommodate {{news coverage of the}} Smith Commission's report into increased devolution for Scotland, which was published on 27 November, and due to a large demand for space from advertisers. The 28 November edition also included an editorial thanking readers for backing the new publication. Speaking to The Guardian shortly after its launch, <b>Walker</b> <b>said</b> that the initial print run had been set as 30,000, but a last-minute decision was taken to double it, something he described as [...] "in hindsight, a good decision". The Nationals launch and success came at a time of general decline in the print media industry, where news providers were cutting staff and resources due to a downturn in newspaper sales. Douglas Beattie of the New Statesman and Alex Massie of The Spectator reported that copies of the first edition, which sold out, were being auctioned on eBay for at least £10. The Financial Times reported that pro-independence campaigners used social media to help potential readers locate available copies of the paper when the first edition had sold out in many areas.|$|E
500|$|A. O. Scott {{wrote that}} Will Smith gave a [...] "graceful and {{effortless}} performance" [...] and also noted the [...] "third-act collapse". He {{felt that the}} movie [...] "does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization". Dana Stevens of Slate wrote that the movie lost its way around the hour mark, noting that [...] "the Infected just aren't that scary." [...] NPR critic Bob Mondello noted the film's subtext concerning global terrorism and that this aspect made the film fit in perfectly with other, more direct cinematic explorations of the subject. Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper, commending Will Smith as being in [...] "prime form", also saying there are [...] "some amazing sequences" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "a pretty heavy screenplay for an action film." [...] The film has been criticized for diverging from Matheson's novel, especially in its portrayal of a specifically Christian theme. Much of the negative criticism concerned the film's third act, with some critics favoring the alternative ending in the DVD release. Doug <b>Walker</b> <b>said</b> the alternate ending was [...] "thought provoking", and the theatrical ending was [...] "a betrayal" [...] and [...] "castration".|$|E
500|$|Scott {{noted that}} {{it was easier to}} reach correct puzzle solutions, with clues being given out [...] "at a very {{reasonable}} rate". He saw this as the game's largest improvement upon previous Ace Attorney titles, which he said relied on trial and error; he had considered this the weakest point in the series, and something that needed to be changed. On the other hand, <b>Walker</b> <b>said</b> that the player often can figure out what a contradiction is going to be before the game lets them prove it, and the player might come up with legitimate ideas that the game does not accept. He also wished that the life bar could be filled up in court. Cole criticized how relevant evidence sometimes is not accepted, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a certain order, but appreciated the game's larger focus on courtroom sessions over investigations. Thomas and the reviewers at Famitsu criticized the lack of new gameplay features, although the former thought that fans of the series would be fine with it. Scott acknowledged that the gameplay only is what is expected from the series, but did not find a problem with it due to the focus on narrative over gameplay. Moriarty said that while Trials and Tribulations is a good game in its own right, he wished that Capcom would make some changes to the gameplay or presentation, to avoid the series becoming [...] "overdone, played-out, and tired".|$|E
