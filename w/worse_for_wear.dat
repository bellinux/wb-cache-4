25|$|England had a {{good time}} between the Fourth and Fifth Tests. Mike Denness {{returned}} to form with 157 not in their innings victory over Tasmania and 99 in a 187 run win over New South Wales. Dennis Amiss made 52 and 124 in the Sydney game and Chris Old took 7/59. Denness therefore returned to the team as England captain, replacing the injured vice-captain John Edrich who was still recovering from his damaged ribs, which had in fact been broken, not just bruised as previously thought. Australia dropped the batsman Ross Edwards in favour of the local leg-spinner Terry Jenner. There was a storm the night before the first day, which ripped the covers off the field and flooded the ground. The nightwatchman had not called the curator, so the damage could not be repaired in time for the first day's play, which had to be abandoned. The ex-Australian umpire Col Egar thought that play might not even start on the second day. What made it more distressing was that a record crowd appeared despite the series having already been won, but had to be turned away. Jim Laker and Ken Barrington were part of the crowd, escorting travel groups of British cricket fans. As it was there was a steady wind which helped dry out the ground overnight, except at the River Torrens end, but the famously long boundary was pulled in with ropes marking a now egg shaped Adelaide Oval. Denness called heads {{and for the first time}} England won the toss. With the pitch still <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> he chose to field, the third time the winning captain had taken this unusual course in the series.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{sense of}} self-seriousness and the camaraderie amongst the {{characters}} were generally cited as positive aspects. Maslin wrote that certain tacky {{elements of the}} film's television roots were outweighed by {{the closeness of the}} Enterprise crew and [...] "by their seriousness and avidity about what seem to be the silliest minutiae [...] That's what longtime Trekkies love about the series, and it's still here—a little the <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear,</b> but mostly untarnished." [...] The Los Angeles Times wrote that despite its spectacle, the film's [...] "humanity once again outweighs the hardware, and its innocence is downright endearing". Mackay offered an alternate view, calling the characters' actions and dialogue [...] "wooden" [...] and saying that the film's monsters had more life than the acting. Lloyd's portrayal of Kruge received praise from New Yorks David Denby and The Daily Newss Hunter Reigler.|$|E

50|$|No <b>Worse</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Wear</b> is a 1994 album, {{the third}} and last by Orange County pop punk band Big Drill Car. It is the only album without their classic {{original}} line-up, featuring new members Keith Fallis and Darrin Norris. The band reached a little success through the album, {{if only for a}} short time before their 13-year break-up, from 1995 to 2008. The release of No <b>Worse</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Wear</b> would also gain Big Drill Car supporting slots on national and world tours with bands such as The Offspring (who had just released Smash to unexpected success and acclaim) and Guttermouth.|$|R

2500|$|An entirely {{different}} type of person was Virendranath Chattopadhyay, member of a famous family in India. Popularly known as Chatto {{he was a very}} able and a very delightful person. He was always hard up, his clothes were very much the <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> and often he found it difficult to raise the wherewithal for a meal. But his humour and light heartedness never left him. He had been some years senior to me during my educational days in England. He was at Oxford when I was at Harrow. Since those days he had not returned to India and sometimes a fit of homesickness came to him when he longed to be back. All his home-ties had long been severed and it is quite certain that if he came to India he would feel unhappy and out of joint. But in spite of the passage of time the home pull remains. No exile can escape the malady of his tribe, that consumption of the soul, as Mazzini called it ... Of the few I met, the only persons who impressed me intellectually were Virendranath Chattopadhyay and M.N. Roy. Chatto was not, I believe, a regular communist, but he was communistically inclined.|$|E

5000|$|The {{final element}} was the [...] (or [...] ) shot, {{which came from}} carom or carambole billiards, a three-ball game popular in various {{countries}} of western Continental Europe, especially popularized by France (and today also popular {{in many parts of}} Asia and South America). In the 1700s, the carambole game added a red [...] to the two white cue balls, and dispensed with the pockets. This ball was adopted into the English game, which retained the pockets, and the goal was to cannon off both the red and the opponent's ball on a single shot, earning 2 points. This influence on the English game appears to have come about through the popularity of French tables in English coffee houses; London alone had over two thousand such establishments in the early 18th century. One period advertisement read: [...] "A very good French Billiard Table, little the <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wearing,</b> full size, with all the materials fit for French or English play".|$|R

6000|$|Queen of wit and beauty, Betty, Never may the Muse forget ye, How thy face charms every shepherd, Spotted {{over like}} a leopard! And thy {{freckled}} neck, display'd, Envy breeds in every maid; Like a fly-blown cake of tallow, Or on parchment ink turn'd yellow; Or a tawny speckled pippin, Shrivell'd with a winter's keeping. [...] And, thy beauty thus dispatch'd, Let me praise thy wit unmatch'd. [...] Sets of phrases, cut and dry, Evermore thy tongue supply; And thy memory is loaded With old scraps from plays exploded; Stock'd with repartees and jokes, Suited to all Christian folks: Shreds of wit, and senseless rhymes, Blunder'd out a thousand times; Nor wilt thou of gifts be sparing, Which can ne'er be <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> <b>wearing.</b> Picking wit among collegians, In the playhouse upper regions; Where, in the eighteen-penny gallery, Irish nymphs learn Irish raillery. But thy merit is thy failing, And thy raillery is railing. [...] Thus with talents well endued To be scurrilous and rude; When you pertly raise your snout, Fleer and gibe, and laugh and flout; This among Hibernian asses For sheer wit and humour passes. Thus indulgent Chloe, bit, Swears {{you have a}} world of wit.|$|R

In {{a fight that}} many consider {{to be one of}} Pride's most exciting matches, Frye and Takayama clinched in a hockey fight pose, each holding the head and hitting, with Takayama finally going to the body after more than a full minute of unrelenting, undefended shots. This would happen three times in the fight, until the referee stopped the bout after Frye mounted Takayama, who was visibly much <b>worse</b> <b>for</b> the <b>wear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{the release}} of their third album, Batch, Big Drill Car parted ways with the now-"classic" [...] {{original}} line-up. Bob had {{announced that he was}} leaving the band to play in another band who {{was on the verge of}} a major label deal. The show was at the PALACE in Los Angeles. It was the biggest of the [...] "VIVA CRUZ" [...] shows (annual shows, show casing the Cruz bands ALL, Big Drill Car and Chemical People). Bob was more active and animated on stage that night than ever before. Bob was replaced by Darren Morris. Darren fit in perfectly - he was a big fan, a super nice guy and he knew all the songs already. Not long after Darren joined the band, Danny left. Danny was replaced by a few drummers including Jamie Reidling (Cadillac Tramps/US Bombs) and Keith Fallis (former drummer for Carnival Art). They went on to release 2 more records with Keith in the band Cargo Records, Toured (A Live Album) which was an earlier recording with the original lineup and No <b>Worse</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Wear,</b> which Keith plays on. While No <b>Worse</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Wear</b> still never broke the band into mainstream audiences, {{the release of}} the album would gain Big Drill Car a little success and supporting slots on national and world tours with bands such as The Offspring (who had just released Smash to unexpected success and acclaim) and Guttermouth. After this, Big Drill Car broke up in 1995.|$|R
