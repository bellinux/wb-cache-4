25|$|In 2000, a {{young man}} accosted Romalis in the medical {{building}} where he works and stabbed him. The doctor was not seriously injured. The criminal was not identified. Several witnesses had seen the attacker <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time before Romalis arrived and even used a restroom in a pharmacy that opens onto the lobby. They described him as a white man in his 20s or 30s wearing a dark grey or black sweatsuit with a hood. When Romalis arrived, the attacker stabbed {{him in the back}} of the lower left ribcage. The man escaped through the parking lot of the building. A parking valet, Jesse Brouwer, chased the attacker for more than a block without success. News reports stated that about an hour before the stabbing, police were called to another clinic, Everywoman's Health Centre because of aggressive anti-abortion protesters on the lawn of the house next door. Three white men, two of whom had not been there before, were trying to intimidate women entering the clinic. The staff became so concerned about the level of intimidation that they called police. After police talked to them, the three men left about noon. Romalis was stabbed just before 1 p.m.|$|E
25|$|Gai Lan and Dai Yuan {{were still}} {{dissatisfied}} and they harboured {{the intention of}} rebelling. They forged close ties with Bian Hong (邊鴻, also rendered 邊洪), an aide of Sun Yi. Once, when Sun Quan was away on a campaign, they {{took advantage of the}} situation to set their plans into motion. At the time, the various chiefs of the counties in Danyang were scheduled to meet Sun Yi in the commandery capital. Before the meeting, Sun Yi asked his wife, Lady Xu (徐氏), who was versed in divination, to predict the events of the meeting. Lady Xu predicted ill luck and advised her husband to postpone the meeting, but Sun Yi wanted to settle the meeting quickly because the Chiefs had been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time since they arrived, so he hosted a banquet for them. Sun Yi often carried a sword with him when he travelled around, but he became tipsy after the feast so he was unarmed when he saw the guests off. Just then, Bian Hong attacked him from behind. The scene was thrown into disarray and no one came to Sun Yi's rescue so Sun died at the hands of Bian Hong. Bian Hong escaped to the hills after murdering Sun Yi, but was later killed by Gai Lan and Dai Yuan.|$|E
500|$|Selman commented in {{an audio}} {{commentary}} for [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] that [...] "the {{thing that really}} got the [...] writers excited about the episode was this very specific version of future Bart." [...] Greaney identified this version as [...] "the guy who blames everyone else and tells everyone else {{that they used to}} be cool, that it's everyone else's fault that his life hasn't gone the way he wants it to go." [...] The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully also noted that future Bart is {{the kind of person who}} is [...] "always <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> big sort of cash payoff that he feels he's owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that's gonna come sooner or later." [...] Greaney said that everyone in the writing room recognized these traits from people they knew and therefore everyone contributed to the episode by suggesting lines for Bart to say and things for him to do.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Stewart {{thought that}} the first Next Generation film, Star Trek Generations, was too much like a {{television}} episode but thought that his character, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, was redefined as a [...] "movie hero" [...] in [...] He was concerned that in the new film, the character would return to that seen in the television series. Michael Piller said that he felt {{that in order to}} be a hero, Picard [...] "should be acting out of a moral and ethical mindset, and stand for principles that are important to mankind". Stewart was later pleased with the film's romantic sub-plot, calling it [...] "charming" [...] and saying that he was [...] "feeling very good about it." [...] He {{thought that the}} film had a lighter tone than previous films, saying, [...] "It shows our crew having a little more fun than we normally see them doing". Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij kiss was cut from {{the final version of the}} film, saying that [...] "It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable to me as I feel the audience were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> kind of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant." [...] Stewart received a producer's credit on the film.|$|E
500|$|After {{his death}} Sibelius, though {{remaining}} {{popular with the}} general public, was frequently denigrated by critics who found his music dated and tedious. René Leibowitz, a proponent of the music of Arnold Schoenberg, published a pamphlet describing Sibelius as [...] "the worst composer in the world"; others dismissed him as irrelevant in what was perceived for a time as an irresistible movement towards atonality. This climate diminished curiosity {{about the existence of}} material from a possible Sibelius Eighth, until late in the 20th century, when critical interest in the composer revived. In 1995 Kilpeläinen, who had published a survey of the Sibelius manuscripts held in the Helsinki University Library, wrote that all that could definitely be connected to the Eighth Symphony were a single page from a draft score and the ringed melody fragment marked [...] "VIII" [...] within the Seventh Symphony sketches. He added, however, that the library contained further Sibelius sketches from the late 1920s and early 1930s, some of which are akin to the ringed fragment and which could conceivably have been intended for the Eighth Symphony. Kilpeläinen also revealed that [...] "ust recently various documents have come to light which no one dreamt even existed. Maybe there are still some clues to the 8th Symphony hidden away and just <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> scholar to discover them." ...|$|E
500|$|Ahsan Haque of IGN rated [...] "Stewie Kills Lois" [...] a 9/10, while rating [...] "Lois Kills Stewie" [...] a 9.4/10, saying [...] "For the {{hundredth}} episode of Family Guy, Seth McFarlane and friends tackle {{the subject of}} one of Stewie Griffin's greatest ambitions— his not-so-secret desire to kill his mother. For the disturbed fans <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> form of a matricidal manifestation, you can feel comfort knowing, without spoiling too much, that the youngest Griffin absolutely means business and ensures that he doesn't fail this time around. [...] There are some tense courtroom moments, a birthday celebration with the gift of Lionel Richie, a cruise ship, machine guns, and the reappearance of the Kool Aid Man that help round out this carefully crafted and well-told cohesive storyline. With the amount of cheap manatee jokes kept to a reasonable level, this episode also manages to find an excellent balance between comedy and storytelling. It's a fantastic way to celebrate the Family Guy one-hundredth episode milestone. [...] With the writers' strike in full effect, it seems {{that this might be}} the last new episode of Family Guy we'll be seeing for a while. It's a bittersweet way to end the abruptly short season as the quality is reminiscent of the series' brilliance from the early years and it seems like the show was really starting to hit its stride for the season. Hopefully the series will be able {{to live up to the}} high bar set by this two-part classic upon its eventual return." ...|$|E

500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E
2500|$|Upon arrival Steć noticed however how {{the other}} UN {{soldiers}} called the mission as [...] "Mission Impossible" [...] due to the racism, the Hutu Power militia and the human rights abuses. [...] "It felt {{as though we were}} sitting on a barrel of gunpowder, waiting for a spark. (...) the genocide hanged in the air", and [...] "the international community was playing for time, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> final solution to the Rwandan problem". But no one could ever have imagined the scale of what was to come.|$|E
2500|$|However, Hal Hinson, in {{his review}} for The Washington Post, wrote, [...] "There are empty thrills, and some suspense. But {{throughout}} the film, we keep <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> trace of personality, some color in the dialogue, some hipness in the staging or in the characters' attitudes. And it's not there." [...] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "What is not present in Mission: Impossible (which, aside from the title, sound-track quotations from the theme song and self-destructing assignment tapes, {{has little to do}} with the old TV show) is a plot that logically links all these events or characters with any discernible motives beyond surviving the crisis of the moment." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "B" [...] rating and said, [...] "The problem isn't that the plot is too complicated; it's that each detail is given the exact same nagging emphasis. Intriguing yet mechanistic, jammed with action yet as talky and dense as a physics seminar, the studiously labyrinthine Mission: Impossible grabs your attention without quite tickling your imagination." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marc Hogan of Spin {{felt the}} mixed {{influences}} didn’t work in Swift’s favor: “A glossy soft rocker with a stomping four-on-the-floor beat, back-porch twang, adult-contemporary orchestration, and Top 40-ready electronic vocal effects, it covers a bizarre number of bases. And the key lyric compares her lost love, mourned here {{as an object}} of desire but not kissed off as one of the usual jerks, to ‘driving a new Maserati down a dead end street,’ like Swift is about to brawl with Rick Ross.” [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly, joked, saying: [...] "Those are the only colors the song — which Swift says is all about 'intense emotion' — brings up, which kind of let me down. (...) I’m being serious — I kept <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> other hue to pop up, and it never did.(... And then, said: [...] "Lyrically, (...) [...] lines (...) lack the crisp, powerful punch that Swift usually delivers. And in a song all about the vividness of feelings, they paint a rather blurry portrait. (...) Where is the drama, the sexiness, the freefall of passion? The poppy production white-washes over all that. That doesn’t mean this is a bad song, just maybe an underwhelming one." ...|$|E
