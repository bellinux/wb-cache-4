A <b>working</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, impacted Earth. In this scenario, the mass of Theia was approximately 10% of that of Earth, it impacted Earth with a glancing blow, and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon, and by inference, to that of Earth.|$|E

In the postmodern age, Iorga's pronouncements on the subject arguably contributed to the birth of Romanian imagological, post-colonial and cross-cultural studies.

25|$|Some {{have criticized}} REBT for being harsh, formulaic {{and failing to}} address deep {{underlying}} problems. REBT theorists have argued in reply that a careful study of REBT shows that it is both philosophically deep, humanistic and individualized collaboratively working {{on the basis of}} the client’s point of reference. They have further argued that REBT utilizes an integrated and interrelated methodology of cognitive, emotive-experiential and behavioral interventions. Others have questioned REBTs view of rationality, both radical constructivists who have claimed that reason and logic are subjective properties and those who believe that reason can be objectively determined. REBT theorists have argued in reply that REBT raises objections to clients' irrational choices and conclusions as a <b>working</b> <b>hypothesis</b> and through collaborative efforts demonstrate the irrationality on practical, functional and social consensual grounds. In 1998 when asked what the main criticism on REBT was, Albert Ellis replied that it was the claim that it was too rational and not dealing sufficiently enough with emotions. He repudiated the claim by saying that REBT on the contrary emphasizes that thinking, feeling, and behaving are interrelated and integrated, and that it includes a vast amount of both emotional and behavioural methods in addition to cognitive ones.|$|E

500|$|Data and {{observations}} began to accumulate that debunked Stormfury's <b>working</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Beginning with Hurricanes Anita and David, flights by Hurricane Hunter aircraft encountered events {{similar to what}} happened in [...] "successfully" [...] seeded storms.

500|$|Dana {{remained}} {{interested in}} {{the origin of the}} Hawaiian Islands, and directed a more in-depth study in 1880 and 1881. He confirmed that the islands' age increased with their distance from the southeastern-most island by observing differences in their degree of erosion. He also suggested that many other island chains in the Pacific showed a similar general increase in age from southeast to northwest. Dana concluded that the Hawaiian chain consisted of two volcanic strands, located along distinct but parallel curving pathways. He coined the terms [...] "Loa" [...] and [...] "Kea" [...] for the two prominent trends. The Kea trend includes the volcanoes of Kīlauea, Mauna Kea, Kohala, Haleakalā, and West Maui. The Loa trend includes Lōihi, Mauna Loa, Hualālai, Kahoolawe, Lānai, and West Molokai. Dana proposed that the alignment of the Hawaiian Islands reflected localized volcanic activity along a major fissure zone. Dana's [...] "great fissure" [...] theory served as the <b>working</b> <b>hypothesis</b> for subsequent studies until the mid-20th century.|$|E
500|$|Dr. R. Cecil Gentry {{became the}} {{director}} of Stormfury in 1968. [...] There were no more near-seedings until 1969. In the interim, equipment was improved. What once was the primitive method of hand-dumping dry ice was replaced with rocket canisters loaded with silver iodide, and then gun-like devices mounted {{on the wings of}} the airplanes that fired silver iodide into the clouds. Observation equipment was improved. Additional reconnaissance data was utilized to modify the <b>working</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> The new theory took cumulus towers outside the eyewall into account. According to the revised theory, by seeding the towers, latent heat would be released. This would trigger the start of new convection, which would then cause a new eyewall. Since the new eyewall was outside the original one, the first eyewall would be choked of energy and fall apart. In addition, since the new eyewall was broader than the old one, the winds would be lower due to a less sharp pressure difference.|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} part of the theorem of corresponding states in 1892 and 1895 [...] was the local time , where t is the time coordinate for an observer resting in the ether, and t is the time coordinate for an observer moving in the ether. (Woldemar Voigt had previously used the same expression for local time in 1887 in connection with the Doppler effect and an incompressible medium.) With the help of this concept Lorentz could explain the aberration of light, the Doppler effect and the Fizeau experiment (i.e. measurements of the Fresnel drag coefficient) by Hippolyte Fizeau in moving and also resting liquids. While for Lorentz length contraction was a real physical effect, he considered the time transformation only as a heuristic <b>working</b> <b>hypothesis</b> and a mathematical stipulation to simplify the calculation from the resting to a [...] "fictitious" [...] moving system.

These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded." [...] As noted by Steven Schafersman, methodological naturalism is [...] "the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within scientific method with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success (although science does have metaphysical implications), but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or <b>working</b> <b>hypothesis</b> for science to succeed.

2500|$|Between 1892 and 1904, Hendrik Lorentz {{created an}} electron/aether theory, {{in which he}} {{introduced}} a strict separation between matter (electrons) and aether. In his model the aether is completely motionless, and it won't be set in motion {{in the neighborhood of}} ponderable matter. Contrary to other electron models before, the electromagnetic field of the aether appears as a mediator between the electrons, and changes in this field cannot propagate faster than the speed of light. A fundamental concept of Lorentz's theory in 1895 was the [...] "theorem of corresponding states" [...] for terms of order v/c. This theorem states that a moving observer (relative to the aether) makes the same observations as a resting observers, after a suitable change of variables. Lorentz noticed that it was necessary to change the space-time variables when changing frames and introduced concepts like physical length contraction (1892) to explain the Michelson–Morley experiment, and the mathematical concept of local time (1895) to explain the aberration of light and the Fizeau experiment. That resulted in the formulation of the so-called Lorentz transformation by Joseph Larmor (1897, 1900) and Lorentz (1899, 1904), whereby it was noted by Larmor that the complete formulation of local time is accompanied by some sort of time dilation of moving electrons in the aether. As Lorentz later noted (1921, 1928), he considered the time indicated by clocks resting in the aether as [...] "true" [...] time, while local time was seen by him as a heuristic <b>working</b> <b>hypothesis</b> and a mathematical artifice. Therefore, Lorentz's theorem is seen by modern authors as being a mathematical transformation from a [...] "real" [...] system resting in the aether into a [...] "fictitious" [...] system in motion.|$|E
