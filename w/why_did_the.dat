During {{this time}} I was {{obviously}} {{at the point}} where I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E
25|$|One {{positive}} outcome {{has been the}} end of jurisdictional warfare between the UFW and Teamsters. The UFW signed an agreement with the Teamsters in March 1977 in which the UFW agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by CALRA, while the Teamsters agreed to organize all other agricultural workers. The agreement also led the UFW to end its boycott of lettuce, grapes, and wine in February 1978. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> two unions sign the agreement? UFW officials claimed the Teamsters {{were on the verge of}} losing a jurisdictional battle for 50,000 workers being decided by the ALRB, but at least one press report indicated that the scandal-scarred union wished to burnish its public image.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the invasion, {{it is clear that the}} Persians held most advantages. Regardless of its actual size, it is clear that the Persians had brought an overwhelming number of troops and ships to Greece. The Persians had a unified command system, and everyone was answerable to the king. They had a hugely efficient bureaucracy, which allowed them to undertake remarkable feats of planning. The Persian generals had significant experience of warfare over the 80 years in which the Persian empire had been established. Furthermore, the Persians excelled in the use of intelligence and diplomacy in warfare, as shown by their (nearly successful) attempts to divide-and-conquer the Greeks. The Greeks, by comparison, were fragmented, with only 30 or so city-states actively opposing the Persian invasion; even those were prone to quarrel with each other. They had little experience of large-scale warfare, being largely restricted to small-scale local warfare, and their commanders were chosen primarily on the basis of the political and social standing, rather than because of any experience or expertise. As Lazenby therefore asks: [...] "So <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Persians fail?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Goldhagen's first notable {{work was}} a book review titled [...] "False Witness" [...] {{published}} by The New Republic magazine on April 17, 1989. It was {{one in a series}} of hostile reviews of the 1988 book <b>Why</b> <b>Did</b> <b>the</b> Heavens Not Darken? by an American-Jewish professor of Princeton University born in Luxembourg, Arno J. Mayer. Goldhagen wrote that “Mayer’s enormous intellectual error” was in ascribing the cause of the Holocaust to anti-Communism, rather than to anti-Semitism, and criticized Prof. Mayer's saying that most massacres of Jews in the USSR, during the first weeks of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941 were committed by local peoples (see the Lviv pogroms for more historical background), with little Wehrmacht participation. Goldhagen accused him also of misrepresenting the facts about the Wannsee Conference (1942), which was meant for plotting the genocide of European Jews, not (as Mayer said) merely the resettlement of the Jews. Goldhagen further accused Mayer of obscurantism, of suppressing historical fact, and of being an apologist for Nazi Germany, like Ernst Nolte, for attempting to “de-demonize” National Socialism. Also in 1989, historian Lucy Dawidowicz reviewed <b>Why</b> <b>Did</b> <b>the</b> Heavens Not Darken? in Commentary magazine, and praised Goldhagen's [...] "False Witness" [...] review, identifying him as a rising Holocaust historian who formally rebutted “Mayer's falsification” of history.|$|E
2500|$|The {{theory of}} [...] "karma and rebirth" [...] raises {{numerous}} questions—such as how, when, and <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> cycle {{start in the}} first place, what is the relative Karmic merit of one karma versus another and why, and what evidence is there that rebirth actually happens, among others. Various schools of Hinduism realized these difficulties, debated their own formulations, some reaching what they considered as internally consistent theories, while other schools modified and de-emphasized it, while a few schools in Hinduism such as Carvakas, Lokayatana abandoned [...] "karma and rebirth" [...] theory altogether. Schools of Buddhism consider karma-rebirth cycle as integral to their theories of soteriology.|$|E

2500|$|One {{position}} {{is to say}} that the constant increase of entropy we observe happens only because of the initial state of our universe. Other possible states of the universe (for example, a universe at heat death equilibrium) would actually result in no increase of entropy. In this view, the apparent T-asymmetry of our universe is a problem in cosmology: [...] <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> universe start with a low entropy? This view, if it remains viable in the light of future cosmological observation, would connect this problem to one of the big open questions beyond the reach of today's physics [...] the question of initial conditions of the universe.|$|E
2500|$|In the trial, Irving {{represented}} himself. He {{called the}} American Kevin B. MacDonald, an evolutionary psychologist, to testify on his behalf. Irving {{made much of}} the statement by the American historian Arno J. Mayer, who Irving went to pains to point out was both a Marxist {{and a man who}} would have been considered Jewish in Nazi racial theory, in his 1988 book <b>Why</b> <b>Did</b> <b>the</b> Heavens Not Darken?, {{that most of the people}} who died at Auschwitz were the victims of disease rather than murder. In response, Peter Longerich argued that Mayer did not deny the Holocaust in his book, and that he was simply wrong about more Jews dying of [...] "natural" [...] as opposed to [...] "unnatural" [...] causes of death at Auschwitz.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1946 Christmas episode, for example, Benny buys {{shoelaces}} for Don, and {{is unable}} to {{make up his mind}} whether to give Wilson shoelaces with plastic tips or metal tips. After exchanging them repeatedly, Mel Blanc is heard screaming insanely, [...] "Plastic tips! Metal tips! I can't stand it anymore!" [...] A variation in 1948 was with an expensive wallet, but repeatedly changing the greeting card, prompting Blanc to shout, [...] "I haven't run into anyone like you in 20 years! Oh, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> governor have to give me that pardon!?" [...] Benny then realizes that he should have gotten Don a wallet for $1.98, whereupon the store clerk responds by committing suicide. Over the years, in the Christmas episodes, Benny bought and repeatedly exchanged cuff links, golf tees, a box of dates, a paint set (water colors or oils), and a gopher trap. In later years, Benny would encounter Mel Blanc's wife (played by Jean Vander Pyl) or the clerk's psychiatrist at the store, and drive them crazy as well.|$|E

2500|$|The Vedanta {{tradition}} of Hinduism rejects the dualism of Samkhya. The Samkhya school of Hindu thought proposes two metaphysical realities, namely Purusha (spirit) and Prakriti (inert primal matter), then states that Purusha is the efficient {{cause of all}} existence while Prakriti is its material cause. Advaita, like all Vedanta schools, states that Brahman is both the efficient and the material cause, [...] "that from which the origination, subsistence, and dissolution of this universe proceed." [...] What created all existence is also present in and reflected in all beings and inert matter, the creative principle was and is everywhere, always. This Brahman it postulates is sat-cit-ananda (truth-consciousness-bliss). By accepting this postulation, various theoretical difficulties arise which Advaita and other Vedanta traditions offer different answers for: first, how did sat Brahman without any distinction become manifold universe? second, how did cit Brahman create material [...] world? third, if ananda Brahman is pure bliss, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> empirical world of sufferings arise? These are the questions that Advaita Vedanta thinkers have historically attempted to answer, as did the non-Advaita schools of Hinduism.|$|E
2500|$|Cecil {{had since}} {{been fascinated by}} the Gnostic Gospels; in 1945, a local farmer near Nag Hammadi, Upper Egypt {{discovered}} a clay casket with twelve leather-bound manuscripts that comprised fifty-two Gnostic texts; one of the texts particularly caught Cecil's attention, the Testimony of Truth, which {{tells the story of}} Genesis from a different perspective: From the perspective of a jealous God, the creator of man, and the Serpent, Lucifer, the bringer of light, who gives knowledge to man but is not once called the Devil – these were written by Gnostics, who were considered heretic by the Orthodox Church; the Cathars, who were Gnostic, [...] were brutally suppressed and massacred during the 13th century in the Albigensian Crusade in Languedoc, Southern France, by Pope Innocent III of the Catholic Church and the newly-set up Dominican Order. Cecil was fascinated that a piece of Christian history with such importance hadn't yet been brought into public consciousness, and hoped to start the new zeitgest with The Serpent's Curse, which would explore what secrets the Gnostics held and <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Church feel threatened by them, resonating the story to the present day.|$|E
2500|$|Jo Garfein at TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} preview, saying, [...] "This episode {{has more of}} an early X-Files feel, in a good way... To {{those of you who}} have either given up on the series or are on the fence, I recommend that you give Fringe another try. If 'Inner Child' is any indication, we are in for a very satisfying and engaging journey for the rest of the season." [...] Alan Sepinwall's review in The Star-Ledger was overall positive, [...] "As far as the episode as a whole goes, I thought it was fairly solid procedural hour of 'Fringe.' No, it didn't follow up on any of the revelations from 'Ability,' but it also didn't feature any of Agent Harris, and both the serial killer case and Olivia's rapport with the kid were compelling enough that I can wait on the mythology stuff for later." [...] Jane Boursaw at TV Squad rated the episode very highly in her recap, and also mooted a theory about the Child, [...] "My theory is that the boy is another Observer. They certainly looked a lot alike, didn't they? Could the boy have come from another dimension and ended up beneath the building? And <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> CIA guy say that they'd found 'another one.'" [...] Apparently, they're keeping track of these creatures or Observers. And if so, where are the others?" ...|$|E
