25|$|In 1988, Bhutan was {{reported}} to have evicted some number of Nepali-speaking residents (Bhutanese reports say about 5,000 and Refugee reports says over 100,000) from districts in southern Bhutan, creating a large refugee community that was now being detained in seven temporary United Nations refugee camps in Nepal and Sikkim. The actual numbers were difficult to establish, as many of those in the camps were reported to be holding forged identity papers, and impoverished Nepalese citizens and started to migrate to the Nepalese community leaving their refugee camps. The reason for leaving refugee camps was to find a job, and services to those living in camps. Few of them returned to the refugee camps. As a result, the number of people living in the camps decreased exponentially. Although the Bhutanese government claimed that only about 5000 initially left the country, the number of actual migration <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

500|$|Bede {{describes}} Æthelberht's {{relationship with}} Rædwald, king of East Anglia, in a passage {{that is not}} completely clear in meaning. It seems to imply that Rædwald retained ducatus, or military command of his people, even while Æthelberht held imperium. This implies that being a bretwalda usually included holding the military command of other kingdoms and also that it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> since Æthelberht is bretwalda despite Rædwald's control of his own troops. Rædwald was converted to Christianity while in Kent but did not abandon his pagan beliefs; this, together {{with the fact that}} he retained military independence, implies that Æthelberht's overlordship of East Anglia was much weaker than his influence with the East Saxons. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the passage in Bede should be translated as [...] "Rædwald, king of the East Angles, who while Æthelberht lived, even conceded to him the military leadership of his people"; if this is Bede's intent, then East Anglia firmly was under Æthelberht's overlordship.|$|E
500|$|In May 1699 Bellomont sailed for Boston. Bellomont spent 14 {{months in}} New England in 1699 and 1700, {{spending}} {{a few weeks of}} that time in New Hampshire and the rest in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts he was treated politely, but his attempts to implement the crown's policies ran into trouble, as they had in New York. He was refused a salary by the colonial legislature, although the [...] "gift" [...] of £1,000 he received <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> typically given other governors of the province. The legislature also made repeated attempts to limit appeals to London of judicial decisions handed down by provincial courts. Bellomont, as he was required to do, forwarded laws passed by the legislature to the Board of Trade for approval; these laws were repeatedly struck down because of provisions that attempted to limit royal prerogatives. [...] He also sided politically against Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton, who was an ally of Joseph Dudley, a Massachusetts native who had presided over the trial of Jacob Leisler. Instead he took council with the populist leader Elisha Cooke, Sr.|$|E
500|$|He {{had been}} working on the {{screenplay}} notes for over a year {{at the time of his}} death. [...] "He was more inquisitive than anybody I ever knew. He was writing a screenplay about his life. He was interested in world affairs, sometimes he'd call me up late at night and discuss philosophy. I think he'll be remembered as a great man. He happened to make a living playing basketball but he <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> He could talk on any subject. He was a Goliath", said Sy Goldberg, Chamberlain's longtime attorney. When million-dollar contracts became common in the NBA, Chamberlain increasingly felt he had been underpaid during his career. A result of this resentment was the 1997 book Who's Running the Asylum? Inside the Insane World of Sports Today (1997), in which he harshly criticized the NBA of the 1990s for being too disrespectful of players of the past. Even far beyond his playing days, Chamberlain was a very fit person. In his mid-forties, he was able to humble rookie Magic Johnson in practice, and even in the 1980s, he flirted with making a comeback in the NBA. In the 1980–81 NBA season, coach Larry Brown recalled that the 45-year-old Chamberlain had received an offer from the Cleveland Cavaliers. When Chamberlain was 50, the New Jersey Nets had the same idea, and Chamberlain declined again. However, he would continue to epitomize physical fitness for years to come, including participating in several marathons.|$|E

500|$|On 4 September 1929, {{the ship}} was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet as the flagship of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, which was commanded by her first captain, Barry Domvile. She remained in the Mediterranean until 1932. She became a gunnery training ship on 18 December 1933 and continued in that role until 1939. In 1935, she was one of four Royal Navy ships featured in the British film Brown on Resolution, where she played a German battlecruiser. In July 1939, a few months before the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe, she began a conversion into an anti-aircraft cruiser at Chatham Dockyard. This consisted of replacing all of her six-inch guns with eight QF 4-inch (102mm) Mk XVI dual-purpose guns in four twin-gun turrets, in the positions formerly occupied by Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 5 six-inch guns. A quadruple mount for the two-pounder Mk VII [...] "pom-pom" [...] light AA gun was installed in No. 2 gun's position. Quadruple Vickers [...] AA machinegun mounts replaced the three-inch guns and her torpedo tubes were removed. Her masts were cut down and her existing fire-control systems were replaced by a pair of High-Angle Control System Mk III systems and a pom-pom director. A Type 279 early-warning radar was also installed. To counter the additional weight high in the ship, [...] of ballast was added. Although the weight of the ballast alone <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of the new equipment, it increased her metacentric height from [...] at deep load.|$|E

She had been pretty, but now she <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> She was radiant. Her blue eyes danced. She looked excited.

The results show that strong and significant correlations can be found between the ratio of creative industries' value added and the GDP per capital. There is no evidence to show that growth rate of creative industries is deferent that of secondary industry for all the regions. But when we divide the samples as two groups, there is weak evidence to infer that the growth rate of creative industries <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of secondary industry for higher GDP per capital regions; on the contrary, there is overwhelming evidence to infer that the growth rate of secondary industry <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of creative industries for lower GDP per capital regions...|$|R
