40|$|This {{research}} {{conducted a study}} specially to systematically analyze combined recovery of exhaust gas and engine coolant and related influence mechanism, including a detailed theoretical study and an assistant experimental study. In this research, CO 2 -based transcritical Rankine cycle (CTRC) was used for fully combining the <b>wastes</b> <b>heats.</b> The main objective of theoretical research was to search an ‘ideal point’ of the recovery system and related influence mechanism, which was defined as operating condition of complete recovery of two <b>waste</b> <b>heats.</b> The theoretical methodology of this study could also provide a design reference for effective combined recovery of two or multiple <b>waste</b> <b>heats</b> in other fields. Based on a kW-class preheated CTRC prototype that was designed by the ‘ideal point’ method, an experimental {{study was conducted to}} verify combined utilization degree of two engine <b>waste</b> <b>heats</b> by the CTRC system.
