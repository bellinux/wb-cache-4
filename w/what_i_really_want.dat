It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E
500|$|Black Flag's {{change in}} musical style and {{appearance}} alienated {{many of their}} original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone. Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote [...] "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to do to them." [...] During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that [...] "his powerful physique was {{a metaphor for the}} impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself." [...] Rollins has since replied that [...] "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself." ...|$|E

[...] The {{song was}} {{the title track}} of the first album from Taupin's band Farm Dogs (see below). Nelson's album included two other Taupin songs, [...] "This Face" [...] and [...] "Mendocino County Line". The latter song, a duet between Nelson and Lee Ann Womack, {{was made into a}} video and released as the album's first single. The song won the 2003 Grammy for best vocal collaboration in country music. In 2004, he co-wrote Courtney Love's song [...] "Uncool", from her 2004 debut solo album America's Sweetheart.

2500|$|In 1976 Kevin Rowland {{formed a}} punk band called The Killjoys, based in Birmingham, England, which gained minor {{success with the}} release of their single [...] "Johnny Won't Get to Heaven"/"Naïve" [...] in 1977. Kevin [...] "Al" [...] Archer joined in early 1978, but due to {{internal}} arguments and tension between Rowland {{and the rest of the}} group the band dissolved. On [...] "a hot night in July 1978" [...] Rowland decided to form a new band, which would eventually become Dexys Midnight Runners, telling Archer [...] "I'm going to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to do: form a great group. We'll wear great clothes and make soulful music." [...] Throughout July Rowland and Archer auditioned 30–40 people to join the group, the eventual band consisting of 8 members. Later that summer the band would create their name, after the drug Dexedrine which was used by fans of Northern soul, and began a rigorous rehearsing and writing schedule, practicing for about 9 hours every day. In November 1978 the band entered the UK live circuit and gained a reputation for their strong performances, which included covers of classic soul songs and originals. Rowland and Archer employed a strict code of conduct, ruling out and drinking or drug use before performances, and introduced many of the band members to activities such as shoplifting expeditions and bumping trains.|$|E
2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although I sense that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E

6000|$|Charming and [...] "gracious" [...] your letter, {{and welcome}} sign of your {{restoration}} in more senses than one. Though I see you, alas, nowadays, at such intervals, I feel this extremely individual little island to be appreciably less its characteristic self {{when you are}} away from it, and sensibly more so, and breathing the breath of relief, when it gets you back and plumps you down with a fond [...] "There!" [...] on your high hilltop, a beacon-like depository of traditions no one else so admirably embodies. Your invitation to come and share {{for a few days}} your paradise with you finds me, I am very sorry to say, in a hindered and helpless moment. I am obliged to recognise the stern fact that I can't leave home just now. I have had a complicated and quite overwhelmed summer--agreeably, interestingly, anxiously and worriedly, even; but inevitably and logically--waves of family history, a real deluge, having rolled over my bowed head and left me, as to the question of work, production, time, ease and other matters, quite high and dry. I went on Saturday last to Dover to see my sister-in-law off to the Continent--and as she took a night boat had to stop there over Sunday, at the too-familiar (and too other things) Lord Warden; after which I came back to bury (yes, bury!) my precious, my admirable little Peter, whom I think you had met. (He passed away on Sunday at St. Leonard's, fondly attended by the local [...] "canine specialist"--after three days of dreadful little dysentery.) Thus is constituted the first moment of my being by myself for about four months. It may last none too long, and is, already, to be tempered by the palpable presence of Gosse from Saturday p.m. to Monday next. So, with arrears untold, in every direction, with preoccupations but just temporarily arranged, I feel that I absolutely must sit close for a good many weeks to come; in fact till the New Year--after which I depart. I don't quite know what becomes of me then, but I don't, distinctly, for a third year, hibernate here. My London rooms are as probably as sordidly let for 1901 (though not to a certainty,) and it will (my wretched fate--not fat--fate) depend more or less upon that. My brother, ill, but thank God, better, wants me to come to Egypt with him and his wife for 12 weeks--his health demanding it, but he only going if I will accompany him. So the pistol is at my head. Will it bring me down? I've a positive terror of it. The alternatives are Rome (of which I've a still greater terror than of Egypt, for it's an equal complication and less reward,) or De Vere Gardens, or a more squalid perch in town if De V.G. are closed to me. The latter, the last-named, doom is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want.</b> If I should, clingingly, clutchingly, stick to these shores, I might then, were it agreeable to you, be able to put in three days of Underbank, which I've never seen in its tragic winter mood. But these things are in the lap of the gods.|$|E
