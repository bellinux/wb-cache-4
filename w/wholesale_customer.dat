50|$|Originally {{owned by}} Mary Jackson, the Brazen Head {{was a general}} store located in Cornhill, an area {{in the heart of}} Boston. Located next to the Town House, {{otherwise}} known as the Old State House, the Brazen Head was most likely a well-known store. The Town House was an incredibly important building, and has been referred to as “The principle public building of the Provence Massachusetts.” According to History of the Old State House by George Moore, “Washington, Lafayette, Franklin, Jefferson” and others joined important Massachusetts residents in visiting the Town House. It can be deduced, then, that the Brazen Head was an important and highly trafficked store due to its centrality within Boston and its location next to the Town House. A newspaper advertisement in a 1736 edition of the New England Weekly Journal also provided us with some insight on the Brazen Head’s surroundings. The advertisement stated, “Several sorts of glass bottles, as also goods velvet corks, to be sold by Mr. Belthazar Bayard, next door to Brazen Head in Cornhil, Boston.” This indicates that the Brazen Head was not the only landmark in the area, and that Cornhill housed many different, important stores.The Jacksons relied heavily on imported goods their entire lives, and before the non-importation agreement it seems like they were well respected in the Boston community. An advertisement in the Boston Gazette from 1759 stated, “Imported from London and Bristol, and sold by Mary Jackson and Son at the Brazen Head, Cornhill, Boston: Brass kettles, skillets, warming pans, iron pots and kettles, powder, etc… A <b>wholesale</b> <b>customer</b> may depend upon being well serv’d at a reasonable price.” The Brazen Head clearly sold a diverse array of goods, and according to the ad, the Jacksons could be counted upon as trustworthy vendors.|$|E

40|$|Rational pricing {{strategy}} {{is one of}} the most important problems in economy. Pricing comprises a number of subtasks including product price formation, existing price adjustment and analysis of deviations in <b>wholesale</b> <b>customer</b> behaviour. The object of this study is exploring these tasks. The study is aimed at creating an intelligent technologies based decision support system for solving the above tasks. Solving is based on finding the hidden regularities among the sets of time-series. For that purpose, a number of Data Mining technologies are used. To store the data mined, concepts of classes and behaviour profiles are introduced. Behaviour profiles are employed as the input data of recommendation and decision making module...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{circumstances}} in which manufacturers provide inputs to wholesale customers only to subsequently compete with these wholesale customers in the retail realm. Such dual distribution arrangements commonly suffer from excessive encroachment in that the manufacturer's ex post retail aggression is harmful ex ante because it undercuts potential wholesale profits. This paper demonstrates that with dual distribution, a manufacturer can benefit from decentralized control {{and the use of}} transfer prices above marginal cost. Although these arrangements often create coordination concerns, a moderate presence of such concerns permits the manufacturer to credibly convey to its <b>wholesale</b> <b>customer</b> that it will not excessively encroach on its retail territory. This, in turn, permits the manufacturer to reap greater wholesale profits. We also note that this force can point to a silver lining in arm's-length (parity) requirements on transfer pricing in that they can solidify commitments to a particular retail posture. decentralization, supply chains, transfer pricing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze how the variability of wind affects optimal dispatches and re-serves in a daily optimization cycle. The Cornell SuperOPF 1 is used to illustrate how the system costs can be determined for a reliable network (the amount of conventional generat-ing capacity needed to maintain System Adequacy is deter-mined endogenously). Eight cases are studied to illustrate the effects of geographical distribution, ramping costs and load response to customers payment in the wholesale mar-ket, and the amount of potential wind generation that is dis-patched. The results in this paper use a typical daily pattern of load and capture the cost of ramping by including addi-tions to the operating costs of the generating units associated with the hour-to-hour changes in their optimal dispatch. The proposed regulatory changes for electricity markets are 1) to establish a new market for ramping services, 2) to aggre-gate the loads of customers on a distribution network so that they can be represented as a single <b>wholesale</b> <b>customer</b> on the bulk-power transmission network and 3) to make use of con-trollable load and geographical distribution of wind to mit-igate the variability of wind generation as an alternative to upgrading the capacity of the transmission network...|$|E
