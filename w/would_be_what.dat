Oda stated that the ending <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{readers to}} know that the stone mask and its powers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he thought about how to create drawings that show the invisible; he {{came up with the idea}} of a character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them.|$|E
5|$|Little Bee {{explains}} that although Nkiruka was gang raped, murdered, and cannibalised by the soldiers, she {{was allowed to}} escape, and stowed away in the cargo hold of a ship bound for England. Sarah allows Little Bee to stay with her, intent on helping her become a legal British citizen. Lawrence, who is still involved with Sarah, disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning Little Bee in to the police. When he informs Little Bee that he is considering this, she responds that allowing her to stay <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> is best for Sarah, so if Lawrence turns her in, Little Bee will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair. The two reach an uneasy truce. After spending several days together, Sarah, Lawrence, Little Bee and Charlie take {{a trip to the}} park. Charlie goes missing, and Little Bee calls the police while Sarah searches for him. Although he is quickly found, the police become suspicious of Little Bee, and discover that she is in the country illegally.|$|E

500|$|In 608, the Exarchate of Africa under Heraclius the Elder revolted against Emperor Phocas. The {{subsequent}} {{campaign against}} Phocas was portrayed by Byzantine historians as avenging {{the death of}} Maurice, {{which might have been}} part of the motivation of this revolt. The other part, however, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> Walter Emil Kaegi termed [...] "cold political calculations": Carthage was at a safe distance from Constantinople and Phocas could not easily launch an attack against it. The relative wealth of the Exarchate of Africa could well enough finance a revolt. Phocas's regime arguably needed the grain and revenues from Africa, while the Exarchate sustained itself with relative ease. Meanwhile, the Persian shah Khosrau II had secured control of Dara and was mobilizing his troops for a large-scale invasion into Byzantine territories. News of this campaign could have well reached Heraclius the Elder. With Phocas facing two separate military fronts, the emperor would be unable to concentrate the majority of his troops on either one of them, encouraging Heraclius the Elder of his chances to succeed in this confrontation.|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, Paul was {{the subject}} of some {{controversy}} when it was discovered that he had plagiarized from Wikipedia part of a speech in support of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli. Referencing the movie Gattaca, Paul quoted almost verbatim from the Wikipedia article about the film without citing the source. Evidence soon surfaced that Paul had copied sentences in a number of his other speeches nearly verbatim from other authors without giving credit to the original sources, including in the speech he had given as the Tea Party rebuttal to the president's 2013 State of the Union address. In addition, a three-page-long passage of Paul's book Government Bullies was taken directly from an article by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. When it became apparent that Paul's op-ed in The Washington Times on mandatory minimums and related testimony he had given before the Senate Judiciary Committee both contained material that was virtually identical to an article that had been published by another author in The Week a few days earlier, the Washington Times said that the newspaper would no longer publish the weekly column Paul had been contributing to the paper. After a week of almost daily news reports of new allegations of plagiarism, Paul said that he was being held to an [...] "unfair standard", but would restructure his office in order to prevent mistakes in the future, if that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> it would take [...] "to make people leave me the hell alone." ...|$|E

But after the release of Interstellar in 2014, Heisserer and Villeneuve agreed that this would not work, and decided that the heptapods' gift <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> was [...] "there in front of us ... the power of their language".|$|E

Also visible from the square <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> Hébrard called the Place Civique or [...] Civic Square, {{which would be the}} city's administrative heart along European lines: it would feature the City Hall on the left, the court houses on the right and a grand triumphant arch leading uphill from the Civic Square.

2500|$|Blackwell {{first became}} {{interested}} in music through the influence of her fourth grade teacher, Nancy Notargiacomo, who eventually became her voice and piano teacher when she was 10. She also credits her high school choral director for encouraging her to pursue a music career. In a 2003 interview Blackwell recalled, [...] "I {{did not come from}} a musical family. I had a fourth grade teacher that introduced me to music and I sang at the Catholic church. In high school I started doing musicals − The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Oliver!, and so forth. I thought maybe this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> I would pursue after high school, although even in my {{senior year in high school}} I had doubts. I wanted to go into history or fashion design. But, I had a wonderful choral director who said 'no, your calling is music,' and she convinced me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1985, Loveless {{felt her}} {{marriage}} to Terry Lovelace was ending (they eventually divorced amicably in 1986). She contacted her brother Roger to help her get back to Nashville. [...] After being in the rock 'n' roll scene for so long she felt {{completely out of the}} country-music loop but wanted to sing country music again. Roger Ramey helped his sister cut a five-song demo tape, one of them being a rough cut of her self-penned song [...] "I Did", which Loveless first wrote as a teenager, then later included on her first album. Roger Ramey then began to spread the word around about her talent. She and her brother disagreed about including [...] "I Did" [...] on the demo tape. Loveless didn't believe the song was good enough, but Roger argued that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> got her a contract. Once the demo was finished, Roger started trying to get her a recording contract with a major label in Nashville.|$|E
