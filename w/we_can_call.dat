25|$|Example. Suppose f(x) = P11(x) = x and g(x,y,z)= S(P23(x,y,z)) = S(y). Then h(0,x) = x and h(S(y),x) = g(y,h(y,x),x) = S(h(y,x)). Now h(0,1) = 1, h(1,1) = S(h(0,1)) = 2, h(2,1) = S(h(1,1)) = 3.

25|$|We may {{speak of}} the degree of a Diophantine set as being the least degree of a {{polynomial}} in an equation defining that set. Similarly, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> the dimension of such a set the least number of unknowns in a defining equation. Because of the existence of a universal Diophantine equation, it is clear that there are absolute upper bounds to both of these quantities, and there has been much interest in determining these bounds.|$|E
25|$|The eigenstates are {{obtained}} by diagonalizing this matrix. This gives new eigenvectors, which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> K1 {{which is the}} sum of the two states of opposite strangeness, and K2, which is the difference. The two are eigenstates of CP with opposite eigenvalues; K1 has CP=+1, and K2 has CP=−1 Since the two-pion final state also has CP=+1, only the K1 can decay this way. The K2 must decay into three pions. Since the mass of K2 is just a little larger than the sum of the masses of three pions, this decay proceeds very slowly, about 600 times slower than the decay of K1 into two pions. These two different modes of decay were observed by Leon Lederman and his coworkers in 1956, establishing the existence of the two weak eigenstates (states with definite lifetimes under decays via the weak force) of the neutral kaons.|$|E

This primitive writing is placed slightly earlier than primitive writings of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia, dated c.3100BC. These markings have similarities to what later became Indus Script.|$|E
2500|$|The theory {{underlying}} Interlingua posits {{an international}} vocabulary, {{a large number}} of words and affixes that are present {{in a wide range of}} languages. This already existing international vocabulary was shaped by social forces, science and technology, to [...] "all corners of the world". The goal of the International Auxiliary Language Association was to accept into Interlingua every widely international word in whatever languages it occurred. They conducted studies to identify [...] "the most generally international vocabulary possible", while still maintaining the unity of the language. This scientific approach of generating a language from selected source languages (called control languages) resulted in a vocabulary and grammar that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> the highest common factor of each major European language.|$|E

2500|$|Wells {{inquiry into}} the nature of dew were widely cited in the 1830s as an {{outstanding}} example of inductive scientific inquiry. Sir J. F. W. Herschel used it as the primary illustration in his Discourse on the study of Natural Philosophy, calling the theory, [...] "one of the most beautiful specimens <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> to mind of inductive experimental enquiry lying within a moderate compass." [...] In 1836, the Encyclopedia Metropolitana reported, [...] "We know of no work in our day which has been more universally admired than the Treatise of Dr. Wells, certainly none that practically exemplifies in a purer and better form the admirable inductive system which it was the object of Bacon to teach." [...] John Tyndall and William Whewell praised it similarly.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they began}} their career as [...] "a group of art school, experimental, post punk rockers," [...] the band's quick rise to stardom, {{polished}} good looks, and {{embrace of the}} teen press, almost guaranteed disfavour from music critics. During the 1980s, Duran Duran were considered the quintessential manufactured, throw-away pop group. However, according to the Sunday Herald, [...] "To describe them, as some have, as the first boy band, misrepresents their appeal. Their weapons were never just their looks, but self-penned songs." [...] As Moby said of the band in his website diary in 2003: [...] "...they were cursed by what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> the 'Bee Gees' curse, which is: 'write amazing songs, sell tons of records, and consequently incur the wrath or disinterest of the rock obsessed critical establishment.'" [...] Some of the influences on Duran Duran included contemporary synthpop bands such as Japan and Yellow Magic Orchestra.|$|E
2500|$|Although Wittgenstein {{certainly}} {{argues that}} the notion of private language is incoherent, because {{of the way in which}} the text is presented the exact nature of the argument is disputed. First, he argues that a private language is not really a language at all. [...] This point is intimately connected with a variety of other themes in his later works, especially his investigations of [...] "meaning". For Wittgenstein, there is no single, coherent [...] "sample" [...] or [...] "object" [...] that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> [...] "meaning". Rather, the supposition that there are such things is the source of many philosophical confusions. Meaning is a complicated phenomenon that is woven into the fabric of our lives. A good first approximation of Wittgenstein's point is that meaning is a social event; meaning happens between language users. As a consequence, it makes no sense to talk about a private language, with words that mean something in the absence of other users of the language.|$|E

2500|$|Neuroethics {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of issues, which can only be sampled here. Some have close ties to traditional biomedical ethics, in that different versions of these issues can arise in connection with organ systems other than the brain. [...] For example, how should incidental findings be handled when a presumed healthy research subject is scanned for neuroscience research and the scan reveals an abnormality? [...] How safe are the drugs used to enhance normal brain function? [...] These are neuroethical issues with clear precedents in traditional bioethics. [...] They are important issues, and luckily <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> upon society's experience with the relevant precedents to help determine the best courses of action in the present cases. [...] In contrast, many neuroethical issues are at least partly novel, and this accounts for some of the intellectual fascination of neuroethics. [...] These relatively newer issues force us to think about the relation between mind and brain and its ethical implications.|$|E

The very far right group of Republicans' interest in Israel is not because they are so supportive of there being a Jewish state and making sure that Jews have a place that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>call</b> home.

2500|$|Addressing {{the issue}} of {{remaining}} faithful to the two previous games whilst still introducing new elements to the franchise, MumboJumbo president Mark Dochtermann explained the developers {{did not intend to}} reinvent the series' basic gameplay, although they were keen to try out new things; [...] "There's a lot left to explore in the Myth franchise even before we go in a somewhat different route. Although, we are taking a [...] route in terms of adding 3D acceleration, 3D models, and doing stuff with the terrain engine and physics that are still way beyond what the other RTS games are doing right now."
