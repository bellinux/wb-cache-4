[...] He was intrigued how {{we are able to}} easily form impressions of humans even though <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> complex structures.

Asch concluded [...] "to know a person is to have a grasp of a particular structure". He demonstrated through his experiments that forming an impression has the following elements: ...|$|E

While complimentary of the talents {{of several of the}} rock artists at the festival, he said he was [...] "horrified" [...] to see Jimi Hendrix set fire to his guitar on stage: [...] "That was too much for me. In our culture, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> respect for musical instruments, they are like part of God." [...] Shankar's [...] peaked at number 43 on Billboards pop LPs chart in the US, which remains the highest placing he achieved on that chart.|$|E

He told DARE officials: [...] "I think your organization has been an absolute fraud {{on the people of}} this country... For you to continue taking precious drug-prevention dollars when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a serious and, in some instances, growing addiction problem is unconscionable." ...|$|E

This {{should be done with}} a view toward development of a civil and military structure for exploitation in the event the Colombian internal security system deteriorates further. This structure should be used to pressure toward reforms known to be needed, perform counter-agent and counter-propaganda functions and as necessary execute paramilitary, sabotage and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents. It should be backed by the United States... If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> an apparatus in Colombia it should be employed now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{large number}} of deaths did not go unnoticed by local officials. Yang Kuisong noted that by May 1951, many provinces had called for {{a halt to the}} mass executions, but the killings had in fact {{increased}} due to acceptance of the suppression campaign as a means of settling local grievances. Mao also became concerned with the excessive executions, and suggested for the executions to be reduced to 0.05 percent, with a limit of 0.1 percent, while {{that the rest of the}} accused criminals can be sentenced to life imprisonment or hard labor instead. Mao stated, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> people executed, it will not be easily understood by the masses, nor will public figures be sympathetic; furthermore we would be deprived of a large pool of labor, and it would serve little use in dividing the enemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 14, 1962, Jacqueline took American {{television}} viewers {{on a tour}} of the White House with Charles Collingwood of CBS News. In the tour she stated that [...] "I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best." [...] The film was watched by 56 million {{television viewers}} in the United States, and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Trustees Award for it at the Emmy Awards in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by Lady Bird Johnson.

2500|$|In September 2006, Timberlake {{released}} his second studio album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Critically and commercially acclaimed, the album spawned six singles, including the worldwide hits [...] "SexyBack", [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". After wrapping up a worldwide concert tour {{in support of}} the album in 2007, Timberlake took a break from his music career to focus on acting. In 2010, Timberlake's manager, Johnny Wright, began conversations with the singer about working on new music. The two had general decisions about ways to release new music, because according to Wright, [...] "a lot of the physical record sellers were gone, by the time we've got music again we need to think about different ways to deliver it". Wright proposed a promotion based on an application or releasing a new song every month. Timberlake, however, was not interested in going back into music and instead continued to focus on his film career. Around the [...] "late part of May/first week in June" [...] 2012, Timberlake asked Wright to dinner and revealed to him that he had spent the last couple of nights in studio with Timbaland working on new material. Wright was shocked at the revelation, telling Billboard magazine that he [...] "wasn't prepared for that." [...] The two immediately began marketing plans for how the album should be promoted and when it should be released. Ultimately, they agreed [...] "to do this in a shorter period of time, so let's put the single out and [...] seven or eight weeks after that– make it a short window, and because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a short window, we have to make a big impact." ...|$|E
