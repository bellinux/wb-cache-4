5|$|Among the Normans who {{returned}} to their holdings was Walter de Clifford, who reclaimed Cantref Bychan, then invaded Rhys's lands in Cantref Mawr. An appeal to the king produced no response, and Rhys resorted to arms, first capturing Clifford's castle at Llandovery then seizing Ceredigion. King Henry responded by preparing another invasion, and Rhys submitted without resistance. He <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to give hostages, probably including his son Hywel.|$|E
5|$|The resort {{brought in}} some money, but Bowers {{was still in}} debt. The Bowers Mine was sold to pay off creditors, and she entered into {{negotiations}} with the newly created State of Nevada {{for the state to}} purchase the mansion as a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately for Bowers, the deal fell through, and she <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to begin to sell her possessions to settle debts.|$|E

5|$|Although the Americans {{had taken}} the vessel, Sterett had no orders to take prizes and so <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to release her. Enterprise {{completed}} her journey to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted morale in the United States, since it was that country's first victory {{in the war against}} the Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in Tripoli, where morale sank heavily upon learning of Tripoli defeat. Despite Enterprise triumph, the war continued indecisively for another four years.|$|E
5|$|Another one of Heffron's {{election}} promises, namely a Royal Commission {{into the}} legalisation of off-course betting, caused considerable tension {{with his own}} cabinet. His Attorney General Reg Downing favoured its legalisation through a government-supervised Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) while his Chief Secretary Gus Kelly favoured legalising the activities of existing SP bookmakers. Downing however, went over Heffron's head and procured an ALP State Executive order requiring {{the establishment of a}} TAB. When the Final Report of Commission was handed down on 29 March 1963, echoing the position of Downing, Heffron <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to carry out the establishment of the TAB.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the Taylor Report in January 1990, Sunderland <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to make plans to turn their Roker Park home into an all-seater stadium. Roker Park was a ground that mainly {{consisted}} of standing terraces, and if converted into all-seater it would have held far fewer spectators than before. Enclosed by residential streets on all sides, expansion was practically impossible. So, by 1991, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray began investigating the possibility of relocation to a new stadium.|$|E

5|$|For most of {{his career}} Harrison <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to earn a living by {{conducting}} and other musical work, to the detriment of his composing. In early 1913 he was engaged as a répétiteur at Covent Garden, where he had the opportunity of observing Arthur Nikisch prepare Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Later that year Harrison was appointed to the conducting staff for the season. In 1914 he was assistant conductor to Nikisch and Felix Weingartner in Paris, rehearsing Parsifal for the former and Tristan und Isolde for the latter.|$|E
5|$|In 1447 {{the local}} painter's guild elected Lochner as their {{representative}} municipal councilor, or Ratsherr. The appointment implies {{that he had}} lived in Cologne since at least 1437, as only those who had been living in the city for ten years could take up the position. He had not taken up citizenship immediately, possibly to avoid paying the 12 guilder fee. He <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to act as Ratsherr, and on 24 June 1447 he became a burgher of Cologne. The role of municipal councilor could only be held for a one-year term, with two years vacated before reoccupation. Lochner was re-elected for a second term in the winter of 1450–51, but died in office.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, Wilberforce {{moved from}} his large house in Kensington Gore to Highwood Hill, {{a more modest}} {{property}} in the countryside of Mill Hill, north of London, where he was soon joined by his son William and family. William had attempted a series of educational and career paths, and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses, which his father repaid in full, despite offers from others to assist. This left Wilberforce with little income, and he <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to let his home and {{spend the rest of}} his life visiting family members and friends. He continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti-Slavery Society.|$|E

5|$|Just {{months into}} his reign, Edward forced a {{constitutional}} crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Wallis Simpson. Although legally Edward could have married Simpson, as King {{he was also}} head of the Church of England, which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage. As a constitutional monarch, Edward <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to accept ministerial advice.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge's heart {{condition}} worsened, {{to the extent}} that he was unable to attend his mother's funeral in 1970. He eventually required 24-hour care, and was transferred to Nuffield Hospital in Exeter, where he died in his sleep on 30 September 1971. His body was interned at the family plot in Heytesbury, Wiltshire. As the Branscombe house was owned by the Lethbridge Family Trust, Mina <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to move out after her husband's death, and she sold his belongings out of financial necessity. Mina also collected together Lethbridge's unfinished book with the help of writer Colin Wilson; together they assembled it into publishable form and it was brought out by Routledge in 1976 as The Power of the Pendulum.|$|E
5|$|Springbok colours {{are only}} awarded to South Africans. Australian Eddie Jones, {{who worked as}} a {{technical}} advisor to South Africa for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, was not allowed to be issued with Springbok colours as a non-South African and <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to wear a South Africa tracksuit when pitchside. Following South Africa's victory in the Rugby World Cup, all players and coaching team members were expected to wear their Springbok colours to the post-tournament awards dinner. In protest at Jones not being issued with colours, Bryan Habana gave Jones his Springbok colours and the team attended the awards dinner in suits instead of in Springbok colours.|$|E

According to the treaty, the Seven Islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of Bassein and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese. The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dispute over}} Springbok colours {{came from the}} rise of rugby league in South Africa in the 1950s. SARB felt it was their duty {{as members of the}} International Rugby Football Board to defend amateur rugby union against {{professional}} rugby league after several Springboks had defected to rugby league. In 1959, the SARB declared that all players that represented South Africa in rugby union had to sign a declaration they would not turn professional for two years. Any player who refused this <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to return his Springbok colours and was not permitted to purchase a replacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{nature of}} the Mycenaean Greeks {{is evident from the}} numerous weapons unearthed, the use of warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, and the preserved Greek Linear B records. The Mycenaeans invested in the development of military infrastructure, with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centers. According to the Linear B records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army. Similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.|$|E

5|$|With the Magyar threat eliminated, Simeon led his hosts {{south and}} routed the Byzantine {{army in the}} battle of Boulgarophygon in the summer of 896, which forced Byzantium to agree to the Bulgarian terms. The war ended with a peace treaty which {{restored}} the Bulgarian market in Constantinople and confirmed Bulgarian domination in the Balkans. The Byzantine Empire <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to pay Bulgaria an annual tribute in exchange for the return of captured Byzantine soldiers and civilians. Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and the Strandzha mountains to Bulgaria. Despite several violations, the treaty formally lasted until Leo VI's death in 912.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> {{to state}} {{the terms of the}} armistice. He demanded the {{dissolution}} of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Zurich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence. The first Land Peace of Kappel, der erste Landfriede, ended the war on 24 June.|$|E
5|$|According to custom, pretenders to {{the throne}} had {{historically}} been put to death upon the naming of a new sovereign. Radama was opposed to this practice and asked the brothers to help ensure his accession {{to the throne}} with minimum bloodshed {{on the day of}} the queen's death. Rainilaiarivony successfully maintained authority over the palace guards anxiously awaiting the command from either faction to slaughter the other. When the queen's attendant quietly informed him that her final moments were approaching, Rainilaiarivony discreetly summoned Radama and Rainivoninahitriniony from the Prime Minister's palace to the royal Rova compound and ordered the prince crowned before the gathered soldiers, just as the queen was pronounced dead. Ramboasalama was promptly escorted to the palace where he <b>was</b> <b>obliged</b> to publicly swear allegiance to King Radama.|$|E
