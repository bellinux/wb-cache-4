His administration oversaw {{the creation of a new}} constitution and a presidential election, Dahomey's first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. Alley lost popularity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E

Despite her efforts at appealing the immigration decision, Anna is told she is banned from entering the United States. Meanwhile, Jacob leaves behind his successful design business and visits Anna in London for a few weeks.

5|$|The film company Toho {{approached}} Obayashi <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> {{to make a}} film like Jaws. Influenced by {{ideas from}} his daughter Chigumi, Obayashi developed ideas for a script that was written by Chiho Katsura. After the script was green-lit, the film was put on hold for two years as no director at Toho wanted to direct it. Obayashi promoted the film during this time period until the studio allowed him to direct it himself. The film was a box office hit in Japan but received negative reviews from critics. House received a wide release in 2009 and 2010 in North America, where it received more favorable reviews.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{function}} of various patterns of animal coloration {{that have been}} called countershading has been debated by zoologists such as Hannah Rowland (2009), <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> {{that there may be}} multiple functions including flattening and background matching when viewed from the side; background matching when viewed from above or below, implying separate colour schemes for the top and bottom surfaces; outline obliteration from above; and a variety of largely untested non-camouflage theories. A related mechanism, counter-illumination, adds the creation of light by bioluminescence or lamps to match the actual brightness of a background. Counter-illumination camouflage is common in marine organisms such as squid. It has been studied up to the prototype stage for military use in ships and aircraft, but it too has rarely or never been used in warfare.|$|E

5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of the}} {{delegation}} to Riel was Gabriel Dumont, a respected buffalo hunter {{and leader of the}} Saint-Laurent Métis who had known Riel in Manitoba. James Isbister was the lone Anglo-Métis delegate. Riel was easily swayed to support their cause—which was perhaps not surprising in view of Riel's continuing conviction that he was the divinely selected leader of the Métis and the prophet of a new form of Christianity. Riel also intended to use the new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in Manitoba. The party departed 4 June, and arrived back at Batoche on 5 July. Upon his arrival Métis and English settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of Riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach. During June 1884, the Plains Cree leaders Big Bear and Poundmaker were independently formulating their complaints, and subsequently held meetings with Riel. However, the Native grievances were quite {{different from those of the}} settlers, and nothing was then resolved. Inspired by Riel, Honoré Jackson and representatives of other communities set about drafting a petition, and Jackson on 28 July released a manifesto detailing grievances and the settler's objectives. A joint English-Métis central committee with Jackson acting as secretary worked to reconcile proposals from different communities. In the interim, Riel's support began to waver. As Riel's religious pronouncements became increasingly heretical the clergy distanced themselves, and father Alexis André cautioned Riel against mixing religion and politics. Also, in response to bribes by territorial lieutenant-governor and Indian commissioner Edgar Dewdney, local English-language newspapers adopted an editorial stance critical of Riel. Nevertheless, the work continued, and on 16 December Riel forwarded the committee's petition to the government, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestion</b> that delegates be sent to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiation. Receipt of the petition was acknowledged by Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, Macdonald's Secretary of State, although Macdonald himself would later deny having ever seen it. By then many original followers had left; only 250 remained at Batoche when it fell in May 1885.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Bachelor’s thesis “Coverage of suicides in Estonian media” was {{to analyze}} the {{coverage}} of suicides in Estonian media through three different suicide cases and evaluate, to which extent is the coverage of suicides in Estonian media coherent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestions</b> made by <b>the</b> World Health Organization (WHO). Three largest daily newspapers, two local papers and one weekly were used as the source for analysis. Three different suicide cases were selected for analysis: a politician’s wife, a businessman and a schoolboy. 29 articles were analyzed, using a combined method of critical discourse analysis and content analysis. Since studies have proved that media has {{an important role in}} preventing suicides, the research questions were posed based on <b>the</b> <b>suggestions</b> for media organizations by WHO, which should be used for covering suicides. The results of this research can be shortly summarized as following: - Suicide method was mentioned in 18 articles out of 29, method has been described in detail in 12 articles - Almost all the articles presented suicide as a result of one certain reason - The grief of relatives was shown in only one article - Experts were interviewed in three articles - None of the articles presented information about the warning signs of suicide or helplines - Suicide statistics was used in two cases, generally in correct form - Suicide victims were not depicted in a heroic way - Physical harm and evaluations to the suicide method were presented in case of covering an unusual method (self-ignition - Five suicide articles were published as a top news story, one article was published on the front page - Photos of the suicide victims were used in five articles, three of them in an incorrect manner The posed research question: To which extent is the coverage of suicides in Estonian media coherent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestions</b> made by <b>the</b> World Health Organization? Proved the hypothesis: Estonian media does generally not cover suicides in coherence <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestions</b> of World Health Organization.
