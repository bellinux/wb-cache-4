5|$|Leaders of {{the main}} rebel coalition, the Syrian National Coalition, were angered by the agreement. The U.S., <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> the coalition, had changed its mind about {{striking}} Syria. Rebels furthermore worried the agreement might be a considered a de facto admission of the Bashar al-Assad government's legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Russell's ministry, though Whig, was not favoured by the Queen. She found {{particularly}} offensive the Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, {{who often}} acted <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, or the Queen. Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge, but Palmerston was retained {{in office and}} continued to act on his own initiative, despite her repeated remonstrances. It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government's approval of President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's coup in France <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> the Prime Minister. The following year, President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III, by which time Russell's administration {{had been replaced by}} a short-lived minority government led by Lord Derby.|$|E
5|$|The {{driving force}} behind the {{government}} assault on the Buddhists appeared to have come from senior military commanders acting <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> the civilian government.

5|$|From 1920 to 1957, three bodies, {{successively}} the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, the Federal Capital Commission, and the National Capital Planning and Development Committee {{continued to}} plan the further expansion of Canberra {{in the absence of}} Griffin; however, they were only advisory, and development decisions were made <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> them, increasing inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war, Huggins invited {{the leader of the}} opposition Labour Party, Harry Davies, to join a coalition government. Davies accepted <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> his party caucus, much to the indignation of many of his contemporaries; Labour promptly split. The two Labour factions reconciled in 1943 and briefly threatened Huggins's premiership until a heated dispute over whether Labour should become multiracial led to the party's disintegration in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} liberty {{was one of}} the {{defining}} features of Ba'athism, however, liberty not in the sense used by liberal democracies. Aflaq was a strong believer in pluralism of thought, but paradoxically, against pluralism in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba'ath Party would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> the people because the party knew what was right.|$|E

5|$|Gladstone {{returned}} to power after the 1892 general election; he was 82 years old. Victoria objected when Gladstone proposed appointing the Radical MP Henry Labouchère to the Cabinet, so Gladstone {{agreed not to}} appoint him. In 1894, Gladstone retired and, <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> the outgoing prime minister, Victoria appointed Lord Rosebery as prime minister. His government was weak, and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him. Salisbury remained prime minister {{for the remainder of}} Victoria's reign.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 the {{situation}} was further complicated when MGM/UA was sold to Qintex, which wanted to then merge with Pathé Communications; the Bond back catalogue was leased to Pathé at a lower-than-market value, <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> Danjaq – who sued MGM/UA Communications, which was itself {{the target of a}} failed takeover bid by Pathé. In August 1990 Albert Broccoli appointed his daughter Barbara Broccoli alongside Michael G. Wilson as producers at Eon, while he concentrated on matters at Danjaq. The dispute between Danjaq and MGM/UA was protracted and delayed production of Bond 17, but was finally settled in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The trivia game begins, {{with various}} {{facts about the}} {{characters}} being revealed such as Joey's space-cowboy imaginary friend (Maurice) and Rachel's actual favorite movie (Weekend at Bernie's). A nine-to-nine score leads to a lightning round. Monica raises the stakes: If the women win, Joey and Chandler must give up their birds, as the maturing Chick is crowing in the mornings and waking them up. Chandler rebuts by suggesting Rachel and Monica give up their apartment to them, which Monica agrees to <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> Rachel. The girls lose the lightning round because they cannot identify Chandler's job, and the boys win.|$|E
5000|$|Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione and Premier Mike Baird gave a {{press conference}} during the siege at 8:15pm <b>without</b> first <b>consulting</b> the negotiators. Graeme said {{he was unaware of}} the conference. (Gunman Monis might well have been aware of it.) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{uranium ore}} was {{handed over to}} the Combined Development Trust, a legal entity set up to handle the {{acquisition}} of nuclear ores and materials. Lansdale had written a legal opinion for the Manhattan Project that it was within the powers of the President of the United States to conclude such agreements with the British <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> Congress. In July 1945, Lansdale concluded an agreement with Brazil for the purchase of 3,000 tons of thorium-bearing monazite ore. For his wartime services, Lansdale was awarded the Legion of Merit and was made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} at Srebrenica, sixteen nations {{met at the}} London Conference, which began on 21 July 1995, to {{consider}} new options for Bosnia. As {{a result of the}} conference, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> civilian UN officials. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E
5|$|American missionaries were {{threatened}} with death when the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners in China. Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and, {{in cooperation with}} other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> the legislature. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military. After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China.|$|E
25|$|Cameron held, on the {{evidence}} before him, that the Navy had established in most respects that its management of the appellant's employment was substantially fair.

5|$|Churchill and Maxime Weygand, who {{had taken}} over command from Gamelin, were still {{determined}} to break the German line and extricate their forces to the south. When they communicated their intentions to King Leopold and van Overstraten on 24 May, the latter was stunned. A dangerous gap was starting to open between the British and Belgians between Ypres and Menen, which threatened {{what remained of the}} Belgian front. The Belgians could not cover it; such a move would have overstretched them. <b>Without</b> <b>consulting</b> the French or asking permission from his government, Gort immediately and decisively ordered the British 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions to plug the gap and abandon any offensive operations further south.|$|E
5|$|Commodore Hopkins {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from Congress over matters unrelated to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, {{and he had}} distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail agayn (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776). American forces were {{not strong enough to}} dislodge the British garrison there, which was also supported by British ships using Newport as a base.|$|E
5|$|Following the court-martial of {{the five}} ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within {{government}} over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured {{the government and the}} Admiralty to pardon the men. The Admiralty thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the Admiralty <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt the show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty <b>without</b> <b>consulting</b> the Board, it would undermine the Board's authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.|$|E
50|$|After {{spending}} some time in Corinth Ducetius broke the agreement and sailed back to Sicily with colonists to found Cale Acte. This angered the Acragantines, who were envious of Syracusans and accused them of releasing their common enemy <b>without</b> having <b>consulted</b> them first. They declared war on Syracuse.|$|R

50|$|The {{fall of the}} Barmakids is {{far more}} likely due to their {{behaving}} {{in a manner that}} Harun found disrespectful (such as entering his court unannounced) and making decisions in matters of state <b>without</b> first <b>consulting</b> him. Al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi succeeded Yahya the Barmakid as Harun's chief minister.|$|R
