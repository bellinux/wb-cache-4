25|$|Employer {{reactions}} to <b>whipsaw</b> strikes vary widely. In some countries which ban worker strikes, the <b>whipsaw</b> strike is illegal and employers {{are able to}} work with government law enforcement officials to end its use. In countries where the <b>whipsaw</b> strike is permitted, employers often counter this form of strike by locking out all employees who work for the employer association and using strikebreakers to provide temporary or permanent replacements.|$|E

25|$|Few {{nations have}} {{addressed}} the use of lockouts during <b>whipsaw</b> strikes, however. In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled on {{the legality of the}} practice. The question before the Court was whether a lockout during a <b>whipsaw</b> strike was an unfair labor practice (ULP) under the National Labor Relations Act and its various amendments. In NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449 ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."), 353 U.S. 87 (1957), the Court held that such a lockout was not a ULP. The high court further extended this ruling in NLRB v. Brown Food Stores, 380 U.S. 278 (1965), holding that an employer could engage in a partial lockout of its employees in advance of a <b>whipsaw</b> strike so long as the employer only utilized temporary replacements and locked out all workers (not just those who supported the union).|$|E
40|$|The authors examine {{management}} <b>whipsawing</b> {{practices in}} the European auto industry based on more than 200 interviews and a comparison of three automakers. They identify four distinct ways in which managers stage competition between plants to extract labor concessions: informal, hegemonic, coercive, and rule-based <b>whipsawing.</b> Practices at the three auto firms differed from one another and changed over time because of two factors: structural <b>whipsawing</b> capacity and management labor relations strategy. In the context of economic globalization, <b>whipsawing</b> is an effective means for managers to extract concessions, to loosen national institutional constraints, and to diffuse employment practices internationally...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] The {{focus of}} this paper is one slow-burning change in the {{organization}} of capitalism in Europe, marketization (Greer and Doellgast 2013, Hauptmeier 2011). We argue that a specific species of marketization, management <b>whipsawing,</b> is causing social dumping in the automotive sector. By management <b>whipsawing</b> we mean the staging of economic competition by large corporations with several production units in a way that extracts labor concessions by pitting local workers against each other in contests for investment and production. Multinational companies (MNC) were the first movers and developed various management <b>whipsawing</b> practices; however, the term was also used historically to describe union <b>whipsawing</b> at large national corporations with several production units (Ross 1948). Management <b>whipsawing</b> presupposes the ability to move production from one location to another, due to (for example) the standardization of production techniques, production of similar products in parallel at different locations, and unutilized production capacity...|$|R

25|$|To {{discourage}} employers {{from breaking}} {{away from the}} bargaining group, unions developed the <b>whipsaw</b> strike. In a <b>whipsaw</b> strike, the union strikes one employer (or just a few employers) in the multi-employer bargaining group. The strike is usually of a short duration (a few days or a week at most). The union strikes employer after employer. Strikes may occur one after another and may overlap, or there may be long lulls between strikes. The same employer may be struck repeatedly, with sometimes as little as 24 hours between strikes.|$|E

Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave a positive review to the song, describing it as West's best single since [...] "Stronger", writing that West [...] "rides a torrid <b>whipsaw</b> beat, {{as he takes}} on his spelunking media image, pinballing from self-aware ('I'm an asshole') to defiant ('Kiss my asshole'). The sentiment is classic Kanye, but he hasn't melted down this brilliantly in a long time." [...] Jason Lipshutz from Billboard praised the song, saying, [...] "with its stunning mix of rock-leaning production, memorable rhymes and unadulterated attitude, new single 'Power' is a pissed-off shot of adrenaline that plays upon all of the controversial rapper's strengths. Rhyming over a soulful vocal harmony and an abrasive sample of King Crimson's [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man," [...] West dismisses his doubters, takes a shot at Saturday Night Live and shrugs off his recent hiatus from hip-hop."

40|$|Financial markets {{all over}} the world {{generally}} exist in 2 conditions: trending and ranging. One of the most frustrating issues confronting market technicians daily is the critical definition when market is ranging and when the market is trending. Applying a trending algorithm to a ranging market will result in <b>whipsaws</b> that yield losses. To avoid some of these false entry signals, this research proposed to vary the moving average and standard deviation parameters to avoid some of these false entry <b>whipsaws</b> and yet capture a new trend early. Adaptive algorithm like the Adjustable Bands Z-Test-Statistics' (ABZ'), seeked to provide a solution to this issue. For the year 2008, ABZ' showed an abnormal return of 316 index points for Malaysian Kuala Lumpur Composite Index Futures (FKLI) compared with a negative return of - 562 index points for the passive buy-and-hold strategy and 690 for Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Futures (FCPO) compared with a negative return of - 1387.

50|$|You’ve {{discovered}} how changes in direction {{are the way}} the KST triggers signals, but also that moving-average crossovers offer less timely, but more reliable signals. The average to use is a simple 10-day moving average. It is possible to anticipate a moving average crossover if the KST has already turned and the price violates a trendline. The KST started to reverse to the downside before the up trendline was violated. Since either a reversal or a trading range follow a valid trendline violation, it’s evident that upside momentum has temporarily dissipated, causing the KST to cross below its moving average. Traditionally, the MACD gives buy and sell signals when it crosses above and below its exponential moving average, known as the “signal line”. This approach isn’t perfect; the ellipses on the chart highlight all the <b>whipsaws.</b> As said earlier, the KST can also give false or misleading signals, {{as you can see}} from the April 2005 buy signal. It comes close to a couple of <b>whipsaws,</b> but by and large, it’s more accurate, even though the MACD often turns faster than the KST.|$|R

2500|$|As {{the use of}} strikebreakers increased, the Supreme Court {{was forced}} to address several issues arising from the practice. One key issue was motive: Did it matter if the use of strikebreakers was {{motivated}} by anti-union animus? In Radio Officers' Union v. NLRB, 347 U.S. 17 (1954), the Supreme Court held that proof of motive was indeed required. However, no proof of motive was needed where employer conduct [...] "inherently" [...] encouraged or discouraged union membership. A second issue involved use of the <b>whipsaw</b> strike. As unionization in an industry spread, unions encouraged employers to bargain as a group. To discourage employers from breaking away from the group, unions developed the <b>whipsaw</b> strike—-in which the union would strike one employer at a time, one after another. Employer groups would counter the <b>whipsaw</b> strike by locking out all workers at all employers belonging to the group, and using strikebreakers to provide temporary or permanent replacements. The question before the Court was whether the lockout was an unfair labor practice. In NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449 ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."), 353 U.S. 87 (1957), the Court held that such a lockout was not a ULP.|$|E
2500|$|The Farmer-led NRLB {{tried to}} extend this {{reasoning}} to employer associations, but was ultimately unsuccessful.

[...] But what if these were <b>whipsaw</b> strikes? [...] The Farmer board in Buffalo Linen Supply Co. held that <b>whipsaw</b> strikes against employers in an employer association were not protected by the NLRA.

2500|$|The {{goal of a}} <b>whipsaw</b> strike may vary. [...] In some cases, {{the strike}} is {{conducted}} only against an employer the union believes is considering quitting the employer association. In other cases, the job action is conducted against a strong employer who is committed to staying in the employer group. The strike serves as an example to keep other, weaker businesses (which have a greater incentive to leave the employer group) in line. [...] Sometimes, a <b>whipsaw</b> strike {{is used as a}} bargaining tool. [...] For example, the strike may be directed at an employer or employers in the group which the union believes are holding up an agreement, or to keep employers off balance in negotiations, weaken the employer group's economic strength, and exercise the union's economic power.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>whipsaw</b> strike (also {{called a}} {{selective}} strike) is a strike by a trade union against {{only one or}} a few employers in an industry or a multi-employer association at a time.

The majority did not define the term [...] "intermittent strike" [...] in Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co. nor in two subsequent decisions upholding the ruling.

2500|$|One of {{the last}} {{national}} negotiations Fitzsimmons oversaw was another national trucking contract.

Fitzsimmons gambled and decided {{to engage in a}} series of <b>whipsaw</b> strikes in order to pressure the employers to agree to terms, but the trucking companies responded with a lockout on April 2. The Carter administration had imposed wage and price controls which sought to hold collective bargaining wage and benefit increases to 7.5 percent a year, but Fitzsimmons sought 10 percent a year. Four days into the labor dispute, layoffs in the automobile manufacturing industry reached 100,000, putting significant pressure on Fitzsimmons to lower his contract demands. The strike and lockout were a short one due to these pressures, and Fitzsimmons reached an agreement on April 11, 1979, which met the President's wage control guideline.|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court {{revisited}} the Mackay Radio ruling repeatedly {{from the}} early 1960s into the late 1980s. Many of the Court's decisions addressed {{the conditions under which}} an employer exhibited anti-union animus. In NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U.S. 221 (1963), the Court held that a grant of superseniority to strikebreakers constituted anti-union animus and was a ULP. Building on its ruling in Buffalo Linen Supply Co., the Supreme Court held in American Ship Building v. NLRB, 380 U.S. 300 (1965) that an employer may lock out its employees without violating the NLRA if a bargaining impasse has been reached and the lockout is for the purpose of applying economic pressure to support the employer’s bargaining position. However, the employer cannot hire permanent replacements, only temporary ones. The high court further extended the [...] "Mackay doctrine" [...] in NLRB v. Brown Food Stores, 380 U.S. 278 (1965), holding that an employer could lock out its employees in advance of a <b>whipsaw</b> strike so long as the employer only utilized temporary replacements and locked out all workers (not just those who supported the union). These cases did not address the partial lockout, however. The Court addressed that issue in 1967. In NLRB v. Great Dane Trailers, Inc., 388 U.S. 26 (1967), the Supreme Court held that an employer could avoid being charged with a ULP if it could provide a legitimate and substantial business justification for treating union workers differently than its other employees. However, even if the employer could offer such a justification, the NLRB could still attempt to show anti-union animus at trial.|$|E
