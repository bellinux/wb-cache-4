40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} an N-person social dilemma game created {{to study how}} climate change agreement strategies develop. The players in this game are trying to collect a target amount for a climate fund. Players fall into three categories: cooperators <b>who</b> <b>contribute</b> their fair share, altruists <b>who</b> <b>contribute</b> more than their fair share and defectors <b>who</b> <b>contribute</b> nothing. In all cases we would evolve a set of player strategies that collected the target sum (- 0 %/+ 0. 5 %). Our results indicate defection is a preferred strategy, but group-level reciprocity or non-altruistic punishment from a third party can dramatically increase levels of cooperation...|$|R
