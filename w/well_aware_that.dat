5|$|By dawn on 20 April 1941, the Germans were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> British and Allied {{forces had}} begun {{preliminary}} withdrawal operations from ports in southern Greece. The Luftwaffe made substantial attacks against these departure {{points in a}} bid to prevent or forestall an evacuation. On Sunday 20 April — Hitler's 52nd birthday — the Luftwaffe mounted mass attacks against Allied shipping in Piraeus Harbour.|$|E
5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} the Berlin Wall was an {{integral}} part of the East German state's policy towards its border system. Nonetheless, the East German government was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> border killings had undesirable consequences. The West German, US, British and French authorities protested killings when they occurred and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result. It also undermined the East German government's support at home.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 48, {{he learned}} to fly. Kesselring {{believed}} that first-hand knowledge of all aspects of aviation was crucial {{to being able to}} command airmen, although he was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> latecomers like himself did not impress the old pioneers or the young aviators. He qualified in various single and multi-engined aircraft and continued flying three or four days per week until March 1945. At times, his flight path took him over the concentration camps at Oranienburg, Dachau, and Buchenwald.|$|E

5|$|The Germans were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{breaking}} the blockade {{was very important}} for the Soviet side. However, due to the reverse at Stalingrad and the Soviet offensive at Velikiye Luki to the south of Leningrad, Army Group North was ordered to go on the defensive and was stripped of many troops. The 11th Army, which was to lead the assault on Leningrad in September 1942, and which had thwarted the last Soviet offensive, was transferred to Army Group Center in October. Nine other divisions were also reassigned to other sectors.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{expected}} that the Allies would next invade Sicily, as a landing could be made there under fighter cover from Tunisia and Malta. He reinforced the six coastal and four mobile Italian divisions there with two mobile German divisions, the 15th Panzergrenadier Division and the Hermann Göring Panzer Division, both rebuilt after being destroyed in Tunisia. Kesselring was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> while this force was large enough to stop the Allies from simply marching in, it could not withstand a large scale invasion. He therefore pinned his hopes on repelling the Allied invasion of Sicily on an immediate counterattack, which he ordered Colonel Paul Conrath of the Hermann Göring Panzer Division {{to carry out the}} moment the objective of the Allied invasion fleet was known, with or without orders from the island commander, Generale d'Armata Alfredo Guzzoni.|$|E
5|$|On the Union side, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, Grant's {{superior}} {{as commander}} of the Department of the Missouri, was also apprehensive. Halleck had authorized Grant to capture Fort Henry, but now he felt that continuing to Fort Donelson was risky. Despite Grant's success to date, Halleck had little confidence in him, considering Grant to be reckless. Halleck attempted to convince his own rival, Don Carlos Buell, to take command of the campaign to get his additional forces engaged. Despite Johnston's high regard for Buell, the Union general was as passive as Grant was aggressive. Grant never suspected his superiors were considering relieving him, but he was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> any delay or reversal might be an opportunity for Halleck to lose his nerve and cancel the operation.|$|E

5|$|The Romans were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{their victory}} was still fragile, {{and that as}} soon as the Parthian king had dealt with the Hyrcanian rebellion, he would turn his {{attention}} to Armenia. Despite Vologases' reluctance to risk an all-out conflict with Rome, in the end, he was forced to act when Tigranes raided the Parthian province of Adiabene in 61. The enraged protests of its governor Monobazus, and his pleas for protection, could not be ignored by Vologases, whose prestige and royal authority were at stake. Vologases therefore hastily concluded a treaty with the Hyrcanians so as to be free to campaign against Rome, and called an assembly of the grandees of his realm. There he publicly reaffirmed Tiridates' position as king of Armenia by crowning him with a diadem. In order to reinstall his brother on the Armenian throne, the Parthian king assembled a force of picked cavalry under Monaeses, complemented by infantry from Adiabene.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, Stalin was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> other European armies had utterly {{disintegrated}} {{when faced}} with Nazi military efficacy and responded effectively by subjecting his army to galvanising terror and nationalist appeals to patriotism.

25|$|The Spanish {{branch of}} the Habsburg royal family was noted for extreme consanguinity. <b>Well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> they owed their power to {{fortunate}} marriages, they married between themselves to protect their gains. Philip and Mariana were actually uncle and niece; therefore, Charles was not only their son, but was also Mariana's first-cousin and Philip's great-nephew.|$|E
25|$|As the {{political}} situation was chaotic, the ageing 64-year-old commander, Oberst (Colonel) Birger Eriksen, had not received any clear orders and had received no notice {{as to whether the}} approaching warships were German or Allied. He was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Norway was officially neutral, but that the government was inclined to side with the British in case of direct Norwegian involvement in the war.|$|E
25|$|The Gillender Building is {{the site}} of a final scene in Jed Rubenfeld's The Interpretation of Murder, a 2006 novel reconstructing Sigmund Freud's 1909 visit to New York.

5000|$|Clark was {{therefore}} {{considered to have}} a negative influence on youth, and was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of <b>that</b> impression held by most adults: I was roundly criticized for being in and around rock and roll music at its inception.

25|$|Rural {{parents were}} {{generally}} <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> their children had limited opportunities {{to further their}} education. Some parents saw little use in having their children attend even primary school, especially after {{the establishment of the}} agricultural responsibility system. Under that system, parents preferred that their children work to increase family income - and withdrew them from school - for both long and short periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Under the Ottomans, Palestine's Arab {{population}} mostly {{saw themselves}} as Ottoman subjects. In the 1830s however, Palestine was occupied by the Egyptian vassal of the Ottomans, Muhammad Ali and his son Ibrahim Pasha. The Palestinian Arab revolt was precipitated by popular resistance against heavy demands for conscripts, as peasants were <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> conscription {{was little more than}} a death sentence. Starting in May 1834 the rebels took many cities, among them Jerusalem, Hebron and Nablus. In response, Ibrahim Pasha sent in an army, finally defeating the last rebels on 4 August in Hebron.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese Government and {{military}} commands were, however, <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{even with this}} effort to strengthen the garrison of Goa, the Portuguese forces would never be sufficient to face a conventional attack from the Indian Armed Forces, which could easily concentrate against that territory land forces overwhelmingly stronger than the Portuguese ones, as well as air and naval forces. The Portuguese Government hoped however to politically deter the Indian government from attempting a military aggression, with the showing of a Portuguese strong will to fight and to sacrifice to defend Goa.|$|E

25|$|Although Santa Anna's {{troops had}} been {{thoroughly}} vanquished, {{they did not}} represent {{the bulk of the}} Mexican army in Texas. An additional 4,000 troops remained under the commands of Urrea and General Vicente Filisola. Texians had won the battle due to mistakes made by Santa Anna, and Houston was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> his troops would have little hope of repeating their victory against Urrea or Filisola. As darkness fell, a large group of prisoners was led into camp. Houston initially mistook the group for Mexican reinforcements and shouted out that all was lost.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy also devised and {{provided}} {{instructions on how}} to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (oikoumenè) and of the Roman provinces. In {{the second part of the}} Geographia, he provided the necessary topographic lists, and captions for the maps. His oikoumenè spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean to China, and about 81 degrees of latitude from the Arctic to the East Indies and deep into Africa. Ptolemy was <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he knew about only a quarter of the globe.|$|E
25|$|The case of BCIs {{today has}} {{parallels}} in medicine, as will its evolution. Much as pharmaceutical science {{began as a}} balance for impairments and is now used to increase focus and reduce need for sleep, BCIs will likely transform gradually from therapies to enhancements. Researchers are <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> sound ethical guidelines, appropriately moderated enthusiasm in media coverage and education about BCI systems will be of utmost importance for the societal acceptance of this technology. Thus, recently more effort is made inside the BCI community to create consensus on ethical guidelines for BCI research, development and dissemination.|$|E
60|$|In some {{perturbation}} Halbert Glendinning gave {{an account}} of the circumstances which had accompanied the preacher's imprisonment. When he came to the discussion of the handfasting engagement, he was struck with the ominous and displeased expression of Murray's brows, and, contrary to all prudential and politic rule, seeing something was wrong, yet not <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> what <b>that</b> something was, had almost stopped short in his narrative.|$|R
