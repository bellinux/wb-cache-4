500|$|Ben Gascoigne's parents met and [...] {{married in}} Levin, New Zealand, {{just before the}} First World War. They soon moved to Napier, where Gascoigne was born in 1915. He {{attended}} Auckland Grammar School, and won a scholarship to Auckland University College (now the University of Auckland) a year before he was due to finish high school. Faced with a choice between studying history or the sciences, he chose the latter {{because he had a}} severe stammer and thought that it would be less of an impediment. He completed both a Bachelor's degree and a Master's qualification in science, securing Honours in both mathematics and physics, finishing his studies in 1937. Despite these achievements, he did not consider himself to be practically trained, saying: [...] "I was still very much a theorist, with no practical physics at all. The professor in Auckland used to wince <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> past the cupboard in which the good instruments were kept!" ...|$|E
500|$|McGovern {{enrolled}} at small Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell {{and became a}} star student there. He supplemented a forensic scholarship by working a variety of odd jobs. With World War II underway overseas and feeling insecure about his own courage, McGovern took flying lessons in an Aeronca aircraft and received a pilot's license through the government's Civilian Pilot Training Program. McGovern recalled: [...] "Frankly, I {{was scared to death}} on that first solo flight. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> away from it, I had an enormous feeling of satisfaction that I had taken the thing off the ground and landed it without tearing the wings off." [...] In late 1940 or early 1941, McGovern had a brief affair with an acquaintance that resulted in her giving birth to a daughter during 1941, although this did not become public knowledge during his lifetime. In April 1941, McGovern began dating fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg, who had grown up in Woonsocket, South Dakota. They had first encountered each other during a high school debate in which Eleanor and her twin sister Ila defeated McGovern and his partner.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

He decides everything. He decided every lens. Every prop. Everything. It's all him." [...] Winslet adds that [...] "Roman {{is one of the}} most extraordinary men I've ever met. The guy is 77 years old. He has an effervescent quality to him. He's very joyful about his work, which is infectious. He likes to have a small crew, to the point that, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> on the set, my thought was, 'My God, this is it?'” Also noting that style of directing, New York Film Festival director Richard Pena, during the American premiere of the film, called Polanski [...] "a poet of small spaces... in just a couple of rooms he can conjure up an entire world, an entire society." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> {{in the door and}} I heard them playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{caused an}} uproar in the {{community}} it portrayed; it {{was taken off the}} shelves of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore — New York's only gay bookstore - and Kramer was banned from the grocery store near his home on Fire Island. Reviewers found it difficult to believe that Kramer's accounts of gay relationships were accurate; both the gay and mainstream press panned the book. On the reception of the novel Kramer says, [...] "The straight world thought I was repulsive, and the gay world treated me like a traitor. People would literally turn their back <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> by. You know what my real crime was? I put the truth in writing. That's what I do: I have told the fucking truth to everyone I have ever met." [...] Faggots, however, became one of the best-selling gay novels of all time. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126174240/http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/bio.cfm?LeaderID=25 |archivedate=November 26, 2006 }} ...|$|E
2500|$|Charlie Jane Anders in {{the review}} by io9 criticized [...] "the personality-free hero, the {{nonsensical}} plot twists, the CG clutter, the bland romance, the new-age pablum...", concluding that [...] "Shyamalan's true achievement in this film is that he takes a thrilling cult TV series, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and he systematically leeches all the personality and soul out of it — {{in order to create}} something generic enough to serve as a universal spoof of every epic, ever." [...] Anders summarized the experience of watching the film by stating that, [...] "Actually, my exact words <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> out of this film were, 'Wow, this makes Dragonball Evolution look like a masterpiece.'" [...] Ain't It Cool News' review questioned why Shyamalan was allowed to write the script, as well as why he was even chosen to direct such a high-profile film after a string of previous flops: [...] "Burdened by [...] never-ending onslaught of expository dialogue awkwardly delivered by actors giving career-worst performances across the board, The Last Airbender is so outrageously bad it's a wonder it ever got before cameras." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, the West Indies won {{the match}} and {{levelled}} the series. In the decider in Jamaica, Waugh took 2/14 in the West Indies' first innings of 265 and then {{arrived at the}} crease with Australia at 73 for three in reply. [...] He compiled a long partnership of 231 runs with his brother Mark, who was eventually out for 126. [...] Waugh was the last man to go, out for 200 after nine hours of batting. [...] "Steve had {{made up his mind}} to bat and bat", wrote Paul Reiffel, [...] "to stay out there and anchor the proceedings. [...] e copped a lot of blows on his arms, chest and ribs.

2500|$|Vaughan owed {{his guitar}} {{technique}} {{in large part}} to Lonnie Mack. Vaughan said, [...] "I got a lot of my fast stuff from Lonnie" [...] and observed in live performance that Mack was [...] "ahead of his time". In 1987, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. Mack recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978: [...] "We was in Texas looking for pickers, and we went out to see the Thunderbirds. Jimmie was saying, 'Man, you gotta hear my little brother. He plays all your [...]' He was playing a little place called the Rome Inn, and we went over there and checked him out. As it would be, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> in the door, he was playing 'Wham!' And I said, 'Dadgum.' He was playing it right. I'd been playing it wrong {{for a long time and}} needed to go back and listen to my original record. That was in '78, I believe." [...] Vaughan owed part of his enduring style—especially his use of tremolo picking and vibrato—to Mack. He acknowledged that Mack taught him to [...] "play guitar from the heart". Vaughan's relationship with another Texas blues legend, Johnny Winter, was a little more complex. Although they met several times, and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material, as in the case of Boot Hill, Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography, [...] "Raisin' Cain", Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. [...] "We even played together over at Tommy Shannon's house one time." [...] Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a Blues Festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill, explaining that he has been misquoted and that [...] "Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him". [...] Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that [...] "mine's a little bit rawer, I think." ...|$|E
