60|$|Tommy obeyed gingerly, {{and then}} Pym gaped, {{for what the}} open door {{revealed}} to him was a tiny roped box with a girl of twelve sitting on it. She was dressed in some dull-coloured <b>wincey,</b> and looked cold and patient and lonely, and as she saw the big man staring at her she struggled in alarm to her feet, and could scarce stand on them. Tommy was looking apprehensively from her to Pym.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{came running}} in presently, her face {{sparkling}} with {{the delight of}} her orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in the unexpected presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside the door. She certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short tight <b>wincey</b> dress she had worn from the asylum, below which her thin legs seemed ungracefully long. Her freckles were more numerous and obtrusive than ever; the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into over-brilliant disorder; it had never looked redder than at that moment.|$|E
50|$|Although {{well known}} for her TV-am weather {{forecasts}} she is most proud of {{her work as a}} writer and as presenter of television programmes about animals, notably Animal Watch on TV-am and the Granada TV series <b>Wincey's</b> Pets. She appeared on BBC Celebrity Eggheads on 12 December 2011.|$|R
50|$|Union Mill - Cotton weaving mill, built 1867 by Skipton Land and Building Company, run by Skipton Mill Co Ltd., {{designed}} by J. Whitehead of Nelson. 800 looms manufacturing <b>winceys,</b> stripes and checks. Steam-powered, one-storey shed with attached warehouse. Extension added 1872, dyehouse added 1875. Union Mill {{is now a}} housing development.|$|R
50|$|Firth Shed - Built 1877, by Samuel Farey, housing 300 looms. Extended in 1906 to {{add another}} 200 looms. Manufactured dyed cotton goods and <b>winceys.</b> Farey {{did not make it}} through the slump of the 1920s, and sold up to Nutter Ltd of Nelson. Weaving stopped in 1970, and Firth Shed now houses Merrit and Fryer's, the builders' merchants and timber yard.|$|R
6000|$|The green {{dress was}} made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as Emily's taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew's and Marilla's benefit, and recited [...] "The Maiden's Vow" [...] {{for them in the}} kitchen. As Marilla watched the bright, {{animated}} face and graceful motions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green Gables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child in her preposterous yellowish-brown <b>wincey</b> dress, the heartbreak looking out of her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to Marilla's own eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pretty!" [...] Marilla sniffed. [...] "I didn't trouble my {{head about}} getting pretty dresses for you. I don't believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I'll {{tell you that}} right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, {{serviceable}} dresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they're all you'll get this summer. The brown gingham and the blue print will do you for school {{when you begin to}} go. The sateen is for church and Sunday school. I'll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear them. I should think you'd be grateful to get most anything after those skimpy <b>wincey</b> things you've been wearing." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} {{watching}} him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now. Matthew was not looking at her {{and would not have}} seen what she was really like if he had been, but an ordinary observer would have seen this: A child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very tight, very ugly dress of yellowish-gray <b>wincey.</b> She wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{feel like}} Byron's 'Childe Harold'--only it isn't really my 'native shore' that I'm watching," [...] said Anne, winking her gray eyes vigorously. [...] "Nova Scotia is that, I suppose. But one's native shore {{is the land}} one loves the best, and that's good old P.E.I. for me. I can't believe I didn't always live here. Those eleven years before I came seem like a bad dream. It's seven years since I crossed on this boat--the evening Mrs. Spencer brought me over from Hopetown. I can see myself, in that dreadful old <b>wincey</b> dress and faded sailor hat, {{exploring}} decks and cabins with enraptured curiosity. It was a fine evening; and how those red Island shores did gleam in the sunshine. Now I'm crossing the strait again. Oh, Gilbert, I do hope I'll like Redmond and Kingsport, but I'm sure I won't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Anne, {{left alone}} in her glory, worked with a will. The floor was swept, the beds made, the hens fed, the muslin dress washed and hung out on the line. Then Anne {{prepared}} for the transfer of feathers. She mounted to the garret and donned the first old dress that came to hand [...] . a navy blue cashmere she had worn at fourteen. It was decidedly on the short side and as [...] "skimpy" [...] as the notable <b>wincey</b> Anne had worn upon the occasion of her debut at Green Gables; {{but at least it}} would not be materially injured by down and feathers. Anne completed her toilet by tying a big red and white spotted handkerchief that had belonged to Matthew over her head, and, thus accoutred, betook herself to the kitchen chamber, whither Marilla, before her departure, had helped her carry the feather bed.|$|E
60|$|When Tommy, with Elspeth and Grizel, set off excitedly for the town, {{the country}} folk were already {{swarming}} in. The Monypenny road {{was thick with}} them, braw loons in blue bonnets with red bobs to them, tartan waistcoats, scarves of every color, woollen shirts as gay, and the strutting wearers in two minds--whether {{to take off the}} scarf to display the shirt, or hide the shirt and trust to the scarf. Came lassies, too, in <b>wincey</b> bodices they were like to burst through, and they were listening apprehensively as they ploughed onward for a tearing at the seams. There were red-headed lasses, yellow-chy-headed and black-headed, blue-shawled and red-shawled lasses; boots on every one of them, stockings almost as common, the skirt kilted up for the present, but down it should go when they were in the thick of things, and then it must take care of itself. All were solemn and sheepish as yet, but wait a bit.|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR ESTHER,--I {{send you}} these few scrapes {{to let you}} see I have not forgot you, though my way is now grand by yours. A spleet new black silk, Esther, being the second in a twelvemonth, as I'm a living woman. The other is no none tashed yet, but my gudeman fair insisted on buying a new one, for says he 'Rich folk like as {{can afford to be}} mislaird, and nothing's ower braw for my bonny Jean.' Tell Aaron Latta that. When I'm sailing in my silks, Esther, I {{sometimes}} picture you turning your <b>wincey</b> again, for I'se uphaud that's all the new frock you've ha'en the year. I dinna {{want to give you a}} scunner of your man, Esther, more by token they said if your mither had not took him in hand you would never have kent the color of his nightcap, but when you are wraxing ower your kail-pot in a plot of heat, just picture me ringing the bell for my servant, and saying, with a wave of my hand, 'Servant, lay the dinner.' And ony bonny afternoon when your man is cleaning out stables and you're at the tub in a short gown, picture my man taking me and the children out a ride in a carriage, and I sair doubt your bairns was never in nothing more genteel than a coal cart. For bairns is yours, Esther, and children is mine, and that's a burn without a brig till't.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, a bride, of course--a bride all {{in white}} with a lovely misty veil. I've never seen one, but I {{can imagine what}} she would look like. I don't ever expect to be a bride myself. I'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me--unless {{it might be a}} foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular. But I do hope that some day I shall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I just love pretty clothes. And I've never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember--but of course it's all the more to look forward to, isn't it? And then I can imagine that I'm dressed gorgeously. This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old <b>wincey</b> dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know. A {{merchant}} in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of <b>wincey</b> to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn't sell it, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn't you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you ARE imagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and boots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my might. I wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither was Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn't time to get sick, watching to see that I didn't fall overboard. She said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from being seasick it's a mercy I did prowl, isn't it? And I wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn't know whether I'd ever have another opportunity. Oh, {{there are a lot more}} cherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I just love it already, and I'm so glad I'm going to live here. I've always heard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world, and I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I would. It's delightful when your imaginations come true, isn't it? But those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand already. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about things if you don't ask questions? And what DOES make the roads red?" ...|$|E
60|$|By early morn {{on their}} Fast Day the Tilliedrummers were straggling into Thrums, and the weavers, already at their looms, read the {{clattering}} of feet and carts aright. To convince themselves, {{all they had}} to do was to raise their eyes; but the first triumph would have been to Tilliedrum if they had done that. The invaders--the men in Aberdeen blue serge coats, velvet knee-breeches, and broad blue bonnets, and the <b>wincey</b> gowns of the women set off with hooded cloaks of red or tartan--tapped at the windows and shouted insultingly as they passed; but, with pursed lips, Thrums bent fiercely over its wobs, and not an Auld Licht showed outside his door. The day wore on to noon, and still ribaldry was master of the wynds. But there was a change inside the houses. The minister had pulled down his blinds; moody men had left their looms for stools by the fire; there were rumours of a conflict in Andra Gowrie's close, from which Kitty McQueen had emerged with her short gown in rags; and Lang Tammas was going from door to door. The austere precentor admonished fiery youth to beware of giving way to passion; and it was a proud day for the Auld Lichts to find their leading elder so conversant with apt Scripture texts. They bowed their heads reverently while he thundered forth that those who lived by the sword would perish by the sword; and when he had finished they took him ben to inspect their bludgeons. I have a vivid recollection of going the round of the Auld Licht and other houses to see the sticks and the wrists in coils of wire.|$|E

50|$|As {{a planned}} community, {{the village was}} built on a grid pattern around a central square and had a mix of single storey thatched, stone-built houses {{fronting}} onto the streets (to prevent people having their middens on show) with long gardens intended to provide the inhabitants with a seasonal supply of food. Alexander Gordon envisaged a thriving industrial village and built a small linen factory in Back Street (now North Street) which produced fine linen table-cloths and <b>wincey</b> using flax from Auchintoul Moss. By the late 19th century, wealthier inhabitants had built some grander houses {{and there was a}} selection of religious establishments throughout the town catering to various denominations in addition to the Church of Scotland and Free Church buildings.|$|E
5000|$|Archaeological digs {{conducted}} in the 19th century {{have shown that the}} area was inhabited during the Bronze Age. A crannog with a connecting causeway was discovered in Kilbirnie Loch. The town derived its name from the parish church, the [...] "Auld Kirk". In 1740 there were only three houses; the population grew to 959 people by 1801. Half a century later, and the town had grown substantially. In 1851 Kilbirnie contained 5,484 people, due to the Industrial Revolution, hastened by the locality of the Ayr and Glasgow railways. During this time the town was a hub of industrial activity with 2 flax-spinning mills, linen-thread mills, <b>wincey</b> factories, 5 fishing-net factories, 2 rope-works, engineering works, mines and ironworks. The steelworks opened in 1841 and quickly became the main industry in the area causing an inpouring of people and during the early to mid 20th Century the town grew to its height of around 10,000 people. However, the industry entered a decline and was eventually closed. The Decoy Bride a film starring David Tennant and Kelly Macdonald was partially filmed in Kilbirnie.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} version, the presenter was former BBC newsreader Kenneth Kendall and the [...] "skyrunner" [...] was broadcaster Anneka Rice. In the first series, Kendall was joined {{briefly in the}} studio for the handover of the first clue by {{the original}} clue-setter, Ann Meo. She would later rejoin the contestants {{if they had been}} successful in finding the treasure to offer her congratulations. If they had been unsuccessful, she would be heard as a voiceover explaining where they had gone wrong. From the second series onwards, this role was expanded, another studio-based person acted as adjudicator, giving the contestants tips on how they were doing against the scheduled time, and providing additional information about the locations visited. In series 2, this was Annette Lynton ("Nettie") and from series 3 onwards, TV-am weather girl <b>Wincey</b> Willis. In 1988, Rice left to have a baby, and her place was taken by tennis player Annabel Croft. In this series, the set was revamped due to a move to Thames Television's facilities (the original studios were at Trilion in Soho, London, and then Limehouse Studios on Canary Wharf in Docklands, East London which was later earmarked for demolition to make way for One Canada Square), and Willis was promoted to sharing main billing with Kendall. Croft was billed as [...] "Guest Skyrunner" [...] for the first episode of the series, and it was stated at the time that Rice would return after giving birth, {{but it turned out to}} be the show's final series and the [...] "Guest Skyrunner" [...] credit was dropped.|$|E
