Incidence of Fusarium <b>wilt</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 08 to 100 %, {{with an average of}} 23. 99 ± 14. 41 %. Seven VCGs of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) were initially identified, namely VCG 0120 - 0120 / 15, 01213 / 16, 01218, 0123, 0124 / 5 and 0126. One third of the total isolates was identified to be Foc tropical race 4 (TR 4) VCG 01213 / 16, which is distributed widely in almost all provinces, infecting local cultivars 'Barangan' (AAA), 'Raja' (AAB) and 'Ambon Hijau' (AAA), as well as other cultivars of different ploidies and genomes. Besides mismanagement by banana farmers, the wide distribution of the disease {{may be due to the}} movement of planting materials along with transmigration of people from Java to other islands...|$|R
40|$|The seed {{transmission}} of Verticillium dahliae was evaluated in lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Seed collected from lettuce plants infected with V. dahliae were plated {{with or without}} surface sterilization on Sorenson's modified NP 10 medium. Of the seed plated with or without surface sterilization, 90 and 66 %, respectively, yielded colonies of V. dahliae. The incidence of Verticillium <b>wilt</b> <b>ranged</b> from 55 to 80 % among lettuce plants grown from seed harvested from infected plants. All evaluated isolates of V. dahliae were capable of seed transmission in lettuce. A V. tricorpus isolate failed to cause significant disease in lettuce or to become seedborne. Storage of contaminated seed at seven temperatures ranging from - 20 to 15 degreesC for up to 72 weeks did not {{reduce the incidence of}} V. dahliae in seed, whereas storage at room temperature (23 +/- 2 degreesC) for 20 to 52 weeks reduced the incidence of V. dahliae without affecting seed viability. Of the 11 weed species collected from fields with a known history of Verticillium wilt of lettuce, four yielded V. dahliae. Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that isolates of V. dahliae from Sonchus oleraceus, Capsella bursa-pastoris, and Solanum sarrachoides were as virulent as or more virulent than an isolate of V. dahliae from lettuce. These results demonstrate the potential of seedborne and weedbome inoculum to disseminate V. dahliae...|$|R

At first affected plants showed collapse of the growing apex. Stunted lateral shoots emerged but then wilted and died while adventitious roots appeared on the stems. Cross sections of stems showed brown discoloration of the vascular tissue and oozed a dirty white exudate.

30|$|In vitro {{data were}} only {{reported}} by Regan (2000) and Juárez Reyes et al. (2009). Regan (2000) {{reported that in}} northern Australia bale silage was prepared from wilted pasture with pangola grass (Digitaria eriantha subsp. eriantha) and two legumes, namely cavalcade centurion (Centrosema pascuorum) and wynn cassia (Chamaecrista rotundifolia). The DM content of the silages made from the <b>wilted</b> plants <b>ranged</b> from 42 – 57 %, the in vitro digestibility from 55.0 - 58.0 % and the estimated metabolizable energy concentration from 8.5 - 9.0  MJ/kg DM. Juárez Reyes et al. (2009) reported higher in vitro gas production (P[*]<[*] 0.05) for pangola grass, compared with 30 % less gas in other grasses (Guinea, Bermuda and Tanzania grasses). They also reported greater (P[*]<[*] 0.05) in vitro gas production and insoluble but slowly degradable (b) fraction of pangola grass, as well as lower b fraction in Guinea and Bermuda grasses.|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} of soil water depletion by Eucalyptus spp. were surveyed {{to assess the}} potential of tree belts and short rotation phase farming with trees for groundwater recharge reduction and salinity control. Soils were sampled to depths of up to 10 m in transects perpendicular to 4 - to 7 -year-old mallee eucalypt belts (Eucalyptus horistes, E. kochii ssp. plenissima, E. loxophleba ssp. lissophloia, E. polybractea) and in a 4 year-old block of E. astringens. Results indicate that the eucalypt species can exploit soil water to depths of at least 8 - 10 m within 7 years of planting. The root systems of these eucalypts were able to penetrate clayey subsoils with bulk densities of up to 2. 0 g cm- 3. Leaf area indexes of tree belts were 2 - 10 times greater than those predicted for natural vegetation, probably {{as a result of}} exploiting a greater amount of soil water stored under the agricultural system. The lateral influence of mallee belts, as indicated by soil water contents that were depleted to <b>wilting</b> point, <b>ranged</b> from 15 - 42 m. The resulting dry soil zone provided an effective barrier to groundwater recharge by incident rainfall thereby lessening the risk of salinisation in the agricultural landscape. The width of this barrier to recharge was predicted to range from 7 m to 54 m based on leaf area...|$|R
40|$|Disease {{incidence}} of Stewart’s wilt on the seed and response of several maize varieties to Pantoea stewartii subp. stewartii. Stewart’s wilt disease of maize {{is caused by}} Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii.   This bacterium is seed-borne pathogens, when attacked maize caused yield lost 40 - 100 %.   The objective {{of this research was}} to detemine the incidence level of stewart’s wilt disease, growth of some varieties of maize and their response to stewart’s wilt pathogens Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii.   The research was conducted in the Laboratory of Bacteriology and Greenhouse Cikabayan IPB from November 2011 to March 2012. In experiment I, nineteen samples of maize were used for symptom test  in the maize seedling stage, using Randomized Block Design with three replications. Experiment II used a Randomized Block Design with 2 factors: maize varieties (8 hybrids varieties, 3 open pollinated varieties, and 7 sweet corn varieties) and bacteria isolates  (BGR 2, BGR 4, BGR 28, BGR 7 and PSM 27), with three replications. The results showed in experiment I, the {{incidence of}} stewart’s <b>wilt</b> disease <b>ranged</b> 2. 00 – 15. 33 %, germination and vigor index of maize seed were 68. 00 – 95. 33 % and 55. 33 – 90. 67 % respectively.   While in experiment II, hybrid and open pollinated of maize varieties were resistant to moderately susceptible   while all sweet corn varieties were susceptible to infection of Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii...|$|R
40|$|Verticillium {{wilt disease}} causes {{significant}} losses to cotton yield and varietal development for resistance {{is critical in}} combating this threat. A study was carried out to determine the underlying genetic pattern controlling disease tolerance and identify suitable parental lines to use in varietal tolerance development. Five cotton varieties were crossed in a half diallel mating system to produce ten crosses and five selfed parental lines which were screened against Verticillium wilt by artificial inoculation. There were significant variations on the severity scores, vascular brown index scores, morphological and agronomical traits under Verticillium wilt pressure. The Verticillium <b>wilt</b> severity scores <b>ranged</b> from 1. 22 to 3. 07 and VBI scores from 0. 78 to 2. 77. The mean squares of general combining ability (GCA) for the various characteristics of the parents were significant and specific combining ability (SCA) of vascular brown index score. Three parental lines were identified as breeding material with good GCA, morphological and agronomical performance which were CRI-MS- 1, SZ 9314 and BC 853. This study imply that varietal tolerance can be developed by incorporating genotypes with resistance genes in breeding programmes. Future work should focus on developing resistant varieties suitable for production in Verticillium wilt prone areas...|$|R
40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportThe primary {{goals of}} this project were to {{evaluate}} powdery mildew resistant (PMR) pumpkins and {{to determine if there}} is a benefit of applying fungicides to PMR pumpkins. Through this project, resistant varieties of pumpkin were shown to be an effective way to manage powdery mildew; however, challenges were also revealed. Two powdery mildew resistant (PMR) varieties were commercially available when this study was conducted. Magic Lantern was shown to be less resistant than an experimental pumpkin line being developed by Harris Moran (HMX 6687) or a Cornell line (98 - 714). There was a benefit to applying fungicides to Magic Lantern. An integrated program was highly effective: there was significantly less powdery mildew on PMR Magic Lantern receiving a 14 -day fungicide program than on susceptible Wizard receiving a 7 -day fungicide program. The other PMR variety, Merlin, was found to be very susceptible to bacterial <b>wilt.</b> A <b>range</b> in susceptibility was also detected among PMR muskmelons. Both race 1 and 2, but not race 3, were present based on powdery mildew occurrence on differential genotypes. Some PMR muskmelons with resistance to both race 1 and 2 (Starfire and HMX 7607) had significantly less powdery mildew than PMR muskmelons with resistance only to race 1 (Eclipse and HMX 7606). Apollo, which has resistance to both races, had a similar amount of mildew as Eclipse. Applying fungicides to Eclipse and to Apollo improved control. The 7 -day program was more effective than the 14 -day program when compared using Eclipse. Other diseases, which are controlled by fungicides used for powdery mildew, can become a problem when resistant varieties are used alone to control powdery mildew. Anthracnose was a much greater problem in nontreated than fungicide-treated plots in the muskmelon experiment. Also, PMR varieties may be more susceptible to other diseases than other varieties. PMR pumpkin Merlin had a higher incidence of bacterial wilt than susceptible pumpkin Harvest Moon (90 % vs 3 % on 25 Aug) in another IPM-funded project. It was not possible to investigate the possibility that PMR pumpkins and squashes, like PMR muskmelons, respond differentially to the races of the powdery mildew fungus.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{challenge facing}} the turf industry is increasingly limited water supplies. Identifying cultivars that use less water while maintaining acceptable quality may mitigate irrigation demands. Our objectives were to identify Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) (KBG) cultivars and phenotypic groups that maintained better visual quality with less water. Thirty bluegrass selections were evaluated in a 2 -yr field study under a rainout shelter near Manhattan, KS. Irrigation (2. 5 cm) was applied when > 50 % of a plot exhibited visible wilt symptoms. Visual quality was rated daily. Average irrigation applications ranged widely from 23. 3 cm (mean = 2. 2 mm d[superscript]− 1) in Bedazzled to 44. 9 cm (mean = 4. 2 mm d[superscript]− 1) in Kenblue, and days to <b>wilt</b> between irrigations <b>ranged</b> from 6. 4 d in Kenblue to 13. 1 d in Cabernet. Visual quality averaged at or slightly below 6. 0, defined as “minimally acceptable,” {{but this may}} be adequate when water conservation is a priority and some dormancy is tolerable; irrigation at < 50 % wilt is recommended for improved quality. Based on statistical range tests, 15 of the 30 cultivars were grouped as both receiving the least water and having the greatest visual quality. Overall, the Compact America and Mid-Atlantic KBG groups exhibited the greatest days to wilt and received the least water. Results suggest that Compact America and Mid-Atlantic phenotypes have the greatest potential for integrating reduced water inputs with maintenance of acceptable visual quality...|$|R
40|$|Verticillium dahliae is a fungal {{pathogen}} causing Verticillium <b>wilt</b> on a <b>range</b> of economically important crops. Microsclerotia are {{its main}} survival and dormancy structures {{and serve as}} the primary inoculum on many hosts. Studies were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of temperature (5 to 50 °C), pH (2 to 12) and nutrient regimes on microsclerotia germination. The optimal condition for microsclerotium germination was 20 °C with pH 8. 0 whereas nutrient regimes had no significant effect on its germination. The whole genome wide expression profiles during microsclerotium germination were characterized using the Illumina sequencing technology. Approximately 7. 4 million of 21 -nt cDNA tags were sequenced in the cDNA libraries derived from germinated and non-germinated microsclerotia. About 3. 9 % and 2. 3 % of the unique tags were up-regulated and down-regulated at least five-fold, respectively, in the germinated microsclerotia compared with the non-germinated microsclerotia. A total of 1654 genes showing differential expression were identified. Genes that are likely to have played important roles in microsclerotium germination include those encoding G-protein coupled receptor, lipase/esterase, cyclopentanone 1, 2 -monooxygenase, H(+) /hexose cotransporter 1, fungal Zn(2) -Cys(6) binuclear cluster domain, thymus-specific serine protease, glucan 1, 3 -beta-glucosidase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. These genes were mainly up-regulated or down-regulated only in germinated microsclerotia, compared with non-germinated microsclerotia. The differential expression of genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis of 20 randomly selected genes from the 40 most differentially expressed genes...|$|R
40|$|Diseases and {{sensitivity}} to P 450 -metabolized herbicides can limit the production of high quality sweet corn. Separate studies were done to determine the probability of exceeding 1 % and 5 % incidence of Stewart’s wilt on sweet corn with different reactions to Pantoea stewartii, the effect of maize dwarf mosaic (MDM) on eight foliar diseases, {{and the effect of}} hybrid CYP genotype on sweet corn yield following postemergence applications of mesotrione or nicosulfuron. Stewart’s disease can be forecasted using the Stevens, Stevens-Boewe, or Iowa State forecasts. These forecasts assume a high degree of host susceptibility. Host resistance affects the incidence and severity of disease, and therefore can affect the accuracy forecasts of Stewart’s disease. Levels of host resistance affected the incidence of systemic seedling <b>wilt</b> within <b>ranges</b> of winter temperatures used by each of the forecasts. Frequency distributions of Stewart’s wilt incidence on moderate and resistant hybrids did not differ among the three temperature ranges above - 2. 8 ºC (27 ºF). Conversely, distributions of Stewart’s wilt incidence on susceptible hybrids differed among each of the four ranges of winter temperature from the Stevens-Boewe forecast (i. e., > 0. 6 ºC, - 1. 1 º to 0. 6 ºC, - 2. 8 º to - 1. 1 ºC, and <- 2. 8 ºC). The probability of exceeding the 1 % and 5 % incidence thresholds that warrant the use of seed treatment insecticides also differed among hybrids with susceptible, moderate, or resistant reactions to Stewart’s wilt. The probability of exceeding 1 % incidence of systemic Stewart’s wilt was greater than 0. 5 on moderately susceptible to susceptible sweet corn hybrids when mean winter temperature was above - 2. 8 ºC (27 ºF). When mean winter temperature was below - 2. 8 ºC (27 ºF), using a seed treatment insecticide on moderate and resistant hybrids for Stewart’s wilt control was not economical because the probability of exceeding 1 % incidence of systemic Stewart’s wilt was about 0. 04. The probability of exceeding 5 % incidence was less than 0. 1 except when the mean winter temperature was above - 2. 8 ºC (27 ºF) and a moderately susceptible to susceptible hybrid was grown. A separate study also was done to evaluate the effect of MDM on eight foliar diseases of sweet corn. MDM-infection substantially increased the severity of five diseases including: southern corn leaf blight (SCLB), northern corn leaf spot (NCLS), gray leaf spot (GLS), Diplodia leaf streak (DLS), and eyespot. Among MDM-susceptible hybrids, mean severity ratings of SCLB, NCLS, GLS, DLS, and eyespot on MDM-infected plants typically were double those of virus-free plants. Three diseases not substantially increased by MDM-infection included: common rust, northern corn leaf blight, and Stewart’s wilt. MDM-infection appears to affect the severity of diseases caused by necrotrophic foliar fungi that colonize mesophyll tissue. MDM-infection did not appear to substantially affect diseases caused by pathogens which form haustoria or invade the vascular system. The extent to which SCLB severity is increased by MDM in terms of changes in level of host resistance also was determined. For MDM-susceptible hybrids, reactions to SCLB ranged from resistant to moderately-susceptible in virus-free treatments, but each of these hybrids was classified as moderately susceptible to susceptible when infected with MDM. Reactions to SCLB did not differ appreciably among viral treatments for MDM-resistant hybrids, ranging from moderately-resistant to moderately-susceptible. An additional study was done to determine if hybrid genotype at a major cytochrome P 450 (CYP) locus on chromosome 5 S affected yield following postemergence applications of mesotrione (HPPD-inhibiting herbicide) or nicosulfuron (ALS-inhibiting herbicide) at two growth stages. Yield of hybrids with two mutant cyp alleles (i. e., cypcyp) was reduced by applications of mesotrione. These hybrids were not evaluated for nicosulfuron because ALS-inhibiting herbicides kill these hybrids. Yield of hybrids heterozygous for mutant and functional CYP alleles (i. e., CYPcyp) were reduced by nicosulfuron but unaffected by mesotrione. Yield of hybrids with two functional CYP alleles (i. e., CYPCYP) were unaffected by mesotrione or nicosulfuron. Results of this experiment demonstrate that the genetic condition of hybrids at the CYP locus on chromosome 5 S affects the yield of sweet corn following application of mesotrione or nicosulfuron at the V 3 to V 5 or the V 5 to V 7 growth stages...|$|R
