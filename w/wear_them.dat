5|$|The United States Transportation Security Administration {{recommends}} {{that women do}} not wear underwire bras because they can set off metal detectors. Though most women travelers <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> without any problem, it can depend on the material of the underwire.|$|E
5|$|The use of crests {{was once}} {{restricted}} {{to those of}} 'tournament rank', i.e. knights and above, but in modern times nearly all personal arms include crests. They are not generally used by women (with the exception of reigning queens) and clergymen, as they {{did not participate in}} war or tournaments and thus would not have helms on which to <b>wear</b> <b>them.</b> Some heraldists are also of the opinion that crests, as personal devices, are not suited for use by corporate bodies, but this is not widely observed.|$|E

50|$|Journade (France) or Giornea (Italy) is a sideless overgown or tabard. It {{was usually}} pleated and was worn hanging loose or belted. Young men <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> short and older men <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> calf- or ankle-length.|$|R

5|$|Fans may wear a full {{or partial}} fursuit or other costume {{to express their}} {{identity}} and entertain others, though typically less than 15% of attendees bring a costume, and few of these <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> all the time. Others may wear accessories such as ears or a tail, particularly outside the main convention area. Nearly all will wear one or more custom convention badges featuring a depiction of their anthropomorphic persona, some with attached ribbons providing an indicator of social status, such as a notice of affiliation, or sponsorship of the convention. Sales of such accessories form {{a part of the}} commerce at furry conventions.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1968, North Stars' rookie Bill Masterton {{became the}} first, and to date, only player to die {{as a result}} of {{injuries}} suffered during an NHL game. Early in a game against Oakland, Masterton was checked hard by two players causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head. Masterton was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries, and died there two days later. The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy later in the season. Following Masterton's death, players slowly began wearing helmets, and starting in the 1979â€“80 season, the league mandated all players entering the league <b>wear</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E
50|$|A sideless overgown or tabard, {{called a}} giornea in Italy and a journade in France, was popular. It was usually pleated and was worn hanging loose or belted. Young men <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> short and older men <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> calf- or ankle-length.|$|R
50|$|Workers <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> at work {{to protect}} their hair from dirt. Farmers used them to see off the weather and dirt. Soviet labour units of the 1930s and 1940s <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> as part of there uniform (where uniforms were available).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, I remember, old lady. But we hadn't tried {{what it was}} to {{have the}} rest then. Our new shoes had come home, but we hadn't put <b>'em</b> on. We're <b>wearing</b> <b>'em</b> now, we're <b>wearing</b> <b>'em,</b> and must step out accordingly.' ...|$|R
5|$|In essence, the lbw law {{remained}} the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery {{was not an easy}} one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.|$|E

50|$|Boots {{of speed}} are a {{frequent}} item in role-playing games and roguelikes. In the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, boots of speed are {{a variation of}} the famous magical boots. They enable the person <b>wearing</b> <b>them</b> to run very fast. In most cases, as fast as a galloping horse, or bit slower if the person <b>wearing</b> <b>them</b> is slow to move around. The person <b>wearing</b> <b>them</b> must usually rest for long periods after use. They are sometimes referred to as 7 League Boots.|$|R

25|$|All {{officers}} {{have a unique}} identification number. These are usually referred to as shoulder or collar numbers, referring {{to the fact that}} they were once worn on the uniform collar and later on the epaulettes by constables and sergeants. Uniformed officers in many forces still <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> on the epaulettes, but other forces have badges or other ways of displaying their identification numbers. Kent Police, for instance, refers to its numbers as force numbers and officers <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> on a velcro tab on their stab vest or on a badge attached to their shirt or tunic. Officers in all forces of the rank of inspector or above do not usually wear their numbers.|$|E

25|$|Although it is {{mandatory}} {{to wear a}} badge, North Korean officials sometimes claim that it is done out of pure loyalty.

25|$|The Australian Government has {{decreed that}} Australian {{personnel}} may accept their medals as a keepsake, but permission to <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> in uniform {{has so far}} been refused.

However, some old documents say that men wore maidari. Women sometimes wore a bracelet called tekunkani.|$|E

50|$|Events of {{that war}} contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip. Patriots <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> in their lapels {{as a symbol of}} {{resistance}} to the German occupiers and local Nazi authorities when other signs of resistance, such as flag pins or pins showing the cipher of the exiled King Haakon VII of Norway were forbidden. Those <b>wearing</b> <b>them</b> did not yet see them as national symbols, as the myth of their Norwegian origin was not commonly known at the time.The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity ("we are bound together"). The wearing of paper clips was soon prohibited, and people <b>wearing</b> <b>them</b> could risk severe punishment.|$|R
