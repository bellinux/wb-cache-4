5|$|A 1997 report {{stated that}} Messers Run <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> site for angling {{upstream}} of the Lofty Reservoir. The same report {{stated that the}} stream was an excellent site for angling between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. Additionally, the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 308 are in the stream's watershed. These state game lands contain 432 hectares of forested land.|$|E

5|$|McMillin {{began his}} collegiate career at Centre College in Kentucky. McMillin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> student who {{supported}} himself by gambling and {{liked to play}} football. McMillin failed all his courses during his senior year, eventually receiving his A.B. degree from Centre in 1937 with credit for military service and courses taken {{after he left the}} college. According to McMillin, he initially left Centre with $3,500 in debt.|$|E
5|$|Rudel {{was born}} on 2 July 1916 in Konradswaldau, in Prussia. He was the third child of Lutheran {{minister}} Johannes Rudel. As a boy, Rudel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> scholar, but a very keen sportsman. Rudel attended the humanities oriented Gymnasium, in Lauban. He joined the Hitler Youth in 1933. After graduating with Abitur in 1936, he participated in the compulsory Reich Labour Service (RAD). Following the labour service, Rudel joined the Luftwaffe where he began his military career as an air reconnaissance pilot.|$|E

5|$|Srinivasa Sastri {{was born}} in the town of Valangaiman, Madras Presidency, India on 22 September 1869. His father, Vaidik Sankaranarayana Sastri, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> Hindu priest. He was educated at the Native High School in Kumbakonam and in 1887, {{graduated}} from Government Arts College, Kumbakonam with a first class degree in English and Sanskrit. On graduation, he found employment as a teacher at Municipal College, Salem.|$|E
5|$|The home leg of {{the tour}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> end to the long and taxing Australian Services campaign. As the {{military}} men played poorly in Australia, the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand. Johnson then helped to arrange England's first post-war tour of Australia, in 1946–47.|$|E
5|$|The inexperienced Ferdinand <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> {{choice of}} {{replacement}} for the capable Charles, having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, day-to-day decisions {{were placed in the}} hands of Mack, equally ill-suited for such an important assignment. When Mack was wounded early in the campaign, he was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army.|$|E

The race <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> one for Williams (Heidfeld was 9th before the reclassification), but Webber hit back at the , qualifying 2nd and finishing 6th– his fourth points scoring finish {{in the first five}} races.|$|E
5|$|At a May Day rally, held on Sunday 6 May in Eastville, local Trades Council members {{publicly}} criticised the TGWU. On {{the same}} day Paul Stephenson had organised a demonstration march to St Mary Redcliffe church, but there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> turnout. Some local West Indians said they should not ripple the water and, according to Roy Hackett, they may have feared victimisation. The dispute led {{to what has been}} described as one of the largest mailbags that the Bristol Evening Post had ever received, with contributors writing in support of both sides of the issue.|$|E
5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player no {{incentive}} to keep playing through what he felt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt {{that it was not a}} complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E

5|$|Hans von Halban {{had proved}} to be an unfortunate choice as he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> administrator, and did not work well with Mackenzie or the NRC. The Americans saw him as a {{security}} risk, and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group (in association with ICI). In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. E. W. R. Steacie became assistant director and head of the Chemistry division when Paneth left. Volkoff eventually succeeded Placzek as head of the Theoretical Physics division. Halban remained as head of the nuclear physics division.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's offense {{started at}} its 20-yard line after a touchback on the kickoff. Dittoe threw two {{incomplete}} passes, was sacked, and the Hoosiers punted after going three and out. The Indiana punt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> one, {{flying out of}} bounds at the Indiana 28-yard line and giving Tech excellent field position. With a large lead secured, Virginia Tech backup quarterback Jim Druckenmiller came into the game for the Hokies, who were unable to gain a first down. Despite failing to advance the ball 10 yards, the excellent starting field position allowed Tech kicker Ryan Williams to attempt a 42-yard field goal, his longest kick of the season. The kick sailed through the uprights, and Tech extended its lead to 4513 with exactly six minutes remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{prisoners of}} war {{captured}} by the US troops during the battle reported that the NK 3rd Division suffered about 2,000 casualties, mostly from artillery fire, in the attack on Yongdong on July 24–25. This brought {{it down to a}} strength of about 5,000 men, approximately half the strength it had when the war began. The 1st Cavalry Division's actions were able to delay the North Korean advance for several days, giving the UN forces valuable time to set up the Pusan Perimeter. The UN losses after this battle and the subsequent fight at Hwanggan cost the 1st Cavalry Division 916 casualties. The defeat <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> showing for the division, but its record quickly improved with experience and it became a more reliable fighting unit {{by the time it was}} placed on Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

Nikumbh then asks Mr Awasthi as to why he sent Ishaan to a boarding school. Mr Awasthi replies that Ishaan was an ill-mannered boy and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> student. Nikumbh shows Ishaan's mother her son's notebooks and gives an analysis of the script. Nikumbh deduces that Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words. Mr Awasthi tries to dismiss it as a mere excuse for Ishaan's laziness. Nikumbh demonstrates what Ishaan experiences every day at school. He states that Ishaan has dyslexia as well as he may be having other conditions, which make him a difficult child.|$|E
5|$|This freelancing attempt did {{not start}} out well, with Benchley selling just one piece to Vanity Fair and accumulating countless {{rejections}} in two months. When a position as press agent for Broadway producer William A. Brady was offered, Benchley accepted it, {{against the advice of}} many of his peers. This experience <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> one, as Brady was extremely difficult to work for. Benchley resigned to become a publicity director for the federal government's Aircraft Board at the beginning of 1918. His experience there was not much better, and when an opportunity was offered to return to the Tribune under new editorial management, Benchley took it.|$|E
5|$|Upon Austria's {{entrance}} into the war in summer 1805, Klenau joined the Habsburg army in southern Germany and became mired in a short campaign that exposed {{the worst of the}} Habsburg military organization. Archduke Charles was sick, and had retired to recuperate. Archduke Ferdinand, the brother-in-law of the Emperor Francis, was theoretically in command, but Ferdinand <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> choice of replacement, having neither experience, maturity, nor aptitude. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, decisions were placed in the hands of Karl Mack, who was timid, indecisive, and ill-suited for such an important assignment. Furthermore, Mack had been wounded earlier in the campaign, and was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, an able military officer, but as yet inexperienced in the command of such a large army.|$|E
