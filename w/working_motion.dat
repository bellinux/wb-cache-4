5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} pioneers of digital puppetry was Lee Harrison III. He conducted experiments in the early 1960s that animated figures using analog circuits and a cathode ray tube. Harrison rigged up a body suit with potentiometers and created the first <b>working</b> <b>motion</b> capture rig, animating 3D figures in real-time on his CRT screen. He made several short films with this system, which he called ANIMAC. Among {{the earliest}} examples of digital puppets produced with the system included a character called [...] "Mr. Computer Image" [...] who was controlled {{by a combination of}} the ANIMAC's body control rig and an early form of voice-controlled automatic lip sync.|$|E
5000|$|Another early pioneer, {{working at}} roughly the same time as Le Prince, was William Friese-Greene. He began to {{experiment}} with the use of oiled paper as a medium for displaying motion pictures in 1885 and by 1887 he was experimenting with the use of celluloid. In 1889, Friese-Greene took out a patent for a 'chronophotographic' camera. This was capable of taking up to ten photographs per second using perforated celluloid film. A report on the camera was published in the British Photographic News on February 28, 1890. He gave a public demonstration in 1890 of his device, but the low frame rate combined with the device's apparent unreliability made an unfavourable impression. English anarchist and inventor Wordsworth Donisthorpe, filed for an early patent in 1876 for a film camera, which he named a [...] "kinesigraph."At the time, the necessary materials were not yet available to produce a <b>working</b> <b>motion</b> picture camera, but in 1889, his interest in the possibility was revived when he heard about the successful experiments of Louis Le Prince, who was then working in Donsithorpe's home town of Leeds. In 1889 he took out a patent, jointly with William Carr Crofts, for a camera using celluloid roll film and a projector system; they then made a short film of the bustling traffic in London's Trafalgar Square.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: {{this thesis}} purpose {{is a new}} way of {{modelling}} systems working with high speeds of mechanisms. Systems are analyzed with taking into consideration the rotational movement and with criterions of using materials with high flexibility and high precision of work. The dynamical analysis was done with giving into consideration the interaction between <b>working</b> <b>motion</b> and local vibrations. During the motion a model is loaded by longitudinal forces. Design/methodology/approach: equations of motion were derived by the Lagrange method, with generalized coordinates and generalized velocities assumed as orthogonal projections of individual quantities of the rod and manipulators to axes of the global reference frame. Findings: the model of longitudinally vibrating systems in plane motion was derived, after that the model can be transformed to the dynamical flexibility of these systems. Derived equations are the beginning of analysis of complex systems, especially can be used in deducing of the substitute dynamical flexibility of multilinked systems in motion. Research limitations/implications: mechanical systems vibrating longitudinally in terms of rotation were considered in this thesis. Successive problem of the dynamical analysis is the analysis of systems in spatial transportation and systems loaded by transversal forces. Practical implications: effects of presented calculations can be applied into machines and mechanisms in transportation such as: high speed turbines, wind power plant, water-power plants, manipulators, aerodynamics issues, and in different rotors etc. Originality/value: the contemporary analysis of beams and rods were made in a separate way, first <b>working</b> <b>motion</b> of the main system and next the local vibrations. A new way of modelling took into consideration the interaction between those two displacement. There was defined the transportation effect for models vibrating longitudinally in this paper...|$|E

The well-known problem of dynamical analysis of systems in rotational transportation was developed in this work to systems with taking into consideration damping forces. Design/methodology/approach: The dynamical flexibility method was used to analysis of the free-free rod’s vibrations. Mathematical models derived in previous articles were used to derivation of the dynamical flexibility. Considerations were done by the Galerkin’s method. Findings: There were considered systems in rotational motion treated in this thesis as main transportation. Dynamical characteristics in form of dynamical flexibility as function of frequency and mathematical models were presented in this work. Research limitations/implications: Analyzed systems were simple linear homogeneous not supported rods. <b>Working</b> <b>motion</b> was limited to plane rotational motion. Future works would consider complex systems and nonlinearity. Practical implications: of derived dynamical characteristics can easily support designing process and can be put to use in stability analysis and assigning stability zones. Thank to derived mathematical models the numerical applications can be implemented and some calculations can be automated.

40|$|It {{is known}} that when any kind of fossil fuel is burnt two phenomenons take place (i) Explosion and (ii) Heat generation. In the concept that is stated it is desired to merge the {{functioning}} of External Combustion (EC) and Internal Combustion (IC) engines {{on the basis of}} their working principle. In an EC engine the motive power is obtained by utilizing the factor of heat alone, which results in vaporization of a fluid that is used to move the piston inside the cylinder piston arrangement. Whereas in an IC engine the motive power is derived form the explosion factor, which takes place inside a control volume, thereby providing the necessary power to push the piston for obtaining the desired <b>working</b> <b>motion.</b> It is important to note that neither EC nor IC engines have efficiency greater than 40 %. This is due to the fact that neither of the system utilizes both the factors mentioned above, for producing useful work. But if we can utilize the heat produced due to combustion of fuel in an IC engine, based on the working principle of EC engine, to supply motive power, then we can assure that maximum output would be derived. This paper aims at justifiable use of energy by the combination of the working principles of EC engines used in locomotives and IC engines powered by gasoline (petrol) ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: of {{this article}} is to present an {{application}} to analysis and modelling of rotational systems. Independent modules of application enables controlling and regulation of characteristics of systems in transportation. The base problem of analyzing systems in transportation is expressing the interaction between the main motion and local vibrations of subsystems. Design/methodology/approach: Mathematical models derived in previous articles were used to implement the mathematical models in numerical calculations. The objectives of creating the Modyfit application were connected with analyzing and modelling rotating systems with taking into account relations between major and local motions. Considerations were done by the Galerkin’s method. Findings: There are many effects of analyzing systems with rotation consideration. Main of them are connected with analyzing systems in function of increasing the value of angular velocity. In such way of analyzing we can observe creating additional poles in the dynamical characteristics and we can also observe that instead of modes there are created zeros. Research limitations/implications: Analyzed systems are simple linear homogeneous beams and rods. <b>Working</b> <b>motion</b> is limited to plane motion. Future research would consider complex systems, damping and nonlinearity.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to present a {{numerical}} application for analysis and modelling dynamical flexible systems in transportation. This application enables controlling and regulation of rotating systems with the interaction between the <b>working</b> <b>motion</b> and local vibrations of elements. Design/methodology/approach: Numerical calculations are based onto mathematical models derived in other publications. The objectives of making this application were connected with emerging wants of analyzing and modelling rotating systems with taking into consideration relation between main and local motions. Theoretical considerations were made by classical methods and by the Galerkin’s method. Findings: In way of increasing the value of angular velocity we can observe creating additional poles in the characteristic of dynamical flexibility and after increasing it is evident that created modes are symmetrically propagated from the original mode. It is evident, instead of modes there are created zeros. Research limitations/implications: Analyzed systems were limited to simple linear type beams and rods. Main motion is plane motion. Future research should consider complex systems and nonlinearity. Practical implications: of the application are possibilities of numerical analysis of beam and rod systems both the free-free ones and fixed ones. Engineers thank to this application can derived the stability zones of analyzed systems and can observe eigenfrequencies and zeros in the way of changing the value of angular velocity. In practice we should implement more adequate models such as those presented in this paper. Originality/value: This paper consist the description of the application called the Modyfit.
