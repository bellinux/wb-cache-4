5|$|While {{psychedelic}} rock {{began to}} waver {{at the end}} of the 1960s, psychedelic soul continued into the 1970s, peaking in popularity in the early years of the decade, and only disappearing in the late 1970s as tastes began to change. Acts like Earth, Wind and Fire, Kool and the Gang and Ohio Players, who began as psychedelic soul artists, incorporated its sounds into funk music and eventually the disco <b>which</b> <b>partly</b> replaced it.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R.

McBride had been called in 1950 {{to testify before the}} Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, <b>which</b> <b>partly</b> exposed his ties to mafia figures but did not result in any charges.

5|$|Philippe {{continued}} to steadily strengthen, becoming a hurricane late on September 18 as it traveled north in a low-shear environment and some models {{suggested that this}} trend would continue and Philippe {{would go on to}} become a major hurricane. However, Philippe began to encounter higher wind shear from a non-tropical low, the development of <b>which</b> <b>partly</b> resulted from Hurricane Rita's outflow. As a result of this shear, Philippe's winds only managed to reach a peak of 80mph (130km/h) before weakening back into a tropical storm on September 20.|$|E
5|$|Various folk traditions across Europe are analyzed, {{such as the}} Alpine Perchtenlaufen, {{where women}} broke social {{conventions}} by attacking men or engaging in lesbianism. Duerr compares these traditions to the benandanti of early modern Friuli, and to the Livonian werewolf, viewing them as representing the clash between order and chaos. Christian society in the Late Middle Ages began to construe the witch as a creature inside of society rather than outside it, <b>which</b> <b>partly</b> led to the witch trials of the early modern period. Duerr argues that the societies of European Christendom began to increasingly accept female nudity in art and fashion during the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, <b>which</b> <b>partly</b> {{touches on}} the problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E

5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, <b>which</b> <b>partly</b> splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{election}} of the Menzies Liberal government in the 1949 elections, White was appointed Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation, despite his personal animosity for Menzies, <b>which</b> <b>partly</b> stemmed from the latter's failure to serve in the First World War. In January 1950, White and the Minister for Supply and Development, Richard Casey, announced that the English Electric Canberra had been selected to replace the RAAF's Avro Lincoln bombers and that the new jet would be manufactured by the Government Aircraft Factory in Victoria. White's term as Minister for Air saw the deployment of RAAF squadrons to the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency in mid-1950, and the establishment of the Women's Royal Australian Air Force, the successor organisation to the wartime Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, that November. The following year he gave his approval for the manufacture of a licensed version of the North American F-86 Sabre jet fighter for the RAAF, and played a major part in the controversial decision to replace the long-serving Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal (Sir) George Jones, with an RAF officer, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Chief Marshal Sir) Donald Hardman. White also sought to strengthen the Citizen Air Force, and personally ordered the establishment of No.24 (City of Adelaide) Squadron at Mallala, South Australia.|$|E
