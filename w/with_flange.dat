40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} web crippling tests of cold-formed unlipped channels <b>with</b> <b>flanges</b> restrained or unrestrained. The tests were performed under end and interior two-flange loading conditions specified in the Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS 4600, 1996) and the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI, 1996) Specification for cold-formed steel structures, namely End-Two-Flange (ETF) and Interior-Two-Flange (ITF) loading conditions. The concentrated load was applied by a bearing plate at the top flange of the channels, and the reaction force applied by an identical bearing plate at the bottom flange of the channels. The bearing plates acted across the full flange widths of the channels. The flanges of the channels were bolted to the bearing plates for the specimens <b>with</b> <b>flanges</b> restrained. The web crippling test strengths are compared with the current design strengths obtained using the AS/NZS 4600 and the AISI Specification.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{deep drawing}} process {{is one of the}} {{important}} sheet metal forming process. In this paper, different methods of analysis such as analytical, numerical and experimental techniques are employed to determine sheet blank size, formability and thickness distribution. The traditional sheet plate forming techniques used in industry is experimental, expansive and time consuming methods. Prediction of the formability, thickness distribution in {{deep drawing process}} will decrease the production cost and time of material to be formed. With this regard, the numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element method for cup shaped components <b>with</b> <b>flange.</b> Thickness distribution is obtained for entire cup along <b>with</b> <b>flange.</b> The results obtained from this numerical analysis are compared with experimental findings and results of other researchers. Experimentally thickness distribution is obtained by measurement at various locations in half cut cup along <b>with</b> <b>flange</b> region. Also analytical relationship is suggested to obtain correct initial blank size for cup shaped components <b>with</b> <b>flange</b> on the basis of principal of constancy of volume. As a result of this, 90 - 95 % consistency is obtained between the finite element result and experimental, analytical findings for initial blank size, formability and thickness distribution. Analytical models are extensive and experimentation is time consuming and expensive. Thus one can rely on FEA and simulations can be carried out to control IBS, formability, thickness distribution for component of same family by taking initial guess of IBS from analytical formula to avoid time and cost in field trials by controlling parameters of tooling and press machine...|$|E

40|$|A new rivet {{fastened}} rectangular hollow flange channel beam (RHFCB) {{was proposed}} using an intermittently rivet fastening process {{as an alternative}} to welded beams. The rivet fastened RHFCB allows greater section optimisation and flexibility in designing suitable combinations of web and flange widths and thicknesses for many industrial applications. In the industrial applications of rivet fastened RHFCBs as flooring, roofing or modular building systems, their flanges will be fastened to supports, which will provide increased web crippling capacities. However no research has been conducted to investigate the web crippling capacities of RHFCBs <b>with</b> <b>flanges</b> unfastened and fastened to supports under one-flange load cases. Similarly the current design rules for cold-formed steel sections are not suitable for rivet fastened RHFCBs due to their two hollow flanges. Hence an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs based on the new AISI S 909 standard test method. It included rivet fastened RHFCBs <b>with</b> <b>flanges</b> unfastened and fastened to supports under End One Flange (EOF) and Interior One Flange (IOF) load cases. Tests <b>with</b> <b>flanges</b> fastened to supports showed that web crippling capacities increased by 39 and 5 % for EOF and IOF load cases. Comparisons of experimental web crippling capacity results with predictions using the current AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 design standards showed that web crippling design equations are conservative for rivet fastened RHFCBs <b>with</b> <b>flanges</b> unfastened and fastened to supports under EOF and IOF load cases. Hence new equations are proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} web crippling tests on cold-formed unlipped channels <b>with</b> <b>flanges</b> restrained (fastened) as well as channels <b>with</b> <b>flanges</b> unrestrained (unfastened). The tests were performed under end and interior two-flange loading conditions specified in the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures, namely end-two-flange and interior-two-flange loading conditions. The concentrated load was applied by a bearing plate at the top flange of the channels, and the reaction force applied by an identical bearing plate at the bottom flange of the channels. The bearing plates acted across the full flange widths of the channels. The flanges of the channels were either bolted {{to one or two}} bearing plates for the specimens <b>with</b> <b>flanges</b> restrained. The web crippling test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the North American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and American Iron and Steel Institute Specification for cold-formed steel structures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the North American Specification using the unfastened design rules are generally conservative, but unconservatively predicted using the fastened design rules, even when the flanges of the specimens were restrained. The design strengths predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard and American Iron and Steel Institute Specification are unconservative. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
