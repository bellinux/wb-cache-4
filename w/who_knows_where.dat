25|$|In The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (published in 1980), Zaphod is {{separated}} from the others and finds {{he is part of}} a conspiracy to uncover who really runs the Universe. Zaphod meets Zarniwoop, a conspirator and editor for The Guide, <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> to find the secret ruler. Zaphod becomes briefly reunited with the others for a trip to Milliways, the restaurant of the title. Zaphod and Ford decide to steal a ship from there, which {{turns out to be a}} stunt ship pre-programmed to plunge into a star as a special effect in a stage show. Unable to change course, the main characters get Marvin to run the teleporter they find in the ship, which is working other than having no automatic control (someone must remain behind to operate it), and Marvin seemingly sacrifices himself. Zaphod and Trillian discover that the Universe is in the safe hands of a simple man living on a remote planet in a wooden shack with his cat.|$|E
25|$|At this point, with Mattacks {{busy with}} other projects, the band shifted to an {{acoustic}} format for touring and released the unplugged Old, New, Borrow Blue as ‘Fairport Acoustic Convention’ in 1996. For {{a while the}} four-piece acoustic line-up ran in parallel with the electric format. When Allcock left the band, he was replaced by Chris Leslie on vocals, mandolin and fiddle, who formerly worked with Swarbrick in Whippersnapper, and had a one-off stint with the band replacing Ric Sanders for 1992 Cropredy Festival. This meant {{that for the first}} time since reforming, the band had a recognized songwriter who contributed significantly to the band's output on the next album <b>Who</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>Where</b> the Time Goes (1997), particularly the rousing ‘John Gaudie’. By the time of the 1997 thirty-year anniversary Festival at Cropredy, the new Fairport had been in existence for over a decade and contributed a significant chapter to the history of the band.|$|E

[...] Lenore's cultural refinement and hosting skills, along with her father's social and political connections, helped George in business, and the couple met the Hoovers, the Roosevelts, and other prominent Washington figures. [...] He was chosen by Pyke Johnson, a Denver newspaperman and automotive industry trade representative he met at the Press Club, to join the newly formed Trade Association Advisory Committee to the National Recovery Administration. [...] The committee's work continued even after the agency was declared unconstitutional in 1935. [...] During 1937 and 1938, Romney was also president of the Washington Trade Association Executives.|$|E

500|$|Beggars Banquet {{was delayed}} for nearly six months due to {{controversy}} over {{the design of the}} album cover, which featured a public toilet with graffiti covering the walls of the stall. Beggars Banquet was well received at the time of release. Richards said, [...] "There is a change between material on Satanic Majesties and Beggars Banquet. I'd grown sick to death of the whole Maharishi guru shit and the beads and bells. <b>Who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> these things come from, but I guess [...] was a reaction to what we'd done in our time off and also that severe dose of reality. A spell in prison... will certainly give you room for thought... I was fucking pissed with being busted. So it was, 'Right we'll go and strip this thing down.' There's a lot of anger in the music from that period." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Denny had {{a devoted}} {{following}} in her lifetime, {{she did not}} achieve mass market success. In the years since her death, her reputation has grown. A four-album box set entitled <b>Who</b> <b>Knows</b> <b>Where</b> the Time Goes? (1985) was produced by her widower Trevor Lucas and Joe Boyd and included many rare and previously unreleased tracks. This was the first public indication that a large cache of unreleased material existed. In 1991, Joe Boyd issued {{a new version of}} Denny's All Our Own Work album with the Strawbs called Sandy Denny and the Strawbs on his Hannibal Records label. The album had strings added to some tracks including [...] "Who Knows Where the Time Goes?" [...] and further tracks with Denny on lead vocal.|$|E

2500|$|McManaman also {{forced himself}} to reinvent his game, and {{transform}} himself with a versatility that enabled him to play utility roles in the side, thus helping him shake off a derogatory nickname he was initially given by the Spanish press, [...] "El Cartero" [...] ("the postman"), the implication being that though he could dribble long distances, he seemed to collect the ball and deliver it <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where,</b> {{in the manner of}} the Spanish postal service.

2500|$|In 2007, Symington {{revealed}} he was {{a witness}} to the Phoenix Lights, a mass UFO sighting that took place on March 13, 1997, a decade before his admission. In an interview with The Daily Courier, Symington stated, [...] "I'm a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything that I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people. I don't know why people would ridicule it." [...] He continued, [...] "It was enormous and inexplicable. <b>Who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> it came from? A lot of people saw it, and I saw it too. It was dramatic. And it couldn't have been flares because it was too symmetrical. It had a geometric outline, a constant shape." [...] As Governor during the Phoenix Lights, Symington stated he would investigate the event, but went on to hold a press conference where he had his chief of staff dress up in an alien costume. He later stated that as a public official he felt a responsibility to avert public panic and therefore made an attempt to introduce some levity into the situation.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the battles}} with Villa, Obregón had {{his right arm}} blown off. The blast nearly killed him, and he {{attempted}} to put himself out of his misery and fired his pistol to accomplish that. [...] The aide de camp who had cleaned his gun had neglected to put bullets in the weapon. In a wry story he told about himself, he joined {{in the search for}} his missing arm. [...] "I was helping them myself, because it's not so easy to abandon such a necessary thing as an arm." [...] The searchers had no luck. A comrade reached into his pocket and raised a gold coin. Obregón concluded the story, saying [...] "And then everyone saw a miracle: the arm came forth from <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where,</b> and come skipping up to where the gold azteca [...] was elevated; it reached up and grasped it in its fingers--lovingly--That {{was the only way to}} get my lost arm to appear." [...] The arm was subsequently embalmed and then put in the monument to Obregón on the site of where he was assassinated in 1928. Obregón always wore clothing tailored to show that he had lost his arm in battle, a visible sign of his sacrifice to Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|... "Amritdharis" [...] {{that belong}} to some Sikh sects (e.g. Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari and Rarionwalay, etc.) are vehemently against the {{consumption}} of meat and eggs (though they do consume and encourage the consumption of milk, butter and cheese). This vegetarian stance has been {{traced back to the}} times of the British Raj, with the advent of many new Vaishnava converts. In response to the varying views on diet throughout the Sikh population, Sikh Gurus have sought to clarify the Sikh view on diet, stressing their preference only for simplicity of diet. Guru Nanak said that over-consumption of food (Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life. Passages from the Guru Granth Sahib (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the Adi Granth) say that it is [...] "foolish" [...] to argue for the superiority of animal life, because though all life is related, only human life carries more importance: [...] "Only fools argue whether to eat meat or not. Who can define what is meat and what is not meat? <b>Who</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?" [...] The Sikh langar, or free temple meal, is largely lacto-vegetarian, though this is understood to be a result of efforts to present a meal that is respectful of the diets of any person who would wish to dine, rather than out of dogma.|$|E
