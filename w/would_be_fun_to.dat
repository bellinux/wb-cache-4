5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play; after the voices were added, {{he could see the}} characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> re-create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E

It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on November 15, 1998. The idea for the episode was pitched by Cary, who thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> see the citizens of Springfield hallucinating. He then fleshed it out, forming its current iteration. The episode features the revelation of Homer's middle name, [...] "Jay", which is a [...] "tribute" [...] to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show who got their middle initial from Jay Ward. The name was pitched on for three days by the writers.|$|E

However, most songs were found to feature at least one difficult instrument portion that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play. Reviews {{also noted that the}} censoring of songs in order to affirm a family-friendly rating is awkward, such as censoring the word [...] "whiskey" [...] from Don McLean's [...] "American Pie" [...] (8 times), and can ruin the enjoyment of some songs. Greg Miller of IGN further noted that these censoring are at odds with the straight-up inclusion of other songs such as [...] "Gasoline" [...] by The Airborne Toxic Event which, Miller claims, is about sex.|$|E
500|$|After President John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in , {{his family and friends}} {{discussed}} how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects. Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. [...] "He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem," [...] she said. [...] "He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful." [...] Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei.

500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.

[...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign.

While traditionally the Doctor rests after he regenerates, Moffat thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> make him save the world instead. He described it as a comedy of a man whose day keeps getting worse and worse. Believing that London and companions from London had become a clichÃ© and the audience had become bored with it, Moffat set the episode in the fictional village of Leadworth. Moffat, a Scot, debated whether to locate the episode in a village in Scotland. He ultimately decided on England, in keeping with the notion of Amelia as an unconventional girl.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake did a joint tour in North America with Christina Aguilera {{entitled}} the Justified and Stripped Tour, to support both Justified and Aguilera's 2002 album, Stripped. Timberlake's and Aguilera's managers suggested to both singers {{to go on}} a conjoint tour. Timberlake agreed with the suggestion, saying that [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> be on tour with somebody who's that talented". Timberlake's further reasoning for touring with Aguilera was due to both singers wanting to [...] "break the mold of what people look at as teen pop and move into a different direction". For the tour, Timberlake wanted to transform arenas into clubs, stating that he wants people [...] "to feel like they're a part of the show and it's a party", remarking that anybody caught sitting down would get booted. For the tour, Timberlake performed with eight dancers, a 14-piece band which included four backup singers, three horn players and a DJ. The tour commenced on June 4, 2003 in Phoenix, Arizona and concluded on September 2, 2003 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The tour grossed approximately $45 million.|$|E

[...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times considered the song"one unfortunate collaboration," [...] while saying Spears [...] "herself could beat [...] in a rap battle." [...] Similarly, Eric R.

500|$|Tom Baker found filming in Paris to {{be a very}} {{different}} experience to what he was used to in the UK where crowds would gather to watch the filming and meet the stars. Doctor Who was not shown in France at the time and so the cast and crew were largely ignored. Lalla Ward found City of Death the most challenging Doctor Who serial she worked on but was pleased with the final outcome, saying, [...] "We had to film loads of scenes in the rain and cold... there was no glamour in it at all... it was different from the ordinary stories too and I like the finished result". Seeing her costumes as an important part in creating the role of Romana, Ward clashed with costume designer Doreen James, rejecting the silver catsuit James had designed for her for the story. Ward {{came up with the idea}} for the schoolgirl costume she wore in conjunction with Baker, recalling, [...] "I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> wear something that little girls probably hated wearing because it might cheer them up... I didn't bank on the fact that I'd also get loads of letters from their fathers saying 'Cool School uniform!'".|$|E
500|$|Silas Carson {{was cast}} as Nute Gunray because another actor was {{uncomfortable with the}} costumes used by the Trade Federation characters, which were hot, exerted a lot of {{pressure}} on the bearer, and took about 15 minutes to apply. Hugh Quarshie considered the part of Panaka as [...] "a good career move" [...] and a production that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> make. Brian Blessed originally auditioned for the role of Sio Bibble, the Governor of Naboo, for which he was considered [...] "too loud". Casting director Robin Gurland approached him to play Nass because it was a [...] "bigger than life" [...] character with [...] "a kind of bravado". Blessed described Nass as a [...] "reluctant hero", and a fun role to play. Sofia Coppola, daughter of Lucas' long-time friend and creative partner Francis Ford Coppola, considers Lucas as [...] "like an uncle to me". As she prepared the script for her directorial debut The Virgin Suicides, Sofia heard Lucas would make a new Star Wars film and asked him if she could accompany him during filming. Lucas offered Coppola a role in the royal entourage, which she accepted because it [...] "seemed like a good vantage point to watch without getting in the way".|$|E
500|$|... 20th Century Fox saw X-Men: First Class as {{the first}} film of a new X-Men trilogy. Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, {{where you have the}} fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E

500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said heâ€™d always thought that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic patternâ€”a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E
500|$|There are 93 {{songs on}} disc for Warriors of Rock. According to Bright, {{all the songs}} have been {{selected}} to fit within a narrow set of music genres, [...] "punk, alternative rock, and classic rock", to avoid dilution of the game's focus. Bright noted that [...] "there's still range and {{still a lot of}} variety in this game" [...] to avoid alienating long-time fans of the series in general. The developers also looked at various song structures and considered if they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play; Bright said that a good song for the game [...] "would have a memorable riff but not feel repetitive" [...] and [...] "would be a good amount of chord changes and, ideally, a fun guitar solo to add to the challenge". Two songs, Alice Cooper's [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy" [...] and The Runaways' [...] "Cherry Bomb", have been specifically re-recorded for use in Warriors of Rock. Megadeth's [...] "Sudden Death" [...] was specifically written as the final song within Warriors of Rocks setlist; its polyrhythms and difficult passes make it one of the toughest songs to beat. [...] "Sudden Death" [...] was nominated, but did not win, for [...] "Best Metal Performance" [...] for the 53rd Grammy Awards; this, along with the song [...] "Baba Yetu" [...] from Civilization IV and [...] "Video Games Live", represents the first time a song composed for a video game has earned a Grammy nomination, with [...] "Baba Yetu" [...] continuing to win its award.|$|E
500|$|According to Rob Kay, the game's Lead Designer, {{the idea}} of Guitar Hero was {{directly}} inspired by Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game, where the player used a guitar-shaped controller {{to interact with the}} game. At the time, GuitarFreaks had not seen much exposure in North America. [...] RedOctane was making dance pads for games like Dance Dance Revolution for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to Netflix. [...] RedOctane's Kai and Charles Huang recognized the popularity of GuitarFreaks in Japan through their rental service, and planned to create guitar controllers to bring the game to North America. [...] The Huangs raised $1.75million for the effort, despite being turned down by some investors who [...] "thought [...] was too weird". Greg Fischbach, {{one of the founders of}} Acclaim Entertainment, noted, regretfully several years later, they had passed on Guitar Hero, questioning [...] "Who's going to buy a peripheral like that?" [...] The Huangs approached Harmonix, who had previously made music video games such as Frequency, Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution about making a guitar-based video game for those controllers. With a budget of about one million dollars (which Kay noted was [...] "pretty tiny for a video game"), the two companies worked together to develop Guitar Hero. Kay noted that [...] "No one had any notions about it being a massive success; we all just thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Harmonix's president Alex Rigopulos also claims that former Microsoft vice-president of game publishing Ed Fries indirectly influenced the game's creation, who had previously told Harmonix when they were pitching Frequency to Microsoft that no music-rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it, prompting Rigopulos to investigate the Guitar Hero opportunity when it arose.|$|E
