5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} {{seem to believe that}} the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the {{government}} system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} in equilibrium, each firm's expectations of how other firms will act are shown to be correct; when all is revealed, no firm <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> its output decision. This idea of stability was later taken up and built upon as a description of Nash equilibria, of which Cournot equilibria are a subset.|$|E
500|$|By the 1980s new Keynesian economists became {{dissatisfied}} with these early nominal wage contract models since they predicted that real wages would be countercyclical (real wages would rise {{when the economy}} fell), while empirical evidence showed that real wages tended to be independent of economic cycles or even slightly procyclical. These contract models also did not make sense from a microeconomic standpoint since it was unclear why firms would use long-term contracts if they led to inefficiencies. Instead of looking for rigidities in the labor market, new Keynesians shifted {{their attention to the}} goods market and the sticky prices that resulted from [...] "menu cost" [...] models of price change. The term refers to the literal cost to a restaurant of printing new menus when it <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> prices; however, economists also use it to refer to more general costs associated with changing prices, including the expense of evaluating whether to make the change. Since firms must spend money to change prices, they do not always adjust them to the point where markets clear, and this lack of price adjustments can explain why the economy may be in disequilibrium. Studies using data from the United States Consumer Price Index confirmed that prices do tend to be sticky. A good's price typically changes about every four to six months or, if sales are excluded, every eight to eleven months.|$|E

Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she had no idea who they were.

2500|$|Similar to {{the number}} of viewers present, {{collectivism}} versus individualism can influence impression formation. Collectivists are at ease as long as their impressions are largely in alignment with the larger group's impressions. When a collectivist <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his/her impression, he/she may be compelled to change the views of all group members. [...] However, this could be challenging for collectivists, who tend to be less confrontational than individualists. Individualists are willing change their own views at will and are generally more comfortable with uncertainty, which makes them naturally more willing to change their impressions.|$|E
2500|$|General {{interpretation}} {{about the}} freedom of religion {{as described in the}} constitution in Malaysia is that a person has a right to practice his or her religion freely. This freedom does not grant a person a right to change his or her religion [...] "at a whim and fancy". For example, a Muslim who wants to convert to another religion must get an explicit permission from a syariah court. The syariah courts rarely grant such requests, except in cases where a person has actually lived his or her whole adult life as a person of different religion, and only <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the official documents to reflect this fact. The Islamic interpretation of the situation is that only the syariah courts can decide who is a Muslim and who is not. A person does not have such freedom, and so cannot have a say in the judgement given in a syariah court.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2010s, fear arose among Palestinians that Israel {{planned to}} change {{the status quo and}} permit Jewish prayers or that the al-Aqsa mosque might be damaged or {{destroyed}} by Israel. Al-Aqsa was used as a base for attacks on visitors and the police from which stones, firebombs and fireworks were thrown. The Israeli police had never entered al-Aqsa Mosque until November 5, 2014, when dialog with the leaders of the Waqf and the rioters failed. This resulted in imposing strict limitations on entry of visitors to the Temple Mount. Israeli leadership repeatedly stated that the status quo would not change.

State officials said [...] "they were going ahead with the $25 million road because the money would otherwise have {{to be returned to}} the federal government." [...] The cancellation of the bridge did not lead Palin to return any of the remaining $197 million in the earmark to the Federal Government. Palin's Ketchikan campaign coordinator Mike Elerding, says, [...] "She said 'thanks but no thanks,' but they kept the money." [...] According to Palin’s communications director Bill McAlister, the bridge [...] "isn't necessarily dead"; it may still be built with [...] "a less costly design". Palin changed her mind on the bridge, he said, when [...] "she saw that Alaska was being perceived as taking from the country and not giving, and that impression bothered her and she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> it. [...] I think that Sarah Palin is someone who has the courage to re-evaluate situations as they developed." [...] Palin said through her spokesperson that the road would open territory for development. A McCain-Palin spokesperson said that [...] "because the contract for the road was already signed before she got into office, the governor was left no viable alternative." [...] The Alaska Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration state that the contract could have been cancelled at minimal cost and that the federal money could have been returned to Congress for other uses, if the road had been cancelled when Palin took office in December 2006, but the bridge to the island was not cancelled until September 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Wataru Mitani is a {{quiet and}} unassuming fifth grader in Japan. A new student called Mitsuru Ashikawa begins {{attending}} Wataru's school, though {{he is in a}} different class. There are also rumors circulating about the Daimatsu building, an empty, unfinished building near Wataru's school: witnesses claimed to have seen a ghost wandering behind the building's blue tarps. One day after school, while out with his uncle, Wataru witnesses an old man entering the abandoned building. Wataru follows him into the building and stumbles into the strange world of Vision. In Vision, he is told that the portal he crossed, called the Porta Nectere, opens only once every ten years for ninety days. People from his world are strictly forbidden to enter Vision unless they obtain the status of Traveler from [...] "the gatekeeper". Unfortunately, he is also told he will forget everything of his visit. Upon re-entering the Porta Nectere, his uncle wakens him and he finds that Vision was a dream; Wataru supposedly fell from the stairs of the Daimatsu building. Wataru's uncle brings Wataru home only to discover a terrible truth: the boy's parents are divorcing and his father is leaving with his mistress, leaving his wife and Wataru behind. Both Wataru and his mother are shocked, and to add to Wataru's stress, he finds his memories of Vision slipping away. Later, Wataru's father's lover confronts Wataru's mother over who Wataru's father really loves. After this encounter, Wataru's mother attempts suicide by leaving on the gas in the house. Mitsuru visits him, warns him of the gas, and tells him to go to Vision if he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his fate. Wataru struggles to remember, but he finally goes to the Daimatsu building to cross the portal to Vision. Thus, Wataru's journey in Vision begins.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Psychology, Washington State UniversityThe {{present study}} is {{proposed}} to investigate {{the conditions under which}} people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> group norms in small groups. Literature suggests that people may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> norms when they do not work well, either because the norms are problematic or because the environment has changed, but there is very little research on norm change in small groups. The current study examines how type of group norm development and the experiences of success or failure at group task performance affect group members' willingness <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their group norms. In Study 1, a group norm directed toward how to perform a group task was determined by group member opinions, an experimenter, or an inherited custom. After working on a first trial of the task, participants received success or failure feedback, and were asked whether they personally <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the group norm or retain it. As expected, participants <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the group norm when they failed compared when they succeeded. However, expected effect of type of norm was not found. In Study 2, minimal group paradigm was employed to produce feeling of groupness which may be lack in Study 1. Type of group norm development and group task performance were manipulated in the same way of Study 1. After receiving success or failure feedback, participants were asked whether they personally <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the group norm or retain it, as well as whether they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> accept a new member to the group. Likewise Study 1, participants who received failure feedback were more willing <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the group norm than were those who received success feedback. More importantly, results indicated that participants <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the group norm when it was determined by the experimenter rather than either group member opinions or an inherited custom. In addition, participants who believed the group norm was determined by group member opinions were more reluctant to accept a newcomer to the group compared to participants in other conditions.
