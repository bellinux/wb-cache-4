40|$|How much is the h-index of {{an editor}} of a <b>well</b> <b>ranked</b> journal {{improved}} due to citations which occur after his or her appointment? Scientific recognition within academia is widely measured nowadays {{by the number of}} citations or h-index. Our dataset is based on a sample of four editors from a <b>well</b> <b>ranked</b> journal (impact factor - IF - greater than 2). The target group consists of two editors who seem to benefit by their position through an increased citation number (and subsequently h-index) within journal. The total amount of citations for the target group is bigger than 600. The control group is formed by another set of two editors from the same journal whose relations between their positions and their citation records remain neutral. The total amount of citations for the control group is more than 1200. The timespan for which pattern of citations has been studied is 1975 - 2015. Previous coercive citations for a journal benefit (increase its IF) has been signaled. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneering work on coercive citations for personal (or editors) benefit.
