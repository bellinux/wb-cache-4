5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor named Fox Censor (pictured on the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and {{had a difficult time}} getting through the real-life censors. They had issues with the size of the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with a dagger, but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer <b>was</b> <b>dancing</b> naked in the front row.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Jamaican {{broadsheet}} The Gleaner, Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, {{condemned the}} group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective {{use of the}} Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he <b>was</b> <b>dancing</b> with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed {{it off with a}} humorous comment.|$|E

The introduction came via his father, who was {{on a business trip}} to Melbourne, where he met Pavlova who <b>was</b> <b>dancing</b> there. One of the many versions of the cause for his decision to change his surname from Helpman to Helpmann, was that Pavlova, a devotee of numerology, suggested that he should change his surname to avoid his name Robert Helpman having 13 letters.|$|E

5000|$|The dances are generally, but not always, coordinated or {{standardized}} {{in such a}} {{way that}} all the individuals in the group <b>are</b> <b>dancing</b> the same steps at the same time.

25|$|While she <b>was</b> <b>dancing</b> at the Hyperion Theater at Yale University, in November 1911, {{students}} {{rushed the}} stage. The Yale News had complained about ticket {{prices for the}} production being raised to $2. The performance followed the Yale - Princeton University football game played earlier the same day. The inflated price of admission {{is thought to have}} triggered the students to pull the seats to pieces and proceed with the outbreak. Deslys retreated to her room while stage hands used fire extinguishers to subdue the students. The same month Deslys performed at the Winter Garden Theater in a production of Vera Violetta. In 1913 Deslys appeared with Al Jolson (in blackface) in the musical comedy The Honeymoon Express.|$|E

25|$|In mid-January {{when the}} boy band Fahrenheit were guests on the Chinese program, Super Winners (超级大赢家), fans had filed {{complaints}} toward the host, Frankie Kao, for his disrespectful and careless attitude towards Fahrenheit and their fans. Fans listed their arguments, criticizing Kao for being contemptuous; before the program was to be recorded Fahrenheit and their fans {{had to wait for}} over two hours because Kao had to practice his dance for the opening; when Aaron Yan accidentally had his eyes burnt by fireworks, Kao completely ignored his injury and continued on with the program. When fans began to worry and cry, he became annoyed and screamed at the fans to shut up. Fans also complained that when Fahrenheit <b>was</b> <b>dancing,</b> Kao had caused them to NG many times and therefore they were required to dance several more times. Fans witnessed an extremely exhausted Jiro Wang, who was {{almost to the point of}} collapsing after dancing. The ill Wu Chun was also a victim; fans had witnessed Kao requiring Wu to do health-risking activities when Wu was sick with a fever.|$|E
500|$|Born in Fort Smith, Arkansas on January 24, 1917, Sims {{was one of}} 12 children. The family soon {{relocated}} to Los Angeles, California, where he was raised. Describing his childhood, Sims said, [...] "It was just a whole big dancing family." [...] He learned to dance from his father, and said he <b>was</b> <b>dancing</b> {{as soon as he}} could walk. He began tap-dancing at the age of 3.

At the age of 14, peeping in the windows of a dance school got Sims arrested for loitering, but he was able to dance his way to freedom, convincing a judge that his reason for being on that street was legitimate.|$|E
