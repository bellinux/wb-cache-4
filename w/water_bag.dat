60|$|Duane felt {{inclined}} {{to doubt the}} outlaw's assertion. For his own part he decided his conduct without further speech. First he watered the horses, filled canteens and <b>water</b> <b>bag,</b> and then tied the pack upon his own horse. That done, he lifted Stevens upon his horse, and, holding him in the saddle, turned into the brakes, being careful to pick out hard or grassy ground that left little signs of tracks. Just about dark he ran across a trail that Stevens said {{was a good one}} to take into the wild country.|$|E

And that flashed up whenever he dared to look forward at Lucy's white form. Slone could not bear this sight; it almost made him reel, yet he was driven to look. He saw that the King carried no saddle, so with Lucy on him he was light. He ought to run all day with only that weight. Wildfire carried a heavy saddle, a pack, a <b>water</b> <b>bag,</b> and a rifle. Slone untied the pack and let it drop. He almost threw aside the water-bag, but something withheld his hand, and also he kept his rifle. What were a few more pounds to this desert stallion in his last run? Slone knew it was Wildfire's greatest and last race.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To compare four field-appropriate torso warming modalities, that do {{not require}} AC {{electrical}} power, using a human model of non-shivering hypothermia. Methods: Five subjects, serving as their own controls, were cooled four times in 8 ºC water, for 10 - 30 minutes. Shivering was inhibited by Buspirone (30 mg) taken orally prior to cooling and IV Meperidine (1. 25 mg/kg) at the end of immersion. Subjects were hoisted out of the water, dried, insulated and then underwent 120 min of either: spontaneous warming only; a charcoal heater on the chest; two flexible hot <b>water</b> <b>bags</b> (total 4 liters of water at 55 °C, replenished every 20 minutes) applied to the chest and upper back; or two chemical heat pads applied to the chest and upper back. Supplemental meperidine (maximum cumulative dose of 3. 5 mg/kg) was administered as required to inhibit shivering. Results:  Post-cooling afterdrop was compared to spontaneous warming (2. 2 °C) less for chemical heat pads (1. 5 °C) and hot <b>water</b> <b>bags</b> (1. 6 °C, p < 0. 05), and was 1. 8 °C with the charcoal heater.   Subsequent core rewarming rates, the hot <b>water</b> <b>bags</b> (0. 7 °C/h) and the charcoal heater (0. 6 °C/h), tended to be higher than chemical heat pads (0. 2 °C/h, p = 0. 055) and was significantly greater than spontaneous warming (0. 1 °C/h, p < 0. 05). Conclusion: In subjects with shivering suppressed, greater sources of external heat were effective in attenuating core temperature afterdrop whereas sustained sources of external heat effectively established core rewarming. Depending on scenario and available resources, we advice to use charcoal heaters, chemical heat pads or hot <b>water</b> <b>bags</b> as effective means for treating cold patients in the field or during transport to definitive care...|$|R

5000|$|On the 7th of Muharram, by {{the order}} of Yazid, the army {{prevented}} Husain from getting water from the Euphrates. The water became scarce in the camp of Husain. Sakinah shared whatever little water she had with other children. When soon there was no water at all, the thirsty children {{looked at her with}} their eyes full of hope. The situation got so bad that her lips were parched with thirst. But soon, Sayyedah Sakinah came out holding a dried up mashq (مـشـق, <b>water</b> <b>bag),</b> leading 42 other children, each holding a dry <b>water</b> <b>bag.</b> The children were shouting as if in chorus, [...] "Al Atash, Ya ammahu!" [...] (The Thirsty, O uncle!). She walked up to Al-‘Abbas and told him that the children had all come to her asking for water. He could see that thirst, aggravated by the scorching heat of the desert, was squeezing their young lives out of them. Al-‘Abbas went to Al-Husain and requested his permission to go and get water for Sukainah and the other children. Husain rejected his request once again, saying to him that he was his army's commander, and that because of that, he could not go and fight. Abbas used Sakinah's request to gain Al-Husain's permission, and then Husain agreed. Then Abbas put Sakinah's mashq on the ‘alam (عـلـم, flag), mounted his horse, and rode up to Husain. [...] When Abbas went to get the water, the children gathered around Sakinah with their little cups, knowing that as soon as Abbas brought water, she would first make sure that they had some before taking any herself. Sakinah was standing next to Husain, with her eyes also fixed on the flag of Abbas. Abbas reached the river bank, fighting Yazid's men who tried to block his way, killing anyone with his spear who tried to stop his progress. Thousands of Yazid's men avoided Abbas while he was going towards the river, and the whole army of Yazid disappeared because they were scared of Abbas - his bravery was well known among the Arabs. As he bent down to fill the mashq, the flag disappeared from sight. Sakinah was frightened and looked at her father, who said, [...] "Sayyedah Sakinah, your uncle Abbas is at the river bank." [...] She smiled and said, [...] "Al-Ḥamdu Lillāh" [...] (الـحَـمـدُ لله, The Praise is for Allah), and called out for all the children to welcome Abbas.|$|E
