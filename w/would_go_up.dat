25|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their road {{loss to the}} Cowboys, the Vikings came home for a Week 8 intraconference duel with the Philadelphia Eagles.

25|$|The New York Times, however, {{reported}} that {{it was unlikely that}} NBC would get baseball, as the network would have to preempt up to three weeks of NFL coverage on Sunday nights. However, the NFL used to not schedule a Sunday night game on the second night of the World Series, which meant that NBC gaining the rights was not completely out of the question (however, the following Sunday, in which a possible World Series Game 7 is scheduled, a Sunday night NFL game is also scheduled). In addition to this, other Sunday playoff games, such as the ALCS and NLCS could be pushed to the afternoon. This might not be appetizing to league officials, as major playoff games <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> head-to-head against highly rated afternoon NFL games (as opposed to today's system, in which only one game out of two for the day <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> against network NFL broadcasts).|$|E

Regular season telecasts were reduced to a meager handful. In return, pregame shows during the League Championship Series were entirely eliminated, to minimize the ratings damage.|$|E

25|$|There was an upsurge of hunting, fishing, harvesting, {{and other}} {{traditional}} practices which {{had fallen into}} disuse during colonisation. Men <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> the cliffs hunting black noddy, a local small bird, while women were collecting sea food in the reefs; everyone was fishing as much as possible. Nauruan women produced twine, made of coconut tree fiber, which was used for construction in lieu of nails, {{as well as for}} canoe making and fishing. From pandanus leaves, they made a strong fabric used for mats, baskets, shelter-pieces, and sails.|$|E
25|$|The reserve clause {{had been}} part of {{baseball}} contracts since the game's early days. The National League had begun using it in the late 19th century; the American League began using it in 1903 as part of the truce between the two that created MLB. Team owners realized that if players could go from team to team seeking higher pay, salaries of all players, not just stars, <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up.</b> They feared some teams might have to fold under such competitive pressure, and included the reserve clause, so called since a team reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, to limit free agency.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, the Village Voice {{examined}} the BQX project's cost {{and found that}} the city had only tenuous sources of funding for the project. The Voice study found that the neighborhoods along the proposed BQX pay a combined $1 billion annually in residential taxes, with the tax revenue having increased 17% since 2015. However, to pay for the BQX, the streetcar alone would need to raise tax by another 17%, or else the city would need to resort to financing the streetcar out of its own budget. In addition, there would be less benefit in building in already-gentrified neighborhoods than in neighborhoods that are gentrifying or being redeveloped. The streetcar's feasibility study estimated that property values <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> even without the streetcar.|$|E

In his walking he came to the bottom of the rising ground on the top of which stood the rock on which he and Clara had twice sat. But he turned away, and <b>would</b> not <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to it.

25|$|The Rumford {{fireplace}} {{created a}} sensation in 1796 when Benjamin Thompson Rumford introduced {{the idea of}} restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Thomas Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Henry David Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted. Rumford and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney {{to increase the speed}} of air going up the flue. It produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> into the chimney rather than choking the residents. Rumford fireplaces are appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency. This simple alteration in the design of fireplaces were copied everywhere in an age when fires were the principal source of heat. The Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|This {{reflects}} {{the idea that}} workers {{have a vested interest}} in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work when it will not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up.</b> Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.|$|E
25|$|Strabo, giving {{credits to}} Metrodorus of Scepsis and Hypsicrates, {{mentions}} that at his time the Amazons {{were believed to}} live on the borders of the Gargareans. There were two special months in the spring in which they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargareans to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty. He also stated that the Gargarians went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.|$|E

The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} famous {{characters}} associated with the river during this time was Mark Addy, who was born in a tenement on The Parsonage near Blackfriars Bridge in Manchester in 1838. Whenever anyone was in difficulty in the river, the cry <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> [...] "Bring Mark Addy!" [...] and he would race to the rescue. [...] He was awarded a number of medals including the gold and silver medals from the Humane Society for the Hundred of Salford, and the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal. [...] In 1878 he became the only civilian ever to be awarded the Albert Medal (first class), His final rescue was on Whit Monday in 1889, when he saved a young boy from a particularly sewage-laden section of the river. After this he became ill, and died of tuberculosis in 1890 aged 51. He had rescued over 50people from the river during his lifetime.|$|E

500|$|Shirley {{had engaged}} in the Louisbourg {{campaign}} primarily {{as a way to}} ensure British interests in the Atlantic fisheries.

[...] After capturing the French fort he wrote to Newcastle, proposing a series of expeditions to gain control of all of North America as far west as the Mississippi River, starting with one that <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> the Saint Lawrence from Louisbourg. [...] Upon his return to Boston, Shirley began making preparations for such an expedition. [...] In May 1746 he received plans for London outlining an attempt on Quebec using Royal Navy and provincial forces, while a second expedition was to attack Fort Saint-Frédéric on Lake Champlain. [...] Shirley stepped up recruiting in Massachusetts and asked neighboring governors to contribute men and resources to the effort. [...] Expected support from Britain never arrived, however, and the 1746 expeditions were called off.|$|E
500|$|The {{journey from}} {{deciding}} {{to burn the}} money to deciding how to burn the money to actually burning the money was a long one. Jim Reid, a freelance journalist and the only independent witness to the burning, reported the various schemes the K Foundation considered. The first was offering Nailed To The Wall to the Tate Gallery as the [...] "1995 K Foundation Bequest To The Nation." [...] The condition was that the gallery must agree to display the piece for at least 10 years. If they refused, {{the money would be}} burnt. A second idea was to hire Bankside Power Station, [...] "the future site of the Tate Gallery extension and an imposing building downstream from the South Bank", as a bonfire venue. In typical KLF 'guerrilla communication' style, [...] "posters were to appear on 15 August bearing the legend 'The 1995 K Foundation Bequest To The Nation', under which would have been an image of Nailed To The Wall on an easel and two flame-throwers lying on the floor. On 24 August a new poster <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> exactly the same as the first except that this time the work would be burnt." ...|$|E

I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again."
