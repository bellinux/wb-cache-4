500|$|Elisabeth's {{body was}} placed in a silver casket, a gift from Nicholas II, for the journey back to Darmstadt. Her father {{arranged}} a white funeral, with white instead of black for the funeral trappings, white flowers, and white horses for the procession. The Hessian people came out by the thousands to view the funeral procession and [...] "sobbed in unison so that I could hear it," [...] Ernst wrote. A cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II, expressed shock at the child's death in a letter to Tsar Nicholas II on 7 November 1903. [...] "How joyous and merry she was that day at Wolfsgarten, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> so full of life and fun and health ... What a terrible heartrending blow for poor Ernie, who doted and adored that little enchantress!" [...] Elisabeth was buried in the Rosenhöhe {{with other members of the}} Hessian grand ducal family. A marble angel was later installed to watch over her grave. In a final gesture to Elisabeth and Ernst, Victoria Melita placed her badge of the Order of Hesse, granted to her upon her marriage, into Elisabeth's coffin. Ernst was still devastated by the memory of his daughter's death thirty years later. [...] "My little Elisabeth," [...] he wrote in his memoirs, [...] "was the sunshine of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

[...] "I think I frightened everybody to death on the board <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> for my oral examination.

In fact, it's actually more dangerous now with the IED threat.". Kemp described how the Taliban had now apparently taken to engaging from a distance, and planting IEDs and mines in areas where troops are likely to take cover, such as in ditches, switching from conventional tactics to a greater use of booby traps and suicide bombers.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1998, Šakić {{was interviewed}} by Argentine {{national}} television. The full interview was broadcast on El Trece on 6 April. In it, Šakić admitted to being in a leadership position at Jasenovac from December 1942 to October 1944 but denied that anyone had been killed during this time. He said: [...] "When I was there no guard or administrator was allowed to so much as touch a prisoner. I'm not speaking {{about what it was}} like before or afterward, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> no one could touch anyone". Šakić claimed all the deaths that occurred during his command came as a result of natural causes. The interview caused a public uproar, with Argentine president Carlos Menem calling for Šakić's arrest a day after the broadcast. Šakić disappeared soon afterwards. His wife claimed that he had left to seek refuge in the Croatian Embassy in Buenos Aires, which the embassy denied. She stated that her husband had not committed acts of genocide in Jasenovac, saying: [...] "It's such a huge lie. I am distraught. After fifty years, they come up with an atrocious thing like this". Dinko Šakić was arrested on 1 May.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Dr. Milton Stenn in 1977, Bowlby explained that his career started off in the medical direction as he was following in his surgeon father's footsteps. His father was a well-known surgeon in London and Bowlby {{explained that he was}} encouraged by his father to study medicine at Cambridge. Therefore, he followed his father's suggestion, but was not fully interested in anatomy and natural sciences that he was reading about. However, during his time at Trinity College, he became particularly interested in developmental psychology which led him to give up medicine by his third year. When Bowlby gave up medicine, he took a teaching opportunity at a school called Priory Gates for six months where he worked with maladjusted children. Bowlby explained {{that one of the reasons}} why he went to work at Priory Gates was because of an intelligent staff member, John Alford. Bowlby explained that the experience at Priory Gates was extremely influential on him [...] "It suited me very well because I found it interesting. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> I learned everything that I have known; it was the most valuable six months of my life, really. It was analytically oriented". He further explained that the experience at Priory Gates was extremely influential to his career in research as he learned that the problems of today should be understood and dealt with at a developmental level.|$|E

2500|$|From 1999 onwards, {{a renewed}} process was set into motion by the Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Pashtun Abdul Haq to unite all the ethnicities of Afghanistan. While Massoud united the Tajiks, Hazara and Uzbeks {{as well as}} some Pashtun {{commander}}s under his United Front command, the famed Pashtun commander Abdul Haq received increasing numbers of defecting Pashtun Taliban as [...] "Taliban popularity trended downward". Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king Zahir Shah. International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which Pulitzer Prize winner Steve Coll referred to as the [...] "grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance", said, [...] "It's crazy that you have this today ... Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara ... They were all ready to buy in to the process ... to work under the king's banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan." [...] Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert Peter Tomsen wrote: [...] "The ‘Lion of Kabul’ [...] and the ‘Lion of Panjshir’ ... Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan’s three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun—non-Pashtun, north-south divide." [...] The most senior Hazara and Uzbek leader were also part of the process. In late 2000, Massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in Northern Afghanistan to discuss, among other things, [...] "a Loya Jirga, or a traditional council of elders, to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan". [...] That part of the Pashtun-Tajik-Hazara-Uzbek peace plan did eventually materialize. An account of the meeting by author and journalist Sebastian Junger says: [...] "In 2000, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> ... I happened to be there in a very interesting time. ... Massoud brought together Afghan leaders from all ethnic groups. They flew from London, Paris, the USA, all parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India. He brought them all into the northern area where he was. He held a council of ... prominent Afghans from all over the world, brought there to discuss the Afghan government after the Taliban. ... we met all these men and interviewed them briefly.
