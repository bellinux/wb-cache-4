While the two were staying in Atlanta, he surprised her by taking her to their wedding ceremony which he had arranged without her knowledge.

5|$|Unknown to Guderian, von Kleist, his {{immediate}} superior, had contacted Loerzer and banned Guderian's proposed long systematic approach {{in favour of}} one big assault. Guderian complained. Kleist ignored him. Yet, the following morning, Loerzer rejected Kleist's method and <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> the agreed rolling bombing as discussed with Guderian. Loerzer would later say that the official order from Hugo Sperrle had arrived too late to make changes.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{his attempt}} to balance the budget, Corzine {{decreased}} funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities have raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts.|$|E

5|$|Director Quentin Tarantino {{expressed}} interest in directing an adaptation of Casino Royale, but Eon were not interested. He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> Casino Royale. Tarantino also {{said he would have}} set it in the 1960s and would have only made it with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. In February 2005, Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director. Later in 2005, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 it was {{announced}} that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty over whether the 2007 event would take place.

In June 2007 it {{was announced}} that alcohol {{would not be allowed to}} be taken on site, but would be available to purchase from official bars within the arena.

5|$|Prior to the election, {{the party}} held a fundraiser which {{featured}} erotic art meant to illustrate political themes and a performance piece involving couples having sex behind a screen, erotic poetry, and body painting. After {{employees of the}} Liquor Control and Licensing Branch told Ince that the art installation would likely result in the refusal of a special event liquor licence, the party asked for judicial review. Both a provincial court and an appeal court refused the review because an actual application had not been submitted for a decision to be reviewed, and the fundraiser <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> the serving of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|Despite Spielberg's rejection, {{the studio}} <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> {{plans to make}} the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month {{pre-production}} process. Howard Sackler, who had contributed to the first film's script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a prequel based on {{the sinking of the}} USS Indianapolis, the story relayed by Quint in the first film. Although Universal president Sidney Sheinberg thought Sackler's treatment for the film was intriguing, he rejected the idea. On Sackler's recommendation, theatre and film director John D. Hancock was chosen to helm the picture. Sackler later felt betrayed when Dorothy Tristan, Hancock's wife, was invited to rewrite his script.|$|E
5|$|For {{their final}} road {{game of the}} season, the Wolverines {{traveled}} to Madison, Wisconsin to play the Wisconsin Badgers. Wisconsin scored first with a 22-yard TD pass by Scott Tolzien to Garrett Graham. Michigan tied the score with a 21-yard Tate Forcier TD pass to Vincent Smith. In the second quarter, the teams traded the lead. First, Michigan took the lead with a 37-yard Jason Olesnavage field goal. Wisconsin then <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> an 8-yard TD pass to Nick Toon. Michigan went back ahead when Ryan Van Bergen picked up Scott Tolzien's fumble (forced by Brandon Graham) and ran it back 14 yards for a touchdown. Wisconsin responded with a 1-yard TD run by John Clay, making the halftime score 21–17 Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{also worked}} with Irving and Stevenson's publisher, Longmans, to block Bandmann's {{production}} {{and those of other}} competitors. In the UK, unlike the U.S., the novella had copyright protection. Longmans brought legal actions against the unauthorized versions; its efforts blocked a William Howell Poole production from opening at the Theatre Royal in Croydon on July 26. That day, Fred Wright's Company B presented one performance of its adaptation at the Park Theatre in Merthyr Tydfil before it was also closed. Bandmann had the Opera Comique theater reserved from August 6, but hoped to open his production earlier. Irving blocked this by reserving the theater for Mansfield's rehearsals, and Mansfield's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde opened at the Lyceum on August 4. Bandmann <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> his August 6 opening, but after two performances the production was shut down because of legal action by Longmans.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 1963, {{the coup}} <b>went</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>with</b> Cao's troops {{isolated}} in the far south, and Tung's forces outside Saigon, unable to rescue Diệm from the rebel encirclement. Tung was called to the Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base under the pretense of a routine meeting, and was seized and executed. Attempts by Diệm and Nhu {{to make contact with}} Đính were blocked by other generals, who claimed that Đính was elsewhere. This led the Ngô brothers to think that Đính had been captured, still unaware that he had rebelled. The following morning, Đính was allowed to have the final word with Diệm before the brothers were arrested, allowing him to prove his loyalty to the rebel cause. Đính subsequently shouted obscenities at the Ngô brothers.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, McCain {{said he was}} {{temporarily}} suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying {{the first of the}} general election debates with Obama, in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis. McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.|$|E
5|$|The Café Royal, {{located at}} 68 Regent Street in the Quadrant, was opened in 1865 by Daniel Nicols {{and became an}} {{institution}} of London high society.

Wilde <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> the trial, which ultimately led to his own arrest and imprisonment. The present building, by Sir Reginald Blomfield, dates from 1928 and is Grade II listed. It was closed in 2008 and the building which houses the café was bought by a subsidiary of Alrov Group, {{as a part of}} Crown Estate's plans to redevelop this part of Regent Street.

5|$|Under the Elysee Accords and the {{subsequent}} legislation that created the State of Vietnam in 1949, Bảo Đại's position as head of state was neither permanent nor indefinite. Sovereignty was presumed to rest solely upon the people, with Bảo Đại being a mere conduit. As a result, the referendum itself was within the law. Diệm had not been elected to his post, so he saw the referendum {{as an opportunity to}} rebuff opponents, who claimed that he was undemocratic and autocratic. The event also gave Diệm an opportunity to boost his prestige by defeating Bảo Đại in a head-to-head contest. It was previously agreed that a National Assembly would be elected first, but Diệm <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> the plebiscite, which meant that he would have total power if he deposed Bảo Đại before a legislature was formed.|$|E
5|$|A year earlier, Murdoch's Fox Entertainment Group {{purchased}} the Los Angeles Dodgers for $311m. Fox also held {{exclusive rights to}} Major League Baseball which meant from a strategic point of view, Murdoch’s acquisition looked more appealing. He was now able to control both programming content on his network and distribution rights to the Dodgers. For the very same reason BSkyB replicated Fox’s formula and <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> a takeover of a Premier League club. Manchester United thus was the unanimous choice of Murdoch and board members. The club was the most valuable in English football, making £30.1million from gate receipts and programmes in 1997 alone. At the same time, more than 200 supporters’ groups were established worldwide and the club's fanbase exceeded 100million, despite only a million having been to Old Trafford to watch the first team play. As a means of capitalising on this growing market, MUTV, a television station operated by the club was launched in August 1998. In co-operation with Granada Media Group and BSkyB it was the world’s first channel dedicated to a football club, funded entirely through subscriptions. On the pitch United's success was largely down to the nurturing talents of manager Ferguson, who assembled a team capable of dominating in the long haul.|$|E
5|$|Much of Livingstone's {{first two}} years were devoted to setting up the Mayoral system and administration. He also devoted much time to battling New Labour's plans to upgrade the London Underground system through a public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) program, believing it to be too expensive and tantamount to the privatisation of a state-owned service. He furthermore had strong concerns about safety; PPP would divide {{different parts of the}} Underground among various companies, something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and maintenance program. These concerns were shared by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union, who went on strike over the issue, being joined on the picket line by Livingstone. Appointing Bob Kiley as transport commissioner, the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state hands through a public bond issue, as had been done {{in the case of the}} New York City Subway. They launched court cases against the government over PPP in 2001–02, but were ultimately unsuccessful, and the project <b>went</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>with</b> the Underground being privatised in January 2003.|$|E
