2500|$|After {{the death}} of Abu Bakr, Ali raised Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. The Twelver Shia view Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr {{as one of the}} companions of Ali. When Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was killed by the Ummayads, Aisha, the wife of Muhammad and also a renowned scholar of her time, raised and taught her nephew Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's mother was from Ali's family and Qasim's {{daughter}} Farwah bint al-Qasim was married to Muhammad al-Baqir and was the mother of Jafar al-Sadiq. Therefore, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grand son of Abu Bakr the first caliph and the grand father of Jafar al-Sadiq. Jafar al-Sadiq disapproved of people who said anything bad about his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph. Zaydis, the largest group amongst the Shia before the Safavid Dynasty and currently the second largest group (although its population is only about 5% of all Shia Muslims), believe that on the last hour of Zayd ibn Ali (the uncle of Jafar al-Sadiq), he was betrayed by the people in Kufa who said to him: [...] "May God have mercy on you! <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say on the matter of Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab?"

2500|$|With {{the death}} of Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz the {{scholars}} in Madina got very upset. But {{in the short time}} Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz was in power the changes he made, had a long-lasting effect {{in the minds of the}} people. An associate of Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz, Zayd ibn Ali the grandson of Husayns was also very upset. Zayd ibn Ali then started receiving letters from Kufa asking him to come to Kufa. In 740, Abu Hanifah supported his friend Zayd ibn Ali against an Umayyad ruler but asked his friend not to go to Kufa. Abu Hanifah, Malik ibn Anas and Zayd ibn Ali's family advised Zayd ibn Ali not to go to Kufa feared that Zayd ibn Ali would get betrayed in Kufa. But Zayd ibn Ali felt that he needed to oppose the Umayyads by force. Zaydis believe that on his arrival in Kufa, on the last hour of Zayd ibn Ali, the people in Kufa asked him: [...] "May God have mercy on you! <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say on the matter of Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab?" [...] Zayd ibn Ali said, [...] "I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them...when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah.". After which they withdrew their support and Zayd ibn Ali fought bravely against the Umayyad army but was killed. The Scholars kept up the pressure on the Umayyads and as the Umayyads tried to re-impose the taxes abolished by Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz, the population also got more rebellious.|$|E

5000|$|A {{few years}} later the people of Kufa called Zayd ibn Ali, the {{grandson}} of Hussein, over to Kufa.

When you question everything about yourself, Ruby has to ask, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hold onto? We don't often have films that ask questions like these or ones that answer them as effectively." [...] Middle of Nowhere was named one of The New York Times Critics' Pick and Manohla Dargis commented [...] "A plaintive, slow-boiling, quietly soul-stirring drama about a woman coming into her own, Middle of Nowhere carries the imprimatur of Sundance, but without the dreary stereotypes or self-satisfied politics that can (at times unfairly) characterize its offerings." ...|$|E
50|$|Edwards {{launched}} {{a breach of}} contract suit against MGM and president James Aubrey for their post production tampering of the film. Edwards:The whole experience was, in terms of filmmaking, extraordinarily destructive. The temper and tantrums from my producer, William Belasco, were such that he insulted {{me in front of}} the cast and crew and offered to bet me $1,000 that I'd never work in Hollywood again if I didn't do everything his and Aubrey's way. They told me that they didn't want quality, just a viewable film. The crew felt so bad about the way I was treated that they gave me a party - and usually it's the other way round. I know I've been guilty of excuses but my God <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do to pay your dues? I made Wild Rovers for MGM and kept quiet when they recut it.
