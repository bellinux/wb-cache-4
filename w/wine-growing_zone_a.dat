40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the studies of 11 varieties cultivated in the eastern region of South Coast <b>wine-growing</b> <b>zone</b> of Crimea (planting of "Solnechnaja Dolina ", near Sudak mountain) in the area of their natural growing, where was formed the gene pool of grapes for a long time. As a result, the three-year (2010 - 2012) study found that the majority of indigenous varieties had small number of fruitbearing shoots in the bush: the varieties with colored berry - 53, 3 - 73, 3 %, in white-berry - 46, 6 - 75, 9 % except Shabash variety - 79. 9 %. We have identified the most productive varieties which were Dzhevat kara (62. 2 t / ha), Kokur Beliy (48. 9 t / ha), Kapselsky Beliy (44. 4 t / ha), and varieties with female type of flower: Kefesiya, Ekim kara, Kock pandas, Sary pandas and Crona gave not high yield: 22. 2; 22. 2; 24. 4; 28. 9 and 28. 9 t / ha. On the strength of growth, productivity and the accumulation of sugars in the juice of berries, we picked out varieties of Dzhevat kara, Crona, Kapselsky beliy. According to the main economic indicators, {{it turned out that the}} most profitable varieties are Dzhevat Kara, Kokur beliy and Kapselsky beliy.

30|$|Considering the {{relationship}} between resistivity structure and seismicity, we suggest that two <b>zones</b> (<b>Zones</b> <b>A</b> and B in Fig.  6) have similar structures to the zones of Seis. 1 –Seis. 3. <b>Zone</b> <b>A</b> corresponds to {{the southern part of}} Hinagu fault, which is 10 – 50  km from the hypocenter of the main shock. <b>Zone</b> <b>A</b> includes <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> of high radon- 222 concentration in soil gas, which suggests large gas ascent velocities caused by frequently induced strain along the Hinagu fault (Koike et al. 2014). Further, <b>a</b> conductive <b>zone</b> like Seis. 1 is suggested at depths of ~ 20  km beneath <b>Zone</b> <b>A,</b> and therefore, this region is considered to have a relatively high potential of earthquake generation.

In addition, zone C has much void space and curvilinear and linear lattice-fringe images with numerous defects, including edge dislocations. Such morphologic and crystallographic characteristics indicate that zones B and C probably comprise the glauconitic minerals of the vermicular glaucony grains, and that <b>zone</b> <b>A</b> comprises non-glauconitic micaceous minerals of higher structural order.

Skipjack usually swims near the surface water and tends to be classified as a juvenile skipjack that caught during fishing activities. The study objective was to analyze biological data of skipjack including length weight relationship, growth, length at first maturity/lm and catch size, size composition and gonad maturity. Skipjack samples {{were caught in the}} waters of the western (<b>zone</b> <b>A)</b> and southern (<b>zone</b> b) areas of North Maluku Province, from April 2012 until May 2013.

This indicates that the growth of skipjack in both areas was categorized as in isometric pattern. L∞ of skipjack caught at <b>zone</b> <b>A</b> was 75 cm at the age of 56 months and at zone B was 76 cm at the age of 56 months.
