40|$|Reliable {{gravimetric}} analysis of particulate matter filters {{is of great}} importance in exposure and risk assessment in industrial hygiene and environmental health, especially for light weight fine particles like PM 2. 5. Weighing bias {{may be caused by}} a number of environmental and operating factors. Among them, the humidity effect is most often addressed. This study proposes a cost-effective <b>weighing</b> <b>chamber</b> with humidity control by using a saturated magnesium chloride solution to meet the USEPA requirements for filter weighing. To exclude the interference of electrostatic charges, filter samples are treated with a radioactive source, Am 241, on a microbalance pan before weighing. Long term monitoring shows that the relative humidity inside the <b>weighing</b> <b>chamber</b> is between 31 – 35 % when the temperature is between 18 – 21 °C. The air pressure inside the <b>weighing</b> <b>chamber</b> is kept slightly positive by adjusting the air supply of the humidity control unit at 15 L/min during filter conditioning and at 25 L/min during filter weighing to maintain a stable humidity condition and prevent aerosol contamination from outside. Moreover, the operator should wear gloves to prevent hand moisture evaporation. We suggest that filter samples to be stored and conditioned in a <b>weighing</b> <b>chamber</b> with the filter holder’s lid open to expedite and enhance the filter conditioning. When a hygroscopic filter, such as an MCE, is used to collect about 0. 5 mg of hygroscopic NaCl particles, a mass increase of 0. 5 mg results due to the filter and an additional 1. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{weight-bearing}} test is {{one method}} to assess pain in rodent animal models; however, {{the acceptance of}} this convenient method {{is limited by the}} low throughput data acquisition and necessity of confining the rodents to a small chamber. New methodsWe developed novel data acquisition hardware and software, data analysis software, and a conditioning protocol for an automated high throughput static weight-bearing assessment of pain. With this device, the rats voluntarily enter the <b>weighing</b> <b>chamber,</b> precluding the necessity to restrain the animals and thereby removing the potential stress-induced confounds as well as operator selection bias during data collection. We name this device the Voluntarily Accessed Static Incapacitance Chamber (VASIC). ResultsControl rats subjected to the VASIC device provided hundreds of weight-bearing data points in a single behavioral assay. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) surgery and paw pad injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or carrageenan in rats generated hundreds of weight-bearing data during a 30 minute recording session. Rats subjected to CCI, CFA, or carrageenan demonstrated the expected bias in weight distribution favoring the un-operated leg, and the analgesic effect of i. p. morphine was demonstrated. In comparison with existing methods, brief water restriction encouraged the rats to enter the <b>weighing</b> <b>chamber</b> to access water, and an infrared detector confirmed the rat position with feet properly positioned on the footplates, triggering data collection. This allowed hands-off measurement of weight distribution data reducing operator selection bias. ConclusionThe VASIC device should enhance the hands-free parallel collection of unbiased weight-bearing data in a high throughput manner, allowing further testing of this behavioral measure as an effective assessment of pain in rodents...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} sink-float {{procedure to}} measure the density of tiny individual mineral particles A COMMON procedure for determining the den-sity of a small mineral particle is the heavy-liquid sink-float method. The procedure has been described in the literature, which has been ade-quately summarized by Muller 0977) - The sink-float method is quite straightforward for particles above o. ooi mm 3 (average dimension o. I mm), but problems arise when the particles are appreciably smaller than that. These problems include the difficulty of observing the mineral particle, dif-ficulty in recovering the particle, and anomalous particle movement due to convection currents in the heavy liquid. The procedure described here overcomes these difficulties to a large extent. The density determination is carried out using a small cell filled with heavy liquid and mounted in a temperature-controlled air bath, in the <b>weighing</b> <b>chamber</b> of an analytical balance. Sink-float behaviour of the small particles i observed using a stereomicroscope. Density calibration is achieved by use of a sealed mercury-in-glass plummet. Because the particles involved are not visible to the unaided eye, a stereomicroscope is mounted horizontally to enable {{the movement of the}} particle to be observed. The magnification used should initially be as low as possible so that a large field of view is obtained. To avoid having to shift the microscope up and down in searching for the particle, it is desirable to use as small a container as possible; a standard glass Io mm spectrophoto-metric ell, with a volume of about 3 ml, was found to be suitable. An added advantage of a small container is that it reduces thermal convection currents in the contained liquid. To control temperature, the cell is mounted in a perspex air bath with a thermocouple well next to the cell. The air bath is mounted on an adjustable-height bridge in the <b>weighing</b> <b>chamber</b> of an ana-lytical balance. A mercury-in-glass plummet on a stainless steel hook is used for the determination f the liquid density, when equilibrium has been achieved. The spectrophotometer c ll is charge...|$|E
