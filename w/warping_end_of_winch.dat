50|$|While he {{was working}} as a tuna and sardine {{fisherman}} from San Pedro, California, Puratić started thinking about the difficulty of hauling seine nets. The original power block he designed was essentially a simple winch which used a V-shaped roller coated with hard rubber. It was suspended from a davit, and powered from the <b>warp</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>winch</b> by a looping rope. In 1954, the power block was trialled by American purse seiners in the Pacific. They have evolved since then, and nowadays power blocks are powered by hydraulic pumps. Their speed, torque and direction can be remotely controlled from the bridge during operations. As a result, retrieving the net is safer and requires less manual work.|$|R

50|$|It has two warp beams, {{though it}} can be run using just one or none. An S-twist thread is out on the front warp (right warp) and a Z- twist on the back warp (left warp, reverse warp). All the <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> pass through a sley with {{individual}} perforations- to keep the threads from tangling.On a machine with 3000 front <b>warp</b> <b>ends,</b> that will mean 6000 perforations, all front <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> will be <b>of</b> the same count, and all back <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> will be <b>of</b> the same count, though the two warps can carry different counts. The warp threads interact with the brass bobbin threads to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse warp threads (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp threads against the bobbin threads. The warp threads are tensioned by a spring.|$|R

50|$|The {{threading}} of a Jacquard loom is so labor-intensive {{that many}} looms are threaded only once. Subsequent warps are then tied into the existing warp {{with the help}} of a knotting robot which ties each new thread on individually. Even for a small loom with only a few thousand <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> the process <b>of</b> re-threading can take days.|$|R
50|$|As a group, western Anatolian rugs often show {{a bright}} brick red and lighter reddish colours.

50|$|The {{lower part}} of the bow of the vessel, instead of being made solid as usual, is {{composed}} of two iron flaps, each hinged at the top, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. When closed, the outer surfaces of these flaps correspond to the general shape of the bow, and, when the torpedo machinery is not being worked, they are kept down in their places by means of chains attached to them near their lower edges, and passing in through a pair of hawsepipes situated between the flaps. Each chain, after entering its hawsepipe, is attached to an iron rod, these rods passing into the vessel through stuffing-boxes at the inner <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the hawsepipes. From the inner <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> these rods chains are led, over guide pulleys, to the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a <b>winch,</b> situated as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and by means <b>of</b> this <b>winch,</b> which is worked by hand, the flaps can be closed when required. The opening of the flaps is effected by the arrangements shown in Figs. 1 and 4, from which it will be seen that each flap has a chain attached to its outside, and that these chains, after being led up over guide pulleys supported by brackets placed {{at the level of the}} gunwale, are crossed and then led down through hawseholes in the deck to the winch below. The chains for opening, in fact, form continuations of those for closing the flaps, or vice versa.|$|R

50|$|Grass {{was then}} seen growing on Old <b>Warp</b> by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 18th century and cattle were put onto {{the island to}} graze. With the Humber Estuary being a drain for {{a large part of}} the Midlands, {{including}} the River Trent and all of its tributaries, and the River Ouse draining a major part of Yorkshire, England, and being very tidal, it was a simple task and a matter of waiting a few years for some strategically placed piles of bricks and concrete (Warping) to start off this island by allow the rich silt to build up. It was certainly protected and further land reclaimed from the Humber as its island status grew, and by the 1861 census there was one wooden cottage on the island, with a fresh water well.|$|R

We report experimental results provided by PZT pickups stuck on thin-walled aluminium beams with open modified cruciform cross-section, exhibiting non-zero warping stiffness. The buckling loads {{and the natural}} frequencies corresponding to various compressive forces were detected for free and (at least partially) restrained <b>warping</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the specimens. The results are {{compared with those of}} a FEM (commercial) and an in-house numerical code that examines the stability of non-trivial equilibrium paths in a dynamic setting. The results seem new and confirm that: (a) PZT pickups can be efficient in extracting modal parameters of thin-walled beams; (b) the numerical simulations are robust and accurate in finding the buckling loads in all analyzed configurations...|$|R

5000|$|Diamond {{drilling}} is {{much slower}} than reverse circulation (RC) drilling {{due to the}} hardness of the ground being drilled. Drilling of 1200 to 1800 metres is common and at these depths, ground is mainly hard rock. Techniques vary among drill operators and what the rig they are using is capable of, some diamond rigs need to drill slowly to lengthen the life of drill bits and rods, which are very expensive and time consuming to replace at extremely deep depths. As a diamond drill rig cores deeper and deeper the time consuming {{part of the process}} is not cutting 5 to 10 more feet of rock core but the retrieval of the core with the wire line & overshot tool.Core samples are retrieved via the use of a core tube, a hollow tube placed inside the rod string and pumped with water until it locks into the core barrel. As the core is drilled, the core barrel slides over the core as it is cut. An [...] "overshot" [...] attached to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>winch</b> cable is lowered inside the rod string and locks on to the backend (aka head assembly), located on the top <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the core barrel. The winch is retracted, pulling the core tube to the surface. The core does not drop out of the inside of the core tube when lifted because either a split ring core lifter or basket retainer allow the core to move into, but not back out of the tube.|$|R

50|$|Beams are the {{vertical}} threads from a beam roller {{that contributes to}} the pattern. Lace is made up of motif that is repeated vertically and horizontally. If a design has 48 horizontal repeats, there will be 48 threads on each beam roller. Every beam roller has its own guidebar, made of thin watch-spring steel. Each front <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> has its own guidebar. The back <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> share 4 stump bars between them. The guide bars are controlled by the Jacquards so can be reposition for each motion, indeed they are also known as Jacquard bars; they are held in a bar box above the sley but below the carriages.|$|R
