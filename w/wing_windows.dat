2500|$|For 1973, {{the vent}} <b>wing</b> <b>windows</b> were deleted from the Scamp, and all models {{were given a}} new grille and front bumpers able to {{withstand}} damage at a [...] impact, as well as steel beams inside the doors to protect vehicle occupants in side-impact collisions as mandated by NHTSA. The door beams, the new bumpers and their impact-absorbing mounts, a rubber-booted telescoping system attached to the car's structure, added mass to the Valiant. At the same time, engines were being progressively detuned to comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Performance and economy suffered as a result.|$|E
2500|$|The 1968 Caprice {{received}} a minor facelift {{that included a}} new grille with taillights set into the bumper and optional hidden headlamps. Caprice coupes now came standard with the new Astro Ventilation system, which included extra vents in the dash, {{and the removal of}} vent (<b>wing)</b> <b>windows.</b> Side marker lamps became standard on all U.S. cars and the Caprice carried over the optional white corner marker lamps at the forward edge of the fenders in addition to the amber parking lights which were illuminated with the headlights. All 1968 Chevrolets got front side marker lights on the fender; cars with an optional engine were identified with its cubic inch displacement listed on half the bezel; the light itself occupied the other half. The fiber optics monitoring system was offered again as an option. Chevrolet made the Caprice Coupe's formal roofline available in the Impala series. The Impala Custom Coupe became the best-selling model in the line. The L72 [...] Turbo-Jet V8 returned to the option list after a one-year hiatus. A new [...] Turbo Fire V8 rated at [...] replaced the [...] small block as the standard engine. Inside, the instrument panel was revised with a return to the horizontal sweep speedometer and a revised three-spoke steering wheel. An optional instrument cluster had a narrow speedometer within its opening and flanking it with engine-turned instruments in the place of warning lights. The fuel gauge, placed next to the speedometer within its own pod in the base models, was moved to its new place next to the speedometer. A tachometer took the place of the fuel gauge in the large opening left by the fuel gauge.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Red Wing Business Systems {{merged with}} Champion Business Systems and FMS/Harvest. Software {{products}} {{included in the}} company merger were Champion Controller Accounting, Profit and Profit Gold Accounting (Champion Business Systems), Perception Accounting Software (FMS/Harvest), AgCHEK, Red Wing DOS Accounting and Payroll, and Red <b>Wing</b> <b>Windows</b> Accounting and Payroll (Red Wing Business Systems).|$|E
50|$|A brick terrace {{continuing}} the stone balustrade from the forecourt surrounds the building; there are loggias {{at the north}} and south ends. The north facade incorporates the facade of an actual 16th-century Italian church. All bays below the roof on the main block are set with multi-pane casement windows; the service <b>wing's</b> <b>windows</b> are six-over-six double-hung sash.|$|R
5000|$|The two-door had a 112 in wheelbase; four-door, station wagon, and the El Camino had a 116 in wheelbase; and the stretched-wheelbase wagon had a 121 in wheelbase. 1968 {{model year}} A-body 2-door hardtops and {{convertibles}} had a vent <b>wing</b> <b>window</b> assembly - 1969-72 models had a one piece door glass where GM's Astro Ventilation system (first {{used with the}} 1966 Buick Riviera) was phased in.|$|R
5000|$|The kitchen <b>wing's</b> {{different}} <b>window</b> {{treatment and}} gable suggest {{it was originally}} attached to a house similar to itself.|$|R
50|$|Modern, labour-saving, {{technology}} was therefore enthusiastically embraced at Gean including central heating, gas ignition coal fires and electric lighting. The service wing {{was designed to}} be very much part of the main house, with attractive, south facing, staff bedrooms overlooking the principal gardens. Only the higher sill levels of the service <b>wing</b> <b>windows</b> distinguish this section of the house.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between the Eagle and Master. The easiest to identify is the post between the front door <b>wing</b> <b>windows</b> and the roll down windows. On the Eagle the chrome divider between these two windows goes down as the window goes down, where as on the Master this divider remains fixed and does not go down with the window.|$|E
5000|$|Built from March 1950. Upper grille {{started out}} horizontal, as in early Phase I; from March 1951, some {{locomotives}} were built with vertical-slotted [...] "Farr-Air" [...] grilles, and by October 1951, all had them. Cab doors became round-cornered, and the kick plates were deleted. The <b>wing</b> <b>windows</b> became taller, with round corners. Two drip strips; one over cab windows, second over door. The end door window became round after November 1950.|$|E
25|$|Its rear {{has a small}} shed-roofed <b>wing</b> with <b>windows</b> and a {{door with}} small {{projecting}} gable. The interior of the chapel has been altered, but retains its original wainscoting and window surrounds.|$|R

50|$|The Series CA Master {{replaced}} the 1933 Eagle mid {{way through the}} model year when the 1933 Standard model (Series CC) was introduced. Several changes {{were made to the}} Eagle when the name was changed to Master. The easiest to identify is the post between the front door <b>wing</b> <b>windows</b> and the roll down windows. On the Eagle the chrome divider between these two windows goes down as the window goes down, where as on the Master this divider remains fixed and does not go down with the window.|$|E
50|$|For 1973, {{the vent}} <b>wing</b> <b>windows</b> were deleted from the Scamp, and all models {{were given a}} new grille and front bumpers able to {{withstand}} damage at a 5 mph impact, as well as steel beams inside the doors to protect vehicle occupants in side-impact collisions as mandated by NHTSA. The door beams, the new bumpers and their impact-absorbing mounts, a rubber-booted telescoping system attached to the car's structure, added mass to the Valiant. At the same time, engines were being progressively detuned to comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Performance and economy suffered as a result.|$|E
50|$|The Airflytes also {{featured}} fully reclining seats {{that could turn}} the car into a vehicle capable of sleeping three adults, however this would also earn the dubious {{distinction of being the}} make-out automobile of choice for teenagers coming of age in the 1950s. The 1950 Ambassador became the first non-General Motors automobiles to be equipped with GM's Hydramatic automatic transmissions (cars with the automatic transmission has Selecto-lift starting, where the diver pulled the transmission lever on the column toward themselves to engage the starter). 1949 was the first year for a one-piece curved windshield, and front door <b>wing</b> <b>windows</b> featured curved glass as well.|$|E
50|$|Glorup Manor {{consists}} of four low white-washed <b>wings</b> with <b>window</b> frames, cornices and pilasters partly painted yellow. It is topped with a large Mansard roof in glazed black tile. The flèche on the roof was added from 1773 to 1775.|$|R
50|$|The center {{portion of}} the {{building}} is three stories, with a gable roof running front-to-back. The main entrance is inside an enclosed lobby of white painted brick which features three windowed arches {{on the front and}} arches with glass doors on either side. Above the lobby is a two-story pedimented portico, supported by four Ionic columns, with a third-floor balcony. On either side of the main block, set back from the portico, are 2 four-bay, two-story <b>wings.</b> <b>Windows</b> on the first floor façade are six-over-six sashes, while the second and third floors are nine-over-nine. The roof is covered in red tile with a decorative finial on the gable ends. The cornice is decorated with small dentils on the wings, and larger ones on the architrave.|$|R
50|$|In July 1610, François III Briçonnet, {{the reign}} {{counselor}} and {{administrator of the}} Paris Chamber of Accounts, became the new owner of the castle. After his wedding with Anne des Landes, the Lady of Magneville, he issued an order for the castle to be reconstructed {{in the style of}} Louis XIII. The result was a multicolored brick facade for the right <b>wing.</b> <b>Window</b> dormers and a belfry with a dome on pillars were also erected. Probably two of four towers and a drawbridge were demolished at that time. These two towers were modified into a pavilion with small turrets and loopholes. The couple also built the Mary Magdalene Chapel not far from the castle, because Bailleau Church was two miles away.|$|R
5000|$|Externally {{the main}} changes {{were to the}} doors, which gained wind-up windows, {{swivelling}} quarter lights (AKA <b>wing</b> <b>windows),</b> external handles and separate locks. The windscreen also gained a slight curvature and was retained in a more substantial frame. The hood (US - top), though modified, continued to have a removable frame {{that had to be}} erected before the cover was put on. The rear springs were replaced by more conventional semi-elliptic types which gave a better ride. The engine block was strengthened and larger main bearings were fitted, increasing the power to [...] at 5750 rpm and torque to 65 lb.ft Nm at 3500 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ability to}} {{configure}} the basic vehicle {{many different ways}} allowed it to be suitable for multiple uses. In addition to the standard 7 person cabin, the Snow Trac was also available with a two-person enclosed cabin which had an exposed cargo area. Alternately, it could be ordered with only a windshield and side <b>wing</b> <b>windows</b> and a canvas top. (Most of the military versions were equipped in this fashion). A fully open-top version was also available and this version was used on sand in Texas oilfields, {{as well as by}} the British Commandos of the Royal Marines to carry a L6 Wombat anti-tank weapon.|$|E
50|$|The Peter Dierks Joers House is a {{historic}} house at 2111 Park Avenue in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Built in 1955, this single story wood and limestone structure {{is one of the}} finest local examples of Mid-Century Modern Ranch architecture. The house is basically U-shaped, with a central public living area, a bedroom wing, and a service <b>wing.</b> <b>Windows</b> are typically full length in height, and most of the exterior is clad in irregularly-laid limestone, with some weatherboard siding. The house was built for Peter Dierks Joers, heir to the locally prominent Dierks Lumber Company, whose sale to Weyerhaeuser he oversaw. The house interior is a showcase of Arkansas wood types and woodwork.|$|E
50|$|Chrome period-correct lowrider-influenced {{accessories}} like chrome vent <b>wing</b> shades, <b>window</b> rain guards, chrome knuckle guards, blue dot tail lenses, chrome headlight visors, chrome gravel {{guards and}} rear window venetian blinds {{were some of}} the Cal-Style cues that were adopted from the 1930s and 1940s Chevy “Bombs”.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} popular Beetle styles, from a Cal looker, to a Cal-Style VW. They vary between {{themselves}} but {{are similar in}} many ways. Also the California look has changed during the 30+ years of its lifespan. The most typical (and traditional) way to customize the exterior {{is to change the}} wheels and lower the front suspension of the car. The favorite wheels are period-style EMPI 5- or 8-spokes, Speedwell BRMs, Mahle [...] "Gas Burners" [...] or satin finish Porsche factory rims like Fuchs from a classic 911. One of the original California look modifications is to replace or remove the bumpers, side trim and vent <b>wing</b> <b>window</b> either to give a cleaner look or to reduce the curb weight; if bumpers are removed, T-bar pushbars are common. The stock bumpers are sometimes painted or powdercoated.|$|R
5000|$|The four-door Ramblers for the 1956 {{model year}} were {{completely}} redesigned, with a characteristic swept-back C-pillars (the Fashion Safety Arch), unusual <b>wing</b> <b>windows</b> {{on the rear}} doors, inboard, grille-mounted headlamps, as well as [...] "the widest windshield" [...] of any car. The short-wheelbase two-door (Nash Rambler) versions were no longer available. The new line retained the 108 in wheelbase that {{was used for the}} previous four-door versions of the Nash Rambler, but the overall length was increased by 5 in, to 191.14 in. The Rambler was substantially smaller outside compared to the other popular domestic cars of the era, but its interior room was equal to the top-selling [...] "low-priced" [...] field. Construction was also unusual, being unit body (what Nash called Double Safe Single Unit).|$|E
5000|$|... 1969 4-4-2s {{were very}} similar to the 1968 except the {{division}} tooth between the grilles, the trunk lid inlets for the tail lights, <b>wing</b> <b>windows</b> deleted on Holiday Coupes and convertibles, steering lock ignition switch on the steering column, standard headrests were added to the front seats, and the paint scheme. Twin hood stripes were now available to highlight the new dual-bulged hood. The 4-4-2 numerals grew to nearly double their previous size. Optional disc brakes now had updated single-piston calipers. The exhaust manifolds featured a new center divider for better performance. Other changes to the engine were minimal, but the Turnpike Cruiser option was deleted. However, another high-performance engine was offered. Called the W-32, it came with the Forced Air Induction plumbing found on the W-30s, but it had a milder cam like the base engine. It was only available with an automatic, and 297 were built, including 25 sport coupes and convertibles each.|$|E
5000|$|The 1968 Caprice {{received}} a minor facelift {{that included a}} new grille with taillights set into the bumper and optional hidden headlamps.

The Impala Custom Coupe became the best-selling model in the line. The L72 427 cuin L [...] Turbo-Jet V8 returned to the option list after a one-year hiatus. A new 307 cuin L Turbo Fire V8 rated at [...] replaced the [...] 283 cuin L small block as the standard engine. Inside, the instrument panel was revised with a return to the horizontal sweep speedometer and a revised three-spoke steering wheel. An optional instrument cluster had a narrow speedometer within its opening and flanking it with engine-turned instruments in the place of warning lights. The fuel gauge, placed next to the speedometer within its own pod in the base models, was moved to its new place next to the speedometer. A tachometer took the place of the fuel gauge in the large opening left by the fuel gauge.|$|E
50|$|The {{front windows}} and the doors {{remained}} {{the same as the}} Celica but the roof line was extended to cover the rear passenger seats and then continued as a thin spine {{to the rear of the}} car. On each side of the spine a centre hinged gull <b>wing</b> <b>window</b> completed the roof and continued down to the waistline. A large integral roll bar completed the rear and also held up the rear of the roof spine. The tail lights and rear indicators shown through many small round holes in the rear face of the bodywork. Unusually for Celicas, the rear bumper had cut-outs to house red reflectors and reversing lights. A 1 metre wide tail gate with a frameless wind-down window occupied the centre of the rear. The centre section of the bumper moved with the tail gate instead of being fixed directly to the body.|$|R

5|$|Snow affects such human {{activities}} as transportation: creating {{the need for}} keeping roadways, <b>wings,</b> and <b>windows</b> clear; agriculture: providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; such sports as skiing, snowboarding, snowmachine travel; and warfare: impairing target acquisition, degrading the performance of combatants and materiel, and impeding mobility. Snow affects ecosystems, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold.|$|R
50|$|Projecting perpendicularly to {{the main}} {{administration}} building on the east is the drill shed, a gable-roofed <b>wing</b> with its <b>windows</b> spaced by buttresses with stone caps. The brick-faced concrete block garage is to the southeast.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} was of rectangular section with a domed decking, {{all covered}} with corrugated light alloy. There was a port side passenger door just aft of the <b>wings,</b> with <b>windows</b> stretching {{forward to the}} pilots cockpit. The main undercarriage was fixed and divided; some aircraft had wheel fairings, others not. There was a fixed tailskid, or a later tailwheel. Some aircraft were fitted with floats or skis instead of the main wheels.|$|R
