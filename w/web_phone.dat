To this aim, we adopt a multilevel latent class solution, which allows to simultaneously cluster individuals and countries. The overall result is that most countries can be grouped in classes that follow a geographical division, while European citizens can be divided in classes with some specific profiles: a large proportion of consumers have not confidence with alternative purchasing channels yet, particularly among older respondents; most consumers still prefer to buy from sellers or providers located in their own country; more educated individuals show a widespread use of the web; a class of potential purchasers may be determined, particularly among younger people...|$|E

40|$|This {{progress}} report considers US government web and new media strategies to collaborate across government to deliver quality online information {{and services to}} the American public. This report notes that the Open Government Directive (OGD) {{had not yet been}} issued since their White Paper was published in November 2008. While the OGD supports efforts to transform online government, it has also brought new challenges. Today, the highest priority is still to improve the public 2 ̆ 7 s ability to easily complete their top tasks (those things most important to the greatest number of people). The Federal Web Managers Council is composed of the Web and New Media Directors of every federal cabinet agency, plus senior web managers of congressional support agencies, major independent agencies, and sub-agencies that deliver top citizen tasks.   Their goal is to create the highest performing government websites in the world.   In November 2008, they published “Putting Citizens First: Transforming Online Government”, a white paper outlining six strategies to reform how the U. S. government delivers online services to the American people:  • Establish web communications as a core government business function; • Help the public complete top government tasks efficiently; • Clean up irrelevant and outdated content so people can find what they need online; • Engage the public in a dialogue to improve our customer service; • Deliver the same answer from every service channel (<b>web,</b> <b>phone,</b> email, print, in-person, etc.); • Ensure underserved populations can access critical information online...|$|E

40|$|Mobile <b>phone</b> <b>web</b> {{utilisation}} {{is relatively}} new in South Africa, and {{not only does it}} provide more convenience to existing Internet users, but it can potentially overcome the access problems that are attendant in the utilisation of the web by most South Africans. This could {{go a long way to}} bridging the Digital Divide and contribute to South Africa’s economic growth. It is therefore important to understand the role that the South African mobile <b>phone</b> <b>web</b> utilisation cluster may play in creating national competitive advantage. This exploratory research study focuses on understanding the role of mobile <b>phone</b> <b>web</b> utilisation in creating economic growth in South Africa. It uses a combination of empirical evidence on the mobile <b>phone</b> <b>web</b> utilisation cluster, academic theory around Porter’s Diamond Model of the Micro Economics of Competitiveness, and pre-existing international and local research. The question that was considered was “Does the Mobile <b>phone</b> <b>web</b> utilisation cluster represent a source of competitive advantage for South Africa?” To support this investigation the following areas were explored; • What is the universe of the mobile <b>phone</b> <b>web</b> utilisation cluster? • Are the related and supporting industries conducive to competition? • Are firm strategies, structures and competitive rivalry conditions conducive to • competitiveness in this cluster? • Are demand conditions conducive to global and local competitive growth? • Are factor conditions conducive to competitiveness? • What is the role of Government? The research found that in most aspects, this cluster has the potential to play a role in creating competitive advantage and contributing to South Africa’s economic growth.

40|$|Mixed mode {{surveys are}} {{presented}} {{as a solution to}} the problem of increasing survey costs and decreasing response rates. The disadvantage of such survey designs is the lack of control of mode-related measurement effects. Within repeating surveys, measurement effects can put in doubt data comparability between different rounds or waves which may be conducted in a single (other) mode. To understand the extend of measurement effects, selection and measurement effects between modes have to be disentangled. Almost all existing techniques to separate both effects are dependent on a set of covariates that are assumed to be mode invariant and explain in a sufficient way selection effects. Most of the time, these covariates are socio-demographical variables that may be mode invariant but fail to fully explain selection effects. The aim of this research is to assess if selection and measurement effects between modes can be evaluated by including questions about mode preferences as covariates rather than only socio-demographical variables. In 2012, a sequential mixed mode experiment was conducted next to the traditional face-to-face European Social Survey in Estonia (Ainsaar et al 2013). This experiment started with a Web questionnaire, which was followed by face-to-face interviews. The questionnaire included three items about mode preference for a <b>Web,</b> <b>phone,</b> and face-to-face survey. These mode preference variables were expected to better explain selection effects between the modes than socio-demographical variables, even though they may not fully meet the mode insensitivity assumption. We investigate whether the trade-off between compliance to the mode insensitivity assumption and the assumption that selection effects are fully explained leads to better results when mode preference variables are included rather than socio-demographic variables using propensity score models. The results show that even though adding the mode preference to the propensity score model seem to increase the explanatory power of participation by Web, it decreases correlation with important target variables. Also, the estimated selection and measurement effects do not always fit our expectations that more selection effects are explained and more measurement effects are detected. status: publishe...|$|E
