5|$|For an {{hour after}} dawn on 13 August, there were few German tracks upon the plot tables in {{operations}} rooms, and none {{at all in the}} central and eastern Channel. The first signs of concentration, however, came earlier than usual, for between 05:30 and 05:40 two formations of 30 or more aircraft were located in the Amiens area. For 30minutes, they remained over land, but at 06:10 they began moving inland. The Observer Corps and radar tracked them and guided the RAF units to intercept. Unaware of the German intent, the controllers directed three full Squadrons and detachments of three others were alerted by 06:15. No. 151 was protecting a convoy in the Thames, No. 111 was protecting RAF Hawkinge and No. 74 Squadron RAF was covering RAF Manston. Parts of No. 85, No. 43 and No. 238 Squadron RAF were also airborne near London. By 06:25, the German formations were well over the Channel. No. 238 was moved to cover their own base at RAF Warmwell. No. 257 Squadron RAF was also ordered to take off at 06:20 to patrol Canterbury. Not satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of the forces already airborne, controllers dispatched No. 601, 213, 64 and 87 Squadrons to intercept between 06:30 and 06:35. The first combats began at 06:30.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Scottish & Newcastle {{claimed that}} John Smith's was {{available}} in 40,000 outlets across the United Kingdom. In 2007, Scottish & Newcastle moved production of John Smith's Cask from Tadcaster to Burtonwood near Warrington, and production of John Smith's Magnet to Camerons Brewery of Hartlepool. In 2008 three limited edition beers were released to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the brewery. In 2010 Heineken discontinued production of cask conditioned John Smith's Magnet, although it remains available in kegs. By 2011, production of John Smith's Cask had moved to Cameron's. As of 2012, John Smith's is the sixth highest selling beer brand in the United Kingdom and the highest selling bitter in the world. From February 2013, John Smith's Extra Smooth and Original were reduced from 3.8 to 3.6% ABV. According to Heineken, the decision was taken {{in order to bring}} the product in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of its major competitors such as Tetley, Boddingtons and Worthington.|$|E
5|$|Jardine was {{selected}} to tour Australia with the M.C.C. team in 1928–29 {{as part of a}} very strong batting side, playing in all five Test matches and scoring 341 runs at an average of 42.62. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,168 runs (average 64.88). He was also on the five-man selection committee for the tour, which chose teams to play in specific games but had not chosen the touring party. Wisden judged that he had been as great a success as had been expected and impressed everyone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of his defensive shots and his play on the back foot. It said that he played some delightful innings. Percy Fender, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Jardine never had the chance to play a normal innings in the Test, having to provide the stability to the batting, and often seeming to come out to bat in a crisis.|$|E

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of the Crusaders now heavily reduced since Hattin, Saladin {{launches}} the Siege of Jerusalem to free it from Crusader control. However, the Saracens {{must take}} great {{care not to}} destroy the Monasteries within the holy city, and must also deal with Templar and Hospitaller encampments that flank the city. The Siege is successful, the Holy Land now once again in Saracen control, spare the Crusader states of Tiberias, Tyre and Ascalon, but are subsequently captured by Saladin. When the Pope is informed of the Crusader defeat in the Middle East, the Third Crusade is launched, threatening to undo Saladin's conquest. The final missions tasks the player with defending a heavily fortified Citadel from constant Crusader attacks, most notably King Richard of England, as well as constructing the Great Mosque of Samarra, the unique Wonder building available to the Saracens in game.|$|E

25|$|Neuroplasticity is {{the ability}} of a {{particular}} part or region of a neuron to change in strength over time. There are two largely recognized categories of plasticity: synaptic and nonsynaptic. Synaptic plasticity deals directly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of the connection between two neurons, including amount of neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic neuron, and the response generated in the postsynaptic neuron. Nonsynaptic plasticity involves modification of neuronal excitability in the axon, dendrites, and soma of an individual neuron, remote from the synapse.|$|E
25|$|In general, acidity of donor sites {{correlates}} well <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of the donor. For example, it is {{a common}} strategy to add electron-withdrawing aryl substituents on a thiourea catalyst, which can increase its acidity and thus the strength of its hydrogen bonding. However, it is still unclear how donor strength correlates with desired reactivity. Importantly, more acidic catalysts are not necessarily more effective. For instance, ureas are less acidic than thioureas by roughly 6 pKa units, but it is not generally true that ureas are significantly worse are catalyzing reactions.|$|E

25|$|When {{damage is}} inflicted upon characters, it is deducted from their Hit Points, which are {{calculated}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Strength</b> stat (prior to GURPS 4th Edition, Hit Points {{were derived from}} the Health stat). Like most other RPGs, a loss of hit points indicates physical harm being inflicted upon a character, which can potentially lead to death. GURPS calculates shock penalties when someone is hit, representing the impact it causes and the rush of pain that interferes with concentration. Different weapons can cause different 'types' of damage, ranging from crushing (a club or mace), impaling (a spear or arrow), cutting (most swords and axes), piercing (bullets), and so on.|$|E

25|$|The Iron Age {{brought a}} measure of {{prosperity}} to {{the people living in}} the area of the present-day Netherlands. Iron ore was available throughout the country, including bog iron extracted from the ore in peat bogs (moeras ijzererts) in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the Veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant. Smiths travelled from small settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand, including axes, knives, pins, arrowheads and swords. Some evidence even suggests the making of Damascus steel swords using an advanced method of forging that combined the flexibility of iron <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of steel.|$|E

The company in the operational reserve was brought to assist, but failed to effect a difference. Meanwhile, another company assaulted the 4th position and also managed to breach the fence. Interpreted as a success, the final company was sent to attack the 3rd position. It stalled due to Egyptian artillery fire and withdrew. At 02:00 on October 19, the company attacking the 4th position, pinned down and unable to advance, retreated as well, and at 03:00, the Oded forces fighting at the 2nd position did the same.|$|E
25|$|Curtis left Rosenborg {{after the}} season, and Eggen {{was hired as}} a new manager with Tor Røste Fossen as his assistant. He {{combined}} Curtis' defensive work with increased creativity in the offensive play, thus increasing the entertainment value and scoring more goals. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of a strong back row, led by center backs Kåre Rønnes and Bjørn Rime, the club won its first double after beating Fredrikstad in the cup final. In the UEFA Cup, the team advanced past IFK Helsinki, and lost to Belgium's Lierse on the away goals rule. The following season started with a fall in enthusiasm among the players, and by mid-season was closer to relegation than a medal. The situation improved with the return of Hauge, and in the end the team ended in a fourth place and lost the cup final against Brann. In the European Cup, the club lost to Celtic.|$|E
25|$|During the War of 1812, Key, {{accompanied}} by the British Prisoner Exchange Agent Colonel John Stuart Skinner, dined aboard the British ship HMS Tonnant as the guests of three British officers: Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane, Rear Admiral George Cockburn, and Major General Robert Ross. Skinner and Key were there to negotiate the release of prisoners, {{one of whom was}} Dr.William Beanes, a resident of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, who had been arrested after jailing marauding British troops who were looting local farms. Skinner, Key, and Beanes were not allowed to return to their own sloop because they had become familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> and position of the British units and with the British intent to attack Baltimore. Thus, Key was unable to do anything but watch the bombarding of the American forces at Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore on the night of September 1314,1814.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} conducted based on Masters and Johnson's model. However, inaccuracies {{have been found in}} the descriptions of the stages of sexual response. For example, Roy Levin identified a few areas of the model that had not been touched upon. First, Masters and Johnson state that only the vagina is lubricated during the arousal stage; Levin argues that the labia produce their own lubricant. Levin also presents research which shows that the first signs of physiological arousal in women is increased blood flow to the vagina, not lubrication. He also dispels information about men and their sexual response; Masters and Johnson report that pleasure was positively associated with the volume of ejaculate released, but Rosenberg, Hazzard, Tallman, and Ohl gave a group of men a questionnaire and found that significantly more men reported that physical pleasure was associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> of the ejaculation compared to the volume. Moreover, some researchers have found that some men can have multiple orgasms, despite what Masters and Johnson had reported.|$|E
