5|$|Many who memorialized Stevens {{after his}} death in 1868 agreed on his talent as a lawyer. He was {{involved}} in the first ten cases to reach the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from Adams County after he began practice, and won nine. One case he later <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not won was Butler v. Delaplaine, in which he successfully reclaimed a slave on behalf of her owner.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> made the call {{on the evening of}} the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E

5|$|From 1961 to 1967, he was {{a leading}} member of a strong Scottish {{international}} team that lost only once to England, in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2–1 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the 1966 World Cup, he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most {{of the credit for}} the 3–2 win, some commentators <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> made an effort to run up a bigger score.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E
5|$|Cerny's {{personal}} interests changed throughout the project, {{leading to the}} inclusion of new ideas absent from the original design documents. The game's enemy characters were designed by Cerny and Sam Comstock, who also animated them. Enemies had to be small in size due to technical limitations. Cerny and Comstock purposely omitted faces to give them unique designs and create a minimalistic appearance similar to the courses. Atari's management, however, suggested that the marble should have a smiley face to create an identified character, similar to Pac-Man. As a compromise, the cabinet's artwork depicts traces of a smiley face on the marbles. Flanagan programmed a three-dimensional physics model to dictate the marble's motions and an interpreted script for enemy behavior. As Marble Madness neared completion, the feedback from Atari's in-house focus testing was positive. In retrospect, Cerny <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> included more courses to give the game greater longevity, but extra courses would have required more time and increased hardware costs. Atari was experiencing severe financial troubles {{at the time and}} could not extend the game's development period as it would have left their production factory idle.|$|E

Boelcke was not only a well-established ace, but was pioneering the tactics and strategy of fighter aviation.

Rodriguez grew up a Met fan and of former Met first baseman turned announcer Keith Hernandez. Rodriguez stated how he listened to his agent Scott Boras about taking more money instead and did not want to make the same mistake of not being on a team he liked playing for by leaving the Yankees.|$|E
25|$|Perceiving a {{means of}} revenge, Republican congressmen {{defeated}} Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and {{gave way to a}} sharp decrease in popularity. Bush would later say that he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never signed the bill. Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be {{a turning point in the}} Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, White wrote The Vivisector, {{a searing}} {{character}} portrait of an artist. Many people drew {{links to the}} Sydney painter John Passmore (1904–84) and White's friend, the painter Sidney Nolan, but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends Roy De Maistre and Francis Bacon, and later said he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been an artist. White's elaborate, idiosyncratic prose was a writer's attempt to emulate painting. By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as James Clifford, Erica McGilchrist, and Lawrence Daws. White was later friends with Brett Whiteley, the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by Louis Kahan won the 1962 Archibald Prize.|$|E

500|$|Evans {{was born}} in Southwark, London, on 23 February 1826, to Henry and Mary Evans. He {{attended}} school in Jamaica Row, where he enjoyed mathematics but <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> learned Latin. As a 13-year-old he began work as a [...] "reading boy" [...] at the printing house of Samuel Bentley in London in 1839. However, he was reassigned as a general errand boy because his stutter interfered with his duties. The hours were long—from {{seven in the morning}} until nine or ten at night—but the printmaking process itself, and the books produced by the establishment, fascinated Evans. Bentley soon realized the boy was talented after seeing his early attempts at scratching illustrations on slate, and arranged for Evans to begin an apprenticeship with wood-engraver Ebenezer Landells.|$|E
500|$|Tracy disliked when he {{was asked}} about his technique, or about what advice he would give to others. He often belittled the profession, for {{instance}} saying to Kanin, [...] "Why do actors think they're so God damn important? They're not. Acting is not an important job in the scheme of things. Plumbing is." [...] Tracy was humble about his abilities, telling a journalist, [...] "it's just that I try no tricks. No profile. No 'great lover' act... I just project myself as I am—plain, trying to be honest." [...] He was known to have enjoyed the quip once made by Alfred Lunt: [...] "The art of acting is—learn your lines!" [...] Katharine Hepburn, in an interview six years after Tracy's death, suggested that Tracy <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> held a different profession.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{became known}} for her [...] manipulative behavior and was often labeled a [...] "soap vixen". She was praised by television critics, with Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune saying: [...] "Whoever shows up as the next villain, chances are {{his or her work}} won't be easy. That's because at least one resident—Abby Ewing—knows how to dish nasty with the best of them." [...] When asked which character he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> created, Mike Kelly, the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap opera Revenge, said: [...] "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world." [...] John Mapes of The Biography Channel said, [...] "Any great soap opera needs a great villain. While viewers may identify more with the protagonist, the villains in a serial drama always spice things up, cause trouble, and make it more fun to watch." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{unpublished}} {{journal and}} later correspondence, McKinlay suggested that Stefansson's departure amounted to abandoning {{the ship to}} its fate. The expedition's historian S.E. Jenness (son of Diamond Jenness) rejects this view, pointing out that Stefansson and the hunting party members had left valuable property aboard Karluk; a possible motive for the trip, Jenness surmises, was to train the younger staff. The anthropologist Gísli Pálsson, writing of the expedition, asserts that while the anger of Bartlett and the crew is understandable, {{there is no evidence}} that Stefansson deliberately abandoned the men. It is arguable, Pálsson says, that Stefansson acted responsibly in attempting to secure a supply of fresh meat which would counter the possibility of scurvy, should Karluk be trapped in the ice for a long time. The historian Richard Diubaldo writes [...] "The evidence suggests that this was a normal hunting trip" [...] and [...] "...there is strong evidence to suggest he [...] <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never left [...] ".|$|E
500|$|... "Dreams Old Men Dream" [...] was {{inspired}} by the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries and Fyodor Dostoyevskys short story The Dream of a Ridiculous Man. It tells the story of an elderly man reflecting back on the life he had and what he <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done before. [...] "On the Night My Love Broke Through" [...] was the last song made for the album that was recorded live. It {{was inspired}} by the works of German-American poet Charles Bukowski. [...] "Relief" [...] is written {{from the perspective of a}} person that questions God's way of controlling the Earth and handling its inhabitants. God himself answers the person's question when Willett sings, [...] "Flash flood, you got too comfortable, so I showed you, who's really in control." [...] The overall sound of the track is described as electronica in the vein of [...] "mid-era Radiohead." [...] The album closer, [...] "Cryptomnesia", {{was inspired by}} a case involving Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov being accused of plagiarism involving his 1955 novel Lolita. Willett said that it is [...] "an apt word for the way history seeps into his songwriting today." ...|$|E
