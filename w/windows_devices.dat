2500|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS {{in response to}} the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer (PC) market with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984. [...] Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh (eventually settled in court in Microsoft's favor in 1993). [...] On PCs, Windows is still the most popular operating system. However, in 2014, Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android, because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones. In 2014, the number of <b>Windows</b> <b>devices</b> sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold. This comparison however may not be fully relevant, as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms.

40|$|Oxide {{semiconductor}} nanowire (NW) suspension based {{devices have}} been attracted {{growing interest in}} smart window applications due to their great controllability of light transmittance, simplicity and long term stability. Recently, we demonstrated smart <b>window</b> <b>device</b> using the suspension of electrospun TiO 2 or solvothermally synthesized ZnO NWs in viscous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. The operating principle of the oxide semiconductor NW and PDMS device {{is based on the}} alterable orientation, alignment or spatial distribution of the NWs in an electric field, by changing light scattering cross-section and thus reversibly increasing or decreasing transmittance [1]. One-dimensional (1 D) nanostructures such as NWs exhibit a good response to electric field due to the highly anisotropic shape. Herein we report transition metal doped ZnO NW and PDMS based smart <b>window</b> <b>devices.</b> Doping ZnO NWs with other chosen metal ions, such as transition metals, may lead to the emergence of new targeted material properties. For instance, high quality ZnO nanocrystals doped with transition metal cations lead to enhanced optical absorption of light in visible range. The pristine ZnO NWs used in our previous work did not exhibit visible light absorption and transmittance of ZnO NWs and PDMS based smart <b>window</b> <b>device</b> was regulated by changing scattering cross-section. The visible light absorption could increase efficiency of smart <b>window</b> <b>device,</b> because during electrophoretic alignment of NWs towards direction of electric field will change not only scattering, but also visible light absorption cross-section. One-dimensional ZnO nanostructures have been synthesized by wet chemical techniques including microemulsion hydrothermal synthesis, surfactant-assisted hydrothermal orientation growth and alcohol solution refluxing. However, synthesis of high quality transition metal doped ZnO nanowires with small diameter and high aspect ratio is still a challenge. Most wet chemical methods fail to produce high aspect ratio doped ZnO NWs in large quantities. Here we are demonstrating large-scale, single-step, direct solvothermal method and have successfully prepared high aspect ratio single crystalline transition metal (Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn) doped ZnO NWs. The solvothermal synthesis process presented here can be scaled up to macro scale production and the fact that NWs need no further modification increases the technological potential of oxide semiconductor nanowire suspension based <b>devices</b> electro-optical smart <b>window</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
