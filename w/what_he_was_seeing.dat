5|$|The King of Sparta– Featured in God of War comic #6. The King's Guard was {{convinced}} by Kratos' wife Lysandra to allow Kratos {{to embark on}} a quest for the Ambrosia that would restore their plague-stricken daughter, Calliope. Kratos and his men were given until the next full moon to return before the King executed his daughter. Ultimately successful, Kratos returned, saved Calliope, and gave the rest of the elixir to the King. The King then officially awarded Kratos with the rank of Captain. The King of Sparta also appears as an illusion created by Tisiphone in Ascension where he honors Kratos for his service as his best general. Kratos believed <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> at first until he saw Tisiphone's ring on the king's finger. He kicked Tisiphone off the balcony, dispelling her illusion. When Kratos {{was on the verge of}} victory over the Furies, Tisiphone changed into the form of the King once again, telling him that he was unworthy of being called a Spartan. The character was voiced by Crispin Freeman in Ascension.|$|E

He {{was struck by how}} [...] "dozens of these people , they were just so alive, but I looked at them now and they were just husks.

60|$|And often, at such times, {{he would}} {{abruptly}} see slouch {{in among the}} company a young hoodlum in square-cut coat and under a stiff-rim Stetson hat. It happened {{to him at the}} Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon. As he rose from his chair and stepped forward across the platform, he saw stalk through the wide door {{at the rear of the}} great room the young hoodlum with the square-cut coat and stiff-rim hat. Five hundred fashionably gowned women turned their heads, so intent and steadfast was Martin's gaze, to see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing.</b> But they saw only the empty centre aisle. He saw the young tough lurching down that aisle and wondered if he would remove the stiff-rim which never yet had he seen him without. Straight down the aisle he came, and up the platform. Martin could have wept over that youthful shade of himself, when he thought of all that lay before him. Across the platform he swaggered, right up to Martin, and into the foreground of Martin's consciousness disappeared. The five hundred women applauded softly with gloved hands, seeking to encourage the bashful great man who was their guest. And Martin shook the vision from his brain, smiled, and began to speak.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile, {{how many}} others have gone--Jenkin, Hodgson, and I know not who besides; and of that tide of {{students}} that used to throng the arch and blacken the quadrangle, how many are scattered into the remotest parts of the earth, and how many more have lain down beside their fathers in their [...] "resting-graves"! And again, {{how many of these}} last have not found their way there, all too early, through the stress of education! That was one thing, at least, from which my truantry protected me. I am sorry indeed that I have no Greek, but I should be sorrier still if I were dead; nor do I know the name of that branch of knowledge which is worth acquiring at the price of a brain fever. There are many sordid tragedies {{in the life of the}} student, above all if he be poor, or drunken, or both; but nothing more moves a wise man's pity than the case of the lad who is in too much hurry to be learned. And so, for the sake of a moral at the end, I will call up one more figure, and have done. A student, ambitious of success by that hot, intemperate manner of study that now grows so common, read night and day for an examination. As he went on, the task became more easy to him, sleep was more easily banished, his brain grew hot and clear and more capacious, the necessary knowledge daily fuller and more orderly. It came to the eve of the trial, and he watched all night in his high chamber, reviewing what he knew, and already secure of success. His window looked eastward, and being (as I said) high up, and the house itself standing on a hill, commanded a view over dwindling suburbs to a country horizon. At last my student drew up his blind, and still in quite a jocund humour, looked abroad. Day was breaking, the east was tinging with strange fires, the clouds breaking up for the coming of the sun; and at the sight, nameless terror seized upon his mind. He was sane, his senses were undisturbed; he saw clearly, and knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing,</b> and knew that it was normal; but he could neither bear to see it nor find the strength to look away, and fled in panic from his chamber into the enclosure of the street. In the cool air and silence, and among the sleeping houses, his strength was renewed. Nothing troubled him but the memory of what had passed, and an abject fear of its return.|$|E

5000|$|It was in Art and Illusion that he {{introduced}} {{the ideas of}} 'schemata', 'making and matching', 'correction' and 'trial and error' influenced by 'conjecture and refutation', in Popper's philosophy of science. In Gombrich's view, the artist compares <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has drawn or painted with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> trying to draw/paint, and by a 'feedback loop' gradually corrects the drawing/painting to look more like <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>seeing.</b> The process does not start from scratch, however. Each artist inherits '"schemata" [...] that designate reality by force of convention'. These schemata, plus the techniques and works of previous masters, are the starting points from which the artist begins her own process of trial and error.|$|R

In 1791 he published an important early study on the topography of the Moon entitled Selenotopographische Fragmente zur genauern Kenntniss der Mondfläche. The visual lunar albedo scale developed in this work waslater popularised by Thomas Gwyn Elger and now bears his name. In 1793 {{he was the first to}} notice the phase anomaly of Venus, now known as the Schröter effect, where the phase appears more concave than geometry predicts.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, Soji is joined {{on the beach}} by Tsukasa, and together, they sit and {{look out at the}} sun. It is also {{revealed}} that with the purging of the timeline Soji's past has changed. The National Times reports that a man named Ichiro Nakajima was beaten to death by his flatmate Noriko Kifune. In the wake of Mother's death, Ryuko Tagawa never existed, and hence Soji is no longer a wanted felon. Elsewhere, Yorito awakens on a dimly lit boulevard. As he comes to, he notices yamibito strolling past, casually going about every day activity; one pushing a pram, one purchasing items from a stall, children yamibito playing. In the sky, the sun is hidden beyond an apparently permanent total eclipse. Unable to tell if <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>is</b> reality or an illusion, if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{in the realm of the}} yamibito or imagining it all, he begins to scream and opens fire on the yamibito, gunning down many of them as they attempt to flee.|$|R

In his pain, Plato continues, the freed prisoner would turn away and run back to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> accustomed to (that is, the shadows of the carried objects).

The family contacted Dr. Oliver Sacks, a famous neurologist known for his book Awakenings, who, along with other physicians, concluded that Shirl would need to relearn how to identify objects that he could feel and smell by using their visual cues.

Belichick also felt that Jim Kelly was not as good at reading defenses as some other elite quarterbacks were (for example, Joe Montana), and that Kelly tended to [...] "freeze" [...] <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> from a series and then use that information on the next one, which meant the Giants could be {{a step ahead of}} him all game if they alternated their cover plans from drive to drive.|$|E

When he opened his eyes he saw Dadaji sitting and again in a few seconds he saw Lord Shiva in Dadaji's place. When this carried on for sometime, Dadaji said to Gauri Shankerji that if was still finding it hard to believe then he should come closer and touch him. When Gauri Shankerji touched him with his hands Dadaji again revealed himself in Lord Shiva's form. Lord Shiva was in the legs folded and sitting posture when Gauri Shankerji touched him.

While in Paris, Graindorge attends the scientific-themed meetings of the home of Melchisédech Thévenot. At the Thévenot, Graindorge witnessed dissections by the noted anatomist Nicholas Steno and becomes even more convinced of the importance of experiment-based knowledge. He begins corresponding to Huet about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>seeing</b> in Paris, which Huet uses as a basis for the programs at the academy in Caen.

5000|$|Kelli Williams as Dr. Gillian Foster, Dr. Lightman's {{psychologist}} colleague in The Lightman Group who analyses {{patterns of}} voice, language, and behavior. She can be somewhat impulsive but is very professional with the clients and subjects in public. While she occasionally disagrees {{with some of}} Lightman's actions, she has an open pact with Lightman: not to let their professional skill interfere with coworkers' personal lives. Her husband's lack of candor often challenges this: When Cal believes her husband, Alec, is cheating on her, <b>he</b> simply ignores <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>seeing,</b> much to Torres's dismay. It is later revealed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not cheating on her but was trying to overcome his drug addiction; they promptly divorce. Gillian had adopted a baby (Sophie) who was eventually returned to the birth mother. This character is based on Dr. Maureen O’Sullivan, Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the University of San Francisco.|$|R

[...] "his body language and expression here is totally different {{now than when}} we saw him before," [...] he opined. [...] "He's a fast learner." [...] Gilbert referred to his accent as [...] "spotty", while Goldman professed that Lincoln fit into character very well; [...] "For much of the pilot, he's {{on his own and}} exudes a lot of believable, shocked emotion, as Rick tries to process <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>seeing.</b> Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln's performance was one of the episode's drawbacks. He wrote: [...] "One drawback in [...] is that Lincoln plays his emotion a little too close to his deputy's badge. We're told– by him– that all he wants to do is find his wife and kid. His belief that they still are alive is the emotional drive of the story, but there's not enough deep pain that seeps up to coat the dialogue Lincoln delivers." ...|$|R
50|$|Katrinaville Chronicles is Spielman's {{start to}} a {{long-term}} photographic essay about Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. Not being a “hard news” guy, his approach {{was that of}} an observer trying to document {{what happened to his}} city, New Orleans. Working slowly and very deliberately he traversed the city searching for images that would tell a story. Spielman always attempts to render the best possible image leaving his biases out of the way. This book also includes his e-mails to family and friends. Never thinking that his words and observations would be part of a book. It was just his first person account of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> and feeling after the storm when the city was almost void of people. He modeled his work after that of the wonderful photographers who documented the Great Depression and Dust Bowl. This was his WPA; the only difference was there was no government funding, no editors to help tell them where to go. He was on his own, shooting and funding his work without any outside help.|$|E
5000|$|By 1941 it {{was obvious}} to all that the {{arrangement}} was not working; Whittle was constantly frustrated by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> as Rover's inability to deliver production-quality parts for a test engine, and became increasingly vocal about his complaints. Likewise Rover was losing interest in the project after the delays and constant harassment from Power Jets in the critical testing process stage, where testing new designs and materials to breaking point is vital. Earlier, in 1940, Stanley Hooker of Rolls-Royce had met with Whittle, and later introduced him to Ernest Hives. Rolls-Royce had a fully developed supercharger division, directed by Hooker, which was naturally suited to jet engine work. Hives agreed to supply key parts to help the project along. Eventually, by mutual agreement between the Minister of Aircraft Production and the Boards of Rover and Rolls-Royce, the Rover jet factory at Barnoldswick was exchanged for the Rolls-Royce Meteor tank engine factory in Nottingham. Subsequent Rolls-Royce jet engines would be designated in an [...] "RB" [...] series, the /26 Derwent becoming the RB.26.|$|E
