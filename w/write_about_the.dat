5|$|After the book's publication, Szalavitz {{continued}} to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> controversy surrounding the troubled-teen industry for Statistical Assessment Service, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Reason, and The American Prospect. The House Committee on Education and Labor held additional {{hearings on the}} matter on April 24, 2008, again chaired by Representative George Miller.|$|E
5|$|England won {{the final}} match by one wicket, but lost the series 2–1. While {{contemporary}} critics did not blame MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy. MacLaren {{believed that the}} choices of the selectors had {{made it impossible to}} win, and continued to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> series for many years. He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15.|$|E
50|$|He has <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{history and}} {{philosophy}} of art <b>writing,</b> raising questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relativism of art writing in different eras by comparing texts <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same artwork and analyzing changing styles of interpretation.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} Ardhanarishvara {{images are}} dated to the Kushan period, {{starting from the}} first century CE. Its iconography evolved and was perfected in the Gupta era. The Puranas and various iconographic treatises <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mythology and iconography of Ardhanarishvara. While Ardhanarishvara remains a popular iconographic form found in most Shiva temples throughout India, very few temples are dedicated to this deity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Reed, who {{was trying}} to get home, was unable to get State Department {{clearance}} for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called Christiana), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April. On orders from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would work late, with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E

5|$|The {{first people}} to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> May Revolution were {{participants}} who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works were motivated by purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain {{the reasons for their}} actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E
5|$|White {{said that}} The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced him to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sort of world {{he would like}} to live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but had to go out to work. Hence he relied on {{epidemics}} and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, Vachss worked as an attorney, in New York City, specializing in child abuse cases; {{he also had a}} career as a novelist. The duality of Vachss' work as a lawyer prosecuting and {{defending}} real cases and as a crime fiction author writing about fictional criminals resulted in Vachss being compared to the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Vachss' eighth novel, Footsteps of the Hawk, in the Burke series featuring a vigilante private investigator of child abuse cases, was released just two months before the publication of Batman: The Ultimate Evil. He had wanted to approach the topic of sex tourism in southeast Asia, but had been unable to find a way for the Burke character to go there; the Batman character offered the chance for him to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> topic.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's writing {{technique}} was unpretentious {{with a natural}} element of humour about it. It focused on ordinary people, reminding the reader of next-door neighbours, cousins and the like, thereby providing a greater ability {{to relate to the}} topic. Unlike his national contemporaries, he was able to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> intricacies of Indian society without having to modify his characteristic simplicity to conform to trends and fashions in fiction writing. He also employed the use of nuanced dialogic prose with gentle Tamil overtones based on the nature of his characters. Critics have considered Narayan to be the Indian Chekhov, due to the similarities in their writings, the simplicity and the gentle beauty and humour in tragic situations. Greene considered Narayan to be more similar to Chekhov than any Indian writer. Anthony West of The New Yorker considered Narayan's writings to be of the realism variety of Nikolai Gogol.|$|E
5|$|Simon Spies, {{owner of}} Spies Rejser, speculated in February 1971 {{that he might}} merge his airline Conair of Scandinavia with Trans Polar, {{although}} he also stated that once his airline received new aircraft {{it would no longer}} necessarily need to charter aircraft from other airlines. Trans Polar was subject to a lawsuit by a laid-off pilot which the airline owed NOK26,600 in pay and compensation for him paying his own connection flights to reach Trans Polar charters. The company had issued several cheques and bills of exchange that had bounced and the pilot threatened to bankrupt the airline unless he was paid. The company responded that he would have a very difficult time bankrupting them and the press should instead <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> airline's future, which they regarded as very bright.|$|E

She had also had a long-held interest in environmental issues. It was produced by former Miss Indonesia, Nadine Chandrawinata, together with Andini's father, the director Garin Nugroho. Andini has stated that she only consulted with her father {{and that he was}} not directly involved in the production, while Chandrawinata described herself as assistant producer, with Nugroho in charge. Artistic direction was handled by Timothy D Setyanto, with costumes by Retno Ratih Damayanti and make-up by Erwin Wijaya. Cinematography was completed by Ipung Rachmat Syaiful.

5000|$|Though {{there is}} dispute {{as to who}} <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> idea first, the [...] "three-self" [...] method is {{attributed}} to both Anderson and Henry Venn.
