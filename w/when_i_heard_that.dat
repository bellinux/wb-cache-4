500|$|In 1936, Kalep {{published}} {{the first edition}} of Air Babies, a children's book that she wrote and illustrated to teach children about flying. The story followed two young planes, Happy Wings and Speedy, and a 1938 reprint included a foreword from Earhart, who embarked on her last flight three days after writing the piece; she disappeared while flying in 1937. Kalep later said of Earhart's disappearance: [...] "I miss her very much. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Amelia had disappeared, well, I fell apart." [...] She visited the 1939 New York World's Fair to promote Air Babies on television and to speak at the National Woman's Party luncheon.|$|E
500|$|Cambridge boat club {{president}} Mark Horton immediately {{challenged the}} Oxford president Andy Michelmore to a re-row; {{the challenge was}} declined. [...] Horton recalls [...] "It was hard to take and is still a painful memory. [...] The Boat Race {{was supposed to be}} one of the proudest moments of my life". [...] Cambridge's Mark Bathurst was indignant about the preparation of the boat: [...] "we had taken to the water without fitting any [...] – an act of monumental idiocy". [...] Oxford cox Fail told The Guardian [...] "I was surprised <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Cambridge had sunk. [...] If you keep going steadily you forget about water and ride it out." ...|$|E
500|$|David Giler {{performed}} a rewrite; Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins, friends of Spielberg, suggested the plot device of a kidnapped child. Spielberg {{then began to}} write the script. The song [...] "When You Wish upon a Star" [...] from Pinocchio influenced Spielberg's writing style. [...] "I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me personally." [...] Jerry Belson and Spielberg wrote the shooting script together. In the end, Spielberg was given solo writing credit. During pre-production, the title was changed from Kingdom Come to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. J. Allen Hynek, who worked with the United States Air Force on Project Blue Book, {{was hired as a}} scientific consultant. Hynek felt [...] "even though the film is fiction, it's based for the most part on the known facts of the UFO mystery, and it certainly catches the flavor of the phenomenon. Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another blockbuster after Jaws, but he decided to make a UFO movie. He put his career on the line." [...] USAF and NASA declined to cooperate on the film. In fact, NASA reportedly sent a 20-page letter to Spielberg, telling him that releasing the film was dangerous. In an interview, he said: [...] "I really found my faith <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> the Government was opposed to the film. If NASA took the time to write me a 20-page letter, then I knew there must be something happening." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Kick, Thomas fused the funk {{and soul}} of The Swing with the {{mainstream}} rock of Listen Like Thieves. In an interview with MusicRadar, Andrew stated, [...] "The melding of funk and rock was always in our heads. We were very excited {{about the idea of}} overlaying two types of songs and genres together." [...] This combination, along with the songwriting prowess between Andrew and Hutchence resulted in Kick: an energetic, emotional and upbeat album. Music Journalist Steve Huey of AllMusic identified with the album's musical style, stating, [...] "Kick crystallized all of the band's influeces – stones-y rock & roll, pop, funk, contemporary dance-pop – into a cool, stylish dance/rock hybrid. Nick Launay, producer of the band's fourth studio album The Swing noted, [...] "They'd lean more toward funk on The Swing and then they'd lean toward rock on Thieves to make it in America. By the time Kick came around, it was time to lean toward funk again. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> album , I thought, wow, they got it right".|$|E
2500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times of October 23, 2008 [...] "the {{news that}} the Republican National Committee has bought Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and her family nearly $150,000 worth of {{clothing}} since September has fueled charges of hypocrisy by her detractors and sparked questions about {{the legality of the}} expenditures [...] Election-law experts are split on whether the RNC's expenditure is allowable under federal laws, which prohibit the use of campaign funds for personal use." [...] Tracey Schmitt, Palin's traveling press secretary responded by saying [...] "It was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign." [...] "I am an Obama supporter, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> for $150,000, they dressed her, her children and her husband, I thought, 'that's not much, said Vicki Sanchez, a costume designer who dressed Geena Davis as the first female U.S. president on the short-lived TV show Commander in Chief." [...] She continues on to say [...] "When you start buying $3,000 suits, boots that cost anywhere from $800 and up, and designer shoes, which cost $500 at least, it goes fast." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Zhou Yu died, he, {{along with}} Gan Ning and others, had {{constantly}} urged Sun Quan to attack Yi Province (益州; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor, Liu Zhang. However, Zhou Yu died of illness while making preparations for {{an invasion of}} Yi Province. When Sun Quan asked Liu Bei for his opinion, Liu Bei, who secretly had the intention of seizing Yi Province for himself, lied to Sun Quan, [...] "Liu Zhang and I {{are members of the}} imperial clan, so we should strive to uphold the Han dynasty with the aid of our ancestors' blessings. Now, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Liu Zhang has offended his neighbours, I feel afraid and don't dare to probe further. I hope you can show leniency towards him. If you don't, I'll retire and return to the countryside." [...] Liu Bei revealed his true intentions later when he attacked Liu Zhang himself and eventually seized control of Yi Province. During the campaign against Liu Zhang, Liu Bei left his general Guan Yu behind to guard Jing Province in his absence. When Sun Quan heard about Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province, he angrily remarked, [...] "This cunning barbarian dares to trick me!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Han Jin Chunqiu (漢晉春秋) by Xi Zuochi (習鑿齒) further {{described}} this uncanny friendship between Lu Kang and Yang Hu. After returning to Jin, Yang Hu started promoting morality and civility, and many Wu citizens {{were impressed with}} him. Lu Kang told the Wu forces stationed at the Wu-Jin border, [...] "If they govern with virtue and we administer our state like tyrants, we'll lose the war without even having to fight. I hope that you can guard the border well and not stir up problems over trivial matters." [...] The Wu-Jin border experienced peace and stability as both sides actively practised détente and got along harmoniously with each other. If cattle from one side accidentally strayed across the border, the other side would allow the owners {{to cross the border}} and retrieve their cattle. During hunting expeditions in the Mian (沔) area at the border, if the citizens of either side were injured, the other would send them home safely. When Lu Kang fell sick, he asked for medicine from Yang Hu. Yang Hu obliged and said, [...] "This medicine is of fine quality. I prepared it myself. I haven't tried it myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> you're ill so I sent it to you." [...] Lu Kang's subordinates cautioned him against taking Yang Hu's medicine because they were worried that Yang might harm him, but Lu ignored them. When the Wu emperor Sun Hao received news of peaceful relations between Wu and Jin, he sent a messenger to reprimand Lu Kang, but Lu replied, [...] "Ordinary peasants in the countryside have to keep their promises, much less me, a government official. If I do not live the virtues, I will appear as a stark contrast to Yang Hu. This does not result in any harm to Yang Hu." [...] However, there were some who disagreed with the behaviour of Lu Kang and Yang Hu, as they believed that Lu and Yang were not fulfilling their loyalties to their respective states.|$|E
