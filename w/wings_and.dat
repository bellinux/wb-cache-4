5|$|Glareolidae is {{a family}} of wading birds {{comprising}} the pratincoles, which have short legs, long pointed <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> long forked tails, and the coursers, which have long legs, short <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> long, pointed bills which curve downwards.|$|E
5|$|The other subspecies, sclateri, has {{slightly}} longer <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> a smaller bill. The plumage is less golden, with the forehead and uppertail-coverts being blue-green, and {{with both the}} <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> tail being blue-black.

40|$|In this study, the {{seasonal}} variation of fecundity, <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> tibia length were investigated in natural populations of Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann, 1819) {{in an attempt}} to determine the changes in life history of the species as a function of seasonality. A relative constant temporal trajectory was found for fecundity, <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> tibia length over twenty-four months. Positive correlations between fecundity <b>and</b> <b>wing</b> size, fecundity <b>and</b> tibia size <b>and</b> <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> tibia sizes were observed. The implications of these results for population dynamics of C. albiceps are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Available {{information}} {{on the effects of}} wing-fuselage-tail and wing-nacelle interference on the distribution of the air load among components of airplanes is analyzed. The effects of <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> nacelle incidence, horizontal andvertical position of <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> nacelle, fuselage shape, <b>wing</b> section <b>and</b> filleting are considered. Where sufficient data were unavailable to determine the distribution of the air load, the change in lift caused by interference between <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> fuselage was found. This increment is affected to the greatest extent by vertical wing position...|$|R

5|$|Gryllus firmus {{exhibits}} wing polymorphism; {{some individuals}} have fully functional, long hind <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> others have short <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> cannot fly. The short-winged females have smaller flight muscles, greater ovarian development, and produce more eggs, so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such as {{the ground}} crickets (Nemobiinae), are wingless; others have small fore <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> no hind wings (Copholandrevus), others lack hind <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> have {{shortened}} fore wings in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings longer than the fore wings. In Teleogryllus, the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100%. Probably, most species with hind wings longer than fore wings engage in flight.|$|E

5|$|The {{flight of}} the Alpine chough is swift and acrobatic with loose deep wing beats. Its high {{manoeuvrability}} is accomplished by fanning the tail, folding its <b>wings,</b> <b>and</b> soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces.

5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
