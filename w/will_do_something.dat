Medics pulled about 200 pellets of birdshot from his chest and arms. Abutaki's elder brother, Ahmed, who was in the morgue while holding his brothers' hands, {{recalled}} the last conversation they had the previous night for the media present: [...] "He said, 'This is my chance, to have a say, so that maybe our country <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for us.'

During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to about such things, all the people are mad with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June.

500|$|Oliver Kent {{continued}} {{his role as}} Executive Producer, while Erika Hossington remained as Series Producer. This series consisted of 43 episodes. As the show built towards its thirtieth anniversary in 2016, Hossington revealed {{in an interview that}} the special episode <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> [...] "no other show has done before." [...] In the interview, Hossington said: [...] "I'm very keen to make it a big event! We spoke about live episodes and things like that, but we decided that none of those things were satisfying as they've all been done. What we're doing, no other show has done before..." [...] Producer of Holby City, Simon Harper, also announced in an interview plans for a crossover event with sister show Holby City in celebration for Casualty's thirtieth anniversary. It was later revealed by Charles Venn in an interview with What's on TV on 8 June 2016, that his character, Nurse Jacob Masters, would be {{at the forefront of the}} anniversary episode. Venn said in the interview his character would play [...] "an integral part" [...] in the 110-minute special anniversary episode. Venn also went on to say that the cast and crew brand the thirtieth anniversary episode Casualty: The Movie.|$|E

The statue was welded by sculptor Alfie Bradley, and funded by the British Ironworks Centre of Oswestry. According to Bradley, many of the spoons were donated by schoolchildren from around the world.

2500|$|Alice, {{frequently}} spoiled with gifts, matured into young womanhood, {{and became}} known as a great beauty like her mother. However, continuing tension with her stepmother and prolonged separation and limited attention from her father created {{a young woman who}} was as independent and outgoing as she was self-confident and calculating. When her father was Governor of New York, he and his wife proposed that Alice attend a conservative school for girls in New York City.

2500|$|While Wolfram advocates simple {{programs}} {{as a scientific}} discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is {{that the study of}} simple programs is the minimal possible form of science, [...] grounded equally in both abstraction and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in NKS is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.|$|E

2500|$|After an eleven-month hiatus, Faith No More played four {{shows in}} South America in November 2011. On {{the first date}} (November 8, 2011), the band played a [...] "mystery song," [...] which led to {{speculation}} of new material. They played Sonisphere France on July 7, 2012. Following several more shows in Europe during 2012, Faith No More [...] became temporarily inactive again. Mike Patton spent 2013 touring with his reformed rock supergroup Tomahawk, while the band's other members also pursued their own side projects. In July 2013, Billy Gould confirmed that the band's hiatus would not be permanent, saying [...] "We <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> again only when all members are with the focus on that, and ready for the challenge.

2500|$|Rhett and Link met in 1984 on September 4th (this is {{the exact}} date they started school in Harnett County) at Buies Creek Elementary School in Buies Creek, North Carolina, where they {{attended}} first grade, a meeting about which they have subsequently written a song and made a movie (Looking For Ms. Locklear - 2008). [...] They met through having to stay in at recess, as they were both doodling on their desks. In an interview on The Tonight Show, they state that they stayed in during recess because {{both of them had}} written swear words on their desks. They stayed in and colored in mythical creatures such as a unicorn (hence their YouTube channel name, GMM/Good Mythical Morning) In their freshman year of high school at Harnett Central High School in Angier, North Carolina, both Rhett and Link signed a blood oath {{on a piece of paper}} which said, [...] "We <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> together some day". Link kept it through his adulthood in a wallet. Unfortunately, the wallet was lost, along with the original copy of the paper.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, 16 {{years after}} her debut appearance, Kasumi was {{redesigned}} to look less cartoon-like and more realistic with a [...] "grown up" [...] appearance in DOA5. The game's art director Yuta Saito said, [...] "From DOA4 we wanted to evolve the characters in a slightly realistic direction. The most difficult, and you don't have to ask, is Kasumi. Kasumi {{is the face of}} DOA and the eternal heroine. And for such a popular character like Kasumi, to change her form we really needed a lot of courage and it really was a big challenge. But if we didn't do that, we couldn't make DOA5 and we wouldn't be able to show you anything." [...] Producer Yasuke Hayashi said the processn of remodeling Kasumi has sparked most disputes in the development team, especially since she is [...] "a character that is not so much out on the table, with [...] hidden feelings, and it's been difficult to express such a 'hidden look'." [...] GamesRadar noted that [...] "the manga influences on her facial featureswhile still apparenthave been scaled right back nd her boobs seem less ludicrously unmanageable." [...] Itagaki, who has left Team Ninja in 2008, said in 2014: [...] "Straightly speakin‚Äô, my daughter was totally ruined, spoiled. I can‚Äôt/shouldn‚Äôt avert my eyes from that fact.

2500|$|Garfield's {{world has}} {{specific}} locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, {{a place he}} loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food {{is the center of}} most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon does take Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to. Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, [...] "I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 {{profile of}} Silvers, The New York Times noted: [...] "His {{greatest}} pleasure ... is simply good writing, which {{he talks about}} as others talk about fine wine or good food. Speaking about writers he likes, he sometimes flushes with enthusiasm. 'I admire great writers, people with marvelous and beautiful minds, and always hope they <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> special and revealing for us.'" [...] Philip Marino, in The University of Chicago Magazine, commented: [...] "Like a chemist pairing ingredients to induce a specific reaction, Silvers has built his career matching the right author and subject, in hopes of generating an exciting and illuminating result. ... 'he puts a writer together with material that even the writer might not have thought was appropriate,' says Daniel Mendelsohn". Glen Weldon, writing for NPR, concurred: [...] "He encouraged writers to craft each review as a vigorous intellectual argument, and delighted in pairing reviewers with books that challenged their personal or political worldview." [...] Professor Peter Brown wrote: [...] "Reviewing for Bob Silvers was like playing in the sprinkling rain of a mighty fountain ... to be doused in the sheer, bubbling delight of Bob‚Äôs own unquenchable enthusiasm and alert, discerning curiosity. It widened the heart". In The Nation, Harvard professor Stanley Hoffmann observed that, in publishing {{some of the earliest}} criticisms of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, Silvers realized what other commentators missed: [...] "In both instances, Bob Silvers was, in effect, whether deliberately or not, compensating for the weaknesses of the more established media. ... It was important that a journal which has the authority of the Review in a sense took up the slack and presented viewpoints which were extremely hard to get into the established media." [...] The Nation added, during the Iraq war:One suspects [...] yearn for the day when they can return to their normal publishing routine ‚Äì that gentlemanly pastiche of philosophy, art, classical music, photography, German and Russian history, East European politics, literary fiction ‚Äì unencumbered by political duties of a confrontational or oppositional nature. That day has not yet arrived. If and when it does, let it be said that the editors met the challenges of the post-9/11 era in a way that most other leading American publications did not, and that The New York Review of Books ... was there when we needed it most.|$|E
