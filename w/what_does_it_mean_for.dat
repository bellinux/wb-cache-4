50|$|<b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> {{an object}} to have {{something}} essentially? Essentiality {{can be explained by}} referencing necessity and/or possible worlds. Mereological essentialism is then the thesis that objects have their parts necessarily or objects have their parts in every possible world in which the object exists. In other words, an object X composed of parts a, b, c, and d ceases to exist if it loses part d. Additionally, object X ceases to exist if it gains a new part e.|$|E
50|$|The {{link between}} {{stewardship}} and environmentalism is a contentious one. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> humans 'to {{take care of}} the world'? Environmental stewardship is typically thought of as entailing reducing human impacts into the natural world. However, Neil Paul Cummins claims that humans have a special stewardship role on the planet because through their technology humans are able to save life from otherwise certain elimination. This is a modern-day interpretation of Noah’s Ark, the cornerstone of human stewardship being technological protection and regulation.|$|E
5000|$|Behavioural theory: <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> two {{processes}} {{to be the}} same? How can we decide whether two processes are different or not? Can we find representatives for equivalence classes of processes? Generally, processes {{are considered to be}} the same if no context, that is other processes running in parallel, can detect a difference. Unfortunately, making this intuition precise is subtle and mostly yields unwieldy characterisations of equality (which in most cases must also be undecidable, {{as a consequence of the}} halting problem). Bisimulations are a technical tool that aids reasoning about process equivalences.|$|E

The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises? and <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?
