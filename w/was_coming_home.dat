25|$|Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally {{talking to}} {{him as if he}} is still alive. One evening, as she is {{returning}} home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems to be following her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from when she was a small child and had attempted to hide a stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved her table scraps for it anyway. One day as she <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>home,</b> her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly swatter. This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, begging to keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river.|$|E

500|$|On November 11, Ortega-Hernandez {{parked his}} vehicle on Constitution Avenue, [...] {{directly}} {{south of the}} White House. He aimed his semi-automatic rifle from the car's passenger seat and fired. Gunfire was reported around 9pm. One bullet hit an antique window on the White House's second floor near the first family's formal living room; however, it did not penetrate the bulletproof glass on the inside. One bullet lodged in a window frame, and others ricocheted off the roof, causing small pieces of wood and concrete to fall to the ground. At least seven bullets struck the second floor, causing $97,000 worth of damage. A woman in a taxi nearby witnessed the shooting and wrote on Twitter, [...] "Driver {{in front of my}} cab STOPPED and fired 5 gun shots at the White House. It took the police a while to respond."
