50|$|A plain buttonhole, by far {{the most}} common type. In plain buttonholes, the raw (cut) edges of the textile are {{finished}} with thread in very closely spaced stitches (if made by hand, often the buttonhole stitch) with a gimp cord at the edges to act as a reinforcement. When stitched by hand, a slit is made in the fabric first and the result is called a <b>worked</b> <b>buttonhole.</b>|$|E

Aunt Janet won't let me put pebbles in my shoes, but I've put a thistle next my skin on my back and it sticks into me if I lean back the least bit. And I'm going to <b>work</b> <b>buttonholes</b> all over this cotton. I hate working buttonholes worse than {{anything}} in the world, so I'm going to work them all day." ...|$|R

50|$|Blanket stitch, {{buttonhole}} stitch, and eyelet stitch all had {{the original}} function of strengthening the edges of textiles subject to daily wear and tear, but were adapted for decorative purposes. In North Africa and the Middle East, eyelet stitch is made using a spoked wheel pattern of stitches, or in the Algerian form without an enclosing circle. In Turkmenistan, hook and tulip motifs could be <b>worked</b> in <b>buttonhole</b> stitch. In Afghanistan, men's shirts could be embroidered with herringbone and buttonhole stitches in white silk on white cotton, in elaborate arabesques.|$|R
60|$|Mark {{again how}} Kismet works! This would not happen {{once in a}} hundred years. Towards {{the end of his}} dinner with the two Chaplains, the Colonel let out his {{waistcoat}} and leaned over the table to look at some Mission Reports. The bar of the watch-guard <b>worked</b> through the <b>buttonhole,</b> and the watch--Platte's watch--slid quietly on to the carpet. Where the bearer found it next morning and kept it.|$|R
