500|$|In the {{following}} episode, [...] "It's Coming", {{set in the}} present, Arthur Petrelli, head of Pinehearst, arranges for Sylar to speak with Elle. His aim is to have Sylar use his latent empathic abilities to take powers, rather than doing so through killing. Elle is chained {{to the floor in}} a metal room, still in pain from her ability. She repeatedly attacks him, furious at Sylar for her father's murder, eventually begging him to kill her so that her pain <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> He forgives her for turning him into a monster and convinces her to forgive herself for her crimes, wanting to take away her pain without killing her. At that moment, Elle's pain disappears and she regains control of her ability. Likewise, Sylar is able to absorb her power. The two appear to rekindle their old feelings for each other as Elle teaches Sylar how to use her ability.|$|E
500|$|After an {{undisclosed}} financial settlement was agreed Mills left Alfreton {{to return to}} Tamworth, who at this time were in the Conference National, for a second spell as manager on 26 January 2007.

We all need to stay proud and positive and I will now prepare a squad for the start of next season." [...] Tamworth spent most of 2007–08 in midtable, eventually finishing 15th in the Conference North; the Tamworth Herald claimed it was [...] "among the poorest campaigns in the club's history".|$|E

2500|$|To {{preserve}} that {{institutional memory}} {{and continue to}} attract intrinsically motivated employees, the government will likely need alternative models to replace or supplement the popular business model of performance-related pay.
