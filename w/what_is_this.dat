5|$|The {{original}} bassist for Anthem, which renamed to Anthym, {{was deemed}} unsatisfactory, so Slovak began teaching Flea to play bass. Following {{several months of}} commitment to the instrument, Flea developed proficiency and a strong musical chemistry with Slovak. When Strassman saw Flea playing Anthym songs on his equipment he quit the band, with Flea quickly replacing him. Shortly afterwards Anthym entered a local Battle of the Bands contest and won second place. Anthym started to play at local nightclubs, {{despite the fact that}} the members were all underage. After graduating from high school, the band changed their name to <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?.</b> Flea left Anthym around this time to accept an offer of playing bass in the prominent L.A. punk band Fear. <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?</b> continued on and performed many shows along the California coast.|$|E
25|$|Irons was a {{founding}} member of, and the original drummer for, The Red Hot Chili Peppers. As teenagers, Irons, Johannes, Slovak, and schoolmate Todd Strassman formed the band Chain Reaction in 1976. After its first gig, the band was soon renamed to Anthym. Slovak became dissatisfied with Strassman's bass playing and eventually taught Michael Balzary (Flea) to play bass. Flea quickly surpassed Strassman in bass skills and took over bass duties in Anthym. After graduating from high school, the band {{changed its name to}} <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?</b> (which was a question often asked by people who heard the band play). Flea left the band around this time because he was offered a job playing bass in the prominent Los Angeles punk band Fear. <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?</b> continued on and performed many shows along the California coast.|$|E

25|$|Michael Peter Balzary (born 16 October 1962), {{better known}} by his stage name Flea, is an American {{musician}} and actor {{best known as}} bassist and {{founding member of the}} rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. Flea briefly appeared as the bassist for such bands as <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?,</b> Fear and Jane's Addiction. He has also performed with rock supergroups Atoms for Peace, Antemasque, Pigface, and Rocket Juice & the Moon. Flea has also collaborated with artists including The Mars Volta, Johnny Cash, Tom Waits, Alanis Morissette, and Young MC.|$|E

Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much!

25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

500|$|The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios {{to record}} a demo tape and {{subsequently}} secured a record deal with EMI. Flea left Fear to pursue the Red Hot Chili Peppers. At the same time, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>This?</b> had also gotten a record deal. Since Slovak considered the Chili Peppers to merely be a side project and not a serious commitment, he left them to concentrate on <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>This?</b> Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would suffer musically without them. He and Kiedis hired drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill Irons' and Slovak's places, respectively. [...] During the recording of the second <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>This?</b> album, Slovak became frustrated with the band and contacted Flea about rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This came at an opportune time, as the group was dissatisfied with Slovak's replacement, Jack Sherman. Kiedis felt that Sherman's guitar work [...] "didn't have the same spirit" [...] that Slovak contributed to the band's sound. [...] When Flea asked Kiedis {{how he felt about}} Slovak rejoining the band, Kiedis responded by saying [...] "I'd give my firstborn son to get him back in the band." [...] After the culmination of the promotional tour for their first album, Sherman was fired and Slovak rejoined the band.|$|E
500|$|Born in Haifa, Israel, Slovak immigrated {{with his}} family to the United States in 1967 when he was five years old. Slovak met future bandmates Anthony Kiedis, Flea, and Jack Irons while {{attending}} high school in Los Angeles. He joined the group Anthym along with Irons while attending Fairfax High School; Flea would later join the group, which later changed its name to <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?.</b> [...] Slovak, Flea, Kiedis, and Irons started Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1982, which became popular in the Los Angeles area, playing various shows around the city. However, Slovak quit the band to focus on <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>This?,</b> which had gotten a record deal, leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record their debut album without him. He rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1985, and recorded the albums Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan with the band.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's {{version of}} [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was an {{international}} number 1 {{hit by the}} end of 1970 and through the early months of 1971 – the first solo single by a Beatle to reach the top, and the biggest seller by any of the four throughout the 1970s. Without the support of any concert appearances or promotional interviews by Harrison, the single's commercial success was due to its impact on radio, where, Harrison biographer Gary Tillery writes, the song [...] "rolled across the airwaves like a juggernaut, with commanding presence, much the way Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' had arrived in the mid-sixties". Elton John recalls first hearing [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] in a taxi and names it as the last of the era's great singles: [...] "I thought, 'Oh my God,' and I got chills. You know when a record starts on the radio, and it's great, and you think, 'Oh, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>this,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>this,</b> what is this?' The only other record I ever felt that way about [...] was 'Brown Sugar'..." [...] In his 40-page Harrison tribute article for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore credited [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] as being [...] "as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced".|$|E
500|$|After Red Hot Chili Peppers {{signed a}} record deal with EMI in 1983, {{founding}} members Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons left {{the group to}} focus on their group <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?,</b> which had also signed a record deal. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea hired Jack Sherman as guitarist and Cliff Martinez as drummer, and established themselves as a prominent funk rock band with their 1984 debut album The Red Hot Chili Peppers. Disappointed {{with the results of}} the production, Kiedis and Flea replaced Sherman with Slovak, who had quit his band, <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?,</b> several weeks earlier. The group's George Clinton-produced second album, Freaky Styley (1985), was Slovak's first studio album with the band. [...] In early 1986, the band began work on their upcoming album, and EMI gave the Chili Peppers a budget of $5,000 to record a demo tape. The band chose to work with producer and former Public Image Ltd. guitarist Keith Levene, because he shared the members' interest in drugs. [...] Levene and Slovak put aside $2,000 of the budget to spend on drugs without telling the rest of the group, which created tension between the members. Martinez' [...] "heart was no longer in the band", but he did not quit, so Kiedis and Flea fired him. [...] After the firing of Martinez, original drummer Jack Irons rejoined the band, which marked the first time all four founding members were together since 1983.|$|E
500|$|Aside from collaborations, Harvey {{has also}} {{embarked}} {{on a number of}} projects as a composer. In January 2009, a new stage production of Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler opened on Broadway. Directed by Ian Rickson and starring Mary-Louise Parker in the title role, the play featured an original score of incidental music written by Harvey. In November 2011, Harvey also composed part of the score for the Young Vic's long-running production of Hamlet in London. In May 2012, Harvey composed two songs, [...] "Horse" [...] and [...] "Bobby Don't Steal," [...] for Mark Cousins' film <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>This</b> Film Called Love?, which also features [...] "To Bring You My Love." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the book}} Give It Away: The Stories Behind Every Song, author Rob Fitzpatrick writes [...] "As far as sheer power goes, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan is the Chili Peppers {{at their most}} virile, most chest-beating, most unabashedly macho." [...] However, Kiedis recalls that during the {{composition}} of the album, Beinhorn encouraged him to step away from his improvisational speed-rap style in favor of slower, crooning vocals. At the time, Kiedis was very uncomfortable with his singing voice, and felt that the new style was [...] "sappy". Kiedis also observed that guitarist Hillel Slovak's playing evolved during his time away from the group in <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?,</b> and that Slovak had adopted a more fluid style featuring [...] "sultry" [...] elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques.|$|E
500|$|In late 1983, {{two weeks}} before signing with EMI, Slovak and Irons {{obtained}} a record deal with MCA Records with their other band, <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?,</b> and left Red Hot Chili Peppers. Rather than dissolving the band, Kiedis and Flea decided to recruit new members. Cliff Martinez was hired as the band's new drummer and Martinez's bandmate in The Weirdos, guitarist, Dix Denney was expected to replace Slovak. [...] After a few rehearsals, however, the band felt he didn't fit and auditions continued. [...] Their final candidates were guitarists Mark Nine and Jack Sherman, about whom the band knew nothing. [...] After practicing with Sherman, they {{felt that he was}} the best fit because he worked well with Flea and Martinez. With Martinez and Sherman aboard, the band released their eponymous debut album on August 10, 1984. During the ensuing tour, continuing musical and lifestyle tension between Kiedis and Sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life. Sherman was fired soon after, with Slovak returning to the Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?.</b> At one point, Chuck Biscuits filled in on drums during the 1985 tour. The band dismissed Cliff Martinez from the group in April 1986 due to personal differences and replaced him with founding member Jack Irons, who was out of work and finally separated from other commitments. During this period, however, Kiedis and Slovak had both developed serious drug addictions, which resulted in Kiedis being briefly fired that same year. At one performance, longtime friend and then Circle Jerks frontman, Keith Morris filled in for an absent Kiedis who was out scoring drugs while his band was playing a show. On June 25, 1988, Slovak died of a heroin overdose shortly after the completion of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan tour. Kiedis would then retreat into hiding, further fueling his drug habit and even skipping Slovak's funeral. After a band meeting with manager Lindy Goetz, Irons subsequently left the group, saying {{that he did not want}} to be part of a band where his friends were dying.|$|E
500|$|Lisa Mahapatra from The New Indian Express was {{impressed}} with the story and Tripathi's writing and praised [...] "the interactions between Shiva and Sati, [...] intriguing. Age-old thoughts and philosophies were delivered in a very modern context, which I thought made for an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Mahapatra added that [...] "the only downside throughout the novel, I was unable to really get into the main characters—they remained mostly on a two-dimensional level." [...] It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times, where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi's usage of common, everyday language. [...] "There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written. I wrote to Amish to express one small observation, the script writing is not that sharp. You have words like 'Goddamnit', 'bloody hell', 'In the name of God <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> nonsense?' etc, which I guess would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel you find it falling a little flat," [...] the reviewer concluded.|$|E

500|$|Garran {{developed}} {{a strong relationship}} with Hughes, giving him legal advice on the World War I conscription plebiscites and on the range of regulations which were made under the War Precautions Act 1914. The War Precautions Regulations had a broad scope, and were generally supported by the High Court, which adopted a much more flexible approach to {{the reach of the}} Commonwealth's defence power during wartime. A substantial amount of Garran's work during the war involved preparing and carrying out the regulations. Many of them were directed at maximising the economic aspect of the war effort and ensuring supplies of goods to Australian troops; others were directed at controlling citizens or former citizens of the enemy Central Powers living in Australia. On one occasion, when Hughes had been informed that at a party hosted by a German man, the band had played [...] "Das Lied der Deutschen", Hughes asked Garran [...] "By the way, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> tune?" [...] to which Garran replied that it was Haydn's melody to [...] "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser", and as it was used as the tune to several hymns [...] "it was probably sung in half a dozen churches in Sydney last Sunday." [...] Hughes then said [...] "Good Heavens! I have played that thing with one finger hundreds of times." ...|$|E

Thousands of years have passed by, and, year after year, all the nations of the earth have, each year, sought the rich commerce of that country; all have enjoyed the riches of the East. That trade was sought by King Solomon, by Tyre, Sidon; this wealth found its way to Egypt, and at last to Rome, to France, Portugal, Spain, Holland, England, and finally to this Republic. How vast and incomparably rich must be that country and commerce, which has never ceased, one day, from the highest point of Jewish splendor to the instant that I am speaking, to supply the whole globe with all the busy imagination of man can desire for his ease, comfort, and enjoyment! Whilst we Rave so fair an opportunity offered to participate so largely in all this wealth and enjoyment, if not to govern and direct the whole, can it be possible that doubt, or mere points of speculation, will weigh with the House and cause us to lose forever the brightest prospect ever presented to the eyes of a nation?" ...|$|E
500|$|The album's release {{followed}} the commercial success of other mafioso-themed rap albums with similar subject matter, including Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… (1995), Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt (1996) and AZ's Doe or Die (1995). Music writers criticized its mainstream, R and pop-leaning sound, {{as well as}} the enlistment of a top production unit and popular guest artists. The album's lyrics and themes were also poorly received and heavily dismissed as an attempt by Nas to follow the popularity of gangsta and mafioso rap. Rolling Stones Mark Coleman wrote negatively of Nas's themes and called it [...] "the latest blatant example of trashy tough-guy talk", writing [...] "Certainly he strikes a note of creepy realism in his stories of heavyweight dealing and literally cutthroat competition. 'The Set Up', 'Shootouts' and 'Affirmative Action' [...] are chilling in their how-many-grams-to-a-kilo detail and utter amorality. On 'Watch Dem Niggas', Nas cites as inspirations both the boxing coach Cus D'Amato and the murderous drug lord Pablo Escobar. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> guy thinking?". Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that he [...] "continually shifts perspective" [...] and called it [...] "late-stage gangsta rap, starting to buckle under its own contradictions." [...] The Village Voices Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "neither" [...] (...) rating, indicating [...] "may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two.
