2500|$|The {{proliferation}} of portable wireless communication {{devices such as}} mobile phones, tablet, and laptop computers in recent decades is currently driving the development of mid-range wireless powering and charging technology to {{eliminate the need for}} these devices to be tethered to <b>wall</b> <b>plugs</b> during charging. The Wireless Power Consortium was established in 2008 to develop interoperable standards across manufacturers. [...] Its Qi inductive power standard published in August 2009 enables high efficiency charging and powering of portable devices of up to 5 watts over distances of 4cm (1.6 inches). The wireless device is placed on a flat charger plate (which can be embedded in table tops at cafes, for example) and power is transferred from a flat coil in the charger to a similar one in the device.|$|E

2500|$|A {{hammer drill}} has a {{specially}} designed clutch that allows it to not only spin the drill bit, but also to punch it in and out (along the axis of the bit). The actual distance the bit travels in and out and the force of its blow are both very small, and the hammering action is very rapid—thousands of [...] "BPM" [...] (blows per minute) or [...] "IPM" [...] (impacts per minute). Although each blow is of relatively low force, these thousands of blows per minute are more than adequate to break up concrete or brick, using the masonry drill bit's carbide wedge to pulverize it for the spiral flutes to whisk away. For this reason, a hammer drill drills much faster than a regular drill through concrete or brick. Holes in hard materials are needed for anchor bolts, concrete screws and <b>wall</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|E

40|$|The DC House {{project at}} Cal Poly State University faces a {{challenge}} of supplying DC voltage to household appliances. Each appliance in the DC House constitutes a DC load {{that has a}} unique voltage and power rating, hence {{the need to develop}} a smart DC <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> that will automatically adjust to the operating voltage required by any DC load. This thesis entails a proof of concept design of the smart DC <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> which can automatically detect an appliance’s voltage rating. The design employs a dc-dc converter in conjunction with a microcontroller to sense load current to properly adjust the required load voltage. Hardware implementation to demonstrate the functionality of the smart <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> was developed. Results performed on several dc loads show that the smart <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> is able to adjust to the required load voltage within an acceptable range. An algorithm to improve the accuracy was attempted and presented along with the results. Further recommendations to improve the current design will also be discussed...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} {{here is a}} study of thermally enhanced injection in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). This effect, which we refer to as "thermal pumping", results from Peltier energy exchange from the lattice to charge carriers when current is injected into an LED. For an applied voltage V such that qV < (hw), where q is the electron charge and (hw) is the average emitted photon energy, thermal pumping can greatly enhance the <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> efficiency of an LED. Thermal pumping can even give rise to LED <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> efficiency greater than one, which corresponds to electroluminescent cooling of the diode lattice. Thermal pumping and electroluminescent cooling will be studied through numerical modeling and experiment. Our results include the first ever experimental demonstration of electroluminescent cooling in an LED. Finally we use the intuition gained {{from the study of}} thermal pumping to design an LED for maximized optical power output with 100 % <b>wall</b> <b>plug</b> efficiency. by Dodd Gray. Thesis (M.

50|$|Before {{commercial}} <b>wall</b> <b>plugs,</b> fixings {{were made}} to brick or masonry walls by chiselling a groove into a soft mortar joint, hammering in a crude wooden plug and then attaching to the wooden plug. This was time consuming and required a large hole, thus more patching of the wall afterwards. It also limited the holes' location to the mortar joints.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} of these {{mixtures}} was produced by Rawlplug and was composed of dry white asbestos fibres, sold loose in a tin. The user wetted some into a ball (usually by spitting on them) and pushed this plug of putty into the hole. A small tamper and spike was supplied with the kit. This putty worked very well, but the hazard of the asbestos fibres means that the product is no longer available. However, another way to fix <b>wall</b> <b>plugs</b> is accomplished by the application of a cotton woven pad which has been impregnated with a special formulated gypsum to bond into the wall. The pad is wetted and wrapped around the wall plug, and the two are inserted into the hole; after a short time it hardens and a strong bond is achieved and the wall fitting can be applied. It is used in combination with <b>wall</b> <b>plugs</b> in masonry, ceramic, wood and plasterboard walls.|$|E
