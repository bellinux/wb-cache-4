They remind that decomposing harvest residues and roots increase the carbon emissions of cuttings, and these emissions are only slowly compensated for by increased use of wood products. This would lengthen the period during which avoiding harvests is a competitive strategy in climate change mitigation.|$|R

To analyze this process and its outcomes, the following research questions were examined in this study: How do CMC and FTF contribute to a <b>win-win</b> <b>strategy</b> in negotiation? How do CMC and FTF affect the participants' ability to empathize with each other? Are the negotiation strategies of Anglo, Nordic, and Latin negotiators affected differently depending on the medium? Is the ability of Anglo, Nordic, and Latin negotiators to empathize with each other affected differently depending on the medium? On the basis of our results, we surmise that CMC does not allow negotiators to employ a cooperative <b>win-win</b> <b>strategy</b> (as recommended by negotiation-strategy training). We see significant differences when we examine the use of personal pronouns and speech acts by the Anglo, Nordic, and Latin culture clusters. When we look at the use of cooperative speech acts, a similar situation occurs: in contrast to Anglos, who behave in a cooperative way, Latins are significantly less cooperative and Nordics use many more general speech acts in the CMC setting...|$|E

This paper discusses how the structures of economic models typically used in policy analysis influence whether <b>win–win</b> <b>strategies</b> for the environment and the economy can be conceptualised and analysed. With a focus on climate policy modelling, the paper points out how, by construction, commonly used model structures find mitigation costs rather than benefits.

40|$|Abstract only. Many of Australias most {{valuable}} fisheries are not appreciated as such {{and so have}} miniscule management budgets. This situation {{is considered to be}} common elsewhere too. The paper argues this situation needs to be addressed from both scientific and community perspectives, but is ultimately doomed to fail unless the political and economic aspects are fully appreciated and addressed. The paper explores why community fishing policy in Australia as elsewhere lacks rigor from the social, legal, economic and environmental perspectives. Such fisheries are undermanaged and so under-resourced - almost everywhere despite being politically and economically very important. Politicians and fishery managers have yet to come up with really successful <b>win-win</b> <b>strategies</b> which are both widely accepted and widely adopted. This paper looks at some of the political and community constraints and proposes some really simple workable fisheries management solutions which satisfy fundamental economic and societal principles.

40|$|International audienceCities {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of climate policies(1 - 6). However, urban climate policies are not implemented in a vacuum; they interact with other policy goals, such as economic competitiveness or social issues. These interactions can lead to trade-offs and implementation obstacles, or to synergies(7, 8). Little analysis investigating these interactions exists, in part because it requires a broad interdisciplinary approach. Using a new integrated city model, we provide a first quantification of these trade-offs and synergies, going beyond the qualitative statements that have been published so far. We undertake a multicriteria analysis of three urban policies: a greenbelt policy, a zoning policy to reduce flood risk and a transportation subsidy. Separately, each of these policies seems to be undesirable because each one negatively affects {{at least one of the}} different policy goals; however, in a policy mix, the consequences of each policy are not simply additive. This nonlinearity permits building policy combinations that are <b>win-win</b> <b>strategies.</b> In particular, flood zoning and greenbelt policies can only be accepted if combined with transportation policies. Our results show that stand-alone adaptation and mitigation policies are unlikely to be politically acceptable and emphasize the need to mainstream climate policy within urban planning...|$|R

In his classic 1964 paper Hamilton did indeed limit his rule to close kin; however, by 1970 he had revised his theory and argued that genetic similarity is sufficient basis for Hamilton's Rule to operate, a view supported by Grafen. In addition, Salter's definition of [...] "ethnic genetic interests" [...] in [...] "On Genetic Interests" [...] is independent of Hamilton's Rule and derives from differences in gene frequencies between populations. Salter argues that investment in ethnic genetic interests is a rational choice dependent on individual values. Salter's realisation that ethnicity is extended kinship at the genetic level led to his conclusion that individuals have a large genetic stake in their ethnic groups, which could help explain the ubiquitousness of ethnic identity, solidarity and conflict from tribal times to the present. From the late 1990s Salter began studying the strategies used in group competition, with a particular interest in <b>win-win</b> <b>strategies,</b> those that would be adaptive to all groups.

All participants had previous experience in successfully helping children who had bullying behaviors toward classmates. The results indicated three categories of successful guidance strategies: individual guidance, class management, and systems’ collaboration.
