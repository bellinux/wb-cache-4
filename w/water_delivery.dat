5|$|In 1975, the Basin {{community}} formed {{water and}} sewer districts and, using federal grants to cover about 60percent of the costs, built a <b>water</b> <b>delivery,</b> sewage, and waste-handling system.

5|$|For over {{a century}} the water was {{supplied}} untreated. In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in water quality. As Hagley's water was not fully treated, {{from time to time}} contamination required boil-water notices. Sedimentation damaged hot-water cylinders and restricted supply due to the deposits left in the <b>water</b> <b>delivery</b> system. Work began in 2012 on a $5.5 million water treatment work at Westbury to supply Westbury, Hagley and Exton. This water treatment plant was opened by Ben Lomond Water in June 2013, supplying filtered and treated water to Hagley.|$|E

Bush in 2007 in the National Park Service budget – local support for its removal is relatively low. In 2012, San Francisco voters struck down Proposition F, which would have ordered the city to study the removal of O'Shaughnessy Dam and draft a plan to replace Hetch Hetchy water, {{by a vote of}} 77 percent against. Proposition F would have allocated $8 million to create a feasibility study by 2016; new <b>water</b> <b>delivery</b> and filtration systems would have to be in place by 2025 and Hetch Hetchy Reservoir would have to be drained by 2035.|$|E
40|$|Two studies {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} response-independent <b>water</b> <b>deliveries</b> on the location (on {{the floor of the}} experimental chamber) and position (height) of rats' behavior. In both experiments, fixed-time schedules delivered water in two dispensers that were located at opposite ends of the chamber. In Experiment 1, the two schedules provided complementary frequencies of <b>water</b> <b>deliveries</b> while the overall number of deliveries stayed constant. In Experiment 2, one of the schedules delivered water twice as frequently as the other; this proportion was kept constant while the overall density of <b>water</b> <b>deliveries</b> changed systematically. In both experiments, a single position (height) of behavior was dominant. Also, the percentage of time allocated to each dispenser was roughly proportional to the percentage of <b>water</b> <b>deliveries</b> associated with the dispensers. These data and additional considerations support the importance of examining the spatial properties and patterning of behavior...|$|R

5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of European agricultural methods, the shores of San Francisco Bay consisted mostly of tidal marshes. Today, the bay has been significantly altered heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of <b>water</b> <b>delivery,</b> shipping, agriculture, and urban development, with side effects including the loss of wetlands and {{the introduction}} of contaminants and invasive species. Approximately 85% of those marshes have been lost or destroyed, but about 50 marshes and marsh fragments remain. Huge tracts of the marshes were originally destroyed by farmers for agricultural purposes, then repurposed to serve as salt evaporation ponds to produce salt for food and other purposes. Today, regulations limit the destruction of tidal marshes, and large portions are currently being rehabilitated to its natural state.|$|E

40|$|Sixteen {{species of}} trees, shrubs and ground covers, {{commonly}} used in landscape designs in southern Arizona, were given high, medium, and low water treatments under trickle and spray irrigation systems. Annual <b>water</b> <b>deliveries</b> for these plant species were obtained. Well-distributed summer rains substantially reduced the irrigation needs of these plants, and all the plant species were reasonably maintained under trickle irrigation, with less than one-gallon-per-day <b>water</b> <b>deliveries,</b> except Mulberry. Plants were grouped into four categories according to their annual <b>water</b> <b>deliveries,</b> viz., very high, high, medium, and low water users. Trickle-irrigated plants made almost equal growth and maintained similar appearance as spray-irrigated plants, which were given more water. The data on plant growth increments were analyzed for selected ten plant species {{to determine the effects}} of reduced water treatments.

25|$|Several villages were {{evacuated}} because of copper smelting at Głogów. Further rural problems arose from piped water construction being given precedence over building sewerage systems, leaving many houses with only inbound piped <b>water</b> <b>delivery</b> {{and not enough}} sewage tank trucks to carry away sewage.

25|$|Economists {{state that}} the Venezuelan {{government}} began rationing in 2014 due to multiple issues, including an unproductive domestic industry that has been negatively affected by nationalizations and government intervention, and confusing currency controls that made it unable to provide the dollars importers need {{to pay for the}} majority of basic products that enter Venezuela. According to Venezuelan residents, the government also rations public water to those who use water over 108 hours a week due to the nation's poor <b>water</b> <b>delivery</b> systems. Gasoline is also rationed in Venezuela allegedly due to smuggling of the subsidized Venezuelan gasoline to Colombia where it is sold for a higher price.|$|E
25|$|Continuity {{of water}} supply is poor in most Yemeni cities. For example, in Taiz, the {{frequency}} of the public piped <b>water</b> <b>delivery</b> is only once about every 40days. More and more people have to rely on more costly water provided by private wells supplying water tankers. The quality of this water is questionable because these tankers have often been used for other purposes without appropriate cleaning. According to the Ministry of Water and Environment, 15 of 23 urban water utilities provided water every day for between 12 and 24 hours in 2007. These data do not differentiate between utilities with continuous supply and those with intermittent supply of a “moderate” sort (more than 12 hours daily water supply). The 15 cities thus include Sana’a and Aden that provide intermittent water supply. Four other towns provided water on a daily basis, but less than 12 hours per day. The city of Ibb and the town of Bajil provide water only once a week. And the utilities in Taiz and Mahwit provided water only less than once a week in 2007. However, there are potentially conflicting reports about the continuity of supply. For example, the Ministry reported that water was being provided on a daily basis in Amran in 2007. However, 100% of the respondents to a household survey in the same town in 2008 indicated that they received water only once a week or even once a month.|$|E

40|$|Inasmuch {{as water}} demand is multifaceted, {{infrastructure}} planning {{should be part}} of a general specification of efficient quantities and qualities of <b>water</b> <b>deliveries</b> over time. Accordingly, we develop a two-sector dynamic optimization model to solve for the optimal trajectories of groundwater extraction and water recycling. For the case of spatially increasing costs, recycled water serves as an intermediate resource in transition to the desalination steady state. For constant unit recycling cost, recycled wastewater eventually supplies non-potable users as a sector-specific backstop, while desalination supplements household groundwater in the steady state. In both cases, recycling water increases welfare by shifting demand away from the aquifer, thus delaying implementation of costly desalination. Implementation of the model provides guidance on the appropriate timing and size of backstop and recycling infrastructure as well as <b>water</b> <b>deliveries</b> from the various sources to the water-demand sectors.

25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh <b>water</b> <b>delivery</b> pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E
