Think of what that meant for them, poor fellows! Can a beadle be dignified with typhoid? Can a missionary be eloquent with lockjaw? No. NO. Well, I got some typhoid anti-toxin from Ridgeon and a tube of Muldooley's anti-tetanus serum. But the missionary jerked all my things off the table in one of his paroxysms; and in replacing them I put Ridgeon's tube where Muldooley's ought to have been. The consequence was that I inoculated the typhoid case for tetanus and the tetanus case for typhoid. [The doctors look greatly concerned. B. B., undamped, smiles triumphantly]. Well, they recovered. THEY RECOVERED. Except for a touch of St Vitus's dance the missionary's as well to-day as ever; and the beadle's ten times the man he was.|$|R
40|$|Many {{sustainability}} {{studies of}} animal production consider three pillars: the economic, environmental and socio-cultural. Farmers and animal scientists tend to put most {{emphasis on the}} economic and environmental pillar and largely ignore the socio-cultural pillar. Socio-cultural sustainability refers to social perceptions of animal farming, including social appreciations and concerns of animal production systems. Integration of social demands and values in the production sector is a prerequisite to justify animal production within a society. The objective {{of the present study}} was therefore to gain further insights into socio-cultural sustainability of pig production. Many citizens may not know what contemporary pig production actually entails. To give people a real life experience with pig production, we conducted farm visits with citizen panels with 18 respondents in the Netherlands and 8 respondents in Denmark. In both countries, respondents were divided over two panels and each panel visited a conventional and an organic pig farm. During the farm visits respondents noted their sensory experiences — <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> smell, <b>hear,</b> see and feel? In addition, each respondent made pictures of six positive and six negative aspects on the farms for which they had to write a motivation. The qualitative analysis resulted in seven socio-cultural themes (SCT) of pig production namely: 1) meat production, 2) farm activities, 3) farm income, 4) animals, 5) housing system, 6) environment and nature, and 7) culture and landscape. Each SCT included several socio-cultural aspects (appreciations, SCA) and socio-cultural issues (concerns, SCI). We identified 31 SCAs in the Netherlands and 33 SCAs in Denmark, of which 29 were SCIs in both countries. Although many issues were associated with animal welfare, the results also showed that social concerns of pig production extended beyond animal welfare. In general it can be stated that citizens are strongly concerned about overexploitation of animals in contemporary pig production systems, but at the same time they appreciate the dynamism in a pig farm including certain modern developments...|$|R
5000|$|Harvey {{wished to}} be [...] "epitaphed as the Inventour of the English Hexameter," [...] and was a prime mover in a {{literary}} clique known as the Areopagus which attempted to impose the Latin rules of quantity on English verse. In a letter to [...] "M. Immerito" [...] (Edmund Spenser) Harvey says that Edward Dyer and Philip Sidney were helping forward [...] "our new famous enterprise for the exchanging of Barbarous and Balductum Rymes with Artificial Verses." [...] The letter includes a tepid appreciation of Spenser's Faerie Queene which {{had been sent to}} him for his opinion, and he gives examples of English hexameters illustrative of the principles enunciated in the correspondence. The opening lines--"What might I call this Tree? A Laurell? O bonny Laurell Needes to thy bowes will I bow this knee, and vayle my bonetto"—afford a fair sample of the success of Harvey's metrical experiments, which were an easy mark for the wit of Thomas Nashe. [...] "He (Harvey) goes twitching and hopping in our language like a man running upon quagmires, up the hill in one syllable, and down the dale in another," [...] says Nashe in Strange Newes, and he mimics him in the mocking couplet:"But ah ! <b>what</b> news <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> of that good Gabriel Huff-Snuff, Known to the world for a fool, and clapped in the Fleet for a rhymer?"Harvey influenced Spenser greatly for a short time, and the friendship lasted. Harvey is the [...] "Hobbinoll" [...] of his friend's The Shepheardes Calender, and into his mouth is put the beautiful song in the fourth eclogue in praise of Eliza. If he was really the author of the verses [...] "To the Learned Shepheard," [...] signed [...] "Hobynoll" [...] and prefixed to the Faerie Queene, he was a good poet spoiled. Harvey's genuine friendship for Spenser shows the best side of his character, which appeared uncompromising and quarrelsome to the world in general. In 1573 the bad feeling against him in his college was so strong that there was a delay of three months before the fellows would agree to grant him the necessary grace for his MA degree.|$|R
40|$|Picture {{yourself}} {{taking part}} in a classroom psychology experiment on perception. You and nine other subjects are being asked to judge the lengths of lines in a vision test. The experimenter holds up a large card that contains three lines of different length, marked A, B, and C, and a target line. The subjects are asked: Which of A, B, or C is the same length as the target? For each card, all subjects take turns reporting which line matches the target. The first few sets of cards are unremarkable. Everyone states what is clear to the eye. On the fifth trial, the obvious answer to you is B, but the first person says C (you find this mildly amusing). However, the second person also says C. The third says C, and then the fourth. Everyone says C. When it is your turn to answer, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> say? Before <b>hearing</b> the response of others, you thought the answer was obviously B. But the unanimous opinion of others is C. All students of social psychology recognize the famous Asch (1955) experiment, and most remember that 3 of 4 subjects at some point conform to a group answer that defies their own perceptions. Deutsch and Gerard (1955) introduced the term ―normative social influence ‖ to characterize the tendency for people to give public responses that allow them to fit in with others even when they privately disagree. However, Asch’s classic study has come to symbolize more...|$|R
