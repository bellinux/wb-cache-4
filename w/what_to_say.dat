Moses is welcomed by Tzipporah's father and the high priest of Midian, Jethro. After assimilating this new culture, Moses becomes a {{shepherd}} and marries Tzipporah. One day, while chasing a stray lamb, Moses discovers a burning bush through which God tells him to go back to Egypt and guide the Hebrew slaves to freedom. God bestows Moses' shepherding staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Moses and Tzipporah return to Egypt, where Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh.|$|E
5|$|The player {{interacts with}} {{characters}} and objects by clicking on them. Clicking {{on the ground}} causes the player's selected characters to move. The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may be issued to controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused. The game can also be set to pause automatically at certain times. Dialogue is started by NPCs at certain scripted times, or by the player's clicking on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player must often choose <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{from a list of}} responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important information. When the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it. Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the mouse pointer is held over game elements.|$|E

25|$|Shyness {{may involve}} the {{discomfort}} of difficulty in knowing <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in social situations, or may include crippling physical manifestations of uneasiness. Shyness usually involves {{a combination of}} both symptoms, and may be quite devastating for the sufferer, in many cases leading them to feel that they are boring, or exhibit bizarre behavior in an attempt to create interest, alienating them further. Behavioral traits in social situations such as smiling, easily producing suitable conversational topics, assuming a relaxed posture and making good eye contact, may not be second nature for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.|$|E

25|$|Other writers blamed either Pompey or Caesar. Plutarch did not {{indicate}} when the incident happened either. In his version it was a ploy by the supporters of Pompey, who claimed that Vettius was plotting to kill Pompey. When questioned in the senate he accused several people, but when he spoke {{in front of the}} people he said that Licinius Lucullus was the one who arranged the plot. No one believed him and {{it was clear that the}} supporters of Pompey got him to make false accusations. The deceit became even more obvious when he was battered to death a few days later. The opinion was that he was killed by those who had hired him. Suetonius wrote that Caesar had bribed Vettius to tell a story about a conspiracy to murder Pompey according to a prearranged plot, but he was suspected of ‘double-dealing.’ He also wrote that Caesar was supposed to have poisoned him. Cicero gave an account in some letters to his fiend Atticus. Vettius, an informer, claimed that he had told Curio Junior that he had decided to use his slaves to assassinate Pompey. Curio told his father Gaius Scribonius Curio, who in turn told Pompey. When questioned in the senate he said that there was a group of conspiratorial young men led by Curio. The secretary of Calpurnius Bibulus gave him a dagger from Bibulus. He was to attack Pompey at the forum at some gladiatorial games and the ringleader for this was Aemilius Paullus. However, Aemilius Paullus was in Greece at the time. He also said that he had warned Pompey about the danger of plots. Vettius was arrested for confessing to possession of a dagger. The next day Caesar brought him to the rosta (a platform for public speeches). Vettius did not mention Curio. He implicated other men instead. Cicero thought that Vettius had been briefed on <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> during the night. The men he mentioned had not cast any suspicion. Cicero noted that it was thought that this was a set up and that the plan had been to catch Vettius in the forum with a dagger and his slaves with weapons, and that he was then to give information. He also thought that this had been masterminded by Caesar, who got Vettius to get close to Curio.|$|E

500|$|The new line-up rehearsed in Dallas for a North American tour, {{starting}} in London, Ontario. Collins {{was nervous about}} <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to the audience between songs, so Rutherford and Hackett helped with some announcements. Unlike Gabriel's theatrical approach, Collins developed a humorous rapport with the audience, and it was immediately successful. Audiences were happy for Collins to sing old material such as [...] "Supper's Ready" [...] in concert {{as he had been}} recruited as frontman from within the group. The resulting tour raised Genesis' profile in the U.S., where they had been relatively unknown while Gabriel was in the band.|$|E

500|$|The {{journalist}} Dave Besseling of GQ, in 2014, described Kapoor as [...] "friendly, chirpy, affable frat-boy type. Someone you’d {{want to play}} {{video games}} with on a Sunday, but keep the hell away from your sister". However, certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental. Vickey Lalwani of Mumbai Mirror wrote in 2012 that this perceived media image hindered certain filmmakers from approaching him for roles. Addressing this image, Kapoor remarked, [...] "I just don’t socialise much, I don’t party too much, I don’t know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to the media if I’m {{not talking about a}} film that I am doing, so yeah, maybe I am perceived as a snob." ...|$|E

As the draft approached, it was reported the Canucks were also shopping Schneider. Originally, it was believed the rumors were an attempt by Gillis to gain leverage for any potential Luongo deals. However, in a surprise move, Schneider was trade to the New Jersey Devils for the ninth overall pick in the draft, which Vancouver used to select Bo Horvat. Fans, as well as both Luongo and Schneider, were shocked by the news. Luongo stated, [...] "I have to let this sink in and figure out what I'm going to do." [...] While Schneider stated he was not sure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> or think and he was speechless, adding, [...] "it was nice to have resolution to the situation." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the last}} years of her life, Vulović lived on a pension of €300 per month in her {{dilapidated}} Belgrade apartment. [...] "I don't know know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> when people say I was lucky... life is so hard today," [...] she remarked. Vulović said she was [...] "tired" [...] of discussing her fall. She only occasionally granted interviews and declined numerous requests, most notably from Oprah Winfrey and the BBC. Vulović's deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years. In December 2016, Vulović's friends became concerned for her well-being after she abruptly stopped answering her telephone. On 23 December, locksmiths discovered Vulović's lifeless body in her apartment after forcing open the door. Vulović's friends said that she had struggled with heart ailments in the years leading up to her death. She was buried in Belgrade's New Cemetery on 27 December.|$|E

I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E
500|$|Gender was a {{recurring}} theme in Rix Nicholas's career, for better and for worse. Praise from a French art critic for her abilities was expressed by saying [...] " [...] Rix paints like a man!". An Australian critic was unsure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> admiring her composition but declaring her technique [...] "strangely unfeminine". Pigot considered that, when Rix Nicholas sought to stake out a woman's place in nationalist art in mid-twentieth century Australia, her career was ultimately penalised by her unwillingness {{to play by the}} male establishment's rules. Art historian Catherine Speck had a different perspective on Rix Nicholas's post-World War I work, suggesting that it never subsequently attained the quality of her Paris output, because her first husband's death in the Great War drove her to create nationalist images of inconsistent quality. In their reference work A Story of Australian Painting, Mary Eagle and John Jones considered Rix Nicholas, alongside Clarice Beckett, to be [...] "the best woman artist to emerge from the artistic milieu of Melbourne in the decade of the First World War".|$|E
