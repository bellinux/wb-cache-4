Displacing any {{sediment}} grain {{requires a}} certain amount of work to overcome both inertia and the friction generated by all adjacent grains (both static and dynamic). The wedge does displacement work by using less force at the cost of increasing the distance the grain must travel. In order {{to reduce the size of}} an SPI device it makes sense to reduce the amount of work required to displace sediment for a given imaging area. Being in an aquatic environment gives the first advantage to reducing work. By increasing the water content of sediments, both static and dynamic coefficients of friction from grain-on-grain interactions are greatly reduced. At these large physical scales, viscosity interactions are very small compared to friction. Therefore, fluidising sediments would allow an SPI device to displace more and coarser sediments with less downward force. (Of course all mass-energy is conserved - more work is required to pump the water into sediments - but at least that can be done away from the wedge.) It is important to cleanly separate sediments to be fluidised and removed from the sedimentary fabric that must be imaged intact. <b>Water</b> <b>lubrication</b> can be used to reduce the amount of force required and lessen required workload, but can we also reduce the distance grains need to be displaced? The imaging mirror is the greatest constraint to reducing grain displacement so it makes sense to dispense with it. A number of commercial and consumer line scanners exist which digitise an image by moving in a plane recording the colour and intensity of light encountered. Flatbed scanners and digital photocopiers are examples of this technique. Light shining from the device reflects off the scene to be imaged to a sensor located near the light source. The light’s path can be folded and manipulated by a series of intermediary mirrors and lenses to a small linear sensor array or directly to a large array of tiny sensors. Pushing a thin flatbed scanner into sediments requires much less work than pushing a large prism, as concluded by Keegan et al. (2001):“In terms of its current design, the size of the prism in the SPI array impedes penetration in all but the softer, less compact sediments. When, for the sake of enhanced penetration, it becomes necessary to use the full complement of lead weights (66kg), the system becomes difficult to handle on smaller craft with restricted lifting equipment. Size and, correspondingly, weight could be reduced if the prism could be replaced to act more as a slim ‘digging blade,’ the whole exposed face of which could be digitally scanned in situ. Such a blade would not only facilitate easier and deeper penetration but also extend the use of SPI to more compact, fine to medium sands. The authors have already experimented with a suitable casing that penetrated these more resistant deposits to depths exceeding 55cm, however, a physically robust scanner that will tolerate the shock of impact and have a level of resolution adequate to the purpose remains to be identified.”The engineering problems of resolution, weight, and pressure and shock-resistance are compounded by keeping the scanner in a rectangular configuration (Patterson et al. 2006). Most underwater equipment is housed in cylinders because cylinders present a smaller surface area for enclosing a given volume than a rectangular enclosure. For a given surface (imaging) area, fewer sediment grains will need to be displaced a shorter distance when imaged from the perimeter of a cylinder than the oblique face of a wedge. It is a conceptually simple matter to modify a consumer flatbed scanner so that its scan head (containing light source and sensor array) moves in a circular path instead of a plane as illustrated in Figure 7. This configuration change allows for a more efficient wedge geometry or, as we’ll see later, permits its elimination.|$|E

The excellent mechanical properties of the laminated ceramics, especially toughness, result mainly from effects of residual stress in the specially-designed layer, interface structure and phase transformation together.

The influences of microstructure (composition and architecture) and test conditions (counterparts and friction parameters) on their friction and wear behavior under <b>water</b> <b>lubrication</b> are systematically elucidated. In general, DLC and a-CNx coatings exhibit superior tribological performance under <b>water</b> <b>lubrication</b> {{due to the}} formation of the hydrophilic group and the lubricating layer with low shear strength, respectively.

Conventional proportioning techniques used {{in the production of}} concrete are to a great extent empirically or semi-empirically based on some old rules such as Fuller’s curve (1907) and Abrams’ rule (1918) for normal concrete, and with certain modifications by adding various fillers and using superplasticizer for SCC. Due to the limited resources of natural aggregates in Sweden {{as well as in the}} other countries, crushed aggregates have to be used in concrete production in the future. The previous experience based on natural aggregates can in many cases not be applied to the production of SCC, which is very sensitive to the particle size distributions, shapes and surface characteristics of various raw materials. It is a great waste of natural and human resources to establish new experience for every locally available crushed aggregate if the conventional experience-based proportioning techniques by “trial and error” are used for the production of SCC.

However, despite all the benefits, porous-ceramic hydrostatic bearings {{have yet to find}} widespread acceptance due to the problems found in tailoring the bearings geometry and size to suit precision engineering applications, while producing porous-structures with consistent and reproducible permeability. Using a series of fine grades of alumina powders in combination with maize starch granules, a new method for the manufacture of porous-ceramic bearings has been developed, based on the starch consolidation technique. By employing this method, it has been demonstrated that is possible to manufacture bearings of different geometries and shapes, with consistent and reproducible properties. The new method also proved to be low cost and environmentally sound. The performance of the new journal bearings has been investigated in a highly instrumented test-rig, and a comparable performance to that of previous porous- ceramic journal research has been observed. In a direct performance comparison between a porous-ceramic hydrostatic journal bearing and a conventional hydrostatic bearing of the same size, the porous-ceramic bearing demonstrated a significant performance improvement in terms of stiffness, power consumption and thermal performance.

40|$|The tribofilm {{formed on}} nanocrystalline diamond coating during ultralow {{friction}} in presence of <b>water</b> and glycerol <b>lubrication</b> {{has been studied}} experimentally by energy filtering transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) on focus ion beam (FIB) cross sections. Surprisingly, even under mild tribological conditions, a tribo-induced hybridization change (sp(3) towards sp(2)) can be clearly detected {{at the top of}} the coating resulting in the formation of a 40 nm thick amorphous sp(2) rich carbon layer with embedded diamond nanoparticles less than 5 nm diameter. Classical molecular dynamics simulations of diamond single crystal asperity collisions can explain this finding. Tribochemical amorphization of the contact zone between the colliding diamond grains followed by fracture events at the asperity shoulders produces ultra-nanodiamonds that remain attached to the amorphous carbon phase. An additional atomistic sliding simulation of two ultra-nanocrystalline diamond coatings yields an amorphous sp(2) rich carbon layer that grows at a rate that is comparable to corresponding layers on the softest diamond single crystal surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{rolling mills}} use {{emulsions}} {{based on a}} mixture of oil and <b>water</b> for <b>lubrication.</b> Since two years ago SAPA has been using (instead of oil) a synthetic lubricant so called conditional emulsion for hot-rolling of aluminum. This lubricant is water based and homogenous at ambient temperature, but switches to a two-phase system at heating above the cloud point. This project aims to validate and if necessary modify an existing HPLC method for quantifying {{two out of three}} key components (A, B and C) in the conditional emulsion. Attempts to develop a method to quantify the pH adjusting components, X and Y were also made. These two methods are required to optimize the lubricant. Due to the complexity of the components, it has been difficult to present a method for quantification, and HPLC with ELS detection was chosen after a long series of trials. Due to a few uncontrollable parameters the proposed analysis method has tendencies to be unstable. The column used is sensitive to changes in equilibrium and ELSD is also less sensitive and less reproducible than the commonly used UV-detector. While the proposed assay method shows somewhat large relative standard deviations the method has been shown to produce sufficiently precise and accurate data for the intended purpose. Development of a method for the pH-adjusting components X and Y was more difficult than expected. For some reason their difference in chemical properties does not show satisfying impact in the chromatograms. This method is still in its cradle and needs further development. ...|$|R
40|$|Even though {{studies have}} shown {{unequivocally}} that the coefficient of friction of self-mated silicon nitride can be quite low in water, the basic phenomena responsible for such a low friction is still controversial. In this investigation the effects of load, speed, and surface roughness on {{the duration of the}} run-in period for self-mated silicon nitride in water was studied. Although the results are consistent with proposed mechanisms involving mixed hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> by <b>water</b> and boundary <b>lubrication</b> by colloidal silica, an alternate mechanism is suggested. The friction and wear tests were conducted using a pin-on-disk tribometer. The surface roughness of the disks was measured with an atomic force microscope (AFM) scanning several areas 50 x 50 µm in dimensions. For a test on a lapped surface at 5 N and 120 mm/s, the coefficient of friction is seen to decrease from an average of 0. 45 – 0. 01 after 600 min. It is proposed that the low friction could be also related to fundamental interactions between two hard and elastically deforming surfaces covered with hydrogen-terminated oxide films. </span...|$|R
