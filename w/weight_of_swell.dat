40|$|This paper {{presents}} the laboratory investigation work which forms {{part of a}} full scale research road project in Mauritius where coal bottom ash is used as mechanical stabiliser in a saprolitic subgrade soil. Three mixtures of subgrade soil and CBA were investigated in the laboratory, each containing varying percentages of coal bottom ash by weight (15 %, 30 %, and 40 %, resp.). The laboratory research indicated that the mechanical properties of the subgrade soil are improved {{with the addition of}} bottom ash. Highest values for soaked and unsoaked CBR values were obtained for the mixture containing 30 % by <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> bottom ash, which were 145 % and 95 %, respectively, as compared to 40 % and 55 % for the subgrade soil alone. Upon addition of coal bottom ash, a considerable decrease in swelling potential during soaking was observed for the mixture containing 40 % by <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> CBA. The <b>swell</b> decreased from 0. 17 % for the subgrade soil alone to 0. 04 % for the mixture containing 40 % by <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> CBA. Moreover, a CBA content of 30 % resulted in a mix of intermediate plasticity as compared to the subgrade soil which is highly plastic. It is concluded that coal bottom ash can be used successfully as a mechanical stabilizer in the experimental subgrade soil by addition of 30 to 40 % of CBA...|$|R

40|$|Article soumis à GRL le 12 / 09 / 2008 après rejet par Nature Geoscience (soumis en avril 2008). Modifié en Janvier 2009 et accepté en février 2009. Global {{observations}} <b>of</b> ocean <b>swell,</b> from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar data, {{are used}} to estimate the dissipation <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> energy for a number <b>of</b> storms. <b>Swells</b> can be very persistent with energy e-folding scales exceeding 20, 000 km. For increasing swell steepness this scale shrinks systematically, down to 2800 km for the steepest observed swells, revealing a significant loss <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> energy. This value corresponds to a normalized energy decay in time ß = 4. 2 x 10 - 6 s - 1. Many processes {{may be responsible for}} this dissipation. Because no particular trend is found with wind magnitude and direction, the increase of dissipation rate in dissipation with swell steepness is interpreted as a laminar to turbulent transition of the boundary layer, with a threshold Reynolds number of the order of 100, 000. These observations <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> evolution open the way for more accurate wave forecasting models, and provides a constraint on swell-induced air-sea fluxes of momentum and energy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRisk {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> and shrinkage {{is essential}} to properly evaluate engineering stability and safety of expansive soils. Herein a novel model for risk analysis <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> and shrinkage <b>of</b> expansive soils was proposed by means of coupling set pair analysis with stochastic simulation of triangular fuzzy numbers. A concept of multi-element connection number for a set pair, which consisted of measured evaluation index sets and classification standard sets of shrink and expansion grade, was described to express hierarchy and fuzziness of membership between the evaluation sample and the classification standard. Moreover, triangular fuzzy numbers simulated by the stochastic simulation method were presented to depict the changing process and fuzziness of component coefficients of discrepancy degree. Combined with the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the evaluation index, integrated connection number was calculated to specify the swell and shrinkage grade of the evaluation sample. A confidence level of evaluation result was also given corresponding to a confidence interval. Finally, a practical example was used to confirm and to compare with the fuzzy mathematic method and extension method. The results show that this presented method is more feasible and easy to operate, {{and the result is}} good. It can provide a reliable degree of evaluation results for risk design and risk management of projects on expansive soils...|$|R
40|$|Swells {{are found}} in all oceans and {{strongly}} influence the wave climate and air-sea processes. The poorly known swell dissipation is the largest source of error in wave forecasts and hindcasts. We use synthetic aperture radar data to identify swell sources and trajectories, allowing a statistically significant estimation <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> dissipation. We mined the entire Envisat mission 2003 – 2012 to find suitable storms with swells (13 [*]<[*]T[*]<[*] 18 [*]s) that are observed several times along their propagation. This database <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> events provides a comprehensive view <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> extending previous efforts. The analysis reveals that swell dissipation weakly correlates with the wave steepness, wind speed, orbital wave velocity, and the relative direction of wind and waves. Although several negative dissipation rates are found, there are uncertainties in the synthetic aperture radar-derived swell heights and dissipation rates.

40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} of current operational methods for retrieving twodimensional ocean wave spectra from near real-time ERS- 1 SAR wave mode (SWM) imagette spectra. The SWM data quality {{and performance of}} the WASAR algorithm are assessed. Sensitivity analyses and validation studies are performed using two-dimensional NOAA buoy data as well as TOPEX and ERS- 1 altimeter-derived significant wave heights. An intercomparison between SWM-retrieved and WAM model spectral parameters shows a good overall agreement, however with a small but systematic overprediction of windseas and underprediction <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> by the WAM.

(Ocean Dyn 64 : 1447 - 1456, 2014), this article presents significant waveheights <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> inverted from a 13 month dataset of two high-frequency (HF) phased array radars. As an important intermediate variable in the calculation of significant waveheights, relative swell directions obtained by two different methods from a single radar station are also presented. The impact of the inaccuracy <b>of</b> relative <b>swell</b> direction on the calculation of waveheight is investigated and an alternative way <b>of</b> using constant <b>swell</b> direction is proposed. Radar-inverted swell significant waveheights using different ranges <b>of</b> relative <b>swell</b> directions are investigated. Results are assessed by WAVEWATCH III model hind casts. Analysis of the complete database shows that radar-inverted swell significant waveheights agree reasonably well with model estimates with large scatter. Standard deviation {{of the difference between}} the two estimations increases with waveheight, whereas the relative standard deviation, normalized by waveheight, keeps nearly constant. The constant direction scheme of waveheight inversion gives good estimations except for energetic swell exceeding the small perturbation assumption. Statistical analysis suggests that radar measurement uncertainty explains a considerable part of the difference between radar and model estimates. Swell estimates from both radar stations are consistent. This enables combined use of both radar spectra at common radar cells. Use of double spectra solves the ambiguity <b>of</b> relative <b>swell</b> direction, i. e., absolute swell direction is obtained, and effectively improves the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>swell</b> direction by the least-squares method...|$|R
