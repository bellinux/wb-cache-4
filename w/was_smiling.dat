5|$|The inquest {{opened on}} 14 August 1985. The police gave {{evidence}} {{that it was a}} murder–suicide, and the bodies were released. The Bambers and Sheila were cremated; the boys were buried. Bamber's behaviour before and after the funeral increased suspicion among his family that he had been involved. He sobbed during the funeral service for his parents and sister, and at one point seemed to buckle and had to be supported by his girlfriend. Several family members and friends alleged that, later at the wake, he <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> and joking.|$|E
5|$|The sinking smack was {{abandoned}} by the nine unwounded crew, who attempted to remove their captain, who ordered {{that he should be}} thrown overboard rather than slow them down. The crew refused to do so, but found they were unable to move him and left him where he lay. He died in his son's arms a few minutes later. It is said that he <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him. The Ethel & Millie had just arrived on the scene as the Nelson sank, and her captain Skipper Charles Manning called for Nelson's lifeboat to come alongside. Realising that this would greatly overcrowd the second boat, the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine, coming under lethal fire as he did so. His vessel was soon badly damaged and began to sink.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} a number one contender's non-title match between WWE Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy and Triple H.

Before the match started, Hardy and Triple H shook hands. During the match, Hardy seemed dazed after he {{suffered}} a series of clotheslines and shoulder blocks. Triple H tried to execute a Pedigree but Hardy countered it into a jackknife roll-up which won Jeff Hardy the match. As Jeff Hardy celebrated Triple H <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> {{at the fact that}} he was pinned so easily, Triple H then celebrated with Hardy.|$|E

500|$|She next starred {{alongside}} Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampal in Siddharth Malhotra's moderately successful family drama We Are Family, {{an official}} {{adaptation of the}} Hollywood tearjerker Stepmom (1998). Kajol {{played the role of}} Maya, a character originally played by Susan Sarandon, and which she described as [...] "a control freak", believing it [...] "is something which every woman would identify with." [...] While reviewing the film for Hindustan Times, critic Mayank Shekhar stated, [...] "The premise is stuff dry tissues are made for. Yet, the pathos here is produced not from moments, but from performances alone: a stunning Kajol's in particular. She appears superior to Susan Sarandon, I suspect." [...] New York Timess Rachel Saltz wrote, [...] "The always appealing Kajol knows how to play melodrama without being melodramatic, and her naturalism gives the movie a genuine emotional kick." [...] Her final release of the year was Toonpur Ka Super Hero, a live-action animated film, opposite Ajay Devgn. In an interview with The Express Tribune, Kajol mentioned that it was difficult to work on the film. She added, [...] "Dubbing and shooting was equally frustrating. You had to keep so many things in mind and there were a few action sequences too where I had to do action in front of a green space, so I <b>was</b> <b>smiling,</b> scowling, laughing– all in the wrong places!" [...] The film was a critical and commercial failure and fetched Kajol mostly negative reviews for playing a role that provided her with [...] "no scope" [...] to perform.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{sentencing}} inside the courtroom, news channel Tv2 recorded Kristiansen reaction {{while he had}} a {{grin on his face}} while chewing chewing-gum. They later aired the video-tape during the evening news, after Kristiansens lawyer told the media that Kristiansen had been [...] "absolutely devastated" [...] by the verdict. In a 2008 interview, Kristiansen explained his reaction, saying that he <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> at the mere [...] "absurdity of the situation", he also accused the media of using the clip to portray him as a [...] "cold-blooded monster without emotions". This incident sparked a long legal conflict between Tv2 and the court, due to a law, banning recording of defendants inside court-rooms. Tv2 was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for the New York Daily News, Jim Farber {{noted that}} the most {{shocking}} aspect of the tour was not the provocative imagery and performances, rather the fact that Madonna appeared in a light mood and <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> all throughout. Similar thoughts were echoed by Jordan Zivitz of Montreal Gazette who observed that after the first section, the tour's tone became more carefree since Madonna seemed to be [...] "enjoying herself". She complimented the performance of [...] "La Vie en rose" [...] and ended the review saying that [...] "the show shared a sense of self-confidence {{and a sense of}} play... a minor revelation from an artist whose discipline and perfectionism haven't compromised a love of serious fun." [...] Chris Kelly from The Washington Post reviewed the show at Verizon Center, saying that Madonna remained [...] "as provocative as ever... The moment [...] show started... those questions and more [...] went out the window, a defenestration the Catholicism-obsessed queen of pop would appreciate." ...|$|E
