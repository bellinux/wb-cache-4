5|$|The Red Line is {{the only}} line in the system that does not share its tracks with another Metrorail line. The Amtrak and MARC tracks do, however, run {{parallel}} to the Red Line tracks between Washington Union Station and Silver Spring {{as well as between}} Twinbrook and Shady Grove stations. These tracks used {{to be part of the}} former Batimore & Ohio Railroad route. MARC uses this parallel route <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> between Washington and Martinsburg, West Virginia. Amtrak, on the other hand, uses this parallel route <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> the Capitol Limited route between Washington and Chicago Union Station. Although MARC does stop at the Silver Spring and Rockville stations between Washington and West Virginia, Amtrak only stops at Rockville between Washington and Chicago.|$|E

He made particular requests <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> to foreign nations. During his trips to Rome, Paris, Madrid, Moscow, and New York City, he resided in a bulletproof tent, following his Bedouin traditions. Gaddafi was notably confrontational in his approach to foreign powers, and generally shunned Western ambassadors and diplomats, believing them to be spies.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Metropolitan & St. John's Wood Railway was to run to underground north-east to Hampstead Village, and indeed this appeared on some maps. Although in the event this was not completed in full and the line was built in a north-western direction instead, a short heading of tunnel was built north of Swiss Cottage station {{in the direction of}} Hampstead. This is still visible today <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> on a southbound Metropolitan line service.|$|E
5|$|These {{analyses}} are conducted <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> empty, loading and unloading, when partially and fully loaded, and {{under conditions of}} temporary overloading. Places subject to the largest stresses are studied carefully, such as hold-bottoms, hatch-covers, bulkheads between holds, and the bottoms of ballast tanks. Great Lakes bulkers also must be designed to withstand springing, or developing resonance with the waves, which can cause fatigue fractures.|$|E

5|$|When {{breeding}} is over, the {{black-necked grebe}} usually partakes in a moult migration to saline lakes. It especially prefers lakes {{with large numbers}} of invertebrate prey, so that it can fatten up while moulting and before going on its winter migration. Some birds, although, moult when on the breeding grounds, but most do not moult {{until the end of the}} moult migration. This migration is dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds being killed by snowstorms <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> to places such as Mono Lake.|$|E
5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E

Breckinridge fell ill <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections.

5|$|Final Fantasy {{has four}} basic game modes: an overworld map, town and dungeon maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a {{scaled-down}} {{version of the}} game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. The primary means of travel across the overworld is by foot; a canoe, a ship, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with bosses, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld map <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> by foot, canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin to lean in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E
5|$|Products {{collected}} from living horses include mare's milk, used {{by people with}} large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition <b>when</b> <b>traveling.</b> Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for {{extended periods of time}} without stopping to eat. The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.|$|E
5|$|The passenger-only ferry service, {{approved}} by voters in 2016, {{was preceded by}} one operated by Washington State Ferries between 1986 and 2003. This state-run system ceased operations after a class-action lawsuit forced its vessels to slow down <b>when</b> <b>traveling</b> through Rich Passage to reduce wake damage. Kitsap Transit briefly operated its own passenger ferries from 2004 to 2007, but failed to receive voter approval for two sales tax funding measures. The agency commissioned a low-wake vessel, Rich Passage 1, which was used from 2011 to 2012 for research and trial runs that determined it could operate at high speeds without creating a damaging wake.|$|E
