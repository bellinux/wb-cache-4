2500|$|While {{sharing a}} flat with Barry Gibb in London in late 1967, Young was {{encouraged}} to write songs. Gibb taught him that [...] "there are no rules in song-writing, there is a structure, but <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is find the 'hook', {{and it could be}} in the melody, the chorus, the words or even an identifiable riff, and that can be the difference in writing a hit record." [...] During 1968, back in Australia, Young wrote [...] "The Real Thing" [...] as a reaction against a Coca-Cola jingle, [...] "Coke is the real thing". Young envisaged the song as a low-key acoustic ballad (in the style of The Beatles [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever") and he originally intended it for his friend and fellow singer Ronnie Burns. Young was practising the song in a dressing room during taping of TV pop music show Uptight when pop producer and fellow Go-Set writer Ian Meldrum heard it. Meldrum (who was also manager for solo singer Russell Morris (ex-Somebody's Image) was greatly impressed by the song and immediately insisted that Young cut a demo of it for Morris. Under Meldrum's production and with the collaboration of engineer John L. Sayers the song was radically transformed into a seven-minute psychedelic epic, with a elaborately edited backing track performed by an all-star band including ex-Zoot guitarist Roger Hicks (who composed the acoustic guitar intro), members of Melbourne band The Groop and backing vocalist Maureen Elkner. Reportedly the most expensive single ever recorded in Australia up to that time, it became one of the biggest Australian pop hits of 1969, peaking at numberone in May and was numberone on Go-Set Top Records for the Year of 1969, and made Morris an immediate national star. It was later covered by Kylie Minogue and by Midnight Oil. Young's next song for Morris, [...] "The Girl That I Love", was released as a double-A-side with [...] "Part Three into Paper Walls" [...] (another epic extended production co-written by Morris and Young) which reached numberone in October.|$|E
2500|$|On the October 7, 2008 {{episode of}} Making the Band, Combs {{stated that he}} did have Richard on three demos for his new album. On the same episode of the show, after {{continued}} debate with O'Day about the well-being of Danity Kane, he stated that O'Day {{was no longer in}} the group, as had been foreshadowed in an earlier episode within the season after a TRL (Total Request Live) appearance. Combs was unaware of the specific problems within the group, but sensed that O'Day and Aundrea Fimbres, who were originally close friends, had drastically drifted apart. O'Day and Richard informed Combs that the entire group had trust issues with management and ultimately each other. The season finale, which took place Tuesday, October 14, 2008, confirmed the departure of O'Day and Woods. Combs removed Woods due to feeling that she was unhappy with the group and that she had gotten [...] "caught up in the wrath" [...] of close friend O'Day. In the live section of the episode, Combs explained that the reason he let O'Day go was that she was not the same person he signed, that the fame had changed her (as had been expressed on the August 28, 2008 episode). [...] "I got love for Aubrey," [...] he said. [...] "I don't have any beef with her. I just want to work with the young lady that I signed, not the person that fame has made her." [...] He later stated that he would be open to working with Woods again. When O'Day came on to reply, just moments after deciding not to leave the studio, she first addressed the perception some people, especially bloggers, have of her. [...] "I would rather be hated every damn day of my life for being real than loved for being something I'm not," [...] she stated. Combs, who spoke to the group and the audience via satellite, relayed to O'Day, [...] "Check this out, baby girl... See, your attitude is gonna have you in a dark and lonely place. ... <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> {{at the end of the}} day, is humble yourself." [...] Woods did not appear on the live episode due to prior obligations.|$|E

And the kind of dynamics she studies doesn't directly concern {{the motion of the}} billiards on the table, but instead a transformation of the billiard table itself, which is changing its shape in a rule-governed way; if you like, the table itself moves like a strange planet around the universe of all possible tables ...
