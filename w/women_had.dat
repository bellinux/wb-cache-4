The lowest occurrence of sexual activity was among married women; those with previous homosexual experience reported they got married to stop homosexual activity.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the <b>women</b> <b>had</b> misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two <b>women</b> <b>had</b> claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E

5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world.

No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown there has been {{significant}} {{lack of knowledge about}} <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> cross infect each other with STIs. It has been less likely that <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> visit health care than heterosexuals, they often felt badly treated, invisible and did not always know where to turn in case of an STI. Objective: The objective was to examine if STI information from Kalmar and Växjö county websites and GCK-summit, targeted <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> Method: With a queer theoretical perspective a critical discourse analysis was made by STI information on the internet. Results: <b>Women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> <b>have</b> been excluded in the STI information currently available through Kalmar and Växjö county websites. The public notices for screening tests have not been designed in such way it includes <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> <b>Women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> <b>have</b> been an obscure group. Conclusion: The conclusion was that <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> <b>have</b> not been included in the STI information available on the internet within the county councils of Kalmar and Kronoberg...|$|R
