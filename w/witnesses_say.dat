5|$|General Edward Braddock left Observatory Hill in Georgetown in 1755 on an {{expedition}} to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. Braddock's expedition was surprised on July 9 {{in the vicinity of}} present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania, in what is now known as the Battle of the Monongahela. Nearly 900 of Braddock's 1,300 men were killed or wounded, and Braddock himself killed. Since before the American Civil War, <b>witnesses</b> <b>say</b> that on the anniversary of Braddock's departure they can hear shouted military orders, horses' hooves on cobblestones, the sound of men marching, and the sound of metal clanking against metal. The sounds can be heard near the old Long Bridge or near the Georgetown bluffs overlooking the Potomac River.|$|E

50|$|The retrial {{began on}} September 27, 1979. The retrial allowed records that proved his alibi to be submitted, {{as well as}} a {{statement}} from a <b>witness</b> <b>saying</b> that she had lied under duress.|$|R
50|$|Testimony can be direct {{evidence}} {{or it can}} be circumstantial. For instance, a <b>witness</b> <b>saying</b> that she saw a defendant stab a victim is providing {{direct evidence}}. By contrast, a <b>witness</b> who <b>says</b> that she saw the defendant enter a house, that she heard screaming, and that she saw the defendant leave with a bloody knife gives circumstantial evidence. It is the necessity for inference, and not the obviousness of a conclusion, that determines whether evidence is circumstantial.|$|R
25|$|On December 26, 2006 the Council of Islamic Courts fighters {{retreated from}} the main {{frontline}} {{after a week of}} artillery and mortar duels and attacks by Somalian transitional government and Ethiopian soldiers, <b>witnesses</b> <b>say.</b> Ethiopian forces took control of Burhakaba early on Tuesday without any fighting, Jama Nur, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Mogadishu, reported. Transitional government and Ethiopian forces have moved 40km towards the capital since taking control of Baladweyne town on Monday, he said.|$|E
25|$|June 26, 2014: Militants from Al-Shabaab {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the town of Bulo-burde, which has been besieged by militants and cut off from road access since it came under government control in March. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>say</b> that the attack lasted thirty minutes and began when militants stormed a military base established in a hotel complex before they were driven back by the combined force of the SNA and AMISOM. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility and claimed to have killed six soldiers while the AU commander, Ibrahim Ali, stated that two Djiboutian peacekeepers, one civilian, and two militants were killed.|$|E
25|$|According to {{reporter}} James Renner, Dean Runkle is {{a possible}} prime suspect in the FBI investigation. Multiple <b>witnesses</b> <b>say</b> that he matches the man they saw with Mihaljevic {{on the day she}} vanished. Runkle also may have volunteered at the Lake Erie Nature and Science Center in Bay Village {{at the time of the}} murder. All four girls who received suspicious phone calls (with Mihaljevic being the last one) had visited it in the weeks before the abduction, and may have written their names and other personal information in the Center's visitor logbook. Runkle denied remembering this to police, but at least eight former students and teacher's aides reported that Runkle had spoken of being present at the center. Although Renner describes Runkle as an eccentric teacher, no hard evidence supports this view. Runkle himself denies any involvement in the murder of Mihaljevic and the FBI has never officially declared him a suspect. Since Runkle is exceptionally well liked as a teacher by many former students, Renner became the subject of strong criticism, unlike anything he had faced from naming previous suspects, when he named Runkle.|$|E
50|$|In {{monetary}} law {{examination of witnesses}} is less stringent than in capital law, and testimony is accepted even despite minor contradictions that may exist in the testimony of two separate witnesses. (If one <b>witness</b> <b>says</b> a defendant owes 100, and the other says the sum is 200, the judges accept that both witnesses agree {{to the existence of}} a 100 lien, even though only one witness testifies to each individual lien. Similarly, if one <b>witness</b> <b>says</b> a defendant owes 100 based on a loan granted on Monday, and another <b>witness</b> <b>says</b> the debt is 100 based on a loan granted on Thursday, the defendant is considered to owe 100 by the combined testimony of the two witnesses even though they disagree as to the source of the obligation.) In contrast, in capital cases the judges threaten the witnesses by warning of the consequences of perjury (source: Mishnah Sanhedrin chapter 4), and they ask many questions and will invalidate testimony even for minor inconsistencies, even if the contradiction seems substantively irrelevant to the case at hand. The purpose of these stringencies is to prevent the killing of an innocent defendant.|$|R
50|$|The {{witness is}} induced to {{contradict}} the own testimony during the present proceeding. That differs from inconsistent statements above. Inconsistent statements involve statements made out-of-court (hearsay) or in prior proceedings. Contradiction involves the <b>witness</b> <b>saying</b> two different things in the same testimony.|$|R

25|$|According to the {{military}} intelligence officials in 2007, there were many key reasons why the Uzbeks had been dominating the area. Military intelligence reports testified that the locals were scared to mobilize the opposition against the Uzbek militants due to their reputations as fierce fighters with long memories and very strong military backgrounds. Some of these fighters used to be soldiers and officers in the Soviet Army during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, {{and some of them}} had military training given by the CIA during the 1990s; hence they were experts in guerrilla warfare. The IMU fighters had little to lose and it was difficult for them to escape somewhere else. They couldn't go back to Uzbekistan, and after 2009, re-infiltration back to Afghanistan also started becoming more difficult. Thus, they made Waziristan their home. Local militants allied to the tribesmen were reported attacking and seizing the IMU's private jail in Azam Warsak. The Pakistan Army intelligence said it did not intend to step in, but <b>witnesses</b> <b>say</b> government artillery fired on the Uzbek fighters they set up to fight the tribesmen.|$|E

500|$|Once {{they had}} {{gained control of}} East Timor, Fretilin faced attacks from the west, by Indonesian {{military}} forces—then known as Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia (ABRI)—and by {{a small group of}} UDT troops. Indonesia captured the border city of Batugadé on 8 October 1975; nearby Balibó and Maliana were taken eight days later. During the Balibó raid, members of an Australian television news crew—later dubbed the [...] "Balibo Five"—were killed by Indonesian soldiers. Indonesian military officials say the deaths were accidental, and East Timorese <b>witnesses</b> <b>say</b> the journalists were deliberately killed. The deaths, and subsequent campaigns and investigations, attracted international attention and rallied support for East Timorese independence.|$|E
500|$|In {{the evening}} of 14 February, Ali Mushaima died from police shotgun wounds to his back at close range. The {{government}} says that Ali {{was part of a}} group of 800 protesters that attacked eight policemen with rocks and metal rods. The government asserts that the police exhausted their supply of tear gas and rubber bullets in a failed attempt to disperse the crowd, and resorted to the use of shotguns. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>say</b> that there were no demonstrations at the time Ali was shot. They say Ali was seen walking with a group of officers who were pointing their guns at him. As Ali walked away, he was shot in the back by one of the officers.

500|$|The {{spirits of}} slaves are also said to haunt {{a portion of}} Independence Avenue SW, the site {{of two of the}} city's largest and most notorious slave markets. The Yellow House or Williams Slave Pen (at about 800 Independence Avenue SW, now the site of the {{headquarters}} of the Federal Aviation Administration) was the most notorious slave pen in the capital: A modest, well-maintained, two-story yellow house concealed a very large basement in which slaves were chained to walls in windowless rooms, while a [...] yard surrounded by a [...] high brick wall provided space for the training and selling of slaves. Another large slave market, the Robey Slave Pen, was just a block away at the corner of 7th Street SW and Independence Avenue SW. On dark nights, <b>witnesses</b> <b>say</b> they have heard the clinking of chains and screams on Independence Avenue where these slave pens used to operate.|$|E

500|$|The Hay–Adams Hotel {{may also}} be host to the ghost of Marian [...] "Clover" [...] Hooper Adams. She was the wife of Henry Brooks Adams, the celebrated 19th-century American journalist, historian, {{academic}} and novelist who was the grandson of John Quincy Adams. She married Henry Adams on June 27, 1872, and in 1877 the couple moved to Washington, D.C., and rented the Slidell House at 1607 H Street NW. Their home became a salon for the capital's literati and politically powerful. In 1881, the Adamses purchased {{a lot on the}} northwest corner of 16th Street NW and H Street NW on Lafayette Square, and with their friend John Hay began building the famous Hay-Adams Houses—two of the most architecturally important private residences ever built in the city. Marian Adams' beloved father, to whom she was exceptionally close, died on April 13, 1885, and she sank into a deep depression. Just months before she was to occupy her spacious and luxurious new home, Adams committed suicide on December 6, 1885, by swallowing potassium cyanide. To mark her grave in Rock Creek Cemetery, Henry Adams commissioned sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and architect Stanford White to create the haunting Adams Memorial with its hooded, robed, androgynous figure formally titled Mystery of the Hereafter and The Peace of God that Passeth Understanding (but which is commonly called Grief). The Hay-Adams Houses were razed in 1927 by real estate developer Harry Wardman, and the Hay-Adams Hotel built on the site. Although Marian Adams never lived in the house where the Hay-Adams Hotel is today, some hotel staff say her specter haunts the site. Housekeepers and other staff have reported being hugged by an invisible presence as well as hearing a woman sobbing. Other mysterious occurrences attributed to the Adams specter include locked doors opening and closing, clock radios turning on and off, and a woman's voice whispering, [...] "What do you want?" [...] A few <b>witnesses</b> <b>say</b> the ghost is accompanied by the scent of mimosa, Adams' favorite scent. The incidents are located primarily on the hotel's fourth floor, and occur usually during {{the first two weeks of}} December (near the anniversary of Marian Adams' death).|$|E
