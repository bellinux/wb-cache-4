40|$|Auditory evoked {{potential}} (AEP) recordings often require subjects {{to ignore the}} stimuli and stay awake. In the present experiment, early (ABR), middle (MLR), and late latency (LLR) AEPs were recorded to compare the effect of five different distracting tasks: (1) doing nothing eyes open, (2) reading, (3) <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> (4) solving <b>a</b> three-digit sum, and (5) doing nothing eyes closed (or counting the stimuli for LLR). Results showed that neither the amplitudes nor the latencies of the ABR, MLR, or LLR were affected by task. However, the amount of pre-stimulus activity (noise) or amplitude rejection was significantly and differently affected by the distracting task. For the ABR, the math task was the noisiest but, for the MLR, the amount of noise was greater when <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie.</b> <b>As</b> for the LLR, reading and <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> yielded the lowest percentage of rejected traces.

Both the Wachowskis and Straczynski agreed that if they were to do a television series, they wanted to attempt something that [...] "nobody had done before", and change the [...] "vocabulary for television production" [...] the same way The Matrix became a major influence for action movies. After several days of discussion they decided on creating a show that would explore the relationship between empathy and evolution in the human race, and whose story would be told in a global scale, necessitating filming on location in several countries over the world, in contrast to the standard production model for television which attempts to limit or fake that as much as possible.
