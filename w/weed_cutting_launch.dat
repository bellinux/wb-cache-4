Widespread and frequent <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> is undertaken to maintain their key functions (e. g. flood water conveyance and maintenance of viable fisheries). In this study, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted to quantify coincident physico-chemical responses (instream and riparian) that result from <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> and to discuss their potential implications. Three weed cuts were monitored at a site on the River Lambourn (The CEH River Lambourn Observatory) and major instream and riparian impacts were observed. Measurements clearly demonstrated how <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> enhanced flood flow conveyance, reduced water levels (river and wetland), increased river velocities, and mobilised suspended sediment (with associated chemicals) and reduced the capacity for its retention within the river channel. Potential implications in relation to flood risk, water resources, downstream water quality, instream and riparian ecology, amenity value of the river, and wetland greenhouse gas emissions were considered. Provided the major influence of macrophytes on instream and riparian environments is fully understood then the manipulation of macrophytes represents an effective management tool that demonstrates the great potential of working with nature...|$|R

Two field experiments {{were conducted in}} 2005 in north-east Thailand {{to examine the effects}} of cutting date and timing of fertilizer application on suppressed weed, growth and yield of DSR. Treatments consisted of two fertilizer applications to the main plots (top-dressing at the date of cutting and 15 days after cutting; DAC) and four cutting dates of the sub-plots. Rice and <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> was performed at 30, 45, 60 and 75 days after seeding (DAS), compared with an untreated control. Cutting resulted in a higher growth rate and improved grain yield of rice compared to the untreated control. <b>Weed</b> <b>cutting</b> at 60 DAS resulted in the greatest leaf area index, which contributed to the maximum number of tiller as well as maximum plant dry mass when observed at 30 DAC. Lower densities and dry weights of weeds at 30 DAC were observed when cutting was done 60 DAS, resulting in a higher grain yield than the other cutting dates. Timing of fertilizer application had no significant effect on the density and dry weight of grasses and broad-leaved weeds, but did have a significant affected on, resulting in the lowest density of sedges at 45 DAC was observed with fertilizer applied at cutting date. Rice grain yield was higher with top-dressing of fertilizer at 15 DAC than with fertilizer applied at cutting date. The cutting treatments resulted in higher net incomes than the untreated control.

P. alpinus needs a deep fine substrate such as sand, silt or peat to root in {{and appears to}} avoid exposed situations. It is, mainly restricted to fairly nutrient-poor waters. In European rivers, it is associated with high quality environments. In a large-scale study of the plant communities of 3447 British lakes, red pondweed was found in 169, with a preference for circumneutral, moderate alkalinity lakes. Unlike other broad-leaved pondweeds, the stolons of red pondweed die back in winter, leaving constellations of resting buds rooted in the substrate, which regrow in spring. In rivers, red pondweed can persist entirely by asexual means (rooting of stem fragments and turion-like resting bodies, and growth in summer) though this may reflect <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> suppressing flowering and seed set.|$|R
5|$|From {{the late}} 1960s, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} {{of the benefits of}} retaining the canal.

The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for such action, and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal as part of the creation of the Brecon Beacons National Park convinced the Council of the wisdom of such a course of action.

50|$|<b>Weed</b> <b>cutting</b> {{boats are}} {{developed}} {{to enable the}} maintenance of canals, lakes and rivers and to remove excessive aquatic life such as algae and other plants that may negatively affect a waterway's ecology. Mechanical harvesters are large floating machines that have underwater cutting blades that sever the stems of underwater plants, gather the weeds and raise them on conveyor belts, storing the vegetation on board in a hold. Periodically this is discharged to a barge or an onshore facility. The harvested product can be composted, sent to a landfill site or used in land reclamation. In developing countries aquatic vegetation may be harvested by hand or by net from the shore, cut and harvested by boat and lifted ashore by hand, crane, pump or conveyor system.

This left a number of headstones buried under as much as 4 ft of earth, and many others were damaged. The WCPCA acknowledged the situation was unfortunate, but made no plans to uncover the now-buried headstones. Financial problems at Woodlawn continued into the late 1980s.

Physical habitat is an established measure of a river's ecological status when assessing changes to flow. Yet, it requires extensive datasets, is site specific, and {{does not account for}} dynamic processes; shortcomings that the use of hydrological and hydraulic models may alleviate. Here, simulated flows along a 600 m reach of the River Lambourn, Boxford, UK, were extracted from the 1 D MIKE 11 hydraulic component of an integrated MIKE SHE model of the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology River Lambourn Observatory. In-channel seasonal macrophyte growth and management through cutting alter water levels, represented in the hydraulic model by manipulating channel bed roughness (Manning's n). Assessment of climate change used outputs from the UK Climate Projections 2009 ensemble of global climate models for the 2080 s. River discharge outputs were disaggregated to provide velocity and depth profiles across 41 cross sections along the reach. These were integrated with habitat suitability criteria for brown trout (Salmo trutta) to generate a measure of available physical habitat. The influence of macrophyte growth caused the habitat-discharge relationship to be unusable in evaluating the sensitivity of brown trout to flow changes. Instead, projected time series were used to show an overall reduction in habitat availability, more for adult than juvenile trout. Results highlighted the impact of <b>weed</b> <b>cutting,</b> and its potential role in mitigating both flood risk and the ecological impacts of climate change.

40|$|Prolific {{growth of}} Typha australis {{in the lower}} part of the Senegal River and the Lac de Guiers {{resulted}} from changed ecological conditions following the construction of two high dams in the Senegal River. Fluctuation of the water level has decreased markedly and the water has changed from brackish to fresh as the inflow of salt water from the ocean is prevented. The efficiency of a hydraulic <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> boat (model Conver 480 H) has been tested in various plots in the Lac de Guiers. This lake, connected with the Senegal River, is economically very important as it is the city of Dakar's major drinking water supply and also provides irrigation water for vast agricultural areas. Cutting, performed at 20 cm and 50 cm below the water surface, was very effective in removing Typha stands. However, due to the excessively thick stems of the Typha plants, cutting took much more time compared to similar operations in Europe. It was estimated that approximately 35 h were required to clear one ha of dense Typha stands. Directly after cutting re-growth was observed during a relatively brief period (approximately three months), however, subsequently all newly formed growth tips in the plots had suddenly disappeared. It was concluded that this sudden collapse was linked to a destruction of the root zone due to anoxic conditions. Eventual re-growth was relatively slow as after one year the plots were still largely free from Typha plants. Efficiency of mowing was not related significantly to depth of cutting...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed {{by the community}} that reusable launch vehicles will dramatically reduce launch costs because you don’t “throw away the vehicle ” every time it is used.

Finally, the model is used to determine the broad economic conditions under which reusable or expendable vehicles will be more or less expensive. This is also applied to determining under what economic conditions portions of a launch vehicle should be reused or expended...|$|R
40|$|Historically, close {{attention}} has been paid to negative impacts associated with nutrient loads to streams and rivers, but today hydromorphological alterations are considered increasingly implicated when lowland streams do not achieve good ecological status. Here, we explore if trait-abundance patterns of aquatic plants change along gradients in hydromorphological degradation and eutrophication in lowland stream sites located in Denmark. Specifically, we hypothesised that: i) changes in trait-abundance patterns occur along gradients in hydromorphological degradation and ii) trait-abundance patterns can serve to disentangle effects of eutrophication and hydromorphological degradation in lowland streams reflecting that the mechanisms behind changes differ. We used monitoring data from a total of 147 stream reaches with combined data on aquatic plant species abundance, catchment land use, hydromorphological alterations (i. e. planform, cross section, <b>weed</b> <b>cutting)</b> and water chemistry parameters. Traits related to life form, dispersal, reproduction and survival together with ecological preference values for nutrients and light (Ellenberg N and L) were allocated to 41 species representing 79 % of the total species pool. We found clear evidence that habitat degradation (hydromorphological alterations and eutrophication) mediated selective changes in the trait-abundance patterns of the plant community. Specific traits could distinguish hydromorphological degradation (free-floating, surface; anchored floating leaves; anchored heterophylly) from eutrophication (free-floating, submerged; leaf area). We provide a conceptual framework for interpretation of how eutrophication and hydromorphological degradation interact and how this is reflected in trait-abundance patterns in aquatic plant communities in lowland streams. Our findings support the merit of trait-based approaches in biomonitoring as they shed light on mechanisms controlling structural changes under environmental stress. The ability to disentangle several stressors is particularly important in lowland stream environments where several stressors act in concert since the impact of the most important stressor can be targeted first, which is essential to improve the ecological status...|$|R

Some of the biological research has focused on the effects of aquatic plant management on stream metabolism. This work was carried out at CEH’s recently acquired experimental area (the Lambourn Observatory) at Boxford. During the course of <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> in the summer months, the primary in-stream production was compared before and after. The preliminary results show a decrease in the process of gross production and respiration, but an increase in net production, with a change from the heterotrophic to autotrophic.

We have also been looking at the relationship between nutrients and biomass in Floating pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), which has now been reported in around 150 sites in the southern England and south Wales. This study was undertaken at the Pevensey Levels and the overall results show that the biomass of the plants is positively correlated with high levels of nutrients; meanwhile, the root length and the ratio between above and below biomass decrease. Concerning chemical control we have continued with experiments in Witham 4 th and Black Sluice IDB areas on the impacts of the herbicide diquat, mentioned previously in this meeting. This year it has been observed that dissolved oxygen declined for a period of about two weeks, which was also the case last year, recovering but never reaching the initial level.

Two research areas with weed (Rubus idaeus (L.) and Calamagrostis epigejos (L.) Roth) were founded in 2011 at SLT 4 K and 5 S. Growth reactions of douglas fir were monitored on these areas, being it areas with weed left without any intervention during the whole vegetation period or areas with regular full-area <b>weed</b> <b>cutting.</b> The following criteria were evaluated: shoot height, root crown thinkness, growth, height of forked tree sprout, crown height, trunk undulation, branching regularity, number of branches, needle length and trunk shape, soil moisture, chemical composition of the assimilation apparatus {{and the impact of}} sunshine. Altogether 512 pieces of douglas fir plants were measured. The results show that douglas fir demonstrated higher height growths every year in areas without cutting than in areas with full-scale cutting, Root crown thickness at SLT 4 K was also bigger in the areas with weed. On the contrary, cutting proved to have positive effect at SLT 5 S and the root crown thickness was slightly higher here.

Factors of experiments are: stem diameter in 2 levels (smaller and larger than 5 mm), distance of spraying jet from weeds in 3 levels (10, 20 and 30 cm) and two types of plant holders: blade and plate. The results showed that stem diameter and jet distance from the weed stem had significant effects on cutting time (at the 1 %).

We evaluated the following parameters: {{the number of}} <b>cuttings</b> stalks that <b>launched</b> shoots and/or roots, vigor, number of roots per plant and root length per plant. Factorial analysis of variance (stems age x source of Nitrogen; and age of stem x Nitrogen level) was applied using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach.

Propagation success was higher using cuttings from mature stems (60. 2 %), a value 1. 6 times higher than obtained with stem cuttings from young stems (38. 0 %). Application of Nitrogen, in both forms, did not influence any of the evaluated parameters.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the economic literature on invasive species, social capital connection to climate change and environmental good provision as well as energy demand management. It contains five independent papers connected by the broader theme of environmental management. Two papers (I and II) deal with invasive species while {{the third and fourth}} probes the effect of social capital on carbon dioxide emissions (CO₂) and individuals’ decision to contribute toward environmental protection. The first paper attempts a comprehensive theoretical and empirical review of findings in economics with respect to the challenging question of how to manage invasive species. We find a relatively large body of literature on the assessment of damage costs of invasive species; single species and groups of species at different geographical scales. Estimated damage costs show large variation, from less than 1 million USD to costs corresponding to 12 % of gross domestic product (GDP), depending on the methods employed, geographical scale, and scope with respect to inclusion of different species. In the second paper, a simple bioeconomic model is developed and applied to the management of the aquatic invasive species Elodea canadensis (Michx) in Lake Lötsjön in Sweden. A weed harvesting programme is proposed and numerically investigated based on the model. Results suggest that it is economically optimal to engage in the <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> programme since it yields positive net economic benefits and that early action is the best strategy. Social capital is the main connecting factor between Paper III and IV. In both papers, different constructs of social capital were computed through principal component analysis and modelled empirically to explain different environmental outcomes. Paper III investigates whether or not social capital explain Swedish county-level aggregate and sectoral per capita CO₂ emissions in an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) framework. The results showed significant dampening effects of trust and overall social capital indices on total emissions, but impact heterogeneity was evident among sectors. Estimated effects were negative on emissions from industry but positive on transport emissions. In Paper IV, we assess the influence of social capital on individuals’ willingness to contribute toward environmental protection in Sweden. Findings show significant impact of social capital. The fifth paper provides an empirical analysis of energy demand in Ghana. Elasticities of seven key disaggregated energy types were estimated using time series analysis. The results suggest energy prices, income, urbanization and economic structure are significant demand drivers of the different energy types with varying elasticities. Further evidence show high degree of inter-fuel substitution in energy demand in Ghana, particularly from gasoline, diesel and kerosene toward LPG consumption...|$|R
40|$|The thesis Application of {{perennials}} in a system {{of vertical}} garden aims {{to verify the}} cultivation of selected assortments of perennials which are planted in vertical exterior walls with substrate technology. Another aim is to suggest and recommend new taxa for further cultivation on these walls. The literary research part presents the basic concepts which explain the term perennial. Perennials are divided into several categories depending on their demands for the habitat with the purpose to understand the varied character of their growth and {{the differences between the}} individual species. Furthermore, the thesis includes a chapter on vertical gardens, whose founder {{is believed to be the}} French botanist Patrick Blanc. He was the first to have presented his green wall Mur végétal in France. Facade greening is more widely spread abroad (e. g. in France, Singapore or London) thanks to the favourable climatic conditions. This form of plant cultivation is being attempted in the Czech Republic and new species of perennials which would thrive in the local climate are being tested. Testing of perennials was carried out on five vertical walls on the estate belonging to the test station of the faculty of gardening in Troja, Prague. The walls were marked with letters and stationed according to sun exposure intensity (A shadow, B, C, D sunlight, E direct sunlight). A new assortment of perennials was planted on walls A and B. Previously tested species were used on wall C and the plants were set in an ornament. Walls D and E had already been planted. All the walls were regularly monitored three or four times per month. Over the course of the observation, regular watering and maintenance of the perennials were carried out (e. g. <b>weeding,</b> <b>cutting</b> and chemical treatment). Assessment of the plants was carried out based on a scale of 1 to 5 points and the criteria included colouring, habitus, vitality and overall aesthetic appeal of the plants. Points for the individual species of perennials tested on walls A, B, D and E were counted and the ones with the highest amount of points (60 % and more) are suitable for planting on vertical walls. Wall C was assessed by 50 evaluators using a questionnaire the overall aesthetic appeal of the wall was evaluated. The results briefly describe the advantages and disadvantages of the individual species of perennials depending on their development during the observed period. Furthermore, a list of species suitable for planting on vertical walls is created based on the points acquired. These species are also graphically depicted based on the aesthetic appeal of the plant over the observed period. The first six places comprise the perennials Bergenia cordifolia (198 p.), Carex comans (187 p.), Epimedium x versicolor Sulphureum (171 p.), Cerastium biebersteinii (222 p.), Lewisia cotyledon (210 p.) and Festuca scoparia (207 p.). The discussion deals with the issue of vertical gardens and cultivation of perennials which commonly grow in shallow soil profile. In conclusion, species which can be grown on vertical exterior walls with substrate technology were identified in the assortment of selected perennials. These species are indicated in the results...|$|R
500|$|The {{new owners}} {{set to work}} immediately. The dry section was {{excavated}} and lined with a butyl liner to prevent leakage. The canal was reopened in 1971. Navigation was restricted to unpowered boats, {{with the exception of}} a maintenance boat that was used for <b>cutting</b> <b>weed,</b> while the final section from Fossend to Lowdwells, which would have been part of the original main line to Exeter, is designated as a nature reserve, and so all navigation and angling is discouraged. The canal is now a designated country park, and a horse-drawn tourist narrowboat runs from Tiverton. Since 2003 powered boats have been allowed on the Canal, subject to Licence from Devon County Council. The Canal is also a very popular Coarse Fishing spot [...] and angling rights on the Canal are leased to the Tiverton and District Angling Club. In addition to holding a valid Environment Agency Rod Licence, a permit must be purchased in advance.|$|R
