50|$|Purely {{in terms}} of the {{temperature}} of the copper wire, an increase in the speed with which the <b>wire</b> <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> the pulley system has the same effect as an increase in resistance. Therefore, the speed with which the wire can be drawn through varies quadratically as the voltage applied.|$|E

5000|$|An {{electric}} current flowing in a wire creates {{a magnetic field}} around the wire, due to Ampere's law (see drawing below). To concentrate the magnetic field, in an electromagnet the wire is wound into a coil with many turns of wire lying side by side. The magnetic field of all the turns of <b>wire</b> <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> {{the center of the}} coil, creating a strong magnetic field there. A coil forming the shape of a straight tube (a helix) is called a solenoid.|$|E
50|$|The {{velocity}} factor (VF), also called wave propagation speed or {{velocity of propagation}} (VoP or ''''''), of a transmission medium is {{the ratio of the}} speed at which a wavefront (of an acoustic signal, for example, or an electromagnetic signal, a radio signal, a light pulse in an optical fibre or a change of the electrical voltage on a copper <b>wire)</b> <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> the medium, to the speed of light in a vacuum. For optical signals, the {{velocity factor}} is the reciprocal of the refractive index.|$|E
5000|$|Besides sensors, the Wiegand {{effect is}} used for {{security}} keycard door locks. [...] The plastic keycard has a series of short lengths of Wiegand wire embedded in it, which encodes the key by {{the presence or absence}} of wires. A second track of wires provides a clock track. The card is read by pulling it through a slot in a reader device, which has a fixed magnetic field and a sensor coil. As each length of <b>wire</b> <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> the magnetic field, its magnetic state flips, which indicates a 1, and this is sensed by the coil. The absence of a wire indicates a 0. The resulting Wiegand protocol digital code is then sent to a host controller to determine whether to electrically unlock the door.|$|E

50|$|One {{system works}} by {{providing}} pre-cut lengths of safety wire {{that have a}} large cap on one end. The cable is threaded through a hole on the fastener to be secured, which {{is large enough to}} accommodate the wire but too small for the cap {{on the other end of}} the cable to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> it. After the other end of the <b>wire</b> is <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> the anchor point, the technician takes an extra end cap and the special tool that is available from Daniels and crimps the cap on to that end of the wire. Again, the end cap is too large to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> the hole that the <b>wire</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through,</b> and thus the cable is secured.|$|R
5000|$|Contrary to {{ordinary}} coincident-current magnetic-core memory, {{which was used}} for RAM at the time, the ferrite cores in a core rope are just used as transformers. The signal from a word line <b>wire</b> <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> a given core is coupled to the bit line wire and interpreted as a binary [...] "one", while a word line wire that bypasses the core is not coupled to the bit line wire and is read as a [...] "zero". In the AGC, up to 64 <b>wires</b> could be <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> a single core.|$|R
5000|$|Regelation is the {{phenomenon}} of melting under pressure and freezing again when the pressure is reduced. Many sources state that regelation can be demonstrated by looping a fine wire around a block of ice, with a heavy weight attached to it. The pressure exerted on the ice slowly melts it locally, permitting the wire {{to pass through the}} entire block. The wire's track will refill as soon as pressure is relieved, so the ice block will remain solid even after wire passes completely through. This experiment is possible for ice at −10 °C or cooler, and while essentially valid, the details of the process by which the <b>wire</b> <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> the ice are complex. [...] The phenomenon works best with high thermal conductivity materials such as copper, since latent heat of fusion from the top side needs to be transferred to the lower side to supply latent heat of melting.|$|E
50|$|Two or more wires may {{be wrapped}} concentrically, {{separated}} by insulation, to form coaxial cable. The wire or cable may be further protected with substances like paraffin, {{some kind of}} preservative compound, bitumen, lead, aluminum sheathing, or steel taping. Stranding or covering machines wind material onto wire which passes through quickly. Some of the smallest machines for cotton covering have a large drum, which grips the wire and moves it through toothed gears; the <b>wire</b> <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> the centre of disks mounted above a long bed, and the disks carry each a number of bobbins varying from six to twelve or more in different machines. A supply of covering material is wound on each bobbin, and the end is led on to the wire, which occupies a central position relatively to the bobbins; the latter being revolved at a suitable speed bodily with their disks, the cotton is consequently served on to the wire, winding in spiral fashion so as to overlap. If {{a large number of}} strands are required the disks are duplicated, so that as many as sixty spools may be carried, the second set of strands being laid over the first.|$|E

40|$|Wire {{scanners}} {{are used}} to measure the profile and the position of particle beams and are therefore ubiquitous in accelerator facilities. A <b>wire</b> <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> the electron beam, causing a charge on the wire and the deflection of beam particles itself. The particles bended by the wire are detected by a scintillation counter. The maximum of the photomultiplier signal corresponds with the center of the beam profile.

Following, is a short introduction of the physical difficulty of detecting the signal influenced on the wire, a possible realization of the necessary electronics and showing preliminary results of measurements carried out at the Tesla Test Facility TTF I in Hamburg and the Photon Injector PITZ at Zeuthen.

40|$|The {{fluid and}} {{particle}} dynamics of a High-Velocity Oxygen-Fuel Thermal Spray torch are analyzed using computational and experimental techniques. Three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{results are presented}} for a curved aircap used for coating interior surfaces such as engine cylinder bores. The device analyzed {{is similar to the}} Metco Diamond Jet Rotating Wire (DJRW) torch. The feed gases are injected through an axisymmetric nozzle into the curved aircap. Premixed propylene and oxygen are introduced from an annulus in the nozzle, while cooling air is injected between the nozzle and the interior wall of the aircap. The combustion process is modeled using a single-step finite-rate chemistry model with a total of 9 gas species which includes dissociation of combustion products. A continually-fed steel <b>wire</b> <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> the center of the nozzle and melting occurs at a conical tip near the exit of the aircap. Wire melting is simulated computationally by injecting liquid steel particles into the flow field near the tip of the wire. Experimental particle velocity measurements during wire feed were also taken using a Laser Two-Focus (L 2 F) velocimeter system. Flow fields inside and outside the aircap are presented and particle velocity predictions are compared with experimental measurements outside of the aircap...|$|E

5000|$|Grommets are {{generally}} used whenever <b>wires</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> punched/drilled sheet metal or plastic casings for this reason. [...] Molded and continuous strip grommets, {{also known as}} edge grommets, are manufactured {{in a wide variety}} of sizes and lengths expressly for this purpose; they are usually a single piece which can be inserted by hand. Two-piece hard plastic devices are available which also grip the <b>wire</b> that <b>passes</b> <b>through.</b> These are called strain relief bushings and are often used to insulate, anchor, and protect power cords where they enter panels. Preventing a tug or twist on the wire from stressing the electrical connections inside the connected equipment. Sleeved grommets have a flexible extension (sleeve), usually tapered or moulded to flex increasingly towards the free end in order to reduce fracturing of electrical insulation.|$|R

5000|$|Shrouded turbine. Many {{turbine rotor}} blades have {{shrouding}} at the top, which interlocks {{with that of}} adjacent blades, to increase damping and thereby reduce blade flutter. In large land-based electricity generation steam turbines, the shrouding is often complemented, especially in the long blades of a low-pressure turbine, with lacing <b>wires.</b> These <b>wires</b> <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> holes drilled in the blades at suitable distances from the blade root and are usually brazed to the blades {{at the point where}} they <b>pass</b> <b>through.</b> Lacing <b>wires</b> reduce blade flutter in {{the central part of the}} blades.

50|$|One {{problem with}} this system is that other cores on the same lines (X or Y) will give off a very small signal as well, {{potentially}} masking the signal being looked for. The conventional solution was to wire the read line diagonally {{back and forth through}} the plane, so that these smaller signals would cancel out—the positive signal from one would be a negative signal from the next as the <b>wire</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> it in the opposite direction. However this solution also made wiring the core fairly difficult, and considerable amounts of research went into various ways to improve the cost of wiring core.|$|R
