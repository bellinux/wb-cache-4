40|$|CEBAF at Jefferson Lab is {{striving to}} achieve its maximum {{reliability}} at the maximum deliverable energy for physics experiments. The most critical {{part of this is}} the acceleration systems in the two linacs. The individual limiting characteristics of the 320 srf cavities, each with its own klystron and control system, continue to be refined as is the system for providing optimal setup tools to operations. The field-emission-stimulated discharges at the cold rf waveguide input window continue as the energy-limiting effect. In addition, operation at increased rf power levels have produced unanticipated heating in the region near the warm polymeric rf windows. The latter has stimulated the migration to a more durable ceramic replacement window. During 2000, CEBAF encountered its first cryomodule helium leak into beam vacuum, most likely through an indium <b>wire</b> <b>seal.</b> Characterization of the leak and accommodation methods used will be described...|$|E

50|$|Cryogenic seals {{provide a}} {{mechanical}} containment mechanism for materials held at cryogenic temperatures, such as cryogenic fluids. Various techniques, including soldering and welding {{are available for}} creating seals; however, specialized materials and processes are necessary to hermetically entrap cryogenic constituents under vacuum-tight conditions. Most commonly used are liquid helium and liquid nitrogen, which boil at very low temperatures, below −153 °C (120 K), as well as hydrocarbons with low freezing points and refrigerating mixtures. Pure indium wire or solder preform washers are accepted as the most reliable low temperature sealing materials. When correctly formed, indium will afford leak rates of less than 4.0x10 -9 mbar- liter/sec.

30|$|The {{application}} of silver as a cathode conductive material, interconnect <b>wires,</b> and <b>sealing</b> for anode lead connection for a µSOFC was studied. The addition of silver as a cathode conductive layer reduced the cell overpotential {{and increased the}} cell performance.

The silver thermal expansion did not match with the thermal expansion of the other cell materials, and therefore, caused damage to the glass sealant. Silver was also found unstable in the dual atmosphere. The results demonstrated that the microstructure of the silver anode lead connection wire changed after it had been exposed to the dual atmosphere, the solid silver <b>wires</b> and the <b>seal</b> became porous. The formation of striation structures and porosity affected the mechanical strength of the Ag interconnect wires.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTNikoloz Nioradze, MSUniversity of Pittsburgh 2009 The work {{describes}} {{development of}} novel Pt disk electrodes with nanometer diameters using {{focused ion beam}} (FIB) milling. The nanofabricated electrodes are applied as probes of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for studying of electrochemical processes on redox reactive substrates. Nanotips are fabricated by pulling a platinum <b>wire</b> <b>sealed</b> in a glass capillary using a laser pipette puller. An inlaid platinum disk eventually is exposed by milling {{the tip of a}} pulled capillary by FIB. Electrodes are as small as 300 - 500 nm in diameter with a ratio of insulating glass sheath and Pt wire (RG) as small as 3. Moreover, FIB milling gives a flat tip surface. The small RG and smooth surface are helpful for approaching a probe close to a substrate in SECM feedback experiments. Nanometer-sized electrodes can be readily positioned within 100 nm from a polished platinum surface. After placing the tip close to the Pt disk, a potential of the Pt substrate is swept to drive a redox reaction, which is monitored as a current response at the nanometer-sized electrode. Presented method of combination of SECM and substrate cyclic voltammetry (CV) will allow for accurate extraction of electrochemical kinetic parameters of a redox reaction. Overall, it can be concluded that tips fabricated by presented method can be successfully exploited for SECM experiments. Described SECM-substrate CV approach will be useful for monitoring of electrochemical behavior of different conductive substrates...|$|R

Surprisingly, the cell performance was stable {{for more than}} 850  h of operation under such gas leakage conditions.

40|$|We have {{observed}} cyclic voltammograms for the AgCI/Ag couple in polycrystalline NaAICI 4 us ing a tungsten ultramicro-electrode. Cathodic and anodic peaks are observed symmetrically {{about the potential}} of a Ag(1) /Ag reference electrode in the same medium, with overpotentials and peak currents that are strongly temperature-dependent. On the assumption of Fickian diffusion in the polycrystalline solid we have calculated approximate diffusion coefficients and an activation energy for diffusion of Ag(1) in the solid electrolyte. The working electrode was a 25 ~m diameter tungsten <b>wire,</b> <b>sealed</b> in Pyrex to present a circular disk of area 4. 9 x 10 - 6 cm 2. The reference electrode was a Pt wire electrolytically coated with Ag, and the counter electrode was a Pt wire. All three electrodes were immersed in the same compartment.

40|$|Ultrasonic Metal Welding (USMW) is a {{solid state}} welding process applied in many {{industrial}} areas, e. g., metal plate welding, electrical <b>wiring,</b> tube <b>sealing</b> and micro welding for electronic applications.

30|$|In this paper, the {{behaviour}} {{of silver}} as cathode conductive material, interconnect <b>wire,</b> and <b>sealing</b> for anode lead connection for microtubular solid oxide fuel cells (µSOFC) is reported. The changes in silver morphology are examined by {{scanning electron microscopy}} on cells that had been operated under reformed methane. It is found that using silver in an solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack can improve the cell performance. However, it is also concluded that silver {{may be responsible for}} cell degradation. This report brings together and explains all the known problems with application of silver for SOFCs. The results show that silver is unstable in interconnect and in cathode environments. It is found that the process of cell passivation/activation promotes silver migration. The difference in thermal expansion of silver and sealant results in damage to the glass. It is concluded that when silver is exposed to a dual atmosphere condition, high levels of porosity formation is seen in the dense silver interconnect. The relevance of application of silver in SOFC stacks is discussed.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{limiting}} {{the rate at which}} wire can be drawn through tungsten-carbide or diamond dies is the severe die wear which may occur at hjgh speed. If true hydrodynamic (fluid-film) lubrication could be provided in the die, wear would probably be much reduced. I t is suggested that this can be done by supplying oil to the entry of the die at a pressure comparable with the yield stress of the wire. The necessary pressure can be conveniently generated by causing the wire to approach the die through a tube of diameter slightly larger than the <b>wire</b> diameter, <b>sealed</b> on to the inlet side of the die. Experimental work shows that the friction in the die itself can then be so reduced that, even when the drag in the tube is allowed for, the total drawing force is less than with the existing method of soap lubrication; and tests with steel dies have shown large reductions in wear. A theory of the behaviour of the inlet tube and of temperature distribution in the system is included...|$|R
