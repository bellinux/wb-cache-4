5|$|Development of Wild Guns {{began when}} a small team of Natsume staff was asked to create a game quickly and cheaply <b>while</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> their next major assignment.

Two other people helped as support staff. The team chose to develop for the Super NES because the three had worked together previously on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for that system. Development of Wild Guns lasted approximately five months and was led by Taniguchi.|$|E
5|$|Domentziolus, however, {{is better}} known as a general in the Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628.

The two had allied against Phocas, with Narses gathering his forces in Edessa, <b>while</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Sassanid reinforcements. In 604, Phocas appointed Domentziolus as magister militum per Orientem and sent him against the Persians. His predecessors Germanus and Leontius had both been defeated, the former killed in battle and the latter recalled and imprisoned by Phocas.|$|E

5|$|From 1961 to 1967, he was {{a leading}} member of a strong Scottish {{international}} team that lost only once to England, in 1965, shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2–1 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the 1966 World Cup, he taunted the opposition by ball juggling <b>while</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> his teammates to find good positions.

Angier confronts Tesla, who admits to never having built any device for Borden but has successfully built a replicating machine for Angier, capable of reproducing animate and inanimate objects a distance from the machine. As Tesla departs, he advises Angier to destroy the machine.|$|E
