5|$|A naval {{footnote}} in {{the history}} of Lundy was the wreck of the Royal Navy battleship HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground near Shutter Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00a.m. on 30 May 1906. Thinking they were aground at Hartland Point on the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding out where they <b>were</b> <b>after</b> encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.|$|E
5|$|Accounting for inflation, nine Atlantic hurricanes {{caused a}} damage total of over $10billion (2006USD), {{including}} three from the 2005 season. The costliest was Hurricane Katrina, with damage amounting to $84.6billion, though in normalized dollars it {{may only be}} second to the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926. Of the thirty costliest United States hurricanes, ten <b>were</b> <b>after</b> the year 2000.|$|E
5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that <b>were</b> <b>after</b> the initial release date of the device.|$|E

We interviewed six site creators {{to understand the}} motivations they felt and the challenges they encountered. We found that these challenges ultimately resulted {{from a lack of}} information visibility, particularly concerning work in progress. Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective site’s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R

However the Spanish conquistador, Francisco Juan Delgado de Leon, captures Sahin and some other Ottoman {{soldiers}} before Morgan can. Morgan is then forced to fight and defeat the Spanish, who are attacking Morgan's new allies, the Aztecs. After his battle to defend the Aztecs, Morgan realizes that Delgado and the Spanish <b>were</b> <b>after</b> the map to the Lake of the Moon disguised as the mosaic in the Aztecs' town square. The mosaic shows the Lake of the Moon being in Florida.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson was {{defeated}} for reelection in 1861. For {{the duration of}} the war, which lasted until April 1865, he stayed out of public life in order to avoid being arrested as many other Confederate sympathizers <b>were.</b> <b>After</b> the war, he was a delegate to the National Union Party's convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1865. He was a supporter of the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them <b>were.</b> <b>After</b> he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 special editions {{were made}} with such titles as “When the Asahi Shimbun <b>is</b> <b>after</b> you” and “When China <b>is</b> <b>after</b> you”, but these {{seemingly}} provocative titles are a so-called Shokun tradition.|$|R

5|$|Salim {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by TJ Ramini. After Drake defeats the henchmen {{in the desert}} ghost town, Salim comes to him on horseback and helps him escape. After Drake was rescued, Salim tells him that the Atlantis of the Sands is a {{dangerous}} place and that Marlowe cannot be allowed to enter because of the evil within. Drake believes that she could use these powers to control others through fear, realising it was not treasure they <b>were</b> <b>after.</b> When Sully is rescued, Salim brings both {{of them to the}} open desert where the Atlantis of the Sands is located. Salim heads off and gets separated from Drake and Sully because of the heavy sandstorm. After Talbot is defeated and the Atlantis of the Sands collapse, Salim appears in time to save them.|$|E

The Carpi are nowhere mentioned in Ammianus' detailed account of these epic events, suggesting that any who remained north of the Danube had probably lost their distinct identity.|$|E
25|$|First of all, {{they changed}} the {{relative}} preponderance of pole weapons over firearms. Henceforth a company of 119 men would have 38% pikes, 25% muskets, and 37% wheellock arquebuses, compared with the old formation that had more than 50% pole weapons, like pikes and halberds. Because the wheel locks were deemed unreliable, by 1609 the arquebuses were phased out and all firearms were to be muskets. In the cavalry the lancers <b>were</b> <b>after</b> 1596 replaced with cuirassiers and arquebussiers, both armed with firearms.|$|E

25|$|After several failed {{attempts}} at developing an official team-owned mascot, the Vikings finally introduced Viktor the Viking during the 2007 Vikings' season. Team officials had long {{indicated that they}} <b>were</b> <b>after</b> a mascot concept that would primarily appeal to the team's younger fan base. Viktor the Viking, a muscle-bound, blond-haired and mustachioed character, wears a Vikings' #1 jersey and an oversized Vikings helmet with protruding horns and a small yellow nose guard. Due to contract disputes in 2015, the team lost its mascot Ragnar the Viking and still is without him for the 2017 season.|$|E

It ruled unanimously that, under section 44(i), Joyce, Ludlam, Nash, Roberts and Waters had been ineligible to be elected, while Canavan and Xenophon had been eligible. The immediate outcome {{was that the}} government risks losing its one-seat majority in the House of Representatives {{if it does not}} win the required by-election and a number of Senate seats were temporarily vacant (affecting the party balance while they <b>were).</b> <b>After</b> countbacks, the High Court has approved successors from the same parties to Senators Ludlam, Waters and Roberts, but not yet to Nash.|$|E

25|$|Operators {{were unable}} to restart the {{isolation}} condensers {{for an extended period}} of time after the tsunami (greater than 30minutes). After that, the isolation condensers were operated intermittently, for unknown reasons. The isolation condensers were designed to successfully cool Unit 1 for at least 8hours, and it is unknown how effective they <b>were.</b> <b>After</b> that, refill would have been required to the isolation condenser tanks which are under atmospheric pressure (low pumping head requirements). By design, isolation condensers would have removed the heat from the reactor transferring it out of the primary containment and into the atmosphere, but with limited and non-existent operation, core and containment cooling was not successful.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{his best}} years <b>were</b> <b>after</b> the war, for {{it was not until}} 1937 that he became a really {{valuable}} member of the side. He had his best season with the ball, in terms of his average, in 1946, taking 56 wickets at only 15.58 each. He made his highest score of 255 in 1949 against the touring New Zealanders, the innings taking only six and a half hours. That season was his best with the bat, both in terms of aggregate (1789) and average (40.65). He finished on a high note, retiring after the 1952 season in which Surrey won the County Championship outright {{for the first time since}} 1914, having shared the title in 1950.|$|E

On the second day, more testimonies <b>were,</b> <b>after</b> State Attorney's and Dahlgren's consent, read by the judge. This was followed by questioning of expert witnesses. According to toxicology report, there were no drugs nor alcohol in the blood of the victims. According to a sexologist testimony, Danhlgren was not a sadist, despite being interested in sadomasochism. His sexual orientation could not be determined due to his sexual immaturity.|$|E
25|$|At the time, the Schuylkill Valley was a {{hotly contested}} territory, with {{constant}} conflicts over titles, some dating to before the American Revolution and British colonial rule, and rights. Had {{any of their}} competitors became aware of what Tower and Munson were up to, they may well have bought up the land the pair <b>were</b> <b>after,</b> and charged exorbitant prices for it, or worse, refused to sell it at all. The partners operated secretly to protect their interests. Tower would make the purchases, and convey the titles to legal dummies to hide the ownership of the land. By 1858 Tower and Munson had acquired eleven thousand acres (45km2). By now, Munson and Tower's plan was well out of the bag, and anyone who had even a partial claim {{to any of the}} lands began to litigate.
