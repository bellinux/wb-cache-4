6000|$|... 'Selfish things!' thought Alice, and she <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Good-night' {{and leave}} them, when Tweedledum sprang {{out from under}} the {{umbrella}} and seized her by the wrist.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said James, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{we would}} make it your way. I rather {{think it would be}} better to make it towards the land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Andersons!" [...] cried Ethel, laughing. [...] "Margaret <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. We {{only want}} Harry, to exact the forfeit! Poor dear little humming-bird! It gives one an oppression on the chest, {{to think of}} her having that great do-nothing brother on her hands all day." ...|$|E
30|$|Speaker D: I <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{write it}} out, {{whatever}} you tell em.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only in name apparently," [...] said Clym {{with rising}} excitement. [...] "I believe she means to elope tonight with Wildeve. I <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> look to it." ...|$|R
60|$|Adieu, my Clarinda! I <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> propose {{your health}} {{by way of}} grace-drink. SYLVANDER.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} this at all, sir. Mr. Savine made that drawing. I know his arrows on the measurement lines, and I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{so when you}} stopped me. I have a confession to make. I believe I dropped that paper out of my wallet on board the steamer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, very true, my dear," [...] {{cried the}} latter, though Jane {{had not spoken}} a word--"I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the same thing. It is {{time for us to}} be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good night." ...|$|E
60|$|The old gentleman <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Oliver {{should not}} go out on any account; when a most {{malicious}} cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on this head at least: at once.|$|E
60|$|KNOX. Come {{along and}} have your {{education}} improved. A Manchu wedding <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pass by....|$|R
60|$|I {{went to the}} bedside. The old man <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep. I {{shook him}} by the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{in another}} half-hour we shall all know. When I left, the judge <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sum up.|$|R
6000|$|Mother leaped up, furious, and snapped, [...] "I'm simply {{ashamed of}} you, {{the way you}} act, like you never would grow up and get a little common sense, what with scaring me into conniption fits, and as I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and I only say it for your own good, if you haven't got enough sense to know how little sense you have got, you at your time of life, why, well, all I can say is--you ought to know better." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ethel did {{not like}} {{anything}} to {{be said to be}} too hard for her, and was very near pleading she only wanted time, but some recollection came across her, and presently she said, [...] "I suppose it is a wrong sort of ambition to want to learn more, in one's own way, when one is told it is not good for one. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I hated being a woman, and having these tiresome little trifles--my duty--instead of learning, which is yours, Norman." ...|$|E
60|$|There stood Mr. Chipperton, {{holding a}} lighted match, {{which he had}} just struck. He was looking at {{something}} on the wall. As we ran in, he turned and smiled, and <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something, when Corny threw herself into his arms, and his wife, squeezing by, took him around his neck so suddenly that his hat flew off and bumped on the floor, like an empty tin can. He always wore a high silk hat. He made a grab for his hat, and the match burned his fingers.|$|E
30|$|Speaker D: [inaudible] I <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{put this}} here. I {{do not know}} what you are doing there.|$|R
6000|$|WILLIE. No, {{not in the}} open--that's a fact. Some folks says a {{great deal}} more, in semi-private. You <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> explain to me, {{on behalf of the}} men, whom you so ably {{represent}} and so wisely lead, Job Arthur--we won't say by the nose--you <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell me--on behalf of the men, of course, not of the masters--that you think of others, besides yourself. Do you mind explaining WHAT others? ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> rub {{it on the}} cat when George Barstow caught 'old of 'is arm {{and stopped}} 'im.|$|R
6000|$|Leaving the river, {{they began}} to ascend a steep chalky lane, which had been wet all the winter, and was now full of rough {{hardened}} wheel-ruts and holes made by slipping horses. Elizabeth thought that Robert Bruce's calthorps could hardly have made the ground more uneven, and she <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so, when Helen groaned out, 'What a horrid place! I slip and bruise my ancle every minute.' Upon which she immediately took {{the other side of}} the question, and answered, 'It is not nearly so bad as the long lane on the down, and you never complain of that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Bud peeped out and <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I {{see nothing}} but snow," [...] when she saw that {{what looked like a}} party of flakes blowing up to the door was really the seven Kobolds loaded with great piles of white silkweed for their spinning. She dropped her best courtesy, smiled her sweetest smile, and called out, [...] "Welcome home, my masters!" [...] like a little maidservant, as she led the way to the large room, now bright and warm with the fire roaring up the chimney made by a hole in the old roots.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did, indeed,' responded Bob Sawyer, 'and I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I wasn't at home, but if you'd leave {{a message}} I'd be sure {{to give it to}} myself; for he don't know me; no more does the Lighting and Paving. I think the Church-rates guesses who I am, and I know the Water-works does, because I drew a tooth of his when I first came down here. But come in, come in!' Chattering in this way, Mr. Bob Sawyer pushed Mr. Winkle into the back room, where, amusing himself by boring little {{circular}} caverns in the chimney-piece with a red-hot poker, sat no less a person than Mr. Benjamin Allen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good evening, Mrs. Quinton," [...] {{said the}} little doctor heartily. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give your husband his {{sleeping}} draught." ...|$|R
60|$|Jerome. [Who {{has come}} to gate as she disappears.] Paul, you there! that is lucky. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask for you.|$|R
6000|$|... "What! {{all that}} great patch of land with {{cabbages}} and sunflowers, which the corporation <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run a main street through?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a year}} or two ago now. I {{was sitting}} one evening at the gate, smoking a pipe and looking at a {{newspaper}} I 'ad found in the office, when I see a gentleman coming along from the swing-bridge. Well- dressed, clean-shaved chap 'e was, smoking a cigarette. He was walking slow and looking about 'im casual-like, until his eyes fell on me, when he gave a perfect jump of surprise, and, arter looking at me very 'ard, walked on a little way and then turned back. He did it twice, and I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something to 'im, something that I 'ad been getting ready for 'im, when he spoke to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir Claude, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Let me {{tell you}} it will {{surprise}} you." [...] She had finished breakfast now and she sat {{back in her chair}} again: she waited in silence to hear. He had pushed the things before him a little way and had his elbows on the table. This time, she was convinced, she knew what was coming, and once more, for the crash, as with Mrs. Wix lately in her room, she held her breath and drew together her eyelids. He was going to say she must give him up. He looked hard at her again; then he made his effort. [...] "Should you see your way to let her go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The General got her {{to explain}} herself, {{and then he}} {{understood}} that {{she wanted him to}} have a grand review and sham battle of all the troops, in honor of the Khan and Khant; and the whole court had to be present, and especially the timidest of the ladies, that would almost scare a person to death by the way they screamed when they were frightened. The General <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the guns and cannon had all got rusty, and the powder was spoiled from not having been used for so long, with the everlasting cleaning up that had been going on; but the fairy godmother stamped her foot and sent him flying. So the only thing he could do was to set all the gnomes at work making guns and cannon and powder, and about twelve o'clock they had them ready, and just after lunch the sham battle began.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something {{gone wrong}} with my ankle. That my blazer? Thanks. Coming over to the house? Clowes <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> help me over." ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{open the}} door of the inner room when Hector said, [...] "You can {{announce}} me, Macfarlane, as Colonel Campbell." ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{the girl}} was fetched, and the Prince <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hand the {{ornaments}} to her, when the witch held him back, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|It was night, {{about ten}} o'clock indeed, the hour at which Alan {{generally}} went to bed. No message {{had come and}} he began to hope that the Asika had forgotten, or changed her mind, and <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so to Jeekie when a light coming from behind him attracted his attention and he turned to see her standing {{in a corner of the}} great room, holding a lamp in her hand and looking towards him. Her gold breastplate and crown were gone, with every other ornament, and she was clad, or rather muffled in robes of pure white fitted with a kind of nun's hood which lay back upon her shoulders. Also on her arm she carried a shawl or veil. Standing thus, all undecked, with her long hair fastened in a simple knot, she still looked very beautiful, more so than she had ever been, thought Alan, for the cruelty of her face had faded and was replaced by a mystery very strange to see. She did not seem quite like a natural woman, and that was the reason, perhaps, that Alan for the first time felt attracted by her. Hitherto she had always repelled him, but this night it was otherwise.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's it!' Lady Georgina exclaimed, with a demonstrative wave of her hand. 'I drew up the {{advertisement}} myself. Exceptionally situated! I should {{just think it}} was! Why, my dear, I wouldn't let you rent the place for worlds; a horrid, poky little hole, stuck down {{in the bottom of}} a boggy hollow, as damp as Devonshire, with the paper peeling off the walls, so that I had to take my choice between giving it up myself ten years ago, or removing to the cemetery; and I've let it ever since to City men with large families. Nothing would induce me to allow you and your boy to expose yourself to such risks.' For Lady Georgina had taken quite a fancy to Mrs. Evelegh. 'But what I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> was this: you can't shut your house up; it'll all go mouldy. Houses always go mouldy, shut up in summer. And you can't leave it to your servants; I know the baggages; no conscience--no conscience; they'll ask their entire families to come and stop with them en bloc, and turn your place into a perfect piggery. Why, when I went away from my house in town one autumn, didn't I leave a policeman and his wife in charge--a most respectable man--only he happened to be an Irishman. And what was the consequence? My dear, I assure you, I came back unexpectedly from poor dear Kynaston's one day--at a moment's notice--having quarrelled with him over Home Rule or Education or something--poor dear Kynaston's what they call a Liberal, I believe--got at by that man Rosebery--and there didn't I find all the O'Flanagans, and O'Flahertys, and O'Flynns in the neighbourhood camping out in my drawing-room; with a strong detachment of O'Donohues, and O'Dohertys, and O'Driscolls lying around loose in possession of the library? Never leave a house to the servants, my dear! It's positively suicidal. Put in a responsible caretaker of whom you know something--like Lois here, for instance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And then, it cuts both ways, too, for Selah {{was once}} desperately {{in love with}} Herbert: of that I'm certain. She must have been, to judge from the mere {{strength}} of the final revulsion. She's a girl of intensely deep passions--I like people to have some depth to their character, even if it's only {{in the way of}} passion--and she'd never have loved him at all without loving him fervently and almost wildly: hers is a fervent, wild, indomitable nature. Yes, she was certainly in love with Herbert; and now, though of course I don't mean to say she's in love with me (I hope it isn't wrong to think in this way about an unmarried girl), still I can't help seeing that I have a certain influence over her in return--that she pays much attention to what I say and think, considers me a person worth considering, which she doesn't do, I'm sure, with most other people. Ah, well, there's a vast deal of truth, no doubt, in these new hereditary doctrines of Darwin's and Galton's that Herbert and Ernest talk about so much; a family's a family, that's certain, not a mere stray collection of casual acquaintances. How the likeness runs through the very inmost structure of our hearts and natures! I see in Selah very much what Herbert saw in Selah: Selah sees in me very much what she saw in Herbert. Extraordinary insight into human nature men like Darwin and Galton have, to be sure? And David, too, what a marvellous thinker he was, really! What unfathomed depths of meaning lie unexpected in that simple sentence of his, [...] "I am fearfully and wonderfully made." [...] Fearfully and wonderfully, indeed, when one remembers that from one father and mother Herbert and I have both been compounded, so unlike in some things that we scarcely seem to be comparable with one another (look at Herbert's splendid intellect beside mine!), so like in others that Selah Briggs--goodness gracious, what am I thinking of? I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Selah Briggs falls in love first with one of us and then with the other. I do hope and trust it isn't wrong of me to fill my poor distracted head so much with these odd thoughts about that unfortunate girl, Selah!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have it,' she replied, {{with the}} same curious little {{vibration}} in her voice, like the twang of a string.|$|R
60|$|He hurried on. He was {{conscious}} of a curious feeling that somebody <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kick him, but he dared not look round.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{open his}} door, when the maiden glided softly past and whispered in his ear: 'What task has he set you?' ...|$|R
