The album was made available as a two-disc set, with audio tracks on one in CD format and video recording of the live performance on the other in DVD format. The DVD contains a live video recording of the performance, without special features or DVD extras. The packaging also included a 20-panel booklet featuring photographs of the group performing, taken by their fans.

500|$|By {{the middle}} of June, Pekka had {{recorded}} vocals for five tracks, which Antti described as [...] "very raw ... the way <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to be". Pekka's vocals {{would continue to be}} recorded in August, and he completed them on August 20. Antti had also completed his guitar solos by June and was pleased with the results. [...] "For me, the solos are [...] best that I have ever managed to create, and I'm very satisfied." [...] After a summer break, the band returned to record Sneck's keyboards, which took place over three days, August 17–19. Sneck worked with software effects for the first time, along with sound modules. He introduced synthesized horns to the band's instrumentation, but an actual trumpet was used for the intro to [...] "Rust Never Sleeps".|$|E

It was very, very rare that we went with the loud vocal version. ‘Summertime Clothes’ is the biggest example of where we disagreed. Even after we finished the record we were still thinking maybe the vocals are too loud on that song. And Ben felt the opposite way." ...|$|R

The two Indian nanosatellites, {{designated}} INS-1A and INS-1B, each carried two payloads from ISRO's Space Applications Centre and the Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems.

INS-1B carried an Earth Exosphere Lyman-Alpha Analyzer (EELA) and Origami Camera as payloads. They weigh [...] and [...] respectively {{and have been}} designed with a mission life of six months. An ISRO official said: [...] "The nano satellites are an experimental class of satellites introduced by ISRO because there are requests from academic institutions to use them for data collection.

500|$|The {{sequences}} where Superman utilizes close-combat fight {{scenes with}} the other Kryptonians {{proved to be a}} major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew. Desjardin explained, [...] "When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don’t want to do the traditional, 'OK I’m a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to pan over here to follow the action that’s not really there yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters—grappling, punching or flying away—and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So then we had a set of high-res stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to move in our digital environment." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home. Reagle told the Arizona Daily Wildcat that [...] "for me, {{to be such a}} total nut for animation since I was a kid, I never even dreamed [...] It's like a dream I never had coming true." [...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to think that we got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else." [...] Scott Thompson has a cameo in the episode as Grady, a character that he first voiced in the season 14 episode [...] "Three Gays of the Condo".|$|E

500|$|Before {{the renewal}} of the fifth season, Abrams stated some {{skepticism}} for a renewal opportunity, but hoped {{that if it was}} cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, [...] "the next year would be the great ending for the show". Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show {{is one of the top}} shows in the Friday night slot, [...] "it's an expensive show. We lose a lot of money on the show." [...] Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success. When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, [...] "That's a Peter Roth issue" [...] (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, [...] "We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated [...] "We want to take care of the fans. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to see where it would have gone, but we also know the show has been a commitment and we want everyone to be satisfied with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Saudi AWACS bear Arabic {{writing on}} their {{exterior}} with a translation below, [...] "Royal Saudi Air Force". The roof-mounted antenna is an AWACS plane’s dominant feature; it is a smooth black disk {{with a white}} stripe down the center, and it rotates constantly. The antenna is {{about a fifth of}} the length of the plane and it sits higher above the roof than the plane’s roof sits above the ground. Another noticeable difference from a commercial 707 is the lack of passenger windows. Colonel Walt Kowalik said about the lack of windows, [...] "We don't want 'em ... we don't want our people looking out of windows. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> concentrating on what's in front of them."

In an interview, vocalists Marjana Semkina discussed the techniques used to record the album stating [...] "I won’t reveal the backstage stories too much…because {{a lot of people}} would be terrified if they knew how we recorded certain things" [...] referring to the subpar conditions under which the album was recorded, maintaining that [...] "at least I know that we did our best". On the title of the album Semkina described the tilde as [...] "a powerful symbol. It brings us certain associations but all of them are more or less neutral. It’s difficult to keep things clear of additional emotional coloring. <b>We</b> didn’t <b>want</b> people to have any feelings about our album before they got to listen to it. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> to be objective. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> to judge us by our music." ...|$|R

On September 9, 2001, two days before the 9/11 attacks in America, Massoud was assassinated by al Qaeda agents in a suicide bombing." [...] As the U.S. Armed Forces were preparing for a confrontation with the Taliban in September 2001, Karzai began urging NATO states to purge his country of al-Qaeda. He told BBC [...] "These Arabs, together with their foreign supporters and the Taliban, destroyed miles and miles of homes and orchards and vineyards... They have killed Afghans.

[...] Parsons didn't dispute that each registrar was a separate legal entity, but noted that creating such entities was trivial: [...] "Mr. Linden seemed proud that the EURid registry verified that each applicant was a legal entity before it was accredited. Take a moment {{and think about what}} that means. You can form a “legal entity” for $50 – an LLC – and you are good to go. Is that what we want a registry to do?

2500|$|Resnicoff is {{frequently}} quoted {{on the impact}} of war and violence on the human spirit, including the distinction he makes between [...] "outrage", a feeling we must value, because it is part of being human (and we must fight against the danger that war and violence can numb us against it), and [...] "rage", where emotions take over, we lose our moral compass, and we become vulnerable to manipulation by others who want us to lose our way. [...] While working for General Wesley K. Clark at the U.S. European Command, Resnicoff worked to expand the concept of force protection to include Spiritual Force Protection: protecting military personnel not only against physical danger, but against threats to their humanity, as well. The book, Stoic Warriors: The Ancient Philosophy Behind the Military Mind quotes his position that [...] "We don't want our people just to come home physically; <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to come back as close to the human beings they were before they went in." ...|$|E

Khorasani also said [...] "Our suicide bombers have entered the school, they have instructions not to harm the children, but to target the Army personnel. It's a revenge attack for the Army offensive in North Waziristan." [...] Later though the Taliban claimed contrary by putting out a statement saying, [...] "More than 50 sons of important army officers were killed after being identified." [...] The attacks were mainly coordinated by TTP leaders operating in Afghanistan. [...] According to the Pakistani Federal Investigation Agency or FIA's early investigations, the group was led by the terrorist, Abu Shamil who planned the attacks, accompanied by three Arabs and two Afghans who spoke Pashto and were from Eastern Afghanistan. Khorasani was later killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan on 9 July 2016.|$|E
2500|$|From {{relatively}} {{early in}} his professional career, Lowell worried {{about the role of}} racial and ethnic minorities in American society. As early as 1887, he wrote of the Irish: [...] "What we need is not to dominate the Irish, but to absorb them.... <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to become rich, and send their sons to our colleges, to share our prosperity and our sentiments. We do not want to feel that they are among us and yet not really part of us." [...] He believed that only a homogeneous society could safeguard the achievements of American democracy. Sometime before 1906, he became an honorary vice-president of the Immigration Restriction League, an organization that promoted literacy tests and tightened enforcement of immigration laws. In 1910, he wrote approvingly in private of excluding Chinese immigrants entirely and of Southern states that denied the franchise to black citizens. Publicly he consistently adopted assimilation as the solution to absorbing other groups, limiting their numbers to levels he believed would allow American society to absorb them without being changed itself, a stance that [...] "fused liberal and racist ideas in making the case for exclusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{historian}} Benny Morris, documents show that Jabotinsky favored {{the idea of}} the transfer of Arab populations if required for establishing a (still-proposed) Jewish state. Jabotinsky's other writings state, [...] "We do not want to eject even one Arab from either the left or the right bank of the Jordan River. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to prosper both economically and culturally. We envision the regime of Jewish Palestine [...] as follows: most of the population will be Jewish, but equal rights for all Arab citizens will not only be guaranteed, they will also be fulfilled." [...] Jabotinsky was convinced {{that there was no way}} for the Jews to regain any part of Palestine without opposition from the Arabs. In 1934, he wrote a draft constitution for the Jewish state which declared that Arabs would be on an equal footing with their Jewish counterparts [...] "throughout all sectors of the country's public life." [...] The two communities would share the state's duties, both military and civil service, and enjoy its prerogatives. Jabotinsky proposed that Hebrew and Arabic should enjoy equal status, and that [...] "in every cabinet where the prime minister is a Jew, the vice-premiership shall be offered to an Arab and vice versa." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1987, Nichols {{became the}} first NCAA {{coordinator}} of officials. [...] He spent 22 years in that position. Nichols said, [...] "the goal {{was to try to}} get guys across the country to officiate the same way, not have the ACC be different from the Big Ten and the Big Ten different from the Pac-10. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> to teach guys to ref better, to try to get them to be more consistent. <b>We</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to be another factor when teams played on the road. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>them</b> to stand tall and figure out tough situations.

2500|$|At 8 a.m. on May 28, Hampton rode {{off from}} Atlee's Station. As more of Grant's {{infantry}} crossed the pontoon {{bridge over the}} Pamunkey, Gregg led his cavalry division probing west from Hanovertown, searching for Lee, while Torbert's division began to picket along Crump's Creek {{in the direction of}} Hanover Court House. Three miles west of Hanovertown, and a mile beyond a large blacksmith shop called Haw's Shop, Gregg's troopers ran into Hampton at Enon Church, finding the Confederate cavalrymen dismounted in a wooded area, hurriedly erecting breastworks made of logs and rails, and well covered by artillery. Davies deployed pickets from the 10th New York Cavalry to Hampton's front, but the 2nd Virginia Cavalry, Hampton's leading element, drove the picket line back. The Confederates deployed in line with Wickham's four Virginia regiments deployed in the woods behind Enon Church, with Rosser's men and the horse artillery to their left. They dug shallow rifle pits and faced them with log and fence-rail breastworks. Because of a swampy tributary of Crump Creek to the north and Mill Creek to the south, it was impossible to turn the position. Hampton viewed the outnumbered Union force and reportedly exclaimed, [...] "We've got the Yankees where <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Georgia’s {{housing prices}} were higher, but the state’s filming {{incentive}} package refunded 30% of production costs such as gasoline, pencils, and salaries. North Carolina’s package refunded 15% and excluded salaries of over $1 million. Still, Disney remained interested in North Carolina {{and offered to}} film there if the state would reduce the amount the company would save in Georgia, approximately $1 million, in half. North Carolina officials searched for ways to accomplish this, including applying unsuccessfully for state and Golden LEAF Foundation grants. They also introduced legislation to improve the state’s refund to 25%, which eventually passed on August 27, 2009. Disney decided to work within existing incentive laws and agreed to film in North Carolina {{as long as the}} film rights they had bought from Sparks counted as a production cost, thereby saving the company an additional $125,000 to $225,000. Then-North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue set up a press conference on April 1, 2009 to announce N.C.’s victory. North Carolina tax collectors refused to consider the film rights, forcing Perdue to cancel the conference at the last second. [...] "I was hopeful {{to say that it was}} coming and now I don't know that I'll get to say that," [...] Perdue said.
