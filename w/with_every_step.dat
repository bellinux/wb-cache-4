5|$|Since the {{remainders}} decrease <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>step</b> but {{can never}} be negative, a remainder r'N must eventually equal zero, {{at which point the}} algorithm stops. The final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is the greatest common divisor of a and b. The number N cannot be infinite because there are only a finite number of nonnegative integers between the initial remainder r0 and zero.|$|E

25|$|In 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, one of history's most noted commanders, {{landed in}} Germany and {{relieved}} {{the port of}} Stralsund, the last continental stronghold of German forces belligerent to the Emperor. Gustavus then marched south and won notable victories at Breitenfeld and Lützen, attracting more Protestant support <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>step</b> he took. The situation for the Catholics improved {{with the death of}} Gustavus at Lützen in 1632, and they won a key victory at Nördlingen in 1634. From a position of strength, the Emperor approached the war-weary German states with a peace offering in 1635: many accepted, including the two most powerful, Brandenburg and Saxony. But then France entered the war, and diplomatic calculations were once again thrown into confusion.|$|E

500|$|Each step {{begins with}} two nonnegative {{remainders}} r'k1 and r'k2. Since the algorithm {{ensures that the}} remainders decrease steadily <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>step,</b> r'k1 is less than its predecessor r'k2. The goal of the kth step {{is to find a}} quotient q'k and remainder r'k that satisfy the equation ...|$|E
500|$|... where r−2(x) = a(x) and r−1(x) = b(x). The {{quotient}} polynomial {{is chosen}} {{so that the}} leading term of q'k(x) r'k−1(x) equals the leading term of r'k−2(x); this ensures {{that the degree of}} each remainder is smaller than the degree of its predecessor deg < deg. Since the degree is a nonnegative integer, and since it decreases <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>step,</b> the Euclidean algorithm concludes in a finite number of steps. The final nonzero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the original two polynomials, a(x) and b(x).|$|E
500|$|... where r'k−2=α, r'k−1=β, {{and every}} {{remainder}} is strictly smaller than its predecessor, |r'k|< |r'k−1|. The first {{difference is that}} the quotients and remainders are themselves Gaussian integers, and thus are complex numbers. The quotients q'k are generally found by rounding the real and complex parts of the exact ratio (such as the complex number α/β) to the nearest integers. The second difference lies in the necessity of defining how one complex remainder can be [...] "smaller" [...] than another. To do this, a norm function f(u + vi) = u2 + v2 is defined, which converts every Gaussian integer u + vi into a normal integer. After each step k of the Euclidean algorithm, the norm of the remainder f(r'k) is smaller than the norm of the preceding remainder, f(r'k−1). Since the norm is a nonnegative integer and decreases <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>step,</b> the Euclidean algorithm for Gaussian integers ends in a finite number of steps. The final nonzero remainder is the gcd(α,β), the Gaussian integer of largest norm that divides both α and β; it is unique up to multiplication by a unit, ±1 or ±i.|$|E

2500|$|Wide heels do not {{necessarily}} offer more stability, and any raised heel with too much width, such as found in [...] "blade-heeled" [...] or [...] "block-heeled" [...] shoes, induces unhealthy side-to-side torque to the ankles <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>step,</b> stressing them unnecessarily, while creating additional impact {{on the balls of}} the feet. Thus, the best design for a high heel is one with a narrower width, where the heel is closer to the front, more solidly under the ankle, where the toe box provides room enough for the toes, and where forward movement of the foot in the shoe is kept in check by material snug across the instep, rather than by the toes being rammed forward and jamming together in the toe box or crushed into the front of the toe box.|$|E

Although he had discarded socialism, he was denounced as suspect following the leftist demonstration in Iași that was led by Max Wexler. Reportedly, he was assigned to a secluded army unit on the Tazlău River, while his case was processed. He feared that a death squad would dispose of him, and became an insomniac. He was later stationed in the village of Căiuți, where he read in Opinia that Fondane's father Isac Wechsler had died.
