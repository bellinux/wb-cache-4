5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

Uncut described the track as a [...] "delirious soul pastiche" [...] and suggested Rhys's lyrics make a [...] "wry plea for understanding between races and classes" [...] while PopMatters claimed the song is about gentrification. Entertainment Weekly was critical of [...] "Juxtapozed with U", describing it as an [...] "awful lite-rock homage" [...] which resembles the theme tune to The Love Boat.|$|E

2500|$|Beauregard {{dispatched}} aidesCol. James Chesnut, Col. James A. Chisholm, and Capt. Stephen D. Leeto Fort Sumter on April 11 {{to issue}} the ultimatum. Anderson refused, although he reportedly commented, [...] "I shall await the first shot, {{and if you do}} not batter us to pieces, we shall be starved out in a few days." [...] The aides returned to Charleston and reported this comment to Beauregard. At 1 a.m. on April 12, the aides brought Anderson a message from Beauregard: [...] "If you will state the time <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> evacuate Fort Sumter, and agree in the meantime that you will not use your guns against us unless ours shall be employed against Fort Sumter, we will abstain from opening fire upon you." [...] After consulting with his senior officers, Maj. Anderson replied that he would evacuate Sumter by noon, April 15, unless he received new orders from his government or additional supplies. Col. Chesnut considered this reply to be too conditional and wrote a reply, which he handed to Anderson at 3:20a.m.: [...] "Sir: by authority of Brigadier General Beauregard, commanding the Provisional Forces of the Confederate States, we have the honor to notify you that he will open fire of his batteries on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time." [...] Anderson escorted the officers back to their boat, shook hands with each one, and said [...] "If we never meet in this world again, God grant that we may meet in the next." ...|$|E
