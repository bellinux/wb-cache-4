5|$|Leucothrinax is a {{monotypic}} genus of fan palms {{which is}} native to the northern Caribbean. The species was split from the genus Thrinax after phylogenetic studies showed that its inclusion in Thrinax <b>would</b> <b>render</b> that genus paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Coke's meaning {{has been}} disputed over the years; some {{interpret}} his judgment as referring to {{judicial review of}} statutes to correct misunderstandings which <b>would</b> <b>render</b> them unfair, while others argue he meant that the common law courts {{have the power to}} completely strike down those statutes they deem to be repugnant.|$|E

5|$|Nathan Lovejoy's 1996 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} morphology, {{found that the}} yellow {{stingray}} is the most basal member of a clade that also contains Pacific Urobatis species and the genus Urotrygon of Central and South America. This finding <b>would</b> <b>render</b> Urobatis polyphyletic, though further study is warranted to elucidate the relationships between these taxa.|$|E
5|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of no {{economic}} value, the slender smooth-hound is occasionally caught incidentally in bottom trawls and on bottom longlines. Much of its northern range lies in little-fished waters, {{and thus the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, this shark's very low fecundity <b>would</b> <b>render</b> it susceptible to population depletion should fishing pressure increase in the future.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{predicted}} that the standing water caused by the storm surge <b>would</b> <b>render</b> {{most of the city}} uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all the water out of the city.|$|E

5|$|On 3 January 1523, the Zurich {{city council}} invited the clergy {{of the city}} and {{outlying}} region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions.

5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} delays that {{affected}} {{the development and}} deployment of the CF-100 could also affect its successor, {{and the fact that}} the Soviets were working on newer jet-powered bombers that <b>would</b> <b>render</b> the CF-100 ineffective, the RCAF began looking for a supersonic, missile-armed replacement for the Canuck even before it had entered service. In March 1952, the RCAF's Final Report of the All-Weather Interceptor Requirements Team was submitted to Avro Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} his theodicy {{required}} Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a universalist theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed {{that there would be}} no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it <b>would</b> <b>render</b> any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands <b>would</b> <b>render</b> Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} preseason poll, however, {{speculation}} began {{as to whether}} regular-season parity <b>would</b> <b>render</b> the prediction irrelevant. Before the 2010 season, the poll had predicted the ACC winner correctly only once {{in the championship game}} era. In the Coastal Division, this speculation was groundless, as Virginia Tech's undefeated season rendered any other winner impossible. In the Atlantic Division, the situation was much different. As late as the second week of November, four of the six division teams were in contention for the division title. These candidates were whittled to three with two weeks remaining in the regular season, then to two in the final week. During that week, NC State traveled to Maryland. If NC State had won, {{it would have been the}} Atlantic Division winner by virtue of a tie-breaking win against Florida State. Instead, NC State lost 38–31, and Florida State earned a bid to the championship game.|$|E
5|$|In January 1960 Heffron {{provided}} his {{old friend}} H. V. Evatt a dignified exit from federal politics by nominating him to succeed Sir Kenneth Street as Chief Justice of New South Wales. His Attorney General Reg Downing, however, was horrified, having favoured the senior puisne justice Sir William Owen as the most suitable candidate while also realising that Evatt's worsening health <b>would</b> <b>render</b> him less than equal {{to the task of}} chief justice. Therefore, while Downing, as attorney general, would normally be the person to move the nomination of chief justice in cabinet, he refused to do so, leaving Heffron to do it himself. Heffron's motion to nominate Evatt was passed narrowly by 8 votes to 6. Downing's concerns would come to pass as Evatt indeed proved highly ineffective, often wracked by mental and physical ill-health, was reduced to having most of his judgements written or co-written for him, and resigning in 1962 after only two years as chief justice.|$|E

5|$|In his {{development}} of the ontological argument, Leibniz attempted to demonstrate the coherence of a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection are incompatible with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then {{he should be able to}} create a being with free will; if he is omniscient, then he should know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis <b>would</b> <b>render</b> the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Crunch Bandicoot {{was designed}} by Craig Whittle of Traveller's Tales and Sean Krankel of Universal. The concept of battling mini-bosses within the game's levels was dropped to uphold the fast and frantic pace of the series' gameplay. Multiplayer capability was also considered before being dropped. An earlier draft of the story featured an alternate version of the game's climax and ending, which involved Crash battling Crunch in a mechanical robot suit. At {{the end of the}} fight, Crunch would destroy Crash's suit with a bolt of electricity. The resulting debris <b>would</b> <b>render</b> Cortex unconscious, destroy the remote control device controlling Crunch and start an electrical fire in the space station. As the Bandicoots escape to resume their beach-going vacation, the ruins of the space station would crash-land onto the island of Cortex's original settlement, conveniently allowing Cortex and Uka Uka to resume their world domination bids.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} plan—drafted {{under the}} direction of the Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Toyoda Soemu—called for Yamato and her escorts to attack the U.S. fleet supporting the U.S. troops landing on the west of the island. Yamato and her escorts were to fight their way to Okinawa and then beach themselves between Higashi and Yomitan and fight as shore batteries until they were destroyed. Once the ships were destroyed, their surviving crewmembers were supposed to abandon ship and fight U.S. forces on land. Very little, if any, air cover could be provided for the ships, which <b>would</b> <b>render</b> them almost helpless to concentrated attacks from US carrier-based aircraft. In preparation for executing the plan, the assigned ships left Kure for Tokuyama, Yamaguchi, off Mitajiri, Japan, on 29 March. However, despite obeying orders to prepare for the mission, Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō—commander of the Ten-Go force—still refused to actually order his ships to carry it out, believing the plan to be futile and wasteful.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} there exist massive perturbative states of the ten {{dimensional}} Green-Schwarz closed superstring that are stabilized against collapse due to presence of fermionic zero modes on its worldsheet. The excited fermionic degrees of freedom backreact on the spacetime motion of the string {{in the same way}} as a neutral persistent current <b>would,</b> <b>rendering</b> these string loops stable. We point out that the existence of these states could have important consequences as stable loops of cosmological size as well as long lived states within perturbative string theory.

5|$|Before the 1912 naval law was passed, Britain and Germany {{attempted}} {{to reach a}} compromise with the Haldane Mission, led by the British War Minister Richard Haldane. The arms reduction mission ended in failure, however, and the 1912 law was announced shortly thereafter. The Germans were aware at as early as 1911, the Royal Navy had abandoned {{the idea of a}} decisive battle with the German fleet, in favor of a distant blockade at the entrances to the North Sea, which the British could easily control due to their geographical position. There emerged the distinct possibility that the German fleet would be unable to force a battle on its own terms, which <b>would</b> <b>render</b> it militarily useless. When the war came in 1914, the British did in fact adopt this strategy. Coupled with the restrictive orders of the Kaiser, who preferred to keep the fleet intact {{to be used as a}} bargaining chip in the peace settlements, the ability of the High Seas Fleet to affect the military situation was markedly reduced.|$|E
5|$|Responding to Peng's {{concern over}} the troops' conditions, Mao limited {{the scope of the}} Third Phase Campaign to pin down the South Korean forces along the 38th {{parallel}} while inflicting as much damage as possible. Upon noticing that the US units were not interspersed between the South Korean formations, therefore unable to support the South Koreans, Mao ordered the PVA 13th Army to destroy the ROK 1st Infantry Division, the ROK 6th Infantry Division and the ROK III Corps. Following Mao's instruction, Peng placed the PVA 38th, 39th, 40th and 50th Corps of the 13th Army in front of the ROK 1st and 6th Infantry Division, while the 42nd and the 66th Corps of the 13th Army were moved into ROK III Corps' sector. The start date of the offensive was set to 31 December in order {{to take advantage of the}} night assault under a full moon and the anticipated low alertness of the UN soldiers during the holiday. For the same reasons Ridgway had predicted that 31 December would be the likely time for the new Chinese offensive. Believing that the destruction of the South Korean forces at the 38th parallel <b>would</b> <b>render</b> the UN forces incapable of counterattacks in the future, Mao promised to pull all Chinese troops off the front line for rest and refit by the end of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Statement that {{eventually}} became the Forty-Two Articles are equally obscure. As early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal articles. In 1551 Cranmer presented a version of {{a statement to the}} bishops, but its status remained ambiguous. Cranmer did not devote much effort into developing the articles, most likely due to work on the canon law revision. He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade. By September 1552, draft versions of the articles were being worked on by Cranmer and John Cheke, his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into Latin. When the Forty-Two Articles were finally published in May 1553, the title-page declared that the articles were agreed upon by the Convocation and were published by the authority of the king. This was not in fact the case and the mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between the archbishop and the Privy Council. Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities responded by noting that the articles were developed {{during the time of the}} Convocation—hence evading a direct answer. The council gave Cranmer the unfortunate task of requiring subscription to the articles from the bishops, many of whom opposed them and pointed out the anomaly of the title-page. It was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that <b>would</b> <b>render</b> the subscriptions futile.|$|E
