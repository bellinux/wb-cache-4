50|$|The Gyromax balance has six {{to eight}} small {{turnable}} weights that fit on pins located in recesses {{around the top of}} the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> rim. Each of the weights, called collets, has a cutout making it heavier on one side. When the collet's cutout points to the outside of the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel,</b> the heavier side is toward the center which decreases the wheel's moment of inertia, increasing its speed. When the collet's cutout points toward the center, the weight moves outward and the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> turns more slowly. A watchmaker can turn an individual collet to adjust the <b>wheel's</b> <b>balance,</b> referred to as 'poise', or pairs of opposing collets to adjust the wheel's rotation speed. The Gyromax is a 'free sprung' balance, meaning there is no regulator on the <b>wheel's</b> <b>balance</b> spring for adjusting the watch's rate, so the collets are used for adjusting both poise and rate.|$|R

Simplification process of 'conventional' Fuzzy-PID to 'simplified' Fuzzy-PID scheme through 3 D vector projection was demonstrated. Without reducing the performance of conventional Fuzzy-PID control, the number of fuzzy rules was greatly reduced, which eventually minimized the computational burden of the processor. Besides, the proposed controller ensures the control energy was within permissible limit and it also eliminates the effects of nonlinearity when the system was only controlled by PID controllers. Finally, the performance of proposed controller is compared to the performance of conservative Fuzzy-PID and PID schemes via simulation...|$|E

50|$|The {{railways}} {{based on}} the Ewing System are basically monorails using a <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> for <b>balancing</b> the train. The main load (almost 95%) is borne by the single rail while the rest is borne by the <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> which runs on the ground. Further, in normal train systems, the rails {{have to be at}} almost exact level of other rail, failing which the train may go off the tracks. By using Ewing system, this problem is solved as the <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> does not need exact level to maintain the balance of monorail. In addition the cost of laying tracks also goes down considerably since only one rail is used. Another benefit of using Ewing System was that the <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> could run on existing tarred roads as well as the macadam roads thus further reducing cost to lay down tracks.|$|R

50|$|A <b>balance</b> <b>wheel,</b> or <b>balance,</b> is the {{timekeeping}} device used {{in mechanical}} watches and some clocks, {{analogous to the}} pendulum in a pendulum clock. It is a weighted wheel that rotates back and forth, being returned toward its center position by a spiral torsion spring, the balance spring or hairspring. It {{is driven by the}} escapement, which transforms the rotating motion of the watch gear train into impulses delivered to the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel.</b> Each swing of the wheel (called a 'tick' or 'beat') allows the gear train to advance a set amount, moving the hands forward. The <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> and hairspring together form a harmonic oscillator, which due to resonance oscillates preferentially at a certain rate, its resonant frequency or 'beat', and resists oscillating at other rates. The combination of the mass of the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> and the elasticity of the spring keep the time between each oscillation or â€˜tickâ€™ very constant, accounting for its near universal use as the timekeeper in mechanical watches to the present. From its invention in the 14th century until tuning fork and quartz movements became available in the 1960s, virtually every portable timekeeping device used some form of <b>balance</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the assessment of an experimental setup for grinding experiments with a top wheel speed of 250 m/s. Among other considerations, high speed grinding is widely considered as a way for enhancing material removal rates by utilising large depths of cut and/or high workspeeds. Performing high speed grinding operations, however, presents challenges to the setup due to the high wheel speeds involved. An experimental setup was established in this study for high speed grinding of hardened nodular cast iron and steel using vitrified CBN wheels. This setup was assessed prior to grinding for <b>wheel</b> <b>balancing</b> and guarding, wheel core expansion and temperature rise, grinding fluid delivery, and idle power consumptions. It was found that high speed wheel rotations caused wheel expansion and temperature rise. A significant portion of the total power was consumed on actions other than material removals. The preliminary grinding tests indicated that the setup met the requirements for high speed grinding in general. Copyright 9 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

40|$|Abstract â€” The Segway Human Transporter is one {{of several}} {{low-speed}} transportation devices (e. g., bikes, scooters, wheelchairs) that, under certain circumstances, travels on sidewalks, roadways, and other shared-use paths. The objective of this research was to examine the primary operating characteristics of the Segway. In this thesis, we designed and constructed mechanically based system for a two <b>wheel</b> <b>balancing</b> Segway robot. In this paper we present a Segway based on gyro sensor, accelerometer along with a microcontroller and use of mechanical and electrical hardwareâ€™s. The dynamics of the vehicle is similar to the classical control problem of an inverted pendulum, which means that it is unstable and prone to tip over. This is prevented by electronics sensing the pitch angle and its time derivative, controlling the motors to keep the vehicle balancing. This kind of vehicle is interesting since it contains a lot of technology relevant to an eco-friendly and energy efficient transportation industry. This thesis describes the development of a similar vehicle from scratch, incorporating every phase from literature study to planning, design, vehicle construction and verification. The main objective was to build a vehicle capable of transporting a person weighing up to 70 - 80 kg and capable of travelling to some km distance with varying speed. The rider controls are supposed to be natural movements; leaning forwards or backwards in combination with tilting the handlebar sideways should be the only rider input required to ride the vehicle. This thesis also take into consideration the material used with minimum possible cost. The design of Segway Human Transporter is such that it covers less space and comfort to the user...|$|E
40|$|An expandable, {{extendable}} {{grinding machine}} controller {{has been researched}} and designed, {{in order to take}} advantage of recent improvements in the functionality and affordability of commercial electronic hardware. In additional it would provide for the incorporation of previous research studies and projects aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the grinding process. Over the past 20 years there have been continuous improvements in the functional capabilities of grinding machines, their control systems and peripheral process monitoring equipment. Process enhancement technologies such as <b>wheel</b> <b>balancing,</b> touch detection (electrical power and acoustic emission) and in-process gauging may be incorporated into higher-end grinding machines according to specific customer requirements, however this requires significant customisation work by the manufacturer due to the differing features and functionality of equipment from different suppliers. Furthermore the implementation of long-proposed optimization strategies such as adaptive and intelligent control has not progressed significantly beyond specific research programs tied to a particular machine and controller, often using non-industrial (i. e. laboratory) equipment for the monitoring of key process data. A need was identified to produce a modern, innovative control system architecture for the Jones & Shipman 1300 X research grinder at LJMU AMTReL. The controller should be intuitive to configure and operate, and should have flexibility to allow the addition of new equipment and machining features. It would be a significant advance to produce a controller that can more easily integrate and adopt the latest process control and monitoring equipment, and later be expanded to incorporate enhanced production cycles as well as previously explored process optimization techniques and strategies. The objective of the research was to unify the specification and implementation of key machine tool control features such as hardware configuration parameters, operational parameters, process variables and machining cycles into a rationalized, extendable, object-oriented framework suitable for implementation using current PC hardware, software and design methodologies. The design built on the outcomes of previous studies and developments in the area of optimised machine tool control. Several models of external monitoring equipment were evaluated in terms of functionality and interfacing, and a structured, integrated control system software design and application was produced. Its functionality was demonstrated on a subset of grinding operations and external hardware. In this thesis the historical developments in controller architectures and technology are discussed, and previous studies into grinding process analysis and optimization are summarized. Various different types of grinding machines and their machining cycles are presented, and the features and functionality of several auxiliary monitoring devices are explained and quantified. The analysis and design of a hierarchical, modular, integrated system structure is then described, and finally the outcomes of the research are reviewed and further development recommendations suggested...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{with the development}} of a two <b>wheels</b> <b>balancing</b> robot as the maze solver.

If the wheels can be driven in such a way as to stay under the robotâ€™s center of gravity, the robot remains balanced.

The GP 2 D 120 IR distance sensor is used to achieve the balancing mode while the GP 2 D 12 IR sensor is applied as the input for microcontroller in the determination of the path control algorithm. The path control algorithm will be coded in ATMEGA 32 microcontroller. The balancing robot will perform as a maze solver without losing the balancing functionality...|$|R
