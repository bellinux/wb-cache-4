5|$|The third {{match on}} the card was a Straight Edge Society pledge vs. hair match, between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. For this match, the other Straight Edge Society members (Serena and Luke Gallows) were banned from ringside. Early on in the match, Punk threw Mysterio headfirst {{out of the ring}} into the barber chair at ringside. Punk had {{suffered}} a cut to the head prior to the exchange, and while Mysterio <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> the match was halted so that the blood could be cleaned up. While Punk's wound was being attended, he dropkicked Mysterio, who was on the ring apron, and began attacking him on the floor to restart the match. After Mysterio missed a splash from the top rope, Punk went to pin him, but Mysterio was able to perform a crucifix cradle on Punk for the victory. The other Straight Edge Society members attacked Mysterio after the match, but he was saved by Kane, which allowed Mysterio to handcuff Punk to the ring ropes and shave his head.|$|E
25|$|Also notable was Gregg Popovich's {{use of the}} Hack-a-Shaq {{throughout}} the series to disrupt the Suns offense when Shaquille O'Neal <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> O'Neal would shoot 64 free throws in the five games, making 32 of them.|$|E
25|$|The Democrats {{claimed that}} the change was illegal, and that {{therefore}} Malcolm Smith was still the Majority Leader and Temporary President. According to Smith and other Democrats, Senator Neil Breslin had accepted a motion to adjourn, and therefore ended the session before the Republicans voted to change leadership. Republican Senator Libous argues that since his original motion <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> the session {{could not have been}} adjourned. Furthermore, like all motions, motions for adjournment require a vote, which never took place before Breslin adjourned the session.|$|E

25|$|Volador Jr. had {{a long-standing}} {{tradition}} of dressing up like various super heroes for significant matches, especially Marvel Comics super heroes such as Spider-Man, Venom and Iron Man, {{and for the}} 81st Anniversary continued the tradition coming to the ring dressed in black with a giant white skull on his chest to resemble the character The Punisher. While he wore a mask during his introductions, Volador Jr. removed it for the match as {{he was no longer}} allowed to wrestle while masked, due to a loss he suffered at the previous anniversary show. Mr. Niebla, along with his Mascota Perico came to the ring dressed in garb resembling members of the Rock band KISS, with Mr. Niebla's mask resembling the face paint that Gene Simmons wears when performing on stage. This was Thunder's first match as a rudo, showcasing a new mask that was primarily black with a few red and yellow highlights. Before the match Thunder attacked Volador Jr. again and threw him outside the ring. To sell the brutality of Thunder's attack Volador Jr. <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> {{for the majority of the}} first fall, leaving Máscara Dorada and Valiente to wrestle the first fall by themselves. During the first fall Thunder stayed on the apron, seemingly more focused on Volador Jr. than the other opponents. The first fall was won by Valiente and Dorada when Valiente pinned Euforia while Máscara Dorada pinned Mr. Niebla. Between the falls Volador Jr. returned to the match, ready to fight. During the second fall Thunder finally entered the ring, throwing his opponents around to showcase his greater size and strength compared to his opponents. At one point Dorada, Valiente, Eurforia and Mr. Niebla were all on the floor when Thunder grabbed Volador Jr. by the trunks and the throat and tossing him over the top rope onto the other four wrestlers. The brutality of his actions got Thunder's team disqualified, losing the match in two falls, something that did not bother Thunder as he was more interested in showing his physical dominance against the smaller opponents.|$|E
25|$|CMLL held a {{steel cage}} match {{involving}} 12 Mini-Estrellas, the rules dictated {{that the last}} two men in the cage would have immediately to face off in a Luchas de Apuestas ("Bet match") with the loser either having to unmask or have his hair shaved off as a result. The match took place on November 6, 2012 in Arena Coliseo in Guadalajara, Jalisco and included Aéreo, Astral, , Fantasy, Mercurio, Pequeño Black Warrior, Pequeño Halcón, Pequeño Olímpico, Pequeño Violencia, Pierrothito, Shockercito and Último Dragoncito. The wrestlers {{were not allowed to}} even attempt to leave the cage until three minutes into the ring, but once the deadline was up Pequeño Halcón was the first person out of the cage followed by Mercurio and Aéreo. Moments later, as Pequeño Olímpico was trying to climb over the top part of the wire mesh on the cage gave out and Pequeño Olímpico ended up with his arm trapped in the cage, needing help to get loose and to the floor where he was checked to see if he needed medical attention. After that Fantasy climbed over the cage the floor, escaping the match and joining Mercurio and Aéreo, who were still on the floor. Moments later Astral {{climbed to the top of}} the cage and dove off the 15-foot-high cage, landing a Moonsault on Mercurio, Aéreo and Fantasy who were still on the floor. During the move Astral got caught in the cage and landed in an uncontrolled manner on the floor, hitting his head, which promoted the medical personnel to immediately rush him out of the arena. The bad fall also hurt Mercurio, who had to be removed from the ring on a stretcher. Many of the remaining contestants, including Pierrothito bled during the match, some was possibly intentional as part of the plan for the match while others were not intentionally bleeding. Demus 3:16 was the recipient of several throws and falls off the cage as he tried to escape, finally shaking off his opponents to climb out. Once Demus 3:16 <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> he needed help to even stand and had to be helped from the arena. The last person to escape was Pequeño Violencia, who's back was bleeding from being thrown against the cage repeatedly. With Pequeño Violencia out it left Shockercity and Pequeño Black Warrior as the last two men in the ring, with both of them risking their hair on the outcome of this part of the match. Shockercito finally managed to defeat his opponent when he applied the La Reienera submission hold on Pequeño Black Warrior, forcing him to submit. Following the loss Pequeño Black Warrior had all his hair shaved off. Following the match Shockercito stated that he hoped his victory would earn him a match against one of the Mini-Estrella champions.|$|E
500|$|The Rockets {{initially}} {{struggled in}} the first half of the 1994–95 season, which they fixed by sending Otis Thorpe to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Olajuwon's former college teammate Clyde Drexler. With only 47 wins, the Rockets entered the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference. Still, a strong playoff run that earned Houston the nickname [...] "Clutch City" [...] had the Rockets defeating the West's top three seeds – the Jazz, Suns and Spurs – to reach back-to-back finals, this time against the Orlando Magic, led by Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee [...] "Penny" [...] Hardaway. When Houston swept the series in four straight games, they became the first team in NBA history to win the championship as a sixth seed, and the first to beat four 50-win teams in a single postseason en route to the championship. Olajuwon was again the Finals MVP, only the second player after Michael Jordan to win the award two years in a row. It <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of The Summit after they captured their second title that head coach Rudy Tomjanovich proclaimed, [...] "Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion!" ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{recently}} as the Miocene period, twelve million years ago, the entire watershed of Piner Creek <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the Pacific Ocean. [...] After significant volcanic uplift and tectonic movement, the headwaters region of the Mayacmas Mountains emerged above the ocean. [...] Piner Creek {{was one of the}} drainages that began to drain the new landmass, in formation of the eventual Santa Rosa Plain, through which the middle and lower reaches of Piner Creek flow. [...] Occasional basaltic outcrops are seen in the upper reach of Piner Creek, betraying the volcanic origin of the Mayacmas Mountains.|$|E

Why don't you go in there and see what's happening?' So that's exactly what I did." [...] Ashanti wrote two verses and recorded a demo for the new version of [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] for Lopez. Gotti and 7 flew out to Los Angeles on September 10, 2001 to record the song with Lopez. The song was due to be recorded the following day, but was postponed due to the September 11 attacks.

She recalled: [...] "I had to write it over the phone and two-way Irv the lyrics." ...|$|E
