5|$|Gastrotrichs have {{a simple}} body plan with a head region, with a brain and sensory organs, and a trunk with a simple gut and the {{reproductive}} organs. They have adhesive glands <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, {{and at least one}} species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.|$|E
5|$|Archaea are prokaryotic {{unicellular}} organisms, {{and form}} the first domain of life, in Carl Woese's three-domain system. A prokaryote {{is defined as}} having no cell nucleus or other membrane bound-organelle. Archaea share this defining feature with the bacteria <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were once grouped. In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, and thereby split the prokaryote domain.|$|E

5|$|At {{the trial}} in 1884, {{prosecutors}} implicated the sisters in the three other deaths in their household, {{as well as that}} of Thomas Higgins, <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were officially charged. Catherine Flannagan's offer to provide evidence against other conspirators for the prosecution in exchange for leniency was refused. The sisters were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. The sentence was carried out on 3 March 1884 at Kirkdale Prison, with the sisters attended to by a Roman Catholic priest. The deaths were witnessed by a reported one thousand people.|$|E
5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.|$|E
5|$|Cladistic {{studies have}} {{consistently}} {{found that the}} closest relatives of the kitefin shark are the cookiecutter sharks (Isistius), <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> share several dentitional, skeletal, and muscular similarities. Dalatias and Isistius {{are believed to have}} evolutionarily diverged shortly after the transition between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods (65.5 Ma), {{as part of a larger}} adaptive radiation of dogfish sharks from the deep sea into relatively shallower habitats.|$|E

5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, the {{disconnect}} with local production {{has had an}} adverse effect on quality; for example, in the 1990s, some of the dried porcino mushrooms exported to Italy from China contained species of genus Tylopilus, which are rather similar in appearance, and when dried, are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from Boletus. Tylopilus species typically have a very bitter taste, a bitterness that is imparted to the flavour of the porcini <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are mixed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, working in Hanford and Savannah River Sites, Reines and Cowan {{developed}} {{the equipment and}} procedures <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in June 1956.

This included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A, which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures {{featured}} in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including Clifford D. Simak, Piers Anthony, David Brin, K. A. Applegate, Philip Pullman, and Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen.

5|$|Names in English dialects are numerous. Scottish {{and north}} English dialects have {{included}} ka or kae since the 14th century. The Midlands {{form of this}} word was co or coo. Caddow is potentially a compound of ka and dow, a variant of daw. Other dialectal or obsolete names include caddesse, cawdaw, caddy, chauk, college-bird, jackerdaw, jacko, ka-wattie, chimney-sweep bird (from their nesting propensities), and sea-crow (from the frequency <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are found on coasts). It was also frequently known quasi-nominally as Jack.|$|E
