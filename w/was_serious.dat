5|$|In 1068, {{there was}} a revolt {{in the north of}} England against the rule of King William, few details of which are recorded. It <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> enough to worry King William, who marched north and began the {{construction}} of castles at Warwick, Nottingham, York, Lincoln, Huntingdon and Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Favre was {{temporarily}} {{banned by the}} NFL from drinking alcohol after he admitted he was addicted to Vicodin and spent 46 days at a drug rehab clinic {{before the start of}} the season.

5|$|After {{rest and}} recovery, the {{regiment}} {{moved to the}} Fromelles sector of the front in mid-October. Here Kippenberger volunteered for sniper duty despite not being known for his accuracy as a marksman. He served in this capacity until he was badly wounded in the arm by shrapnel on 10 November 1916. Although he eventually recovered from his wound, {{at the time it}} <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> enough that he was repatriated to New Zealand and discharged from the NZEF in April 1917.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1973, there <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> {{debate among}} the Hanoi {{leadership}} over future military policy as the Central Committee of the Lao Động Party convened to assess the progress of its efforts in the south. General Văn Tiến Dũng, PAVN chief of staff, and Defence Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp strongly urged the resumption of conventional military operations, warning that increasing passivity would affect {{the morale of the}} army. Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, however, feared resuming operations would drain vital resources needed for reconstruction in the north.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese raid on Ceylon of March–April 1942, the Eastern Fleet was {{transferred}} from its base at Trincomalee, {{to the other}} side of the Indian Ocean: Kilindi in Kenya. From there the fleet undertook local patrols, escorted convoys and occasionally despatched ships to operations in the Mediterranean. During Operation Vigorous, a convoy to Malta in June 1942, Nestor <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> damaged in an air raid and slowly sank.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, there <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at {{a bend in the}} river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, {{the decision was made to}} straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|E

5|$|In January 1950, Douglas opened {{campaign}} headquarters in Los Angeles and San Francisco, which {{was seen as}} a signal that she <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> about contesting Downey's seat and would not withdraw from the race. Downey challenged Douglas to a series of debates; Douglas, who was not a good debater, declined. The two candidates traded charges via press and radio, with Downey describing Douglas's views as extremist.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2009, a posting on the 4chan /b/ {{board said}} there would be a school {{shooting}} at St Eskils Gymnasium in Eskilstuna, Sweden, leading 1250 students and 50 teachers to be evacuated. A 21-year-old man was arrested after 4chan provided the police with the IP address of the poster. Police said that the suspect called it off as a joke, and they released him after they found no indication that the threat <b>was</b> <b>serious.</b>|$|E
5|$|These 18th-century {{improvements}} to the spinning process meant that handloom weavers were in great demand. but as power looms were introduced in factories in Manchester there was less work for them and there <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> unemployment in the town. In 1827 silk weaving began in Leigh, either {{as the result of}} a dispute or a labour shortage in the Middleton silk industry. William Walker was a middleman who opened the first silk mill in Leigh in 1828, and others quickly followed, including James Pownall and Henry Hilton, whose mill survived until 1926.|$|E

5|$|Years later Armstrong {{remembered the}} {{invitation}} to join the tour as having arisen in a casual conversation, during {{which he did not}} believe the King <b>was</b> <b>serious.</b> He realized the proposed tour was not just idle conversation when the King informed his Cabinet of his plans and chose Armstrong, Judd, and his personal cook Robert von Oelhoffen as his only traveling companions. At a state dinner held by Kalākaua and his ministers a week before departure, Armstrong spoke of their youthful dreams of sailing around the world finally being brought to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Berryman {{was later}} {{nominated}} for a bar to his Distinguished Service Order for the September 1918 fighting, but this was subsequently downgraded to a second Mention in Despatches. He {{was wounded in the}} right eye in September 1918 while he was commanding the 14th Field Artillery Battery. Although his wound <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> enough to warrant hospitalisation, there was no permanent damage to his vision. However, {{it was the end of}} his career as a battery commander, as the Army took the opportunity to transfer him to a staff post. From 28 October 1918 to 1 July 1919, he was Brigade Major of the 7th Infantry Brigade. With the war over, he returned to Australia in October 1919.|$|E
5|$|Defying the king, between 12February and 20April 1642, each county {{delegation}} of England in Commons chose two divines, {{in addition to}} two for each county of Wales, four for London, and two for each University (Oxford and Cambridge). County delegations often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in this {{way to ensure that}} their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14May, to which Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22August, marking the beginning of the First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> about reforming the church and induce the Scots to come to their aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{official}} government statement that allowed {{for freedom of}} the press, {{this was the first}} trial of whether or not Dubček <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> about reforms. Goldstucker suffered no repercussions, and Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media, the government, and the citizens. It was under Goldstücker that the journal's name was changed to Literární listy, and on 29 February 1968, the Writers’ Union published the first copy of the censor-free Literární listy. By August 1968, Literární listy had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most published periodical in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Jane Addams and Smith had a {{disagreement}} over Hull House's Sunday concerts. Smith, a classically trained musician, {{felt that the}} purpose of the events should be to present educationally challenging programs. Addams, felt that the programs should feature more popular music to promote Hull House and recruit broad audiences to experience the environment which the settlement house offered. A compromise was finally reached at the turn of the decade, with Sunday concerts featuring music which had a more popular appeal, and weekday evening programs focusing on more challenging material. The disagreement over content <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> enough to lead to Smith's resignation in 1901. Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content, she was able to persuade Smith to remain.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December, Vandermaesen made a {{stand before}} Port Napoleon, {{defending}} {{the entrance to}} the town with his available regular troops and some small cannon. Keating attacked him, engaging the French front while a second attack by Madras sepoys outflanked the French line and disrupted it, allowing a successful frontal assault. With their defences breached the French fell back and on 2 December Decaen proposed a ceasefire, which was accepted. The following day Decaen surrendered, although with guarantees that he and the garrison would be repatriated and allowed to retain their personal arms and Eagles. Although some in the British force were unhappy with the terms of the surrender, the British commanders were relieved to have the invasion complete before the hurricane season began later in the month. The danger to the 70 ships in the British fleet from such a storm <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> and it was vitally important that they be in a safe harbour when the hurricane season began.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the thirty}} years from 1880 onwards, rule changes were {{incrementally}} {{introduced into the}} game, including {{the adoption of the}} line of scrimmage, scoring that began to resemble the modern version, and the down and yardage structure. Popular personalities of the era included player-coach Joe Wright Sr., one of the best all around Canadian athletes {{at the turn of the}} century. One major outstanding issue within the CRU at the time was the role of professional versus amateur players; this dispute caused the Argonauts to withdraw from the league in 1903 and eventually led to the establishment of a new league, The Big Four or Interprovincial Rugby Football League. Alongside the professionalism dispute, there <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> disagreement over the adoption of the Burnside rules, with Ontario, Quebec, and the intercollegiate league often not in alignment. Amongst other critical innovations, the Burnside rules reduced the number of men per side to 12 and introduced the ten yards in three downs structure that is central to the modern game.|$|E
5|$|Shooting began September 23, 1937 and was {{scheduled}} to end November 20, 1937 on a budget of $767,676. Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan's apartment, moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes. The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, trying too hard to be funny, and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing {{her that he was}} funnier when he <b>was</b> <b>serious.</b> Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played herself {{for the rest of the}} shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.|$|E
5|$|The first {{blood was}} shed deep in Malaysian territory, with the Indonesian-staged Brunei Revolt on 8 December 1962. This operation, {{with the goal}} of seizing the oilfields as well as European hostages, was swiftly crushed by British forces that flew in from Singapore. The {{conflict}} proper, however, began in April of the following year, as 'volunteer' Indonesian forces made occasional raids across the Sarawak border. These raids were small, generally composed of groups smaller than platoon size, and their damage was minimised with relative ease by local security forces. The turning point came on 16 September, when the Malaysian Federation was formally created. In Indonesia, the response to the frustration of their plans to prevent the Federation's birth <b>was</b> <b>serious</b> and violent. A mob converged upon the British embassy in Jakarta, smashing windows and doors in protest. Sukarno authorised stronger raids by Indonesian regular forces, and even launched seaborne attacks into peninsular Malaysia. The raiding would continue {{for the duration of the}} conflict.|$|E
