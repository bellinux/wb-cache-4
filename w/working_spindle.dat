40|$|The {{traditional}} methods for mitigating chatter instability are called passive control {{which focuses on}} optimizing <b>working</b> <b>spindle</b> speeds and depths of cut. But they have inherent disadvantages in gaining highly efficient machining in milling processes. By contrast, the research in this paper is {{along the line of}} active control. Specifically, an adaptive algorithm is developed based on Fourier series analysis to deal with the so-called cutting force variation matrix which causes chatter instability. As a result, the chatter instability is remarkably mitigated. The performance improvement is illustrated by numerical simulation...|$|E
40|$|Chatter is an {{undesirable}} dynamic {{phenomenon in}} machining processes, which causes cutting disturbance, overcut, quick tool wear, etc., and thus seriously impairs workpiece quality. To mitigate chatter, traditional methods called passive control focus on optimizing <b>working</b> <b>spindle</b> speeds and depths of cut. But they have inherent disadvantages in gaining highly efficient machining. On the contrary, {{the research in}} this paper is {{along the line of}} active control. Specifically, an adaptive algorithm is developed based on Fourier series analysis to deal with the so-called regenerative cutting force which causes chatter. As a result, chatter is remarkably mitigated. The performance improvement is illustrated by numerical simulation in terms of both stability lobes diagram (SLD) and surface location error (SLE) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{introduces}} a rotating clamping device, using with the disassemblage machine of monomer hydraulic prop. It {{was used for}} clamping hydraulic prop, which was mainly comprised by the coupling mechanism, clamping mechanism and compressing mechanism. The coupling mechanism sleeve was bolted to the spindle. Clamping mechanism located {{at the end of}} sleeve, <b>working</b> with the <b>spindle</b> rotation. Compressing mechanism hang around the sleeve, not <b>working</b> with the <b>spindle</b> rotation. Compressing mechanism passed the clamping force through the thrust bearing, clamping the hydraulic prop. It was easy to operate. Clamping force is decentralized, the stress in cylinder was even, so the cylinders seldom distort, which reduced the impact, extending the life of the equipment...|$|R
40|$|Spindle {{checkpoint}} silencing is {{a critical}} step during mitosis that initiates chromosome segregation, yet surprisingly {{little is known about}} its mechanism. Protein phosphatase I (PP 1) was shown recently to be a key player in this process, and in this issue of Genes & Deverlopment, Akiyoshi and colleagues (pp. 2887 – 2899) identify budding yeast Fin 1 p as a kinetochore-localized regulator of PP 1 activity toward checkpoint targets. Here we review recent mechanistic insights and propose a <b>working</b> model for <b>spindle</b> checkpoint silencing...|$|R

The 3 D model of spindle unit is build in Pro/E and then guided into ANSYS workbench for modal and harmonic response analysis. The inherent frequencies are carried out by modal analysis. And displacement-frequency curves of dynamic response of spindle unit at the front end, in the middle position, at the rear end are carried out respectively. The results of analysis provide reference for spindle design optimization, and also improve the accuracy and <b>working</b> life of <b>spindle</b> unit...|$|R
60|$|It must be {{understood}} that water-power alone is used for preparing the cotton and <b>working</b> the <b>spindles</b> and looms of the cotton mills. Steam is applied in the two establishments in which the cottons are printed, {{for the purposes of}} printing, but I think nowhere else. When the mills are at full work, {{about two and a half}} million yards of cotton goods are made every week, and nearly a million pounds of cotton are consumed per week, (i e. 842,000 lbs.,) but the consumption of coal is only 30,000 tons in the year. This will give some idea of the value of the water-power. The Pawtucket Canal was, as I say, bought, and Lowell was commenced. The town was incorporated in 1826, and the railway between it and Boston was opened in 1835, under the superintendence of Mr. Jackson, the gentleman by whom the purchase of the canal had in the first instance been made. Lowell now contains about 40,000 inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|The frescos {{from the}} Brarup {{workshop}} {{are quite different}} in style {{from those of the}} Elmelunde Master. God is not stereotyped. Like those from Isenfjord, they have energy. Eve, when <b>working,</b> holds the <b>spindle</b> correctly. In the scenes of the Banishment, Adam and Eve take long strides in contrast to Elmelunde where they are passive and static. In the illustration of the Fall and the Banishment, there are scenes of the Inverted World: a man shears the tail of a horse while another puts horseshoes on a cat. Both are based on items from Proverbes et rimes from 1480. Similar images {{can be seen in the}} churches of Hyllested, Brarup and Hästveda.|$|R
40|$|This study {{involves}} {{the results of}} an investigation concerning the influence of ring travellers of dif-ferent weights, types and coatings on the hairiness of acrylic yarns spun from microfibres. 30 tex yarn was produced using C-type travellers with a twist factor of αtex= 31. 6. Travellers of 8 different weights and 4 different coatings were used <b>working</b> with two <b>spindle</b> speeds of 7000 rpm and 10, 000 rpm. Yarn hairiness was evaluated {{with the use of a}} Shirley Yarn Hairiness Tester. The values of tension, break-age rate, count, twist, evenness, elongation and tensile strength of the yarn produced were measured. In addition the yarns were knitted into fabrics to observe and evaluate pilling. Some conclusions were drawn considering yarn hairiness...|$|R
40|$|In {{this present}} work, the {{important}} {{challenge is to}} manufacture high quality and low cost products within the stipulated time. The quality {{is one of the}} major factors of the product which depends upon the surface roughness and hence the surface roughness placed an important role in product manufacturing. Hence, an Empirical model is proposed for prediction of surface roughness in machining processes at given cutting conditions. The model considers the following <b>working</b> parameters <b>spindle</b> speed, feed, depth of cut, number of flutes and overhang of the tool. For a given work-tool combination, the range of cutting conditions are selected from different cutting condition variables. The experiments were conducted based on the principle of Factorial Design of Experiment (DOE) method with mixed level. After conducting experiments, surface roughness values are measured. Then these experimental results are used to develop an Empirical model for prediction of surface roughness by using Multiple Regression method. In this the Artificial Intelligence based neural network modelling approach is presented for the prediction of surface roughness of Aluminium Alloy products machined on CNC End Milling using High speed steel tool. Trails were made with different combinations of step size and momentum to select the best learning parameter. The best network structure with least Mean Square Error (MSE) was selected among the several networks. The multiple regression models, which are most widely used as prediction methods, are considered to be compared with the developed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model performance...|$|R
40|$|PID control; fuzzy control. Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{concept and}} application of mathematical and simulation model of variable-speed drives (hereafter VSD or VSDs). The models were/are used in rolling mills engineering, commissioning and maintenance. The VSDs are the main actuators there. In order to reach optimal performance in terms of material tolerances, wear and tear, and reliability {{it is necessary to}} have good VSD control which meets not only technology targets but also properties of the VSD mechanical train (set of motor rotors, shafts, gear boxes, couplings, clutches, <b>spindles,</b> <b>working</b> and backup rolls, etc.). Only the optimal VSD control and appropriate operation and maintenance can ensure trouble-free operation and long lifetime of the VSDs. We have been dealing with the VSDs models since 1990. Since then we have used the models in many practical applications. Currently, we concentrate mainly on an optimal and advanced interstand section control. Apart from various PID control strategies, also Fuzzy control has been tested and analyzed. The paper mentions some of our experiences we have achieved in this area...|$|R
40|$|Travel {{literature}} is {{abundant in the}} 14 th century, and several literary works narrate a journey into the Mediterranean Sea: many are the stories of men traveling into those waters, but a few feature female protagonists. The intervention of this essay is twofold. First, {{on the basis of}} Fernand Braudel’s definition of the Mediterranean as a “sea-movement” it explores the role of the Mediterranean in The Decameron by Boccaccio and “elsewhere,” especially Boccaccio’s own Filocolo, Piero da Siena’s Bella Camilla, Le Roman de Floriant et de Florete and other stories featuring women navigating in the Mediterranean in 14 th century literary works. Second, it establishes who the women traveling in those waters are by asking why they travel {{and whether or not they}} themselves chose to travel. Above all, it examines the consequences of their travels on their lives. From here we arrive at the ironic title of this essay: “Mediterranean Metamorphosis. ” When we wonder to what extent women have or have not been modified by their travels in the Mediterranean (the same body of water that men were constantly crossing), that sea changes from a “sea-in-movement” to a “sea-crystallized. ” Women travel, leave home and return exactly as they were when they left, possibly because theirs was mostly a journey they had not chosen to make. Thus we arrive at the second part of the title, “Traveling Penelopes”: the situation of women traveling in the Mediterranean in The Decameron and “elsewhere” encompasses an illumination of a French manuscript of Boccaccio’s De Casibus, where Penelope is seen calm and smiling, <b>working</b> her <b>spindle</b> while her suitors are behind her killing each other. Therefore, most women travel in the Mediterranean paradoxically in a dimension of total immobility; no modification from who they are at their departure is foreseen. For the Mediterranean to be a “social space” or “a place of exchange and sharing”, a woman must be disguised as a man, like Zinevra and Camilla, or, like the Christian Gostanza from Lipari (Decameron V, 4). The Mediterranean in the 14 th century is a dangerous place for women who have not chosen to travel in those waters, and remains a “social space” for men only...|$|R
