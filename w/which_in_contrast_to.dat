25|$|Despite Crosby's efforts, Carleton {{continued}} to advertise {{the book for}} sale until at least 1911. In 1911, Carleton serialised and updated Crosby’s life story in Every Where. The 1906 publication of Crosby’s own autobiography, Memories of Eighty Years, <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Carleton’s book, focused on Crosby's hymn-writing years, was sold by subscription and door-to-door, and promoted in lectures by Doane, raised $1,000 for Crosby. For a period Crosby and Knapp were estranged because of the Carleton book, but by early 1905 they had reconciled.|$|E

25|$|As for {{calculations}} beyond perturbation theory, {{the situation}} improved {{with the advent}} of new functional renormalization group methods, in particular the so-called effective average action (a scale dependent version of the effective action). Introduced in 1993 by Christof Wetterich and Tim R Morris for scalar theories, and by Martin Reuter and Christof Wetterich for general gauge theories (on flat Euclidean space), it is similar to a Wilsonian action (coarse grained free energy) and although it is argued to differ at a deeper level, it is in fact related by a Legendre transform. The cutoff scale dependence of this functional is governed by a functional flow equation <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> earlier attempts, can easily be applied in the presence of local gauge symmetries also.|$|E

25|$|The oral {{bioavailability}} of progesterone is very low, requiring {{very high}} doses to produce significant effects, and the hormone must be micronized {{in order to}} confer oral activity at practical dosages. As progesterone {{could not be used}} orally for many decades (until the introduction of OMP in 1980), the poor activity of oral progesterone prompted the development of progestins (i.e., synthetic progestogens), <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> oral progesterone, have improved metabolic stability and high oral bioavailability. OMP is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but its bioavailability is very low at less than 10% (relative to intramuscular injection) due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. There is wide interindividual variability in the bioavailability of OMP, and its absorption is increased approximately two-fold when it is taken with food.|$|E

25|$|The {{impact of}} the 1911 cyclone {{convinced}} local parishioners {{of the need to}} rebuild St David's in stone, a more expensive undertaking than erecting a timber structure. Reverend Taffs reputedly prepared the design for the new church <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the simple, gabled timber churches that dominated the area, drew from the architectural traditions of the Byzantine Empire or that of the Romans during the Middle Ages. The culmination of Early Christian architecture, the style that came to be associated with this empire began after AD 330 when Emperor Constantine established the Imperial Roman capital at Byzantium, renaming it Constantinople. From its palette the design for St David's originally incorporated a series of domes and barrel vaults over the nave and apse, a dome on a windowed drum, and rounded arches of coloured stone. The planned church was modest in size - 44 feet long by 25 feet wide (13.41m x 7.62m) - and designed to seat 120 persons. Construction commenced in 1912 after suitable stone was found at Bonnie Doon, a local cane farm on the Mossman River. Kerr reports in his Northern Outpost report of 1995 that stones were transported from the property {{with the help of the}} Mossman Mill which agreed to supply half a mile of tramline to enable it to be hauled from the quarry to the construction site. A contract for the nave stone was let for 850 tons at three shillings a ton and Mossman Central Mill railed it to the church site. To withstand potential flooding, substantial foundations were laid by parishioners under the supervision of a stonemason. These were completed in 1915, but further work was delayed by World War I (1914-1918). A decoratively painted timber panel intended for the sanctuary was crafted during this time for use in the temporary church and later transferred to the stone building.|$|E
500|$|Wisden {{said that}} as a bowler, Peel had a [...] "fine length, easy action and splendid command of spin", which meant that he [...] "was often a match-winner". Peel {{consistently}} bowled a good length and varied the flight of the ball to deceive batsmen. He also bowled a quicker ball <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> his usual delivery, travelled {{in a straight line}} instead of turning. On a pitch affected by rain, batsmen found him very difficult to face, and he was very successful in these conditions. When bowling on pitches where the ball came more slowly off the surface, Peel often bowled faster; this pace made it difficult for batsmen to score runs against him even when conditions were in their favour. After he delivered the ball, the spin he imparted often made it curve in the air before it reached the batsman. According to Woodhouse, when bowling, [...] "Peel brought his arm behind his back with a peculiar flourish-like action and then 'whipped the ball down. He generally opened the bowling, including when he played for England. At the time, it was general practice to open the bowling with a fast bowler and a left-arm spinner.|$|E

There Morpurgo developed bookseller activity enabling him partnership with numerous foreign publishing houses. In 1855 he traveled to Trieste, Italy to sign contracts with booksellers and publishers. In 1860 Morpurgo founded his own bookstore [...] "Libreria Morpurgo succ. Savo" [...] by buying out Savo's shares. In 1861 he started the first interlibrary loan in Split. In 1862 bookstore was renamed to [...] "Libreria Morpurgo". In 1859 Morpurgo published the Annuario Dalmatico (Dalmatian Yearly) and in 1861 he published the second volume <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the first volume discussed the political problems in the country. During 1861 out of ten political publications released in Split, five were published by Morpurgo. During that time he also published the variety of commemorative books and brochures.|$|E

2500|$|In total DEFA {{produced}} some 900 feature films during its existence {{as well as}} around 800 animated films and over 3000 documentaries and short films. In its early years, production was limited due to strict controls imposed by the authorities which restricted the subject-matter of films to topics that directly contributed to the Communist project of the state. Excluding newsreels and educational films, only 50 films were produced between 1948 and 1953. However, in later years numerous films were produced {{on a variety of}} themes. DEFA had particular strengths in children's films, notably fairy tale adaptations such as Drei Haselnüsse für Aschenbrödel (Three Nuts for Cinderella) (1973), but it also attempted other genre works: science-fiction, for example Der schweigende Stern (The Silent Star) (1960), an adaptation of a Stanislaw Lem novel, or [...] "red westerns" [...] such as The Sons of the Great Mother Bear (1966) in <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the typical American western, the heroes tended to be Native Americans.

2500|$|Hasidic Judaism {{was founded}} by Yisroel ben Eliezer (1700–1760), {{also known as the}} Ba'al Shem Tov (or Besht). It {{originated}} in a time of persecution of the Jewish people, when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too [...] "academic", and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favored small and informal gatherings called Shtiebel, <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing. Ba'al Shem Tov's disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely owing to Tzadiks, who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and presented a compelling spectacle. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be nothing new, but a refreshment of original Judaism. As some have put it: [...] "they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost". Nevertheless, early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as Misnagdim, (lit. [...] "opponents"). Some {{of the reasons for the}} rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of Haredi Judaism.|$|E

60|$|The {{same general}} {{principle}} {{enables us to}} understand the singular, and often conspicuous, markings on so many gregarious herbivora which are yet, on the whole, protectively coloured. Thus, the American prong-buck has a white patch behind and a black muzzle. The Tartarian antelope, the Ovis poli of High Asia, the Java wild ox, several species of deer, {{and a large number}} of antelopes have a similar conspicuous white patch behind, <b>which,</b> <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the dusky body, must enable them to be seen and followed from a distance by their fellows. Where there are many species of nearly the same general size and form inhabiting the same region--as with the antelopes of Africa--we find many distinctive markings of a similar kind. The gazelles have variously striped and banded faces, besides white patches behind and on the flanks, as shown in the woodcut. The spring-bok has a white patch on the face and one on the sides, with a curiously distinctive white stripe above the tail, which is nearly concealed when the animal is at rest by a fold of skin but comes into full view when it is in motion, being thus quite analogous to the upturned white tail of the rabbit. In the pallah the white rump-mark is bordered with black, and the peculiar shape of the horns distinguishes it when seen from the front. The sable-antelope, the gems-bok, the oryx, the hart-beest, the bonte-bok, and the addax have each peculiar white markings; and they are besides characterised by horns so remarkably different in each species and so conspicuous, that it seems probable that the peculiarities in length, twist, and curvature have been differentiated for the purpose of recognition, rather than for any speciality of defence in species whose general habits are so similar.|$|E
