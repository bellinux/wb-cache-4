40|$|International audienceHigh {{molecular}} weight film-forming flexible fluorinated poly(arylene ether benzoxazole) s, which are suitable as gas separation membranes, adhesives and matrix resins, were synthesized in aprotic dipolar solvents such as N-methyl pyrrolidinone via an intermediate poly(hydroxy amide). The cyclodehydration was subsequently achieved at moderate temperatures (e. g. 150 – 195 °C) in solution via an acid-catalysed (p-toluene sulfonic acid or pyridine hydrochloride) process. The <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>dehydration</b> could be azeotropically removed in an analogous manner {{to the well}} known synthesis of polyimides via intermediate poly(amide acid) s. The fluorinated monomers were bis(arylamino phenol) s based upon either the 6 F or a novel 3 F connecting link. Oxybis(benzoylchloride) {{appears to be a}} particularly attractive comonomer which allows the synthesis of soluble high {{molecular weight}} products. The amorphous macromolecules produced highly transparent ductile cast films with glass transition temperature values of about 300 °C or higher. Semicrystalline morphologies could also be produced by incorporating more rigid comonomers. The synthetic procedures described herein are considered to be attractive relative to several alternative methods described in the literature for the synthesis of amorphous polybenzoxazole...|$|E

25|$|Large colon impactions {{typically}} {{occur at}} the pelvic flexure and right dorsal colon, two areas where the lumen of the intestine narrows. Large colon impactions are most frequently seen in horses that have recently had a sudden decrease in exercise, such as after a musculoskeletal injury. They are also associated {{in the practice of}} twice daily feeding of grain meals, which causes a short-lived but significant secretion of fluid into the lumen of the intestine, resulting in a 15% decrease in plasma volume (hypovolemia of the circulatory system) and the subsequent activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Aldosterone secretion activates absorption of fluid from the colon, decreasing the <b>water</b> content <b>of</b> the ingesta and increasing risk of impaction. Amitraz has also been associated with large colon impaction, due to alterations in motility and retention of intestinal contents, which causes further absorption <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and <b>dehydration</b> <b>of</b> ingesta. Other possible factors include poor dental care, course roughage, dehydration, and limited exercise.|$|R
