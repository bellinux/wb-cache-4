25|$|So at this moment, I begin my {{tenure in}} this Chamber, {{uncertain}} of what history will say of my tenure here. I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the rivalry}} cooled, the two clubs were still {{involved}} in engrossing battles; The Guardians Jamie Jackson wrote after a November 2007 fixture: [...] "For once here was enough spectacle {{to meet the}} pre-match hype and convince the millions watching {{around the world that}} the Premier League may just have the best footballers who can play the very best stuff." [...] In 2009, the teams met in the semi-finals of the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League, which United won 4–1 on aggregate. United defender Patrice Evra was blunt in his post-match assessment: [...] "It was 11 men against 11 children. We never doubted ourselves. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> more experience and that's what made the difference." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{saying that}} she was in favour of [...] "peaceful negotiations" [...] to end apartheid, Thatcher opposed {{sanctions}} imposed on South Africa by the Commonwealth and the EC. She attempted to preserve trade with South Africa while persuading the government there to abandon apartheid. This included [...] "asting herself as President Botha's candid friend", and inviting him to visit the UK in 1984, in spite of the [...] "inevitable demonstrations" [...] against his government. Thatcher dismissed the African National Congress (ANC) in October 1987 as [...] "a typical terrorist organisation". During his visit to Britain five months after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela praised Thatcher: [...] "She is an enemy of apartheid... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> to thank her for." ...|$|E
500|$|Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, which {{promotes}} intelligent design, contested this, saying, [...] "the problem for their logic is that ID {{is not an}} arbitrary explanation, because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> experience with intelligent agents producing the type of informational complexity we see in nature." [...] Columnist Jeff Jacoby wrote in The Boston Globe that intelligent design [...] "isn't primitivism or Bible-thumping or flying spaghetti. It's science." [...] This view of science, however, {{was rejected by the}} United States National Academy of Sciences. Peter Gallings of Answers in Genesis, a Young Earth Creationist ministry said [...] "Ironically enough, , in addition to mocking God himself, are lampooning the Intelligent Design Movement for not identifying a specific deity—that is, leaving open the possibility that a spaghetti monster could be the intelligent designer... Thus, the satire is possible because the Intelligent Design Movement hasn’t affiliated with a particular religion, exactly the opposite of what its other critics claim!" [...] Mark Coppenger, a pastor who teaches at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, commented, [...] "I'm happy to say I think FSM hurts the evolutionists' program since, by mocking the Christian tradition... it reinforces the correct impression that there is genuine contempt for biblical faith in that camp... Besides, the parody is lame, and there are few things more encouraging than cheap shots from one's opponents." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Time {{included}} Romm's blog in {{a list of}} the 25 [...] "Best Blogs of 2010" [...] and one of the [...] "Top Five Blogs TIME Writers Read Daily". [...] The same year, TreeHugger named Romm's blog the [...] "Best Politics Website", adding, [...] "this is the art of blogging at its best". [...] The UK's The Guardian ranked Climate Progress at the top of {{its list}} of blogs in its [...] "Top 50 Twitter climate accounts to follow". [...] Reviewing Romm's 2010 book Straight Up, Bill McKibben wrote that Romm [...] "knows his climate science ... has been a persuasive voice for the most important truth about global warming: that it is a far worse problem than either politicians or the general public understand. ... Romm has been consistent in insisting that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> of the technology necessary to at least begin tackling the problem." [...] He called Romm [...] "a tireless foil to the 'right-wing disinformation machine' that has tried – with great success ... to delay action by confusing and disheartening Americans about global warming. ... It requires a thick skin to take on the daily task of dealing with the disinformers, but Romm has the taste for this kind of blood sport, and the talent as well." [...] In 2011, The New York Times called Romm [...] "one of the country’s most influential writers on climate change". [...] In 2012, Planetsave wrote that Romm is [...] "considered the world’s best blogger on climate science, and politics related to it." ...|$|E

2500|$|US President Barack Obama {{said that}} the {{agreement}} {{would need to be}} built on in the future and that [...] "We've come a long way but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> further to go." [...] Gregg Easterbrook noted that Obama's speech was exactly what George H W Bush had said after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. However, there had been no progress in regulating greenhouse gases since 1992.|$|E
2500|$|When Cao Cao's forces {{arrived at}} Yi (易), Guo Jia said, [...] "A swift army is powerful. Now, as we've {{travelled}} a long distance, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> heavy baggage so we cannot launch a swift attack. If the enemy learns of our approach, they will definitely prepare defences. Why don't {{we leave the}} heavy baggage behind and send our light forces to take a shortcut and launch a surprise attack?" [...] Cao Cao led his army through a secret passage at Lulong Pass (盧龍塞) and headed directly towards the Wuhuan chieftains' headquarters. The Wuhuan were shocked when they heard of Cao Cao's approach and they hastily assembled their army, but were defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Tadun was killed in battle. The Yuan brothers fled to Liaodong to join the warlord Gongsun Kang, who captured and executed them and then sent their heads to Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 September 2016, Street {{was officially}} {{selected}} by Conservatives {{to stand in}} the first election for Mayor of the West Midlands Combined Authority, which took place on 4 May 2017. Street said: [...] " [...] will determine how we create wealth here and what type of society the West Midlands will become. I promise to work tirelessly to convince voters that I am the man to lead us through these decisions... Our economy is being renewed but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> more to do to ensure everybody feels the benefit. Our mission is therefore to build the economic powerhouse of Britain in an inclusive way. That will need leadership from somebody who has a proven record, can bring people together and can represent us with passion. This election needs to go beyond traditional political loyalties and I look forward to seeking voters' support for the job ahead." [...] The following day, it was confirmed that Street would leave John Lewis at the end of October 2016. He was succeeded by Paula Nickolds, who assumed the role in January 2017.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> {{trouble with}} our heroine. Brown wanted her ugly. Brown's chief {{ambition}} {{in life is}} to be original, and his method of obtaining the original is to take the unoriginal and turn it upside down.|$|R
60|$|Need it be {{said that}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> to hear and tell? I think not. Neither need the fact be {{enlarged}} on, that we all retired late that night, {{in a state of}} supreme felicity and mental exhaustion.|$|R

2500|$|Once {{again it}} appears that the Ipswich clubs decided to break away from the Brisbane {{competition}} - {{a letter to the editor}} from 'Lancashire Lad' in 1914 lamented that [...] "It is a pity the Ipswich and district clubs found it necessary to break away from the Brisbane competition, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> to learn from our West Moreton footballers-especially I may say, in the matter of enthusiasm for the game." [...] However, by 1914, the game had become so popular in Brisbane that [...] "Soccer devotees attended in their thousands at the Albion Flats", to watch Ipswich defeat Brisbane 2-1. The Ipswich team included players from Booval, Bush Rats, Goodna, Ipswich City, Bundamba Rangers and St Stephen's. The Brisbane players' clubs are not recorded. The Queensland team chosen after this match went on to play New South Wales and either won 3-2 or lost 6-2, according to conflicting newspaper reports. The Ipswich and West Moreton competition was clearly very strong at this time, as their representative team defeated the New South Wales team 4-1.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents {{and opponents}} have been both criticized for overstating the {{benefits}} or overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively. Systematic reviews have cited {{the lack of}} high quality research for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled. [...] A 2007 Nuffield Council on Bioethics report concluded that good evidence for or against water fluoridation is lacking. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy. John Doull, chairman of the 2006 National Research Council committee report on fluoride in drinking water, has stated a similar conclusion regarding {{the source of the}} controversy: [...] "In the scientific community, people tend to think this is settled. I mean, when the U.S. surgeon general comes out and says {{this is one of the}} 10 greatest achievements of the 20th century, that’s a hard hurdle to get over. But when we looked at the studies that have been done, we found that many of these questions are unsettled and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> less information than we should, considering how long this [...] has been going on. I think that’s why fluoridation is still being challenged so many years after it began. In the face of ignorance, controversy is rampant." ...|$|E
