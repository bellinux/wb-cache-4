50|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>workshop</b> <b>practices</b> of Brueghel. He {{operated}} a large workshop that allowed him to produce a large quantity of works, which were in turn reproduced in his workshop. After Brueghel's death in 1625, Jan Brueghel the Younger took over his father's studio and continued to run it in the same way, as evidenced not only by the surviving paintings in the style of his father he produced but also by the uninterrupted collaboration with such artists as Rubens and Hendrick van Balen, who had collaborated with his father. This workshop production contributed to the wide distribution of Jan Brueghel the Elder's creations.|$|E
5000|$|The Clark Art Institute {{conclude}} {{their investigation}} of the [...] "Virgin and Child in a Landscape" [...] paintings as follows:"Our analysis, based on laboratory study and consideration of fifteenth-century <b>workshop</b> <b>practices,</b> demonstrates that these panels were all produced between 1482 and the early 16th century not by one but by several artists, perhaps sharing a common template for the main figures. Unless further conclusive evidence comes to light, however, {{we will continue to}} attribute the paintings to the Master of the Embroidered Foliage, while acknowledging that this is a catch-all name referring to a number of painters active in Brussels and Bruges in the late 15th century." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{was a very}} skilled portraitist but, {{possibly}} because of the lower ranking of portraiture {{in the hierarchy of}} pictorial genres, he painted only a few (possibly about 12) portraits. He is still regarded as an innovator of the genre as he introduced a new level of expressiveness and accentuated psychological presence. Floris pioneered two types of images in the late 1540s: expressive portraits of individual sitters and head studies on panels. By 1562, Floris’ distinctive head studies had become a form of authorial performance, which bore witness to his creative genius and the <b>workshop</b> <b>practices</b> that he had imported from Italy. While the head studies where made for his own use {{as well as for the}} pupils and assistants in his workshop, some were clearly also produced as artworks in their own right. The rapid, expressive brushwork of these panels suggests that he painted some heads as creative studies and thus anticipate in a certain way the tronies of 17th-century artists. These studies became collector’s items for local art lovers. The head studies testify to the self-conscious artistic culture of Antwerp, where they were valued for their authorship rather than their preparatory value.|$|E

5000|$|There were {{a number}} of issues with the Gresley gear. Because the {{conjugation}} apparatus was mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the valve spindles from the valve gear, as the valve spindles lengthened with the heat of steam in the cylinders the valve timing would be affected, and the gear would need to be removed before it was possible to remove valves for maintenance. However, the B17 Class [...] "Footballer"/"Sandringham" [...] 4-6-0s avoided this particular problem by being designed with the conjugated gear behind, rather than in front of, the cylinders. The main difficulty with this valve gear was that at high speeds, inertial forces caused the long conjugating lever to bend or [...] "whip". This had the effect of causing the middle cylinder to operate at a longer cutoff than the outer cylinders, therefore producing a disproportionate share of the total power output, leading to increased wear of the middle big end. Sustained high speed running could sometimes cause the big end to wear rapidly enough that the increased travel afforded to the middle piston by the increased play in the bearing was enough to knock the ends off the middle cylinder. This happened during the 113 mph run of [...] "Silver Fox". Although the problem could be contained in a peacetime environment with regular maintenance and inspections, it proved to be poorly suited to the rigors of heavy running and low maintenance levels of World War II. This gave rise to big-end problems on the centre cylinder connecting rod on the famous A4 class of streamlined Pacifics and many of these locomotives were fitted with a reduced diameter piston and had the inside cylinder sleeved down as a temporary measure. It should be noted that LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard suffered centre cylinder big-end damage (indicated to the driver by the fracture of a [...] "stink bomb" [...] attached to the bearing, which fractures during overheating of the white metal) during its world record run and was forced to limp back to its depot for repairs afterwards. Gresley's successor at the LNER, Edward Thompson, was critical of this particular valve gear. As well as introducing new two-cylinder designs, he set about rebuilding Gresley locomotives with separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear for each cylinder.Under later British Railways ownership, the application of former Great Western Railway <b>workshop</b> <b>practices</b> for precise alignment of the valve gear and in the manufacture and lubrication of the inside big end bearing effectively solved the problems.|$|E

40|$|This volume {{offers a}} {{thematic}} {{exploration of the}} migrant artist’s experience in Europe and its colonies from the early modern period through to the Industrial Revolution. The influence of the transient artist, both on their adoptive country {{as well as their}} own oeuvre and native culture, is considered through a collection of essays arranged according to geographic location. The contributions here examine the impetuses behind artistic migrations and the status of the foreign artist at home and abroad through the patterns of patronage, contemporary responses to their work and the preservation of their artistic legacy in domestic and foreign settings. Objects and sites from across the visual arts are considered as evidence of the migrant artist’s experience; talismans of cultural exchange that yielded hybrid artistic styles and disseminated foreign tastes and <b>workshop</b> <b>practices</b> across the globe...|$|E

40|$|The Italian Renaissance was {{a pivotal}} {{period in the}} history of Western culture during which artists such as Masaccio, Donatello, Fra Angelico, and Leonardo created some of the world's most {{influential}} and exciting works in a variety of artistic fields. Here, Evelyn Welch presents a fresh picture of the Italian Renaissance by challenging traditional scholarship and placing emphasis on recreating the experience of contemporary Italians: the patrons who commissioned the works, the members of the public who viewed them, and the artists who produced them. Art and Society in Italy 1350 - 1500 dramatically revises the traditional story of the Renaissance and takes into account new issues that have greatly enriched our understanding of the period. From paintings and coins to sculptures and tapestries, Welch examines the issues of materials, <b>workshop</b> <b>practices,</b> and artist-patron relationships, and explores the ways in which visual imagery related to contemporary sexual, social, and political behavior...|$|E
40|$|Agile {{development}} practices respect tacit knowledge, make communication more effective, {{and thus}} foster the knowledge creation process. However the current agile methods, like XP, {{are focused on}} practices that individual teams or projects need, {{and the use of}} the methods in organizations consisting of multiple cooperating teams is difficult. The Community of Practice theory suggests that large agile organizations should have various overlapping, informal cross-team communities. This paper studies three agile methods developed at Nokia that use facilitated workshops to solve multi-team issues. The paper explains using Communities of Practices theory- why these methods work in multi-team settings. The results of this paper suggest that <b>workshop</b> <b>practices</b> that amass people from different parts of organizations to perform a specific well-defined task can be used effectively to solve issues that span over multiple teams and to build up Communities of Practice. This result suggests that the Community of Practice concept could provide a basis for adapting agile methods for the needs of large organizations. ...|$|E
