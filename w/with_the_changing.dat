5|$|Dan Mulligan (Mark Ruffalo) is a {{formerly}} successful {{record label}} executive living in New York City who is estranged {{from his wife}} Miriam (Catherine Keener) and struggling to keep up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> music industry. After being fired from his job, he goes on a drinking binge which leads him to a bar in the Lower East Side where he encounters Gretta James (Keira Knightley). Gretta is a young and fiercely independent songwriter who has just broken up with her long-time boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave Kohl (Adam Levine), a newly successful musician who {{had an affair with}} one of his producers' assistants. Captivated by Gretta's music, Dan offers her to sign her to his former record label, and although she initially refuses she reconsiders the offer and agrees.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{conditions}} have fluctuated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> {{price of oil}} since 1985, for example during and following the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain {{is home to a}} number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share of exports consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E

5|$|The British press {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} Arsenal were fortunate to win; Wenger himself admitted so in {{his press conference}} afterwards. A television audience of over 480million worldwide watched the final; in the United Kingdom, coverage of the match peaked at 12.8million, making it the highest-rated game in Cup history since the 1996 final. The departures of captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane before the year end, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> objectives of both clubs, meant the 2005 final is considered as the natural end point in the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United under Ferguson and Wenger.|$|E
5|$|The late 1960s and 1970s were a time {{of major}} change at Manual. A new wing {{featuring}} a gym with a seating capacity of 2,566 opened in 1971. The school had as many as 3,360 students in the 1971–72 school year, necessitating 17 portable classrooms {{in the front and}} rear courtyards. Manual still had grades seven through twelve at this time, and overcrowding gradually began to improve after Manual dropped the seventh and eight grades when Noe Middle School opened in 1974. Throughout the decade the administration gradually dropped the last vestiges of its manual training emphasis as the number of shop classes dwindled from 16 in 1971 to three in 1979. The Youth Performing Arts School, actually a magnet school within Manual, opened in 1978 and, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> curriculum, presaged Manual's transition to an academically intensive magnet school in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of varying coloration either rapidly or <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> seasons has military applications. Active camouflage could in theory {{make use of}} both dynamic colour change and counterillumination. Simple techniques such as changing uniforms and repainting vehicles for winter have been in use since the Second World War. In 2011, BAE Systems announced their Adaptiv infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of a tank. The Peltier plate panels are heated and cooled to match either the vehicle's surroundings (crypsis), or an object such as a car (mimesis), when viewed in infrared.|$|E

5|$|High-resolution {{images of}} Io {{acquired}} when Io is experiencing an eclipse reveal an aurora-like glow. As on Earth, {{this is due}} to particle radiation hitting the atmosphere, though in this case the charged particles come from Jupiter's magnetic field rather than the solar wind. Aurorae usually occur near the magnetic poles of planets, but Io's are brightest near its equator. Io lacks an intrinsic magnetic field of its own; therefore, electrons traveling along Jupiter's magnetic field near Io directly impact Io's atmosphere. More electrons collide with its atmosphere, producing the brightest aurora, where the field lines are tangent to Io (i.e. near the equator), because the column of gas they pass through is longest there. Aurorae associated with these tangent points on Io are observed to rock <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>changing</b> orientation of Jupiter's tilted magnetic dipole. Fainter aurora from oxygen atoms along the limb of Io (the red glows in the image at right), and sodium atoms on Io's night-side (the green glows in the same image) have also been observed.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Maya art {{then went}} through an {{extended}} Post-Classic phase before the upheavals {{of the sixteenth}} century destroyed courtly culture {{and put an end to}} the Mayan artistic tradition.

Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.|$|E
