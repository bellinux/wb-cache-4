Over the past 15 years, low-emissivity and other techno-logical improvements have significantly improved the energy efficiency of windows sold in the United States. However, as interest increases in the concept of zero-energy homes—build-ings that do not consume any nonrenewable or net energy from the utility grid—even today’s highest-performance <b>window</b> <b>products</b> will not be sufficient. This simulation study compares today’s typical residential windows, today’s most efficient resi-dential windows, and several options for advanced window technologies, including products with improved fixed or static properties and products with dynamic solar heat gain proper-ties. Nine representative <b>window</b> <b>products</b> are examined in eight representative U. S. climates. Annual energy and peak demand impacts are investigated. We conclude that a new generation of <b>window</b> <b>products</b> is necessary for zero-energy homes if windows are not to be an energy drain on these homes. Windows with dynamic solar heat gain properties are found to offer significant potential in reducing energy use and peak demands in northern and central climates, while windows with very low (static) solar heat gain properties offer the most potential in southern climates...|$|E

40|$|Accurately {{analyzing}} {{heat transfer}} in window frame cavities {{is essential for}} developing and characterizing the performance of highly insulating <b>window</b> <b>products.</b> Window frame thermal performance strongly influences overall product thermal performance because framing materials generally perform much more poorly than glazing materials. This paper uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling to assess {{the accuracy of the}} simplified frame cavity conduction/convection models presented in ISO 15099 and used in software for rating and labeling <b>window</b> <b>products.</b> (We do not address radiation heat-transfer effects.) We examine three representative complex cavity cross-section profiles with varying dimensions and aspect ratios. Our results support the ISO 15099 rule that complex cavities with small throats should be subdivided; however, our data suggest that cavities with throats smaller than seven millimeters (mm) should be subdivided, in contrast to the ISO 15099 rule, which places the break point at five mm. The agreement between CFD modeling results and the results of the simplified models is moderate. The differences in results may be a result of the underlying ISO correlations being based on studies where cavity height/length (H/L) aspect ratios were smaller than 0. 5 and greater than five (with linear interpolation assumed in between). The results presented here are for horizontal frame members because convection in vertical jambs involves very different aspect 2 ratios that require three-dimensional CFD simulations. Ongoing work focuses on quantifying the exact effect on window thermal performance indicators of using the ISO 15099 approximations in typical real window frames...|$|E

40|$|The {{last several}} years have {{produced}} {{a wide variety of}} new <b>window</b> <b>products</b> aimed at reducing the energy impacts associated with residential windows. Improvements have focused on reducing the rate at which heat flows through the total window product by conduction/convection and thermal radiation (quantified by the U-factor) as well as in controlling solar heat gain (measured by the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) or Shading Coefficient (SC)). Significant improvements in window performance have been made with low-E coated glazings, gas fills in multiple pane windows and with changes in spacer and frame materials and designs. These improvements have been changes to existing design concepts. They have pushed the limits of the individual features and revealed weaknesses. The next generation of windows will have to incorporate new materials and ideas, like recessed night insulation, seasonal sun shades and structural window frames, into the design, manufacturing and construction process, to produce an integrated window system that will be an energy and comfort asset...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} concept for a ''smart'' highly {{efficient}} dynamic window that maximizes {{solar heat gain}} during the heating season and minimizes solar heat gain during the cooling season in residential buildings.

This prototype was built at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from commercially available ''off-the-shelf'' components. It is a stand-alone, standard-size product, {{so it can be}} easily installed in place of standard <b>window</b> <b>products.</b> Our design shows promise for near-term commercialization. Improving thermal performance of this prototype by incorporating commercially available highly efficient glazing technologies could result in the first window that could be suitable for use in zero-energy homes. The unit's predictable deployment of shading could help capture energy savings that are not possible with manual shading. Installation of dynamically shaded windows in the field will allow researchers to better quantify the energy effects of shades, which could lead to increased efficiency in the sizing of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment for residences...|$|E

40|$|Computer {{modeling}} {{to determine}} fenestration product energy properties (U-factor, SHGC, VT) {{has emerged as}} the most cost-effective and accurate means to quantify them. Fenestration product simulation tools have been effective in increasing the use of low-e coatings and gas fills in insulating glass and in the widespread use of insulating frame designs and materials. However, for more efficient fenestration products (low heat loss products, dynamic products, products with non-specular optical characteristics, light re-directing products) to achieve widespread use, fenestration modeling software needs to be improved. This paper addresses the following questions: (1) Are the current properties (U, SHGC, VT) calculated sufficient to compare and distinguish between windows suitable for Zero Energy Buildings and conventional <b>window</b> <b>products?</b> If not, what data on the thermal and optical performance, on comfort, and on peak demand of windows is needed.

Is the existing level of accuracy enough to distinguish between products designed for Zero Energy Buildings? Is the current input data adequate...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{prospects for}} developing a test device suitable for field verification {{of the types of}} low-emittance (low-e) coatings present on high-performance <b>window</b> <b>products.</b> Test devices are currently available that can simply detect the presence of low-e coatings and that can measure other important characteristics of high-performance windows, such as the thickness of glazing layers or the gap in dual glazings. However, no devices have yet been developed that can measure gas concentrations or distinguish among types of coatings. This paper presents two optical methods for verification of low-e coatings. The first method uses a portable, fiber-optic spectrometer to characterize spectral reflectances from 650 to 1, 100 nm for selected surfaces within an insulated glazing unit (IGU). The second method uses an infrared-light-emitting diode and a phototransistor to evaluate the aggregate normal reflectance of an IGU at 940 nm. Both methods measure reflectance in the near (solar) infrared spectrum and are useful for distinguishing between regular and spectrally selective low-e coatings. The infrared-diode/phototransistor method appears promising for use in a low-cost, hand-held field test device...|$|E

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Approximately two quads (2 * 1015 Btu, 2. 1 EJ) of annual heating energy use in the United States are attributable to heat loss through windows, primarily in residential buildings. Even if all existing windows were replaced with currently available energy-efficient windows, the heating consumption attributable to windows would still be more than one quad (1015 Btu, 1. 1 EJ) [Arasteh et. al. 2006].
