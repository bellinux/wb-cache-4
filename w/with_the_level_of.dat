5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious scent of the skunk. Such prey often send clear and honest warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such warning signs is correlated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> toxicity of the organism.|$|E

5|$|As most meat ant colonies {{rarely have}} a second queen, polydomy is not always {{associated}} with polygyny, although the two are frequently associated with each other because polygynous colonies reproduce by budding. This means that the ecological factors that promote polydomy and polygny both differ. Studies show that most meat ants are produced by a single, inseminated queen due to {{the high level of}} relatedness in all but one tested colonies. Colonies that are not closely related are the result of colony fusion (meaning that two unrelated and separate colonies form a single entity). Meat ants also show nest fidelity: in polydomous colonies, workers from different nests will always mingle with others from different nests but never return to a nest they do not originate from. Instead, they return to the nest they enclosed in. This means that colonies may only homogenise through brood transfer. As discussed before, nestmates from different nests will always be aggressive towards each other, but this is due to a number of factors: genetic and spatial distance in nests can correlate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> aggression exhibited by the ants. However, they exhibit more aggression to ants of different species from adjoining territories. They are also aggressive to conspecific ants from distant colonies, suggesting that environmental cues {{play a vital role in}} nestmate recognition. An example is that background odours in a particular environment may impair ants from identifying their own nestmates, and may need to make more attempts to determine an ant's identity.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} the potential predictive value of cathepsins B, D and K {{in a series}} of 51 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas. While almost always benign, craniopharyngiomas exhibit a high propensity to recur postsurgically and biological markers are therefore needed to predict their recurrence. We have previously demonstrated the potential predictive value of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (Lefranc et al. J. Neurosurg. 2003; 98; 145 - 153). METHODS AND RESULTS: Computer-assisted microscopy was used to determine quantitatively <b>the</b> immunohistochemical <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alpha, beta and gamma RAR subtypes and cathepsins B, D and K. <b>The</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of cathepsin D and of cathepsin B correlated significantly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> RARbeta. <b>The</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of cathepsin K correlated significantly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> expression of RARgamma. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas are characterized by low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARbeta and high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARgamma. <b>The</b> tendency to recurrence seems, at least partly, to relate to the fact that (i) craniopharyngiomas with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARbeta express low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cathepsin D, and (ii) craniopharyngiomas with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> RARgamma express high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cathepsin K.

40|$|Several {{observations}} {{suggest that}} disturbed homeostasis of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) {{may provide a}} link between Gaucher disease (GD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). We recently reported increased dimerization of α-Syn in the red blood cell (RBC) membrane of patients with GD. Several studies indicate a crucial relationship between lipids, oxidative stress and α-Syn status. Here we investigated {{the relationship between the}} observed increased dimerization of α-Syn in the cell membranes of RBCs, cells devoid of lysosomes and lacking lysosomal enzyme synthesis, and the lipid abnormalities and oxidative stress already described in GD. Correlation studies showed that in GD the α-Syn dimer/monomer ratio is positively correlated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and the glucosylceramide/ceramide (GlcCer/Cer) ratio and negatively <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and plasmalogens. In conclusion, we have shown that the increased tendency of α-Syn to form dimers in the RBC membrane of patients with GD, is correlated <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> lipids, including GlcCer, the primary lipid abnormality in GD, and the increased oxidative stress observed in this disorder. The study of other tissues, and in particular brain, will be important in order to elucidate the significance of these findings regarding the link between GD and P...|$|R
