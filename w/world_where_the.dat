5|$|Some {{clinical}} guidelines recommend {{the use of}} RSTs in people with pharyngitis, but others do not. US guidelines are more consistently in favor of their use than their European equivalents. The use of RSTs may be most beneficial in the third <b>world,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> complications of streptococcal infection are most prevalent, but their use in these regions has not been well studied.|$|E
5|$|From 20 to 24 February, Gočeva held five concerts at the Macedonian Opera and Ballet (MOB) {{during which}} she {{performed}} songs from Makedonsko Devojče 2 live for the first time. The concertgoers {{were the first to}} receive copies of the album along with their tickets which were put on sale on 9 December 2013. In 2014, 15,000 tickets were sold for Gočeva's concerts in Skopje. In January 2014, a listening party for the album was held at the club XO in Skopje on which Gočeva was also present; the event represented the first of such kind in Macedonia and according to Gočeva, the inspiration for it came from a similar trend popular across the <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> artist and the team working behind the album listen to the full final version of the project together with a group of fans and music journalists.|$|E
5|$|Later on, it is Bigger Brothers Day in Marine <b>World,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Bigger Brothers {{and their}} boys attend to {{celebrate}} (including Homer, Tom, Bart, and Pepi). After running into Homer, Tom begins to brawl with him, {{in a fight}} which rages across Springfield. In the end, Homer winds up getting poked on the back by a fire hydrant, breaking his spine, much to Tom's shock. As a result, Homer is sent to a hospital on a stretcher, and Bart holds himself responsible for this. Later on, Tom sadly talks {{about how much he}} will miss being a Bigger Brother, while Pepi is sad over losing his Bigger Brother. Fortunately, Bart suggests Tom become Pepi's big brother, to which they happily agree, and both Tom and Pepi walk out into the sunset holding hands. At the same time, Homer (whose back is now fixed) and Bart reconcile, as Homer teaches Bart how to brawl due to his experience with Tom.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, 2015, Cawthon {{announced}} a spin-off of his series, entitled FNAF World. Unlike the main series, {{the game is}} a RPG-based video game, using the various animatronic characters from the first four games. The game {{takes place in a}} fanciful <b>world,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> characters must fight enemies and progress through the game by unlocking certain perks and items. Though originally planned for release on February 2, 2016, Cawthon rescheduled the release to January 22, 2016, but eventually launched yet another day earlier, on January 21, 2016, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Avatar completes {{a series}} of tests at Scintillus Academy, a mage school whose staff was killed by the Guardian. Afterwards, the player travels to the Pits of Carnage, a {{subterranean}} prison on a <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Guardian trains soldiers to attack other dimensions; and to the Tomb of Praecor Loth, where a king killed in a war with the Guardian is buried. Finally, the Avatar visits the Ethereal Void, a strange world with floating, glowing pathways and no map. Eventually, the Avatar discovers that Mayor Patterson is the traitor and destroys the blackrock dome.|$|E
5|$|The subgenre has {{its origins}} in open world action {{adventure}} games popularized in Europe (and particularly the United Kingdom) throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The release of Grand Theft Auto (1997) marked a major commercial success for open-ended game design in North America, and featured a more marketable crime theme. But it was the popularity of its 3D sequel Grand Theft Auto III in 2001 {{that led to the}} widespread propagation of a more specific set of gameplay conventions consistent with a subgenre. The subgenre now includes many games from different developers all over the <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> player can control wide ranges of vehicles and weapons. The subgenre has evolved with greater levels of environmental detail and more realistic behaviors.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the studio's history, many {{projects}}—including Futureblight, Dwarves, Aliens: Crucible, and Stormlands—were cancelled. Due {{to having}} so many projects cancelled, the company entered a severe financial crisis in 2012. As a result, Obsidian decided to crowdfund their next game, Pillars of Eternity, a role-playing game played from an isometric perspective, which ultimately became a success and saved the studio from closure. The team's focus then changed from developing licensed titles to creating original games {{based on the}} studio's own intellectual property. Obsidian has developed {{a close relationship with}} another studio that was founded by ex-Interplay Entertainment employees, inXile Entertainment. The company's latest games are Tyranny, a role-playing game set in a <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> war between good and evil has been fought with evil coming out on top, and Armored Warfare, a massively multiplayer online game with a focus on controlling tanks.|$|E
5|$|A further Scottish {{distinction}} {{from the}} UK flag days {{is that on}} Saint Andrew's Day, (30 November), the Union Flag will only be flown where a building {{has more than one}} flagpole; the Saltire will not be lowered {{to make way for the}} Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more flagpoles present, the Saltire may be flown in addition to the Union Flag but not in a superior position. This distinction arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> potential existed for the citizens of a country to be unable to fly their national flag on their country's national day. (In recent years, embassies of the United Kingdom have also flown the Saltire to mark St Andrew's Day). Many bodies of the Scottish Government use the flag as a design basis for their logo; for example, Safer Scotland's emblem depicts a lighthouse shining beams in a saltire shape onto a blue sky. Other Scottish bodies, both private and public, have also used the saltire in similar ways.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the <b>world</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
