I welcome your comments on the ideas below, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> with them <b>or</b> not; and also on the write-up itself [...] for example, please {{let me know if}} it is confusing, so that I can rework it. 1 I’ll start with a short summary, and will then give the longer version. SHORT SUMMARY Historical data show that stocks with certain characteristics – for example, stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios, or stocks with good performance over the past six months – tend to perform particularly well. We argue that these patterns arise because some investors exhibit psychological biases in their thinking – specifically, two biases known as representativeness and conservatism. LONGER SUMMARY A lot of current research in finance is about something called the “cross-section of average stock returns. ” In simple terms, it is about why certain kinds of stocks have better performance, on average, than certain other kinds of stocks. This paper presents one of the first “behavioral ” models of the cross-section. In other words, {{it is one of the}} first papers to argue that several facts about the cross-section may reflect less than fully rational thinking on the part of some investors. (Two other well-known behavioral models of the cross-section are those of Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) and Hong and Stein (1999)). Some facts Why is there a lot of research on the cross-section of average stock returns? In part, because there are many puzzling things about it. Here, in particular, are four puzzling facts that researchers are still trying to understand. “Long-term reversals” Suppose that you take historical data on U. S. stock prices and do the following exercise. Every three years, you form a group of stocks that had very poor performance over the previous three years (group A); and also, a group of stocks that had very good performance over the previous three years (group B).

Though it may not seem this way {{for those who have}} been in the field for most of their careers, in the overall scheme of professions, software builders are relative "newbies. " In the short history of the software field, a lot of facts have been identified, and a lot of fallacies promulgated. Those facts and fallacies are what this book is about. There's a problem with those facts—and, as you might imagine, those fallacies. Many of these fundamentally important facts are learned by a software engineer, but over the short lifespan of the software field, all too many of them have been forgotten. While reading Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering, you may experience moments of "Oh, yes, I had forgotten that," alongside some "Is that really true?" thoughts. The author of this book doesn't shy away from controversy. In fact, each of the facts and fallacies is accompanied by a discussion of whatever controversy envelops it. You may find yourself agreeing with a lot of the facts and fallacies, yet emotionally disturbed by a few of them! <b>Whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> disagree, you will learn why the author has been called "the premier curmudgeon of software practice.

40|$|ELLIE RENNIE reviews Marcus Westbury 2 ̆ 7 s ABC TV series, Not Quite Art ?THIS Is Not Art? is {{held every}} spring in Australia?s largest {{regional}} city, Newcastle. TINA, as it affectionately referred to, {{is a number}} of different festivals thrown into the one program. Electronic music, emerging writers and youth media are interspersed with semi-intellectual discussions, soap box speakers and the fluttering of hundreds of zines. I attended TINA for the first time last month. As with everything that calls itself ?new? or ?emerging,? TINA felt somehow familiar and unexpected at the same time. One surprising-yet-tedious moment occurred during a serious panel discussion on generationalism. Just when things were getting interesting, two strangely dressed men took over the stage and conducted a urine-drinking performance (yes, it was freshly squeezed). Meanwhile, a young woman in the audience continued to eloquently ask a question to the panel, completely unfazed by the impromptu performance. For regulars at TINA, this kind of interruption was just ?same old. ? On Tuesday, the ABC will be screening the final of a three part series made by {{one of the founders of}} TINA, Marcus Westbury. Not Quite Artexamines underground, experimental and DIY culture in the cities of Newcastle, Glasgow and Melbourne. Westbury, a 33 year-old Novocastrian who now lives in Melbourne, premiered the first two episodes of his series (available for download on the program?s website) for the TINA audience. Nervously gulping down his home-town ginger beer, Wesbury told us to expect ?a typical ABC arts program format. ? The series, however, is intentionally disrespectful of the arts scene. By taking a stab at cultural funding, Westbury challenges (but also reinforces) familiar notions of high and low culture. A symphony orchestra is not much more than a covers band; the Opera House is a blank canvas for an anti-war protest. <b>Whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> not, the primary subject-matter of this series is intensely interesting and often amusing ? from graffiti art to political computer games and botanical weed tours. Fancy galleries and expensive concert halls are a long way from Westbury?s creative scene which lives in laneways, run-down bowling clubs and dilapidated factories. In fact, some of it could almost be art ? if only it would comply to health and safety rules. Westbury is surprisingly good in the stuffy TV presenter role. With short hair and dark rimmed glasses, he looks decidedly more Melbournian than Novocastrian these days, but he does achieve some funny lines and smooth interviews amongst his artsy to-camera schtick. The really annoying thing about this TV series is that it hasn?t been done before ? at least not in Australia, reminding us that ABC is a decade behind creative industries policy. During question-time at the premier screening, the kids from Newcastle expressed sincere thanks to Westbury for finally managing to show their city and culture as they experience it. I expect the Mayor of Newcastle will be equally proud. As demonstrated by the second episode, set in Glasgow and Melbourne, city councils have been embracing underground art scenes for some time. Melbourne?s laneways are now a top tourist destination, not to mention a great backdrop for a wedding photo. The final episode faces up to the fact that DIY is now also R&D for commercial culture. We discover that Melbourne?s laneways are just as famous for their bars as their artwork, and that ?the new? inevitably gets coopted into mainstream fashion, design and music. In the end it is ?not quite? art, but it is definitely the creative industries. ? Ellie Rennie is a CCI Research Fellow at Swinburne?s Institute for Social Research.
