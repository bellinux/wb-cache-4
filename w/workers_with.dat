5|$|Most of {{the mining}} {{companies}} {{felt that the}} expected recovery {{would result in a}} labor shortage and challenge economic recovery. The government believed that if copper prices fell in the future, similar effects would be experienced. The colonial administration implemented two schemes to maintain the relationship of urban <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> their rural homelands. Health-service expenditures by rural relatives of urban workers were borne by the government, and the rural male migration of the working population was reduced.|$|E
5|$|Surnames that mention {{animals can}} also be toponymic, the names Horscroft, Horsfall, Horsley and Horstead for example all {{denoting}} people who came from these villages associated with horses. The surname Horseman (1226 onwards) {{on the other hand}} is a metonym for a rider, mounted warrior, or horse-dealer, while the surnames Horse and Horsnail could either be nicknames or metonyms for <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> horses and shoers of horses respectively.|$|E

Two of the three species are from the Eocene while the third species is from the Late Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|With urban regeneration, high-value {{service sector}} {{industries}} such as corporate services and financial services haven taken root in Northern England, with major hubs around Leeds and Manchester.

5|$|After the 1943 Argentine coup d'état, Juan Perón, {{a member}} of the United Officers Group that {{engineered}} the plot, became Minister of Labor. Campaigning among <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> promises of land, higher wages, and social security, he won a decisive victory in the 1946 presidential elections. Under Perón, the number of unionized workers expanded as he helped to establish the powerful General Confederation of Labor. Perón turned Argentina into a corporatist country in which powerful organized interest groups negotiated for positions and resources. During these years, Argentina developed the largest middle class on the South American continent.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend). It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother and sees the usually jumbled miners marching in step as part of the funeral procession does he have an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful force, to be organized specifically by him. Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.|$|E
5|$|Historians are {{now turning}} to local gazetteers of Ming China for clues {{that would show}} {{consistent}} growth in population. Using the gazetteers, Brook estimates that the overall population under the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) was roughly 75 million, despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62 million. While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> not enough good cultivated land for them to till, so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation. The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region, while the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled {{in order to bring}} in more revenues.|$|E

5|$|Mining {{started on}} 7 July 1910, {{with the first}} ore train being run on 13 July. The first shipload left Kirkenes on 11 October, but SS Bengal sank with the first shipment. In 1911, the system {{exported}} 330,000 tonnes of ore. The railway was also used for transporting <b>workers,</b> <b>with</b> trains running from the towns to the plants {{in the morning and}} returning after the working day was over. Prior to private cars becoming common, the railway operated a passenger carriage on the trains between Kirkenes and Bjørnevatn—allowing free travel. The railway has never had any scheduled or public transport of passengers, but the company's concession specifies that the authorities could at a later date require the company to operate public passenger services under specified conditions.|$|E
5|$|Nasser also {{attempted}} to maintain {{oversight of the}} country's civil service {{to prevent it from}} inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state. New laws provided <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management. Land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers, promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty. As a result of the 1962 measures, government ownership of Egyptian business reached 51percent, and the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers. Nasser's tilt toward a Soviet-style system led his aides Boghdadi and Hussein el-Shafei to submit their resignations in protest.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the people}} in the labor force over the age of16, 679 people (49.3% of the population) were in the {{civilian}} work force, while 697 people (50.7% of the population) were not in the labor force at all. At the time of the Census, seventy people (5.1%) were unemployed, with none in the armed forces. Of the 609 employed residents over the age 16, private-sector wage and salary workers accounted for 475 of them (78.0%). One-hundred-nine people (17.9%) were classified as federal government <b>workers,</b> <b>with</b> the self-employed making up 4.1% of the population. No one was classified as an unpaid worker.|$|E

5|$|On October 7, 1987, Collins {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to close a}} deficit between state contributions to the worker's compensation Special Fund and disbursements. The Special Fund was designated for payments to <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> occupational diseases and workers whose work-related injuries could not be traced to any single employer. A plan proposed by Democratic state senator Ed O'Daniel was expected to {{provide the framework for}} legislation considered in the session. Under O'Daniel's plan, additional revenue for the Special Fund would be raised by increasing assessments on worker's compensation premiums for 30 years. Assessments for coal companies were increased more than those on other businesses because the majority of the claims paid from the Special Fund were for black lung, a breathing disease common among coal miners; consequently, it was opposed by legislators from heavily coal-dependent counties. Nevertheless, after nine days of negotiations, a bill substantially similar to O'Daniel's original plan was approved by the legislature and signed by Collins.|$|E
5|$|P.exclamans are haplodiploid insects, as {{are other}} Polistes species {{including}} Polistes metricus, Polistes dominula, and Polistes annularis. This means they have haploid males that produce identical haploid sperm, and diploid females that produce haploid eggs through meiosis. This has consequences for genetic relatedness within colonies, since sisters receive identical sperm if {{they share a}} father, and the normal half identical contribution from the mother. This results in sex-biased conflicts between the queen and the <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> respect to the sex ratio, with workers preferring a more female biased sex ratio, and queens preferring equal investment in queens and males.|$|E
5|$|Rescue {{operations}} {{took over}} 24hours; the pace was {{hampered by the}} decision to remove many of the logs by hand for fear that using heavy equipment to remove them would cause further collapses, resulting in further injuries to those still trapped. Students, including the entire Texas A football team and {{many members of the}} university's Corps of Cadets, rushed to the site to assist rescue <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> the manual removal of the logs. The Texas A civil engineering department was also called on to examine the site and help the workers determine the order in which the logs could be safely removed, and, {{at the request of the}} Texas Forest Service, Steely Lumber Company in Huntsville, Texas, sent log-moving equipment and operators. John Comstock was the last living person to be removed from the stack. He spent months in the hospital following amputation of his left leg and partial paralysis of his right side. Comstock returned to A in 2001 to finish his degree.|$|E
