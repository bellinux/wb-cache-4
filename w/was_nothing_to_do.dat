25|$|In Week 2, {{the team}} {{traveled}} to St. Louis where they lost 24-22. A major defensive loss was suffered when Brian Orakpo went {{down from a}} tear to his left pectoral muscle. Despite widespread complaints from Redskins fans and players about the Rams playing dirty, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but {{move on to the}} home opener against Cincinnati. The game started on a bad omen when the Bengals threw a 76-yard TD pass on the opening drive. Although the Redskins responded furiously and played another close match, they lost and injuries continued to pile up as CB Josh Wilson and WR Pierre Garçon went down. They would win their next game on a late game field goal at Tampa Bay, 24-22, after the Buccaneers made a 4th quarter comeback to take the lead. The Redskins only won one of their next five games, going into the bye week at 3-6.|$|E

Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot". Marco Pirroni, who had {{performed}} with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, [...] "After that, it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story".|$|E
500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E

500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E

2500|$|The {{restoration}} has however received {{almost universal}} backing from French experts {{and from the}} general public. Malcolm Miller, author {{of a number of}} books on the cathedral and widely considered its greatest expert, dismissed the objections: [...] "They talk about the patina of the centuries. Nonsense. Rubbish. This is not the patina of the centuries. It is the rotting remains of a whitewash from the 18th century. The people who built this cathedral intended that its interior should be light. There was nothing natural about its darkness. It <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with ageing of the stone. It was caused, first of all, by centuries of candle smoke and then by a stupid decision to install oil-fired central heating in the 1950s. More recently, there was smoke damage from a couple of fires.” ...|$|E

Kat is described by the EastEnders website saying {{that as soon as}} she arrived in Walford with her [...] "fake tan, heavy make-up and hoop earrings", viewers would know that Kat would bring a dose of [...] "Viagra to the men of Albert Square". It continues to read: [...] "Her mum had died, dad was grieving and nan (Mo) was touting stolen meat off the back of lorries (some things never change). Kat wasted very little time in establishing herself as a drama queen by shocking everyone with the revelation that her youngest sister, Zoe was in fact her daughter. Then she stole her dishy doctor boyfriend for good measure." [...] It continues: [...] "With her enemies closing in, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but return home to Walford for help, complete with a huge baby bump" ...|$|E
2500|$|One interned {{serviceman}} {{described the}} Laghouat camp as a [...] "Beau Geste style fort based about a Saharan oasis". Those held were treated well, except that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{and they were}} not allowed to leave the camp. In any event, [...] "any escape was virtually impossible, given the expanse of desert that surrounded them". Another internee wrote to the Red Cross in Scotland from the Camp des internés britanniques Laghouat : [...] "Technically we are not prisoners of war but up to the present {{have not been able to}} find a difference. Unfortunately 30 to 40 per cent of the articles sent in the batch of parcels were missing." [...] In his book There and Back Again: a navigator's story (2004), former Royal Air Force navigator Douglas Hudson of 101 Squadron reports that over five hundred Allied prisoners were held in the camp. He tells of inhumane living conditions and the construction of an escape tunnel.|$|E
2500|$|Ray {{claimed the}} {{dismissal}} was because [...] "they wanted a {{girl on the}} show", and stated that [...] "mass appeal" [...] was a direct quote from that meeting. However, fellow co-creator Janet Carr of the show replied back on that statement saying, [...] "Regardless of what Jung might say GG will NOT be dumbed down and I state again, the decision <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with bringing in a girl... I'm a girl and I started this show – I don't care about {{the gender of the}} presenters – I just care about having the best people working on it." [...] The network first claimed Jeremy would stay behind the scenes in a writing capacity, then stated he would not be working on the show due to holiday travel plans that conflicted with the show's schedule. It then made the statement saying, [...] "The reason for replacing Jeremy Ray was ongoing behind-the-scenes performance based issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Daniel comforted {{an upset}} Imogen, she leaned in and kissed him. While Daniel {{was shocked by}} the kiss, Imogen tried to {{convince}} him that it was [...] "a brain snap and nothing more". Daniel then had to choose whether to tell Amber about the kiss or not. Following his break-up with Amber, Daniel had to assure Imogen that it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with their kiss. She then tried to convince Daniel to work things out with Amber, but his [...] "unwavering confidence in their love" [...] had been knocked. Kaplan expressed her wish for Imogen and Daniel to become a couple, saying [...] "I have wanted them to be together from the start. I think they balance each other out and Daniel brings out the best in Imogen, so I'm always hoping that it happens secretly!" [...] Phillipps later admitted that Daniel and Imogen were better suited than Daniel and Amber. He thought they should get together and hoped the writers had noticed that there was a demand for them to be a couple on social media sites.|$|E
2500|$|Not all judges {{took the}} same view. In Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner home-working ladies {{stitching}} flaps onto trousers were held to be employees {{within the meaning of}} the Act. The leading judge, Stephenson LJ, held that [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the promise of future work, but simply the exchange of work for a wage, and control over one's job by the employer in the employment contract. Before the case reached the Court of Appeal, a young Tony Blair had been arguing the exact opposite in the Employment Appeals Tribunal, that O'Kelly's case should be followed. Agency workers were presumed to fall outside the scope of protective employment legislation. In 1997, when Tony Blair led New Labour to election victory, the approach to employment policy he brought was one of upholding labour market flexibility. The position of agency workers was reaffirmed when Derry Irvine was appointed Lord Chancellor, and he sat in on, and gave the leading judgement in, Carmichael v National Power plc. He reasserted his view of [...] "mutuality of obligation". It is notable that the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 removed the power of the Lord Chancellor to decide on cases in this manner; it now being an incursion on the separation of powers within government.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} received media criticism {{due to her}} American accent {{upon her}} reintroduction in 2003. Johnson said, [...] "I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart." [...] However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the Daily Mirror describing it as [...] "hilarious" [...] and branding the character [...] "Go Away Again Vicki". [...] He added, [...] "Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys." [...] Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: [...] "When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I did that {{for a few months}} and then one day out of the blue I arrived on set and they told me they wanted me to change to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else - all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People assumed I was slipping out of the accent - but it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with me. I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth." ...|$|E
