Moreover, The Collector had already been adapted in a 1965 film that gained Fowles further popular attention.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of several Spec Ops games in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the series met with low sales and poor reviews, causing {{a halt to the}} {{production}} of successive games. In 2003, Take-Two mentioned in their financial results that Rockstar Games <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> franchise, but in 2004 the project was cancelled. It was later revealed that Rockstar Vancouver would have developed the canned project, with Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme working on the soundtrack for the game.|$|E

5|$|From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward {{was head}} of the Military Applications Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he {{conducted}} atomic weapons laboratory work at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

5|$|Hemingway's {{marriage}} to Hadley deteriorated as he <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Sun Also Rises.

On their return to Paris, Hadley asked for a separation; in November she formally requested a divorce. They split their possessions while Hadley accepted Hemingway's offer of the proceeds from The Sun Also Rises. The couple were divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pfeiffer in May.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the need}} for an {{improved}} CSBS was known in the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out. That was because an entirely new class of tachometric bombsights were being developed, which offered dramatically improved accuracy and automated much of the setup. The RAF <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Automatic Bomb Sight along these lines but development was slow and it had not been accepted for use when the war started. Hearing of a similar development by the US Navy, the Air Ministry began extensive negotiations in an effort to gain a licence for the Norden bombsight. The Navy constantly refused these requests, based on arguments about secrecy and various political issues. As the war started, revised versions of the CSBS, the Mk. VII and Mk. IX remained universal and the Mk. X, a more extensive improvement, was in mass production and being readied for service entry.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the Conservancy worked to {{preserve}} the San Clemente Island goat, a rare Spanish-descended breed from California. In 1991, it added genetic material from the San Clemente to their genetic database, later transferred to the National Animal Germplasm Program. As of June 2010, the organization <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rescue {{of a group of}} feral Spanish goats from an island in South Carolina. There are less than 2,500 members of the breed in the United States, and the island group is one of only two bloodlines known to exist in the southeastern US. Conservancy members first made trips to the island to document and photograph the herd of around 30 goats, then undertook action to remove some goats from the island to preserve the bloodlines from threatened extinction. A small flock was established in a nature preserve just south of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, and as of June 2010 plans were in place for satellite herds to be established.|$|E

He considered publishing an account of his 1969 trip to Afghanistan with Peter Levi. Levi published his own book about it, The Light Garden of the Angel King: Journeys in Afghanistan (1972). Chatwin contributed two articles on nomads to Vogue and another article to History Today.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were {{approaching}} retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs. McDonnell Douglas <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> MD-11, a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC-10, while Airbus was developing its A330 and A340. In 1986, Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767, tentatively named 767-X, {{to target the}} replacement market for first-generation wide-bodies such as the DC-10, and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup. The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 767, along with winglets. Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the existing 767 flight deck, nose, and other elements.|$|E
5|$|Dunning {{remained}} in charge at Columbia until 1 May 1943, when the Manhattan District {{took over the}} contract. By this time Slack's group had nearly 50 members. His was the largest group, and it <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most challenging problem: {{the design of a}} suitable barrier through which the gas could diffuse. Another 30 scientists and technicians were working in the other five groups. Henry A. Boorse was responsible for the pumps; Booth for the cascade test units. Libby handled chemistry, Nier analytical work and Hugh C. Paxton, engineering support. The Army reorganized the research effort at Columbia, which became the Special Alloyed Materials (SAM) Laboratories. Urey was put in charge, with Dunning becoming head of one of its divisions. It would remain this way until 1 March 1945, when the SAM Laboratories were taken over by Union Carbide.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, the Russian {{flight of}} Sputnik 1 {{prompted}} the United States to accelerate its fledgling space program. On July 29, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, which established NASA and subsumed NACA within this newly created organization. Langley Research Center {{became a part}} of NASA, as did Langley employees such as Kraft. Even before NASA began its official existence in October, Kraft was invited by Gilruth {{to become a part of}} a new group that <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> problems of putting a man into orbit. Without much hesitation, he accepted the offer. When the Space Task Group was officially formed on November 5, Kraft became one of the original thirty-five engineers to be assigned to Project Mercury, America's man-in-space program.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015, Kinberg {{said that}} a sequel for Deadpool was in development.

However in October 2016, Miller left the film due to creative differences with Reynolds {{and was replaced by}} David Leitch in November as the director. In February 2017, Drew Goddard had joined as a creative consultant to work on the script with Reynolds, Rheese and Wernick. Filming commenced in June 2017 in Vancouver for a June 1, 2018 release.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} {{parts of the}} game's development, the largest {{challenge}} was to coordinate Guasti's and his collaborators' work; when Guasti started working as a programmer, he learned about project management, and applied it to AM2R, but still found it challenging to have deadlines and keep people motivated, as everyone <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game for free in their spare time. In late 2014, the project was ported to the newer version GameMaker: Studio, which enabled improved loading times and performance, but required the complete rewriting of some features and changes to the designs of some levels. This move also made bugs faster to fix and new builds easier to make, leaving the development progress in a more expedient and productive state. Later in the same year, the developers worked on improving the visuals, giving the fourth area a new graphics tile set intended to give it more personality.|$|E

5|$|The first convoy from Belgium, {{carrying}} stateless Jews, left Mechelen {{transit camp}} for Auschwitz on 4 August 1942 {{and was soon}} followed by others. These trains left for extermination camps in Eastern Europe. Between October 1942 and January 1943, deportations were temporarily halted; by this time 16,600 people have been deported on 17 rail convoys. As the result of Queen Elisabeth's intervention with the German authorities, all of those deported in this first wave were not Belgian citizens. In 1943, the deportations resumed. By the time that deportations to extermination camps had begun, however, nearly 2,250 Belgian Jews had already been deported as forced laborers for , a civil and military engineering group, which <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> construction of the Atlantic Wall in Northern France.|$|E
5|$|Timbaland {{spoke to}} MTV's Shaheem Reid back in July 2008 {{to confirm that}} he <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{follow-up}} to his platinum selling Shock Value.

He was insistent that he would also collaborate with Jordin Sparks, Beyonc√©, Rihanna, Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and T.I. However, none of these collaborations (except Miley Cyrus) made it to the final track list. He also said that alongside T-Pain who would definitely appear, he hoped to get Jay-Z on board, although he ultimately failed to do so. Timbaland began working on the sequel to Shock Value in July 2008. In March 2009, he filed a lawsuit against his label, Blackground Records, alleging that they attempted to blackball him after he decided to move from music performance into production.|$|E
