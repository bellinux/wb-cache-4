Real Madrid of Spain tried to sign him in 1959 after some stunning performances by him {{on a tour of}} Europe. Internazionale, AC Milan and Juventus of Italy considered jointly signing him in 1963 (he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> a season with each); a deal that would have been unique in football.|$|E
25|$|Central Bedfordshire Council (then Bedfordshire County Council) {{acquired}} the old church in 1977. The site continued {{to suffer from}} vandalism, as well as fly-tipping, under Council ownership. In 2010, local activism led to plans {{for the church to}} acquire a new function. It was proposed to convert it into a bothy to provide overnight accommodation for walkers on the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge walk, with a full-time warden on site. However, there were concerns that the Council {{would not be able to}} afford the £75,000 that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> on such a project.|$|E

25|$|On 4 February, Wyld {{met with}} the {{residents}} of Leicester Square to present {{his plans for the}} gardens. At this meeting he claimed that in addition to the £3,000 he had paid for the freehold he had also agreed to pay £4,500 for the building and the works would cost £12,000; he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> around £21,800 on the project in total, which included the outlay for new gardens and a new enclosure railing.

25|$|The key {{features}} of the 2011 CBA included changes related to health and safety, including {{a reduction in the}} number of off-season practices, a prohibition against training camp “two-a days", and a limit on contact practices in both the preseason and regular season. The new CBA also featured increases in player benefits, including retroactive pension increases for retired players and the creation of a neuro-cognitive benefit for players affected by concussions and other similar injuries. Also, the agreement promised an increase up to $1.5 million in salary guarantees for injured players and a new revenue split, offering players between 47 percent and 48.5 percent of all revenue. Changes were also made in contract-related benefits, with an increase in minimum player salaries and salary cap minimums, including the guarantee of a 99% -95% league wide spend and a requirement that each club <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> an average of 89% of the salary cap over four-year periods.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the new multipurpose vessel began on 25 May 2003 when the Ministry of Transport and Communications appointed a work group to investigate the technical requirements and economic aspects of building a new multipurpose icebreaker capable of combating oil and chemical spills around the year. The amount of oil transported in the Gulf of Finland had increased from a mere 15 million tons {{per year in the}} early 1990s to 69 million tons in 2003 and was expected to reach 130 million tons by 2010 after the new Russian oil terminals became operational, increasing the risk of a large spill in the vulnerable sea area considerably. While Finland already had a fleet of vessels with oil recovery equipment, none of them were capable of collecting spilled oil efficiently in heavy seas or in ice. The new multipurpose icebreaker would be designed to be capable of recovering spilled oil and chemicals in both open water and ice conditions, extinguishing shipboard fires and emergency towing of the largest merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Finland. The new vessel would also have sufficient icebreaking capability to assist oil tankers to the Kilpilahti oil refinery in Porvoo during winter. However, in the interim report, published on 30 September 2003, the work group noted that unless other work outside the winter months could be arranged and the new multipurpose icebreaker <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> {{the rest of the year}} in pollution control readiness, the operating expenses would be very high.|$|E

His 1943 revival of William Congreve's Love for Love on tour {{and then in}} London received high praise from reviewers. In 1944 he was approached by Ralph Richardson, who had been asked by the governors of the Old Vic {{to form a new}} company. Unwilling to take sole charge, Richardson proposed a managing triumvirate of Gielgud, Olivier and himself.

50|$|It is {{important}} to notice that scandal <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> broken out if all Lucetta and Henchard did was walk, talk, or dine together in a boarding house.

In any case Henchard does propose marriage, stating that there was a risk his first wife would return. Lucetta accepts the proposal, so the two are engaged. Henchard returns to Casterbridge leaving Lucetta to bear the full brunt of the scandal until he is ready to bring her to town, and she writes him passionate letters on a daily basis. Of course, it is at this inopportune time that Susan arrives. Henchard cancels the engagement and sends Lucetta a substantial gift of money.|$|R

2500|$|Mitchell criticizes this because, he asserts, {{the falling}} wages of babysitters only solves the problem if {{it reduces the}} desire of couples to save, which is not {{supported}} by any research. The only effect of falling wages would be to increase {{the real value of}} nominal contracts. [...] In other words, couples <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> more time babysitting before they acquired the amount necessary to leave the cooperative. Mitchell concludes that the problem is greater aggregate desire to save than can be funded by existing administrative debt, and that the solution is thus either to reduce (desire for) savings or, more likely increase spending by simply issuing more scrip.|$|E
2500|$|This led to {{a series}} of {{projects}} including Nike Zeus, Nike-X, Sentinel and ultimately the Safeguard Program, all aimed at deploying a nationwide defensive system against attacks by Soviet ICBMs. The reason for so many programs was the rapidly changing strategic threat; the Soviets claimed to be producing missiles [...] "like sausages", and ever-more missiles would be needed to defend against this growing fleet. Adding radar decoys and additional warheads to existing missiles allowed the offensive force to grow both more rapidly and much more cheaply than the defense. An early estimate suggested one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> $20 on defense for every $1 the Soviets spent on offense. The addition of MIRV in the late 1960s further upset the balance in the favour of the offence.|$|E

Torquay started the 1st leg poorly and were fortunate when Tim Sills scored just before half-time but Exeter City leveled when Wayne Carlisle equalised. [...] Just when the game looked like a draw Chris Zebroski pounced on a poor clearance by Paul Jones to make the final score 2–1 to United. Torquay knew going into the 2nd leg that if they scored one goal Exeter City would need two goals to force extra time and when Kevin Hill scored {{in the second half}} in his record equaling appearance the match seemed all over, however Exeter City went on to score four goals in the space of 18 minutes, dumping Torquay out of the play-offs and ensuring they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> another season in non-league football.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{returned}} to baseball in 1981 after accepting a coaching job with Joe Torre, {{who was then}} manager of the New York Mets.

The Braves proceeded to challenge for the National League pennant for the first time since 1969, ultimately losing to the Cardinals in the 1982 National League Championship Series. Gibson remained with Torre on the Braves' coaching staff until the end of the 1984 season. Gibson then took to hosting a pre- and postgame show for Cardinals baseball games on radio station KMOX from 1985 until 1989. Gibson also served as color commentator for baseball games on ESPN in 1990 but declined an option to continue the position over concerns he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> too much time away from his family.

[...] Gibson is father to three children: two with his first wife, Charline, and one with his second wife, Wendy.|$|E
