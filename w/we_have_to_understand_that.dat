40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} change propagation during software maintenance and evolution. Change propagation is modeled as a sequence of snapshots, where each snapshot represents one particular moment in the process, with some software dependencies being consistent and others being inconsistent. A snapshot is changed into the next one by a change in one software entity and the dependencies related to it. The formalism for this process is based on graph rewriting. The paper discusses two basic processes of change propagation: change-and-fix, and top-down propagation. It also describes a prototype tool "Ripples 2 " which supports both processes, and {{an example of the}} use of the tool. 1. Introduction Change propagation {{is one of the key}} parts of software maintenance and evolution.

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} role of model transformation is in exchanging modeling information among diverse modeling languages. However, while a model is typically constrained by other models, additional information is often necessary to transform said models entirely. This dilemma poses unique challenges for the model transformation community. To counter this problem we require a smart transformation assistant. Such an assistant {{should be able to}} combine information from diverse models, react incrementally to enable transformation as information becomes available, and accept human guidance – from direct queries to understanding the designer(s) intentions. Such an assistant should embrace variability to explicitly express and constrain uncertainties during transformation – for example, by transforming alternatives (if no unique transformation result is computable) and constraining these alternatives during subsequent modeling. We would want this smart assistant to optimize how it seeks guidance, perhaps by asking the most beneficial questions first while avoiding asking questions at inappropriate times. Finally, we would want to ensure that such an assistant produces correct transformation results despite the presence of inconsistencies. Inconsistencies are often tolerated yet <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> their presence may inadvertently trigger erroneous transformations, thus requiring backtracking and/or sandboxing of transformation results. This paper explores these and other issues concerning model transformation and sketches challenges and opportunities...|$|E
40|$|Talking about {{disability}} {{requires a}} reformulation of our imagine {{of the human}} being that should include his vulnerability and constitutive dependency. Age, pathology or impairment can increase our dependency, but dependency itself is one of the defining features of any human being. At the same time, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> disability does not correspond to pathology or impairment, because it is a relational concept. in fact, disability is the reverse of functioning, which {{is the result of the}} interaction between an individual with a certain health conditions and the environment. Therefore it is not an exclusive medical nor social issue. This is the setting on which ICF, one of the WHO classification instruments (2001), is based. Thinking about human being’s constitutive dependency affects our self-understanding as members of the species; it also changes the perspective of our sight on disability. In this sense it gets clear that taking care of those who are more dependent is a matter of justice and not only of generosity. We need to rethink rights not as the claim of groups, but as human rights. Furthemore, we have to value the different capacity of individuals to transform a resource in a functioning, and to understand and respond to the need of care of those who are, in turn, dependent on the people they are taking care of...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is to {{emphasize}} the role of the state and its organizative branches in the education of minorities and their integration in the economic, social, cultural and political life as received by the other autochthon population. It is worth mentioning that the majority of states, members of international organizations, have expressed their will to accomplish their obligations towards minority population. This is not enough, because if we want to walk towards European Union in a definitive manner, we have to remind ourselves the Romanian state and the challenges about minority rights, as non negotiable conditions to European integration. Today the minorities in Albania are part of multiethnic, multi religious and multicultural society and in many cases remain anonymous. To build the rule of law, to be an educated society, a state where each individual gets value independently from the gender, religion, political ideas, ethnicity etc, we have to analyze the requests and reports of European Union on the minority rights, where the most important part related to their education. This scientific rationale presents the thesis that the state, as the primary subject can influence effectively in understanding that minority education is not just an obligation foreseen in the national legislation but also an important part of the international legislation. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the aspiration of each state to be a member of the European Union, are strictly related to minorities, as in case of Romania.

40|$|Nuruddin Farah’s Secret, {{the third}} in a suite of three novels called ‘Blood in the Sun,’ was written in Berlin in 1990. It was {{originally}} dubbed ‘Awake, When Asleep,’ an evangelical plea for social and political redemption whose idealism Farah did not walk out on but camouflaged under an uncompromising exploration. Somalia had become a nightmare and has stayed a life-long trauma for Farah himself. With the Wall collapsing outside the windows at Potsdamer Platz and the jubilant demonstrators’ catch phrase "We are the people" metamorphosing into "We are ONE people,” the novel’s title and language changed. Farah’s documentation of the collective horror of Somalia in decay, the converse of German unity (as it seemed), could only be searched through a radical literary diagnosis that shattered ‘normalcies’ that bound together family-clan, man-woman, right-wrong, sanity-insanity, God-gods-fathoms. Farah deconstructs, unveils, ruthlessly the mechanisms of patrilineal genetics, patronymics, rape, blood binds, foster children, down to their minutest, most mazelike particulars; even the interlinguas of animals. All is made transcendent. This is what the ‘secrets’ connote. Cultural taboos and religious codes of loyalty, normalcies, kill. In monologues, all the five narrators, Kaaman, Sholoongo, Yaqut, Damac and Nonno, tell stories about themselves, about each other. They do it through fables, innuendos, whispers, wrong-sayings, rumors, lies, voyeurism. As readers we have to endure Farah’s fragmented world, simply for it to make sense for us. To achieve this, his fable tells us, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> there is no secret if life is here to be lived. That the collective mystery of Somalia is a lie: no one understands why someone shoots another human being; why you eat locusts; {{that no one knows}} that God does not exist. Now, {{a quarter of a century}} later, dysfunctional Somalia is still there, unchanged, but so also, increasingly, the out of Somalia world, from Damascus in the east to Berlin and Stockholm in the north.

30|$|In other cases, the {{interviewees}} mentioned that they exercised their own agency and expected even native speaker clients/co-workers to co-construct norms and meanings with them. They didn’t consider adopting the dominant local norms (British English in UK, for example) as the preferred option. They considered {{it important to}} maintain their voice and identity, considering their professional expertise as more important than superficial markers of their English accent. ET, a physician from Zimbabwe in Sheffield, said in his emailed response: “I think because {{it is such a}} professional job, people are prepared to overlook the language issue. They would rather have an excellent physician who speaks little English than see him go to another country e.g. US. Besides, I think the patients wouldn’t mind whether the physician who treated them, saved their life, was speaking broken English or fluent English {{as long as they are}} good at what they do, that is all that matters. I think medicine and other technically demanding fields don’t really need someone to be fluent in English, as long as they can make a diagnosis that is all that matters. It’s more like football, Ronaldo didn’t speak a word of English, neither does Messi, but they are technically very good at it. Most teams now are composed of footballers from different countries who all speak different languages but they still deliver. That is what medicine is like.” Though ET uses derogatory terms like “little English,” “broken English” and lack of “fluent English” that smack of deficiency, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> he is presenting his competence from the perspective of native speakers. His email communication shows fluency, though he will probably display his own accent and idiomatic peculiarities in oral interactions. What gives ET confidence in this agentive stance is his opinion that his professional status and expertise give him a social capital that overrides perceptions of linguistic deficit. It appears that one’s status in the knowledge economy is not based on elite varieties of English alone. ET adopts the functional orientation that what should be valued is the professional’s ability to perform effectively (i.e., the ability to “deliver”) and not puristic norms of linguistic correctness.|$|E
