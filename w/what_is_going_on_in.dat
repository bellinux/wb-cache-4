5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> his head.|$|E
5|$|Makoto first appears {{when the}} cast is in sixth grade, though is in a {{different}} class. Known as Mako for short, though mostly only to Shuichi, Makoto was also assigned male at birth, but wishes {{to be a girl}} and shares Shuichi's interest in cross-dressing; it is this that spurs Makoto to become Shuichi's closest friend. Due to facial freckles and round glasses, Makoto is not able to appear as cute as Shuichi when wearing feminine clothes. Makoto's primary reason for wanting to be a girl may be due to an attraction to men, something Shuichi cannot relate to; Makoto is a romantic who wants to be in a relationship with a cool, adult man. Makoto is unusually mature and is able to think calmly and objectively while providing advice to friends. Makoto also gets along well with boys and girls of the same age, because of good listening skills; Makoto often becomes an onlooker to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> other characters' lives. Makoto is an only child whose parents run a bakery.|$|E

25|$|Jadaliyya has {{quickly become}} the go-to place for {{information}} and analysis of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Egypt and the region. Moreover, Jadaliyya {{is the place where}} writing of a kind that we associate with the best of anthropology--in the moment, grounded in theory, capturing historical transformation through engagement in events as they unfold--has been published. It seems to provide solutions to many problems we have been engaged with in anthropology -- the production of knowledge in and about the region, particularly in this time of the massive uprisings … Jadaliyya has been the place where some of the best “ethnographic” writing about the region in this time of incredible transformation and change is to be found.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, {{when all of a sudden}} a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E

25|$|None of {{the models}} {{developed}} so far succeed to explain exchange rates and volatility in the longer time frames. For shorter time frames (less than a few days), algorithms can be devised to predict prices. It is understood from the above models that many macroeconomic factors affect the exchange rates {{and in the end}} currency prices are a result of dual forces of demand and supply. The world's currency markets {{can be viewed as a}} huge melting pot: in a large and ever-changing mix of current events, supply and demand factors are constantly shifting, and the price of one currency in relation to another shifts accordingly. No other market encompasses (and distills) as much of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the world at any given time as foreign exchange.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> {{those parts of}} the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E
25|$|However, after Act I, {{the number}} and quality of Richard's asides to the {{audience}} decrease significantly, as well as multiple scenes are interspersed that do not include Richard at all, but average Citizens (ActII, SceneIII), or the Duchess of York and Clarence's children (ActII, SceneII), who are as moral as Richard is evil. Without Richard guiding the audience through the dramatic action, the audience is left to evaluate for itself <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>In</b> ActIV, SceneIV, after {{the murder of the}} two young princes and the ruthless murder of Lady Anne, the women of the play – Queen Elizabeth, the Duchess of York, and even Margaret – gather to mourn their state and to curse Richard; and it is difficult as the audience not to sympathise with them. When Richard enters to bargain with Queen Elizabeth for her daughter's hand – a scene whose form echoes the same rhythmically quick dialogue as the Lady Anne scene in Act I – he has lost his vivacity and playfulness for communication; it is obvious he is not the same man.|$|E

25|$|Understanding and {{accepting}} the psychological state {{an individual is}} in is paramount. There are many mis-conceptions {{of what it means}} for a traumatized individual to be in crisis or 'psychosis'. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and cannot comfort themselves, if treated humanely and respectfully they will not get to a state in which they are a danger. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance they will be taken seriously and not just as a sick, delusional individual. It is vital for the assessor to understand that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the traumatized persons head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., posttraumatic symptoms, dissociation, substance abuse, somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established rapport and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, abandonment issues, and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.|$|E
25|$|Both of the lovers' fates are {{interwoven}} {{yet they}} deceive {{the other in}} a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was {{a small price to pay}} to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E

500|$|Willis's review, written {{more than}} half a century past the {{original}} writing of the volume, is in some respects a gentler way of phrasing the work's immediate reception. One of Russell's contemporaries wrote: [...] "As a contribution to social science... or to the study of government, the volume is very disappointing... In this pretentious volume, Russell shows only the most superficial familiarity with progress made in the study of social phenomena or in any special field of social research, either with techniques of inquiry, or with materials assembled, or with interpretations developed... it seems doubtful that the author knows <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the world of social science." [...] (Merriam, 1939) Indeed, the very preface of the work candidly states: [...] "As usual, those who look in Russell's pronouncements for dotty opinions will be able to find a few". (Russell 1938:x) Still, some scholars, like Edward Hallet Carr, found the work of some use. (Carr 2001:131) ...|$|E
