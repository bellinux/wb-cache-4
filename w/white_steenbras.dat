50|$|The {{west coast}} {{seabream}} is a deep-bodied fish that can grow to {{a length of}} about 100 cm. The maximum recorded weight is 19.3 kg. The head is shorter than its depth, and the profile is slightly convex above the eye. There are no scales on the snout and the upper jaw is protusible. The teeth are small, with a single outer row of pointed teeth and two inner rows of small molars. The dorsal fin has eleven spines and nine to ten soft rays, and the anal fin has three spines and eight to nine soft rays. The pectoral fin is longer than the head and has fifteen to sixteen soft rays. The colour is silvery-grey with about seven faint, vertical bars which are more visible in young fish. This species could {{be confused with the}} sand steenbras (Lithognathus mormyrus), but that has a shallower body, more rays in its dorsal and anal fins, and ten to fourteen dark bars. The <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> (Lithognathus lithognathus) is also similar, but has a longer head and more slender body.|$|E
40|$|<b>White</b> <b>steenbras</b> Lithognathus lithognathus (Pisces: Sparidae) {{has been}} a major target species of {{numerous}} fisheries in South Africa, since the late 19 th century. Historically, it contributed substantially to annual catches in commercial net fisheries, and became dominant in recreational shore catches {{in the latter half of}} the 20 th century. However, overexploitation in both sectors resulted in severe declines in abundance. The ultimate collapse of the stock by the end of the last century, and the failure of traditional management measures to protect the species indicate that a new management approach for this species is necessary. The species was identified as a priority for research, management and conservation in a National Linefish Status Report. Despite knowledge on aspects of its biology and life history, little is known about juvenile habitat use patterns, home range dynamics and movement behaviour in estuaries. Similarly, the movement and migration of larger juveniles and adults in the marine environment are poorly understood. Furthermore, there is a complete lack of information on its genetic stock structure. Such information is essential for effective management of a fishery species. This thesis aimed to address the gaps in the understanding of <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> movement patterns and genetic stock structure, and provide an assessment of its current conservation status. The study adopted a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating a range of methods and drawing on available information, including published literature, unpublished reports and data from long-term monitoring programmes. Acoustic telemetry, conducted in a range of estuaries, showed high site fidelity, restricted area use, small home ranges relative to the size of the estuary, and a high level of residency within estuaries at the early juvenile life stage. Behaviour within estuaries was dominated by station-keeping, superimposed by a strong diel behaviour, presumably based on feeding and/or predator avoidance, with individuals entering the shallow littoral zone at night to feed, and seeking refuge in the deeper channel areas during the daytime. Conventional dart tagging and recapture data from four ongoing, long-term coastal fish tagging projects, spread throughout the distribution of this species, indicated high levels of residency in the surf zone at the late juvenile and sub-adult life stages. Consequently, juvenile and sub-adult <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> are vulnerable to localised depletion, although they can be effectively protected by suitably positioned estuarine protected areas (EPAs) and marine protected areas (MPAs), respectively. It has been hypothesized that adult <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> undertake large-scale coastal migrations between summer aggregation areas and winter spawning grounds. The scale of observed coastal movements was correlated with fish size (and age), with larger fish undertaking considerably longer-distance coastal movements than smaller individuals, supporting this hypothesis. Given the migratory behaviour of adults, and indications that limited spawning habitat exists, MPAs designed to protect <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> during the adult life stage should encompass all known spawning aggregation sites. The fishery is plagued by problems such as low compliance and low enforcement capacity, and alternative management measures, such as seasonal closure, need to be evaluated. Despite considerable conventional dart tagging effort around the coastline (5 782 fish tagged) with 292 recaptures there remains a lack of empirical evidence of fish migrating long distances (> 600 km) between aggregation and spawning areas. This uncertainty in the level of connectivity among coastal regions was addressed using mitochondrial DNA sequencing and genotyping of microsatellite repeat loci in the nuclear genome, which showed no evidence of major geographic barriers to gene flow in this species. Samples collected throughout the <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> core distribution showed high genetic diversity, low genetic differentiation and no evidence of isolation by distance or localised spawning. Although historically dominant in several fisheries, analysis of long-term commercial and recreational catch data for <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> indicated considerable declines and ultimately stock collapse. Improved catch-per-unit-effort in two large MPAs subsequent to closure confirmed that MPAs can be effective for the protection of <b>white</b> <b>steenbras.</b> However, the current MPA network encompasses a low proportion of sandy shoreline, for which <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> exhibits an affinity. Many MPAs do not prohibit recreational shore angling, which currently accounts for the greatest proportion of the total annual catch. Furthermore, EPAs within the juvenile distribution protect a negligible proportion of the total available surface area of estuaries – habitat on which <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> is wholly dependent. Despite some evidence of recent increases in abundance in estuaries and the surf zone in certain areas, <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> meets the criteria for “Endangered” on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and for “Protected species” status on the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act of South Africa. The species requires improved management, with consideration for its life-history style, estuarine dependency, surf zone residency, predictable spawning migrations and its poor conservation status. The multidisciplinary approach provides valuable information towards an improved scientific basis for the management of <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> and a framework for research that can be adopted for other overexploited, estuarine-associated coastal fishery species...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the economic effects of management policies on {{four of the}} seven beach-seine net fishing operations in False Bay. The effects of past regulations are examined by assessing {{whether or not this}} industry is at present profitable. It was found that under the present management policies all fishing crews are profitable. A new policy preventing fishermen from catching <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> has been introduced. This was examined and it was shown that only one of the crews examined would be effected. Two proposed policies were examined to determine their impact on the sector. The first proposal aims to remove kob as a target species, however none of the crews would be significantly effected by this proposal. The second proposal aims to restrict fishing to working days, this proposal would result in collapse of two crews. Long term feasibility was examined using three models that predict the NPV of income for each crew under different assumptions. It was shown that if stocks continue to decline and <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> remains restricted all crews except one would collapse. If stocks improve but the catching of <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> remains prohibited for IO years, one of the crews will collapse. The final section assessed the validity of a proposal that the Marine Resource Fund be used to buy trek fishermen's permits, it was concluded {{that this is not a}} feasible proposal...|$|E

40|$|Information {{pertaining}} to the commercial availability of fish species in South Africa remains sparse, {{even though it is}} crucial for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions in favour of their own well being and the well being of the environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the most commonly available fish species in South Africa by means of surveys of restaurants (n = 215) and retail outlets (n = 200) and to assess the conservation statuses of the observed species. Furthermore, the processing states in which fish were mostly sold (fresh, frozen, whole or filleted) and the quality of information available to consumers on fish at the point of sale were evaluated. Kingklip was found to be the most commonly marketed fish species in restaurants, while hake was observed most frequently in retail outlets. More than 30 % of the observed species were of conservation concern and included, amongst others, kingklip, kabeljou (kob), east- and west coast soles and geelbek. Specially-protected, illegal-to-sell fish in South Africa, such as <b>white</b> <b>steenbras,</b> white musselcracker and Natal stumpnose, were marketed in restaurants and retail outlets. This study highlighted the poor ability of fish purveyors in South Africa to provide information on the identity, origin, production method and sustainability of fish being sold. Additionally, the labelling of many packaged fish products in retail outlets was in contravention with South African regulations. Poor vendor awareness, disparate naming practices and the highly processed nature of fishery products provide an opportunity for unintentional or deliberate mislabelling of fish in South Africa. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{recruitment}} of juvenile marine fishes into the Knysna and Swartvlei estuaries was monitored over 30 months using seine, scoop and cast nets. The relative abundance, seasonality {{and growth of}} the dominant species are presented, and includes the Cape stumpnose Rhabdosargus holubi, <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> Lithognathus lithognathus, blacktail Diplodus sargus, strepie Sarpa salpa, Cape moony Monodactylus falciformis, southern mullet Liza richardsonii, groovy mullet Liza dumerilii, striped mullet Liza tricuspidens, flathead mullet Mugil cephalus, freshwater mullet Myxus capensis and leervis Lichia amia. Information on a further 12 species is also provided. Recruitment of most fish species into the Swartvlei and Knysna estuaries reaches a peak during summer, which coincides with maximum food resource availability and corresponds {{to the time when}} systems along this section of the coast are often open to the sea. Artificial winter breaching of the Swartvlei mouth has occurred in the past, and has generally led to the premature closure of the system and loss of the ‘head’ of water needed for the summer opening. This type of mouth manipulation leads to reduced availability of estuarine nursery areas for marine fishes along the southern Cape coast. Comparisons between the {{recruitment of}} juvenile fishes into the Knysna and Swartvlei estuaries indicate that higher densities of most species were recorded in the former system. This is attributed mainly {{to the fact that the}} Knysna mouth is deep, permanently open, and has a strong marine influence when compared to the shallow, narrow and seasonally closed Swartvlei mouth. However, in a regional context both Knysna and Swartvlei are large, unpolluted systems, which serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish. On this basis alone, these contrasting estuarine systems should be allocated the highest possible conservation status. Rhodes University Libraries (Digitisation) ABBYY FineReader 1...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{fisheries}} management approaches have been shown, in many instances, {{to have been}} ineffective in dealing with complex conservation concerns such as bycatch. Greater considerations for broader-scale and holistic approaches, as proposed by the 'Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries' (EAF) and the 'balanced harvesting approach', are beginning to challenge some of the negative misconceptions around bycatch, especially in small-scale fisheries. The need for a more holistic approach to {{fisheries management}}, particularly in small-scale fisheries, in South Africa is highlighted by its commitment to an EAF and the recent Small-Scale Fisheries Policy, for which the Marine living Resource Act of 1998 provides the legal framework to implement. The case study of the Olifants estuary small-scale traditional gillnet fishing community, located {{on the west coast}} of South Africa, provides a particularly relevant example of a complex fishery requiring a holistic approach. Current regulations prohibit the harvesting or retention of any bycatch species. Fisheries management worldwide and in South Africa, generally view gillnet fisheries as destructive, due to the occurrence of bycatch and {{the fact that many of}} these bycatch species are considered overexploited, which has led to numerous attempts over the years to phase out the Olifants gillnet fishery. The purpose of this study was to, firstly, use an EAF framework to contextualise the issue of bycatch in the Olifants gillnet fishery, and secondly, to identify the relative contributions of all fisheriy sectors to the four key selected linefish species caught as bycatch by the fishery. An extensive review and analysis of available secondary data, as well as primary data collected for this study, have estimated, with acknowledged limitations, the magnitude of the exploitation by all known fisheries of these species. Key information from small-scale fisher interviews and community-monitoring data highlight the capture rate of key linefish species by this fishery. This is echoed by recent landings for 2012 indicating the relative contribution of the national beache seine and gillnet fishery to the overall catch of (Elf [Pomatomus saltatrix] - 26. 94 %; Silver Kob [Argyrosomus inodorus] - 0. 88 %; White Stumpnose [Rhabdosargus globiceps] - 1. 05 % - excluding the recreational sector).

40|$|The {{collection}} of bait organisms goes hand-in-hand with shore-angling in South Africa, hence {{the level of}} bait-collection {{can be used as}} an indicator of fishing effort and vice versa. This emphasises the importance of understanding the fisheries for bait organisms. In 1998 the South African fisheries policy was revised, culminating in the Marine Living Resources Act No. 18 (1998) which supported sustainable development, equitable access to resources and stability of the industry. The policy also dealt with the needs of subsistence fishers who had previously been all but ignored. This study looks to continue in this direction by investigating the opportunities for the establishment and management implications of small-scale commercial baitfisheries in the Eastern Cape. Data were collected from eight clearly demarcated sampling areas using the roving survey method. A total of 97 survey trips were undertaken between September 2001 and April 2003 and 469 interviews were conducted on individual anglers. The data was analysed and discussed on the basis of three wider study regions and this allowed for a more accurate and focussed assessment of the fishery area and the potential for its formalisation. Recreational fishers (91. 5 %) dominated {{in each of the three}} regions surveyed. The low number of subsistence fishers encountered in this study is not a standard pattern throughout South Africa. The dominance of local residents in the shore-fishery could have an important impact on the success of a formalised baitfishery in that the greater proportion of the potential market is accessible throughout the year. Most recreational shore-anglers were middle-aged (43. 8 years ± 12. 9 years), and hence at the peak of their earning years and this may contribute towards the potential success of a small-scale commercial baitfishery. Most anglers and baitfishers were of the opinion that all South Africans owned and were responsible for managing the living marine resources. The vast majority of recreational users paid for and were in possession of valid permits and approved of the baitfishery regulations. This implies that the greater majority of users recognise that the state is the rightful custodian of the resource and is responsible for management. No subsistence users were in possession of permits. Resource users in the Gamtoos to Tsitsikamma National Park region, where the inspection rate was highest, had the best knowledge of the regulations regarding both baitfishing (67. 2 % ± 38. 8 %) and angling (79. 8 ± 21. 4 %). This substantiates the hypothesis that there is a direct correlation between knowledge of the regulations and the rate of inspection. About 475 000 angler-days/year were fished in the study area, with the highest number of angler-days recorded in or near urban and peri-urban areas. Bronze bream (65. 9 %) and dusky kob (61. 1 %) were the two most commonly targeted species, followed by <b>white</b> <b>steenbras</b> (31. 7 %), white musselcracker (31. 4 %) and blacktail (20. 2 %). A total of four purchased and 19 collected bait species was recorded during the study. Sardine, chokka and pink prawn were the most frequently encountered purchased bait. Red bait, sand prawn, mullet, siffie, sand mussel, bloodworm and saddleback were the most frequently encountered collected bait species. Sand prawn was identified as the preferred bait species for a wide range of angling species. The total quantity of bait organisms used per fishing trip was markedly less than the total amount collected per trip. The ban of off-road vehicles (ORV's) from beaches (20 January 2002) resulted in spatial shifts in angler effort in certain areas, suggesting that total effort has reduced in areas where ORV's were commonly used. Subsequent to the ban, fishers were encountered, on average, much closer to access points. The value of small-scale baitfisheries within the total study area was estimated at about R 7 million per year. Across the entire study area red bait was identified as the most valuable bait in the rock-and-surf fishery in monetary terms, while sand prawn was also important. The findings led to the conclusion that small-scale commercial baitfisheries in the study area are potentially viable. Scenarios for the establishment of baitfisheries are suggested and discussed...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Estuaries have {{received}} considerable attention from biologists in southern Africa {{in the past}} thirty years. Professor J. H. Day and the Zoology Department of the University of Cape Town have undertaken ecological surveys {{of a large number}} of estuaries of a variety of types, laying the important groundwork for more detailed studies of single species or problems. Their studies showed that the fish populations of southern African estuaries consist mainly of marine species. Why and when these species enter or leave the estuaries and whether they grow or breed in them were not established. The only relatively detailed study of a fish in southern African estuaries was that of Talbot (1955) who investigated aspects of the growth, feeding and reproduction of Rhabdosargus globiceps (Cuvier). No quantitative information has been published on any of the fish species, perhaps due to the difficulty of obtaining such data; results such as population estimates, mortality rates and growth rates are particularly unreliable when the area being investigated is in direct contact with the sea. Studies relating to even a single species of fish are hampered by immigration and emigration between estuary and sea, which make the population continuously variable. The larger estuaries are also difficult to sample adequately, especially with regard to netting, except perhaps on a very large scale using expensive commercial equipment. Along the southern African coast many of the smaller estuaries with a limited catchment area are cut off from the sea for most of the year due to erratic rainfall and longshore drift of sand. These closed or 'blind' estuaries of south eastern Africa, of which there are at least thirty in the eastern Cape Province, provide excellent areas for studying estuarine fish populations which enter when the estuary is open to the sea, but become isolated once it closes. These fish which become cut off in closed estuaries are subject to a new series of conditions. They are exposed to the wider temperature and salinity fluctuations of an estuary and they are forced to utilise the food resources of the estuary. Additionally they may be subjected to predation from piscivorous birds, and those predatory fish which are also cut off in the estuary. These factors will affect the size, mortality, and growth rates of a fish population. Since the fish are isolated no recruitment from the sea can take place, and any increase in numbers would have to come from breeding within the estuary. It is inevitable that the most numerous species should receive attention first. Rhabdosargus holubi (Steindachner) (Synonomy : Sargus holubi Stndr, Austrosparus tricuspidens Smith, Rhabdosargus tricuspidens (Smith)) (Plate 1) is one of the most abundant fish in the estuaries of the eastern Cape Province. According to Smith (1965) it is endemic to southern Africa, occurring from the Cape to Zululand, being most common between Mossel Bay and East London. It is largely replaced by Rhabdosargus sarba (Forskal) in the north of its range and by Rhabdosargus globiceps (Cuvier) in the south. Commonly called the 'flatty' or silver bream it is considered only as being of nuisance value by fishermen, seldom exceeding 30 cm in length. In this study the ecology of R. holubi was examined in relation to the closed West Kleinemond estuary which is a small 'blind' estuary typical of those found along the eastern Cape coast. The growth, mortality and population size of R. holubi in this estuary were investigated and linked where possible with predation and detailed studies into the tolerances, food, and feeding of the species. It was not known at the commencement of the study whether breeding could occur in estuaries, although Smith (1965) stated that R. holubi does breed in estuaries. During the course of the sampling programme in the West Kleinemond estuary, measurements of the growth and population structure of two other species of fish were recorded for comparison with R. holubi: the sparid Lithognathus lithognathus (Cuvier) (<b>White</b> <b>Steenbras)</b> and the piscivorous carangid Hypacanthas amia (L.) (Leervis or garrick). Laboratory studies on R. holubi were possible due to the fact that large numbers of this species could be caught in eastern Cape estuaries and transported to Grahamstown, where they could be maintained in captivity for up to four months in recirculating seawater aquaria. During the course of the study over 2000 fish were kept in captivity at different times for a variety of experiments. Another 2500 were preserved for gut analyses and lipid determinations, while over 5000 were captured, examined and released in the field...|$|E
