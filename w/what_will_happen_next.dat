5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b> For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E
500|$|The Fine Brothers {{created a}} show titled Lost: <b>What</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Happen</b> <b>Next?,</b> {{which is a}} parody show based on Lost. The show debuted on January 24, 2008, and was the [...] first long-running series on the Fine Brothers channel. The show lasted 19 episodes and ended on November 1, 2010. The show {{featured}} several characters from other fictional universes such as the Avatar and Star Wars universe. The Fine Brothers collaborated with Rhett and Link to create a parody song of Lost as well.|$|E
50|$|As a parody, {{it is kind}} of {{predictable}} knowing <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> the <b>next</b> episode. The {{only thing}} the viewer has to do is follow the political news. For example, in 2004, Andrés Manuel López Obrador had problems with the law, confronting a desafuero judge, so in the show all the trouble was parodied for months.|$|R
50|$|Patronage is {{a strong}} element of {{traditional}} Island politics, {{and has been a}} widely accepted practice for generations. Recent political discrimination rulings based on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms have put this longstanding tradition into question, however, and {{it remains to be seen}} <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> the <b>next</b> time there is a change of government (traditionally, hundreds of supporters of the old government would lose their jobs).|$|R
50|$|GT Time - A weekly podcast show {{hosted by}} Kyle Bosman, {{in which a}} panel discuss the latest video game related news stories and make bets about <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> during the <b>next</b> week. Ended on February 2016.|$|R
500|$|Having {{previously}} {{discovered that}} his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) was faking her pregnancy, Will tells her he no longer {{feels the same way}} he did when they first fell in love. He later attends Ken and Emma's delayed wedding, only to find that Ken has ended the relationship as a result of Emma's feelings for Will. She announces her intention to leave McKinley High School, explaining that it will be too painful for her to carry on working with Will and Ken. Back at school, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) suspends cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) for leaking the glee club's set list, and has Will reinstated as the director of New Directions. The glee club members show Will their trophy and perform [...] "My Life Would Suck Without You" [...] for him. As Emma prepares to leave the school, Will chases after her and stops her with a kiss. Both are happy, but uncertain of <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Chahi, he was {{inspired}} by his 1999 trip to Mount Yasur's crater in Vanuatu. The scenery, {{and the power of}} the volcano, which was extremely active at the time, fascinated and scared him. Chahi, still intending to make another video game [...] "before [...] died", hoped that his next project could convey the: [...] "ambivalence of Nature, beautiful and potentially violent at the same time". Becoming more and more interested in the world's natural forces, Chahi went on to visit different volcanoes, including Dolomieu crater on Reunion Island, and a volcano in the Indian Ocean. Once the development was underway, Montpellier even recorded audio from a real volcano for inclusion in the game. Nature and cycle were some of the most important key elements of the game. The team intended to create different cycles and loops that would result in different kinds of interaction between the environments. For example, the tide cycle and eruption cycle changes dynamically, and it impacts the growth of plants and the lives of the villagers. According to Chahi, the cycle allows players to anticipate <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
500|$|It is {{considered}} to have [...] "one of the most shocking twists on Black Mirror", as Jenelle Riley of Variety puts it, some time before the third series started. Writing before the third series, Margaret Lyons of The New York Times said it is [...] "the most outright disturbing" [...] episode of Black Mirror. Right after it aired, Cocks deemed it [...] "the single darkest episode of Black Mirror so far" [...] and considered its twist to be [...] "nothing short of genius". Sims stated that it [...] "is, by a significant margin, the most disturbing episode Black Mirror has produced". Although he praised the twist as [...] "a smart one, brilliantly concealed and smartly revealed," [...] he criticized it because [...] "once the point is made, it is made over and over again." [...] Lambie praised its [...] "fearsome pace" [...] and highlighted [...] "its subtle approach", with sparse dialogue, that gives [...] "the events and performances greater impact". He concluded: [...] "its horror-infused drama leaves us unsure whom we can trust or <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next,</b> and its last act is truly gut-wrenching". Monahan wrote that the twist was unpredictable and the episode [...] "was an exciting and efficient piece of narrative rug-pulling".|$|E

25|$|Each {{day three}} videos from the {{internet}} are shown, they are unusual and often not sports related.

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} launch, Ian Bogost {{describes}} Play the News as [...] "very casual", and fears {{that it can}} be summarised as simple quizzes. He claims that the game has some potential to engage people with news, [...] "by making them think about <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next</b> and by creating a natural reason to read stories one otherwise might not". The game won in May 2009 the first [...] "Knight News Game Awards", awarded by the association Games for Change. It rewards [...] "news game", games that [...] "enhances people's ability to make decisions in a democracy".|$|E
2500|$|This episode, {{which comes}} {{right after the}} first strophe of the {{narration}} (no. 19 of Canto I) and depicts the entry of the caravan of carracks in the poem, sailing into the unknown upon the sheet of white foam of the Indian Ocean, has huge significance {{in the organization of}} the poem. The gods of the four corners of the world are reunited to talk about [...] "the future matters of the East" [...] ("as cousas futuras do Oriente"); in fact, {{what they are going to}} decide is whether the Portuguese will be allowed to reach India and <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{the group}} issued their second album In Case We Die {{on their own}} Tailem Bend label. It {{featured}} guest appearances by local musicians and was produced by The Carbohydrates (James Cecil and Cameron Bird's production duo) in Cecil's Super Melody World studio, now {{set up in a}} large garage space in Melbourne's inner northern suburbs. It was mixed by Tony Espie (The Avalanches, New Buffalo, Robert Palmer), at 001 Studios in Melbourne. Cyclic Defrosts Vaughan Healey described a typical gig as [...] "a bewildering ride through dynamic tempo changes, finger clicks and swapped instruments. You never really know who is going to sing or <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next,</b> and somehow the eight-piece juggles this anarchic structure with a music class worth of instruments and staging rearrangements." ...|$|E
30|$|Remark 9 This {{behavioral}} hypothesis may {{be justified}} by {{considering that the}} future development of an allocation cannot be predicted for exactly.

60|$|This book is well-written {{and carries}} the reader {{right up to}} the last chapter, always panting to know <b>what</b> ever <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b> It {{describes}} a journey across central South America, at about the latitude of Buenos Aires in Argentina. Lots of different sorts of nasty happenings, and nasty people are encountered, and the problems are overcome one by one. It seems quite realistic, but at anyrate it is a good product of the writer's imagination and research. I enjoyed transcribing it very much.|$|R

The places for the believers in the hereafter are known as Paradise and for the non-believers as Hell.|$|R
50|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game is Steve Keene, a man {{fashioned}} as a wisecracking secret agent.

House then drags Cameron, Foreman, and Chase out of the party to perform a differential diagnosis. Drawing up a list of all of Esther's symptoms, House is able to predict <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> to Ian <b>next,</b> as well as {{how long it will take}} him to get there.|$|R
