Rachel's two fathers Hiram and LeRoy Berry (Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell), along with Finn's mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) and his step-father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), act very supportive and arrange for the couple to spend the night together in Rachel's room, expecting that the reality of having to live together <b>will</b> <b>encourage</b> the teens to postpone their wedding. The ruse backfires, and the engaged pair announce that they will be getting married even sooner than planned.|$|E
5|$|Planning, before food shopping, {{and knowing}} what {{purchases}} are necessary is among ways of reducing food waste; buy one, get one free (BOGOF) offers have been criticised for encouraging customers to purchase food {{items that are}} eventually thrown away; {{as part of its}} own campaign on food waste, supermarket retailer Morrisons is to offer “One Free to Freeze” as a replacement for BOGOFs, with hopes that these promotions <b>will</b> <b>encourage</b> customers to plan ahead.|$|E

5|$|The bridge {{opened on}} 17December 2015, with a bridge walk, in which Sheet Harbour {{residents}} {{walked across the}} old bridge to commemorate its closure, then walked back across the new bridge signifying its opening. That same day, the new bridge was opened for pedestrians, and open to traffic the following day. The new bridge has a projected lifespan of at least 75years, until 2090. It also has a sidewalk, which connects to Sheet Harbour's current sidewalk system. Officials hope this <b>will</b> <b>encourage</b> active transportation.|$|E

50|$|In {{a lengthy}} flashback, it is {{revealed}} that Will and Deanna met when Will was stationed on Betazed between assignments, {{and while there}} attended a wedding at which Deanna was maid of honor. Will was instantly attracted to her and began to pursue her, though she initially rebuffed his advances, {{feeling that he was}} only interested in her physical attributes, and that he preferred quick, thrilling encounters over meaningful emotional intimacy. Over a series of meetings, however, they began to grow closer, as <b>Will</b> <b>encouraged</b> Deanna to embrace impulsive feelings and Deanna <b>encouraged</b> <b>Will</b> to explore his more spiritual side.|$|R
25|$|A central anti-copyright {{argument}} is that copyright is not beneficial to society and instead serves to enrich a few {{at the expense of}} creativity and widespread accessibility of works. The classic argument for copyright is that granting creators temporary monopolies over works—giving them an income <b>will</b> <b>encourage</b> producing future works as well.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the present}} {{situation}} has resulted in severe traffic problems on the bridge itself and in Menlo Park and East Palo Alto, Caltrans {{has been unable to}} upgrade the relevant portion of Highway 84 to freeway standards for several decades, due to opposition from the cities of Menlo Park, Atherton and Palo Alto. Freeway opponents fear that upgrading Highway 84 <b>will</b> <b>encourage</b> more people to live in southern Alameda County (where housing is more affordable) and commute to jobs in the mid-Peninsula area (where businesses wish to be located in order to be close to Silicon Valley), thus increasing traffic in their neighborhoods to the south and west of U.S. 101.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, MSU {{accepted}} {{its first}} class of {{students for the}} Residential College in Arts & Humanities. Founded October 21, 2005, the college provides around 600 undergraduates with an individualized curriculum in the liberal, visual and performing arts. Though all the students will graduate with the same degree, MSU <b>will</b> <b>encourage</b> students in the college {{to get a second}} degree or specialization. The new college will be MSU's fourth residential college, after James Madison College, the Lyman Briggs School, and the now-defunct Justin Morrill College. Although early proposals named the college after Nelson Mandela, university officials have not decided on a permanent name , saying that it is still too early to fix a permanent name to the college.|$|E
25|$|In many countries, {{local and}} {{national}} government often refuse to recognize slums, because the slum are on disputed land, or because of the fear that quick official recognition <b>will</b> <b>encourage</b> more slum formation and seizure of land illegally. Recognizing and notifying slums often triggers a creation of property rights, and requires that the government provide public services and infrastructure to the slum residents. With poverty and informal economy, slums do not generate tax revenues {{for the government and}} therefore tend to get minimal or slow attention. In other cases, the narrow and haphazard layout of slum streets, houses and substandard shacks, along with persistent threat of crime and violence against infrastructure workers, makes it difficult to layout reliable, safe, cost effective and efficient infrastructure. In yet others, the demand far exceeds the government bureaucracy's ability to deliver.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that it is very}} {{difficult}} to eliminate the optimistic bias; however, some people believe that trying to reduce the optimistic bias <b>will</b> <b>encourage</b> people to adapt to health-protective behaviors. Some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias cannot be reduced, and that by trying to reduce the optimistic bias the end result was generally even more optimistically biased. In a study of four different tests to reduce the optimistic bias, researchers found that regardless of the attempts to reduce the bias, through lists of risk factors, participants perceiving themselves as inferior to others, participants asked to think of high-risk individuals, and giving attributes of why they were at risk, all increased the bias rather than decreased it. Although studies have tried to reduce the optimistic bias through reducing distance, overall, the optimistic bias still remains.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} a wine region will largely dictate whether Chenin blanc is {{produced}} in a predominately sweet or dry manner, while the vineyard soil type will generally influence the overall style of the wine. Heavy clay based soils, paired with the right climate, is favorable {{to the development of}} weighty, botrytized dessert wines that need time to age and mature. Well-drained and less organic, predominately sandy soils tend to produce lighter styles of wine that mature more quickly. Chenin blanc planted in soils with a high silex content will produce wines with distinctive minerally notes, while limestone based soils <b>will</b> <b>encourage</b> wines with sharp acidity. In Vouvray the soil is predominately argilo-calcaire or calcareous clay, which produces rounded wines with both acidity and weight. In areas where schist is plentiful in the soil, Chenin blanc grapes will generally ripen earlier than in vineyards with predominately clay based soils.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Gillard {{government}} {{implemented a}} carbon price of $23 per tonne {{to be paid}} by 300 liable entities representing the highest business emitters in Australia. The carbon price will increase to $25.40 per tonne by 2014–15, and then will be set by the market from 1 July 2015 onwards. It is expected {{that in addition to}} encouraging efficient use of electricity, pricing carbon <b>will</b> <b>encourage</b> investment in cleaner renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Treasury modelling has projected that with a carbon price, energy from the renewables sector is likely to reach 40 percent of supply by 2050. Analysis of the first 6months of operation of the carbon tax have shown {{that there has been a}} drop in carbon emissions by the electricity sector. It has been observed that there has been a change in the mix of energy over this period, with less electricity being sourced from coal and more being produced by renewables such as hydro and wind power. The government at the time presented this analysis as an indicator that their policies to promote cleaner energy are working. The carbon pricing legislation was repealed by the Tony Abbott-led Australian Government on 17 July 2014. Since then, carbon emissions from the electricity sector have increased.|$|E
