5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended {{over a long period of}} time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing from}} Whitlam, Kerr called Fraser. According to Fraser, Kerr {{asked him whether}} he, if {{commissioned}} Prime Minister, could secure supply, <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and investigations of the Whitlam Government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those questions were asked {{later in the day}} before Kerr commissioned Fraser as Prime Minister. According to Kerr, Fraser was supposed to come to Yarralumla at 1.00pm.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E
5|$|If the Spanish monarch ever refused in {{conscience}} {{to grant}} royal assent, a procedure {{similar to the}} Belgian handling of King Baudouin's objection {{would not be possible}} under the current constitution. If the sovereign were ever declared incapable of discharging royal authority, his or her powers would not be transferred to the Cabinet, pending the parliamentary appointment of a regency. Instead, the constitution mandates the next person of age in the line of succession <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> become regent. Therefore, had Juan Carlos followed the Belgian example in 2005 or 2010, a declaration of incapacity would have transferred power to Felipe, then the heir apparent.|$|E

5|$|Indiana was {{the first}} of the country's western states to {{mobilize}} for the Civil War. When news reached Indiana of the attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861, many Indiana residents were surprised, but their response was immediate. On the following day, two mass meetings were held in Indianapolis, the state capital of Indiana, and the state's position was decided: Indiana would remain in the Union and <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> contribute men to suppress the rebellion. On April 15, Indiana's governor, Oliver P. Morton, issued a call for volunteer soldiers to meet the state's quota set by President Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|On November 7, Ralston {{called a}} meeting with company and union leaders to begin {{negotiations}} to resolve the strike. The temporary solution was that all workers {{who had not been}} involved in violence could return to work, the company would raise wages by five percent, recognize the union, guarantee a minimum weekly salary, and Thorpe and national union leaders <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> leave the state. The union and company agreed to later submit all grievances to the Indiana Public Service Commission for arbitration, and agreed that their decisions would be final. The arrangement was submitted to a workers' vote and was approved unanimously; the strike ended at 6:00 pm.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It {{remains to be seen}} if, with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E

5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he {{knew he was going to}} get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E
5|$|Twice in May 1940 Churchill {{broached}} {{the subject of}} bringing Lloyd George into the government. Each time Chamberlain indicated that due to their longtime antipathy he <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> retire if Lloyd George were appointed a minister. Churchill did not appoint Lloyd George, but brought up the subject with Chamberlain again early in June. This time, Chamberlain agreed to Lloyd George's appointment provided Lloyd George gave a personal assurance to put aside the feud. However, Lloyd George declined to serve in Churchill's government.|$|E
5|$|A four-lane {{bridge is}} {{estimated}} to cost NOK2 billion. It could either be located immediately north of the current bridge, or south of Norwegian Talc. The traffic from Askøy, along County Road 562, connects with National Road 555 at Storavatnet. Without a bypass, the increased capacity from Sotra would not be achieved without expanding the motorway from Storavatnet to the city center. In 2010, an alternative was launched whereby a four-lane bridge would be built south of Norwegian Talc, and <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> run into a tunnel and connect to the current motorway at Liavatnet. This is the planned intersection between National Road 555 and County Road 557 (Ring Road West), which would result in traffic from Sotra towards southern Bergen would not take up capacity on the current 555 motorway until after traffic from both Sotra and Askøy heading towards southern Bergen have had a possibility to head onto County Road 557.|$|E

5|$|Approval {{was given}} on 26 January 1973 for {{full-scale}} {{development of the}} AWACS system. To allow further development of the aircraft's systems, orders were placed for three preproduction aircraft, {{the first of which}} performed its maiden flight in February 1975. To save costs, the endurance requirements were relaxed, allowing the new aircraft to retain the four JT3D (US Military designation TF33) engines. IBM and Hazeltine were selected to develop the mission computer and display system. The IBM computer receiving the designation 4PI, and the software is written in JOVIAL. A Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) or back-up interceptor control (BUIC) operator <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> be at home with the track displays and tabular displays, but differences in symbology would create compatibility problems in tactical ground radar systems in Iceland, Europe, and Korea over Link-11 (TADIL-A).|$|E
5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within a {{well-established}} franchise, Starbreeze tried {{to retain the}} essence of the world and rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1942 and November 1943, Groves paid monthly {{visits to}} the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Reports {{indicated}} that compared to the alternatives of a gaseous diffusion plant or a plutonium-producing nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic plant would take longer and require more scarce materials to build, and need more manpower and more electricity to operate. The cost of a kilogram of fissile material would therefore be much greater. On the other hand, while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles, the electromagnetic process was proven to work, and could be built in stages that <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> start producing fissile material. Groves cancelled the pilot plant on 14 November, in favor of proceeding immediately with the production plant.|$|E

5|$|Following further {{speculation}} {{over her}} leadership, on 26 June a rumour emerged that supporters of Kevin Rudd were collecting signatures for a letter demanding an immediate leadership vote. That afternoon, before any letter had been published, Gillard called a leadership spill live on television. She challenged any would-be opponent {{to join her}} in a pledge that, while the winner would become leader, the loser <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> retire from politics. Despite his earlier comments {{that he would not}} return to the leadership under any circumstances, Kevin Rudd announced that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost. In the party-room ballot later that evening, Rudd defeated Gillard by a margin of 57 votes to 45.|$|E
5|$|Following Blackburn's relegation, it was rumoured that Robinson <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> {{return to}} the top flight, with Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United said to be interested, however no move materialized. Speculation {{continued}} over Robinson's future throughout the season, with Brad Friedel being rumoured to be returning to the club (a rumour he denied), further fuelled by Robinson being dropped in December for a match against Blackpool in favour of Jake Kean, with Robinson having played every match {{at that point in}} the season. However, following the match against Blackpool, Robinson did not make any further appearances, with Kean taking the goalkeeper position, fuelling further rumours that Robinson could leave, and Robinson was made available for loan in February. In March, Robinson was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season with a back injury; however, in April, he suffered complications, and was ruled out for six months as a result of a pulmonary embolism following his surgery. He finished the season having made 21 league appearances for the club.|$|E
5|$|By early May, 1st Airborne Division {{had been}} brought up to strength, albeit mainly with inexperienced replacements. 4th Parachute Brigade had been disbanded and its battalions merged with those of 1st Parachute Brigade in the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Arnhem. It was replaced by 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade. The Norwegian Parachute Company was also attached to the 1st Airborne Division. However, on 4 May, Urquhart was ordered to despatch 1st Independent Polish Brigade to Dunkirk, and to detach 1st Parachute Brigade from the division; one of the brigade's battalions <b>would</b> <b>immediately</b> be transported to Denmark for occupation duties, with the rest of the Brigade remaining in Britain as a reserve formation. At the same time the rest of the division was warned that it would be soon be transported by air to Norway as part of the occupation force, with the Special Air Service Brigade being temporarily attached to the division to replace 1st Parachute Brigade. Urquhart informed Thorne that the division could be ready for deployment in 48 hours, far less time than Thorne and his staff had expected. When it entered Norway, the division would be responsible for maintaining law and order in the areas it occupied, ensuring that German units followed the terms of their surrender, securing and then protecting captured airfields, and finally preventing the sabotage of essential military and civilian structures. To achieve this, the division would be formed of three brigades: 1st Airlanding Brigade, Special Air Service Brigade and an ad hoc Artillery Brigade formed from divisional troops.|$|E
