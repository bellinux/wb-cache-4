40|$|As part of {{a larger}} body of work aimed at {{developing}} mathematical models of the <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> magnetic separator in dense medium separation, four factorial experiments, each of sixteen trials, were carried out using magnetite feed to such a separator. This work was done in a purpose built rig based on a small industrial scale (700 mm lip length, 900 mm diameter) <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> magnetic separator. The magnetite lost in these trials, that is reporting to the effluent, was universally found to be of lower susceptibility than the feed, but was commonly found to be coarser than the feed. These observations are explained in terms of a conceptual model of the mechanism by which magnetic material is captured. This explanation is supported by both magnetic theory and high speed photography. It is proposed that the capture of magnetic particles in the <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> magnetic separator is by a flocculation process which proceeds rapidly at high pulp density, but only very slowly with low pulp density feeds...|$|R

40|$|Loss of {{magnetic}} medium solids from dense medium circuits {{is a substantial}} contributor to operating cost. Much of this loss is by way of <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> magnetic separator effluent. A model of the separator would be useful for process design, optimisation and control. A {{review of the literature}} established that although various rules of thumb exist, largely based on empirical or anecdotal evidence, there is no model {{of magnetic}}s recovery in a <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> magnetic separator which includes as inputs all significant machine and operating variables. A series of trials, in both factorial experiments and in single variable experiments, was therefore carried out using a purpose built rig which featured a small industrial scale (700 mm lip length, 900 mm diameter) <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> magnetic separator. A substantial data set of 191 trials was generated in the work. The results of the factorial experiments were used to identify the variables having a significant effect on magnetics recovery. Observations carried out as an adjunct to this work, as well as magnetic theory, suggests that the capture of magnetic particles in the <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> magnetic separator is by a flocculation process. Such a process should be defined by a flocculation rate and a flocculation time; the latter being defined by the volumetric flowrate and the volume within the separation zone. A model based on this concept and containing adjustable parameters was developed. This model was then fitted to a randomly chosen 80 % of the data, and validated by application to the remaining 20 %. The model is shown to provide a satisfactory fit to the data over three orders of magnitude of magnetics loss. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science BY. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Biochar {{has shown}} {{potential}} as a soil amendment, but is a fine powder {{that is difficult to}} handle and would be blown away if applied to soils without modifications. <b>Wet</b> <b>drum</b> granulation of cornstalk biochar using binder solutions of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was initially investigated, establishing that biochar could be granulated into a form that would be easier to handle and apply effectively to the soil. Biochars from three different feedstocks were then tested along with three binder solutions. The biochar granules were free flowing and relatively strong with a significant yield between a size range of 1 to 4 mm. The binder concentration, total binder solution volume and drum rotational speed affected both the optimal granule size yield and granule strength to different extents depending on the biochar and binder combination. The research showed that biochar could be granulated using <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> granulation with adjustment of process parameters to ensure production of granules with specified properties...|$|R

40|$|Low {{concentrate}} density from <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> magnetic separators {{in dense}} medium circuits can cause operating difficulties due to inability {{to obtain the}} required circulating medium density and, indirectly, high medium solids losses. The literature is almost silent on the processes controlling concentrate density. However, the common name for the region through which concentrate is discharged-the squeeze pan gap-implies that some extrusion process {{is thought to be}} at work. There is no model of magnetics recovery in a <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> magnetic separator, which includes as inputs all significant machine and operating variables. A series of trials, in both factorial experiments and in single variable experiments, was done using a purpose built rig which featured a small industrial scale (700 mm lip length, 900 turn diameter) <b>wet</b> <b>drum</b> magnetic separator. A substantial data set of 191 trials was generated in this work. The results of the factorial experiments were used to identify the variables having a significant effect on magnetics recovery. It is proposed, based both on the experimental observations of the present work and on observations reported in the literature, that the process controlling magnetic separator concentrate density is one of drainage. Such a process should be able to be defined by an initial moisture, a drainage rate and a drainage time, the latter being defined by the volumetric flowrate and the volume within the drainage zone. The magnetics can be characterised by an experimentally derived ultimate drainage moisture. A model based on these concepts and containing adjustable parameters was developed. This model was then fitted to a randomly chosen 80 % of the data, and validated by application to the remaining 20 %. The model is shown to be a good fit to data over concentrate solids content values from 40 % solids to 80 % solids and for both magnetite and ferrosilicon feeds. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

50|$|In modern steel <b>drum</b> <b>mills</b> the {{grinding}} process takes about 20 minutes. After grinding, the paste is stirred slowly for another 20 to 30 {{minutes in a}} particular container (malaxation), where the microscopic oil drops unite into bigger drops, which facilitates the mechanical extraction. The paste is then pressed by centrifugation/ the water is thereafter separated from {{the oil in a}} second centrifugation as described before.The oil produced by only physical (mechanical) means as described above is called virgin oil. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria (low free acidity, no or very little organoleptic defects). A higher grade extra virgin olive oil is mostly dependent on favourable weather conditions; a drought during the flowering phase, for example, can result in a lower quality (virgin) oil. It is worth noting that olive trees produce well every couple of years so greater harvests occur in alternate years (the year in-between is when the tree yields less). However the quality is still dependent on the weather.|$|R

The results of the experiment suggest that rate of biomass production and NPK uptake were highest during panicle initiation to first flowering stages for the tested variety CO 47 and LCC based N management have effectively saved the N fertilizer. The lack of difference in soil available nutrient between LCC based treatments and conventional blanket N treatment suggest that LCC based N management could be best option for farmers to save fertilizer N besides maintaining soil fertility. The results suggest further scope to standardise the LCC based N management for different intensively cultivated cultivars at specific location and season...|$|R

5000|$|Big Star's Third {{began with}} Stamey, who had collaborated with Big Star's Alex Chilton {{in the late}} 70s. In 2005, working with Cat's Cradle owner Frank Heath, Stamey {{recruited}} a group of musicians for a performance of Elliot Smith's Either/Or. Several weeks later, Heath and Stamey discussed a performance of Third/Sister Lovers using a similar model. Stamey subsequently tracked down Carl Marsh, who had orchestrated Third/Sister Lovers. Marsh volunteered to write out the scores to replace the originals, which had been lost, but needed the original multitracked recordings of the album to do so. Five years later, at Heath's urging, Stamey spoke to John Fry at Ardent Studios, where Third/Sister Lovers was recorded. Fry agreed to make some of the original multitracks available so that the written music could be accurately rewritten, and the unwritten parts deciphered, and, after speaking to Stephens -- who then managed Ardent Studios -- Stamey planned a trip to discuss the project with the reconfigured Big Star, who were rehearsing for a SXSW performance. The night before the meeting, on March 17, 2010, Chilton {{died of a heart}} attack. [...] With the support of Chilton's widow, Stephens, and Ardent, the plans for the Third/Sister Lovers concert moved forward. The inaugural performance of Big Star's Third took place on December 10th at the Cat's Cradle, with Stephens on <b>drums,</b> <b>Mills</b> on bass, and Easter and Stamey on guitar.
