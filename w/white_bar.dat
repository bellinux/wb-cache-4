5|$|The European {{storm petrel}} can be {{distinguished}} from related Western Palaearctic species by the <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> on its underwing and its distinctive fluttering flight. Compared to Leach's storm petrel, band-rumped storm petrel, and the recently described Monteiro's storm petrel, it is also smaller, darker, shorter-winged and has a square tail. Wilson's storm petrel lacks an underwing bar, and has long legs with the feet visible beyond the tail.|$|E
5|$|The ruff has a {{distinctive}} gravy boat appearance, {{with a small}} head, medium-length bill, longish neck and pot-bellied body. It has long legs that are variable in colour but usually yellow or orange. In flight, it has a deeper, slower wing stroke than other waders of a similar size, and displays a thin, indistinct <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> on the wing, and white ovals {{on the sides of}} the tail.|$|E
5|$|Generally duller and paler, {{the female}} {{has a more}} uniform and paler blue face, with highly {{contrasting}} cream bare skin around the eye. It lacks the red shoulder band, and the blue shoulder markings are darker and less distinct. The throat and chest are pale green and the belly is yellow. The upper mandible is paler brown-grey with a darker tip, and has been recorded as black while nesting. The lower mandible is pale grey to almost white. When flying, the female has a broad <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> visible on the underwing.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{different}} {{interpretations of the}} arms, <b>white</b> (silver) <b>bars</b> started {{to be replaced by}} blue bars somewhere {{at the end of the}} 18th century. Beginning with the 18th century some arms interpretations started to show <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> being decorated with blue template lines within them until the end of the 18th century when arms with fully blue bars started to appear. In the State Archive of Dubrovnik there is a map of Dubrovnik Republic (1747) made by Mihajlo Pešić. On the lower end of the map the arms of the Republic are visible showing red and <b>white</b> <b>bars,</b> with the <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> being richly decorated with blue template lines within them.|$|R
50|$|The {{speckled}} earless lizard is {{an overall}} gray-brown in color, {{with black and}} white speckling all along its back, with a solid gray-brown underside. It has distinct black and <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> immediately preceding the hind legs. Males {{tend to have a}} blue coloration to the <b>white</b> <b>bars,</b> whereas females do not. Like all species of earless lizards, it has no external ear openings.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} like a darker version of the {{widespread}} shikra, but all plumages have a dark vertical throat stripe. The adult male besra has dark blue-grey upperparts, and is <b>white,</b> <b>barred</b> reddish below. The larger female is browner above than the male. The juvenile is dark brown above and <b>white,</b> <b>barred</b> with brown below. It has a barred tail.|$|R
25|$|Lyn's home colours are red {{and white}} shirts and blue shorts. The shirts have red sleeves and a red front with a broad, {{vertical}} <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> in the middle, which is traditionally twice {{as wide as the}} sides (a 25-50-25 red-white-red pattern). The back has the same pattern, with inverted colours.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the black and <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> stripes in 1910, the GTFC kits have featured exclusively red, black and white. The only exceptions to this are the corporate colours used in a sponsor logo and the yellow/gold trim used between 2001 and 2003. The official GTFC club logo first appeared on the club kit in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Continuing on, Seven Lakes Drive {{begins to}} {{parallel}} the <b>White</b> <b>Bar</b> Trail as both {{head to the}} northeast through the rugged, forested terrain of the park. Eventually, the <b>White</b> <b>Bar</b> Trail splits from the parkway and proceeds to the north while Seven Lakes Drive remains on a generally northeasterly track. Stony Brook reaches its source at Lake Sebago, {{the first of the}} seven lakes the road passes, where the Tuxedo–Mount Ivy Trail briefly follows the parkway before turning off to the east. The highway runs along the southeastern shore of Lake Sebago for just over , passing a lakeside parking area and a ski trail. Past the lake, Seven Lakes Drive makes a slight turn to the north before intersecting with the Lake Welch Parkway by way of an elongated traffic circle. The road reverts to a northeasterly routing past the junction, briefly paralleling the Rockland–Orange county line as it runs past Lake Kanawauke's southeastern edge. Seven Lakes Drive crosses the county line near the lake's midpoint.|$|E
5000|$|Southern birds, S. r. daggetti, have <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> on {{the back}} and a pale belly.|$|R
50|$|Prominent {{black and}} <b>white</b> cross <b>bars</b> are present {{throughout}} the body. Black bars are paired {{and make the}} margins for the <b>white</b> <b>bars.</b> Parietal strip present. Dorsal color bright red on nape and becomes fade to tail. Midbody scale rows 13. Ventrals 174. Subcaudals 139.|$|R
50|$|The Saxon Monk {{comes in}} five colors {{including}} blue, black, red, yellow and silver with <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> or spangles.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally {{the club}} wears a {{predominantly}} navy blue jersey with white butcher stripes (irregular hoops), although {{for a time}} they wore an all-navy blue jersey with a thick <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> through the middle. The numbers {{on the backs of}} the players' jerseys were normally red on a white background, although, depending on the jersey design being used, they were sometimes white on a blue background.|$|E
25|$|Males in nuptial plumage are {{distinguished}} from green-winged teals by the horizontal white scapular stripe, {{the lack of}} a vertical <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> at the breast sides, and the quite conspicuous light outlines of the face patch, which are indistinct in the green-winged teal drake. Males in eclipse plumage, females and immatures are best recognised by their small size, calls, and the speculum; they are hard to tell apart from the green-winged teal however.|$|E
25|$|The racing stripe {{is borne}} by Coast Guard cutters, aircraft, and many boats. Red-hulled {{icebreaker}} cutters and most HH-65/MH-65 helicopters (i.e., {{those with a}} red fuselage) bear a narrow <b>white</b> <b>bar,</b> a narrow blue bar, and broad CG red bar, with the Coast Guard shield centered. Conversely, black-hulled cutters (such as buoy tenders and inland construction tenders) use the standard racing stripe. Auxiliary vessels maintained by the Coast Guard also carry the Racing Stripe, but in inverted colors (i.e., broad blue stripe with narrow white and CG red stripes) and the Auxiliary shield.|$|E

50|$|Fish {{that are}} {{generally}} blackish {{except for the}} three <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> {{are associated with the}} host anemone Stichodactyla mertensii, Mertens' carpet sea anemone.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm. The forewings are bronzy-brown with two erect yellowish <b>white</b> <b>bars.</b> The hindwings are whitish costally at the base.|$|R
25|$|Female upperside tawny, veins black. Forewing: the dorsal margin broadly black; the apical area {{beyond a}} line curving from the tornus, round {{apex of the}} cell and a little beyond it, {{to the base of}} the costa also black, the wing crossed preapically by a conspicuous, broad, oblique <b>white</b> <b>bar,</b> and three sub{{terminal}} white spots. Hindwing: dorsal margin dusky; terminal broadly, costal margin more narrowly, black; a subterminal series of four white spots. Underside tawny, with markings similar to those in the male; the pale whitish markings more extensive; the dorsal margin broadly without striae.|$|E
25|$|A red and <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> {{across the}} bottom of the screen {{indicates}} battle advantage. Where the red and white portions of the bar meet indicates which duelist has the advantage. The closer the meeting point is to a duelist, the worse they are doing. When the player properly performs a blocking move, or strikes the enemy, the bar shifts towards the opponent, indicating that he has lost advantage. The duelist with more advantage can attack faster, while the duelist with less advantage attacks slower. Also, a failed attack has the chance of disorienting the attacker, causing them to become even slower for a short time.|$|E
25|$|Just {{east of the}} Stony Brook bridge, the Pine Meadow Trail {{begins on}} the {{southeast}} side of the highway. The road loosely parallels Stony Brook as it heads deeper into the park and serves the Reeves Meadow Visitor Center. The center is also a trailhead for the Reeves Brook Trail, with the Pine Meadow Trail passing the facility on its southeast side. Past the visitor center, the parallel alignments of Seven Lakes Drive and Johnsontown Road {{come to an end}} as the latter ends at a cul-de-sac adjacent to the former. The dead end serves as the trailhead for two hiking trails: the Blue Disc Trail, which starts just before the cul-de-sac; and the <b>White</b> <b>Bar</b> Trail, which begins at the cul-de-sac's northern end. Not far from this point, the Kakiat Trail crosses Seven Lakes Drive on its way toward Kakiat County Park.|$|E
60|$|His wings {{were black}} and gray with two <b>white</b> <b>bars.</b> He {{was a little}} smaller than Fidget the Myrtle Warbler and quite as restless.|$|R
25|$|It is a {{medium-sized}} and almost flightless rail with short wings and tail, olive-brown upperparts, black underparts with <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> {{and a red}} bill and legs.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> {{across the}} front of the navy blue jersey was {{introduced}} in order to bring it further in line with the WP brand ...|$|R
25|$|Dry-season brood: Very {{similar to}} the wet-season brood, but the forewing on the upperside bears a large, oval, obliquely-placed conical patch that extends {{from the middle of}} the dorsal margin to vein 4. In certain {{specimens}} this <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> or patch is continued on to the hindwing. Underside: similar to that of the wet-season form but all the markings broader, coarser, more prominent. Forewing: costa and apex in some specimens broadly shaded with diffuse fuscous brown; the outer postdiscal brown line formed into a series of lunules that extend outwards slenderly along the veins and join the anticiliary brown line, thus enclosing in the interspaces a series of spots of the white ground colour, each of which is centred with a black or dark brown subtriangular spot. Hindwing: the terminal markings modified as on the forewing; the spot in interspace 3 of the subterminal series larger and more prominent than the others, the large subcostal black spot often broken by an anterior and a posterior silvery spot superposed on it. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in specimens of the wet-season brood but slightly darker above.|$|E
25|$|The general colour of the upperparts is pearl grey, tinged {{brownish}} {{towards the}} east of its Eurasian range. The cheeks and chin {{as well as a}} thin and often hard-to-see stripe above the eye are white, and a deep black mask extends from the beak through the eye to the ear coverts; the area immediately above the beak is grey. The scapulars (shoulder feathers) are white, and the wings are black with a <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> made up by the bases of the primary remiges, continuing slightly offset onto the bases of the secondary remiges in some regions. The tail is black, long, and pointed at the tip; the outer rectrices have white outer vanes. The underparts are white, slightly tinged with grey in most subspecies. In particular the breast is usually darker and sometimes browner {{than the rest of the}} light underside, and may appear as an indistinct band between the lighter belly and white throat. In the subspecies around the North Pacific in particular and in females elsewhere too, there may be faint brownish bars on the breast. The bill is large and hooked at the tip and coloured nearly black, but pale at the base of the under mandible (though the extent varies seasonally). The legs and feet are blackish.|$|E
500|$|The {{storm petrel}} {{is a small}} bird, [...] in length with a [...] wingspan. It weighs , {{with an average of}} [...] It is square-tailed and has all-black plumage except for a snow-white rump that extends to the sides of the tail base and a broad white band on the underwings. Juveniles in fresh plumage can also show a narrow <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> on the upperwing. The plumage becomes dark brown rather than black as it becomes worn. There are no obvious {{differences}} between the sexes, although in the Mediterranean subspecies, at least, most captured birds can be sexed using a formula which involves multiplying the wing length by the length of the white rump band; females are slightly larger and have a longer white rump than males. The Mediterranean subspecies has longer wings and a heavier bill on average than the nominate form, but neither sex nor subspecies can be determined by observation at sea.|$|E
50|$|The body {{of adults}} is dark brown {{on top and}} reddish underneath. The tail has a black and <b>white</b> <b>barred</b> pattern. The legs are a {{yellowish}} color.|$|R
60|$|They now {{advanced}} {{with extreme}} caution. Nothing was said until, against a shady background of foliage, five <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> were visible, crossing their route {{a little way}} ahead.|$|R
50|$|The {{adult is}} 18.5 cm long and weighs 63 g. It has black upperparts with <b>white</b> <b>barring</b> on the back, white {{spotting}} {{on the wings}} and a white rump. The tail is black with some <b>white</b> <b>barring,</b> and the underparts are pale buff-olive with a red central belly. There is a black patch through the eyes and on the cheeks, a yellow forehead, and a red nape. The crown is red in the male and black in the female. Young birds are duller, have less white above and less red on the belly.|$|R
2500|$|Hand {{dampening}} (also {{known as}} finger dampening) {{can be used}} to dampen a white note while striking a nearby black note. As the player strikes a black note with a mallet, they simultaneously press the heel of their hand or the side of their pinky finger onto the ringing <b>white</b> <b>bar,</b> using the same hand to strike the black note and dampen the white note. [...] Using both hands, it's possible to dampen and strike two notes at once.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s struggling, predominately white artists {{discovered}} Main Street's vacant {{buildings and}} cheap rents. A bar and nightclub called [...] opened on Main Street in 1984, which would grow in popularity {{and serve as}} the catalyst for the Main Street Entertainment District that [...] "blossomed" [...] in the 1990s. One by one coffee shops, galleries, breweries, and bars began opening on the six blocks between Central Parkway and Liberty Street. Main Street was full of artists and had a thriving arts scene, but they were eventually displaced to Northside after the street's growing popularity enticed landlords to raise rents. At its height Main Street's numerous clubs, restaurants, and bars attracted nearly a million visitors a year. Locals had mixed reactions to the change, with some complaining that the young, primarily <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> hoppers from the suburbs trashed, abused, and disrespected the street while others saw the 1990s as Main Street's [...] "Golden Era." [...] By the late 1990s there were about 19 clubs and bars on Main Street.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian {{painted lady}} is {{remarkably similar to}} the painted lady (Vanessa cardui). It is {{differentiated}} by its smaller size, rarely exceeding 2 inches (5 cm) across its wings, and the blue colouration at {{the centre of the}} four eyespots on its hindwings. Its body is dark brown, almost black, all over, except the tips of the antenna which are white. The base of the wings are brown, which turns into a brick red colouration, broken by bands of black. The tips of the forewing are black with four white dots running from the apex of the wing, and a <b>white</b> <b>bar</b> extending from {{the leading edge of the}} forewing. The hindwings have four round eyespots at their base, with a blue centre for at least three. The underwings are almost identical to the upperwings, except the base of the underwings is brick red rather than brown. The Australian painted lady's colouration allows it to blend in effectively with the ground. Males and females look almost identical. The ovum is translucent green in colour and barrel shaped with 13 to 15 vertical ribs. Right before hatching, the black head and grey-tinted body appear through the shell.|$|E
50|$|The Saxon Shield {{comes in}} many colors {{including}} black, blue, {{red and yellow}} with <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> or spangles, blue with black bars or barless, blue check or silver check.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese pygmy {{woodpecker}} is 13 - 15 cm long. The crown is grey-brown. A white supercilium starts {{above the}} eye and continues to the neck and breast. The ear coverts are brown, {{and there are a}} white moustachial stripe and a grey-brown malar stripe. The chin and throat are white. The mantle and back are dark brown, with <b>white</b> <b>bars.</b> The upperwing coverts and flight feathers are brownish-black and have <b>white</b> <b>bars.</b> The breast has a brownish suffusion. The breast, flank and belly have variable streaks. The tail is blackish, with <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> on its outer feathers. The iris is chestnut, the beak is blackish and the legs are grey. The male has a small red mark on the side of its nape, and the female does not. The female's beak, wings and tail are longer than the male's. The juvenile bird's throat is often streaked. The bird becomes smaller and darker from the north of its range to the south.|$|R
50|$|This caladenia {{is similar}} to C. carnea but differs from it in not having red and <b>white</b> <b>bars</b> on the labellum. In some places, hybrids between the two species occur.|$|R
