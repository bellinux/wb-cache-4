5|$|Waxy {{produced}} four Epsom Derby winners: Waxy Pope (1809), <b>Whalebone</b> (1810), Blucher (1814) and Whisker (1815). He also sired three fillies {{that won}} The Oaks: Music (1813), Minuet (1815) and Corinne (1818). Corinne {{also won the}} 1,000 Guineas Stakes in 1818. His most productive offspring were produced by the mare Penelope (by Trumpator) and include <b>Whalebone,</b> Whisker, Web, Woful, Wire and Wilful. Penelope was bred and owned by the Duke of Grafton, and all of her foals were foaled at Euston Hall. Whisker was more notable for siring broodmares, and <b>Whalebone</b> was a good producer of colts. Waxy Pope was a leading sire in Ireland and Blucher was a marginally successful sire.|$|E
5|$|Whisker was foaled in 1812 {{and was a}} full-brother to Woful and <b>Whalebone.</b> Whisker won the Derby in 1815 and 11 {{other races}} in his career. He sired Economist (the {{grandsire}} of King Tom) and the filly Poetess (the dam of Monarque).|$|E
5|$|Woful was full-brother to <b>Whalebone</b> and Whisker and was foaled in 1809. He won 12 {{races in}} his turf career {{and was a}} {{successful}} sire, especially of broodmares, for the Euston Hall stud, producing winners of the Epsom Oaks, 1,000 Guineas and St. Leger Stakes.|$|E

5|$|On the West Cliff is {{a statue}} of Captain James Cook who served his {{apprenticeship}} in the town, and a <b>whalebone</b> arch, commemorates the whaling industry. It is the second such arch, the original is preserved in Whitby Archives Heritage Centre. By the inner harbour is a statue commemorating William Scoresby, designer of the crow's nest.|$|E
5|$|No {{images of}} Murrell survive. Accounts {{describe}} him as a short man who walked with {{his hands behind his}} back and hummed as he went. He was also noted for wearing a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron goggles, while carrying a <b>whalebone</b> umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, of whom he was nevertheless fond.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes, such as {{the sperm}} whale, possess teeth with {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of the}} tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. Mysticetes have large <b>whalebone,</b> as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas Odontocetes contain only one.|$|E

5|$|<b>Whalebone</b> was foaled in 1807 out of {{the mare}} Penelope, who was a {{daughter}} of Prunella. He raced for six years and won the Derby in 1810. He later sired two Derby winners, Lap-dog and Spaniel and Caroline, winner of the Oaks. He {{might have been the}} sire of Derby winner Moses, but Moses' parentage is uncertain due to his dam being covered by two stallions.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as <b>whalebone</b> whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, {{dolphins}} and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Blythburgh, a {{mile from}} Bulcamp and {{situated}} near the fordable headwaters of the Blyth estuary, was afterwards {{believed to be the}} location of the tombs of Anna and Jurmin. It is a candidate for a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity. Part of an 8th-century <b>whalebone</b> diptych or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found near the site.|$|E
50|$|Within {{these areas}} there is {{evidence}} of a long occupation period that lasted from 2000 BC to 1000 BC. There is a presence of semi-subterranean dwellings that were lined with stone slabs and <b>whalebones</b> that also contained fire pits. Some stone paving was also apparent. Chipped stone projectile points used for hunting sea mammals were also present.|$|R
50|$|The first {{evidence}} for whaling in Scotland is from Bronze Age settlements where <b>whalebones</b> {{were used for}} constructing and decorating dwelling places. Commercial whaling started in the Middle Ages, and by the 1750s most Scottish ports were whaling, with the Edinburgh Whale-Fishing Company being founded in 1749. The last company still engaged in whaling was Christian Salvesen, which exited the industry in 1963.|$|R

5|$|The abbey ruin {{at the top}} of the East Cliff is the town's {{oldest and}} most {{prominent}} landmark. Other significant features include the swing bridge, which crosses the River Esk and the harbour, which is sheltered by the grade II listed East and West piers. The town's maritime heritage is commemorated by statues of Captain Cook and William Scoresby, as well as the <b>whalebone</b> arch that sits {{at the top of}} the West Cliff. The town also has a strong literary tradition and has featured in literary works, television and cinema, most famously in Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.|$|E
5|$|The steel-hooped cage crinoline, first {{patented}} in April 1856 by R.C. Milliet in Paris, and {{by their}} agent in Britain a few months later, became extremely popular. Steel cage crinolines were mass-produced in huge quantity, with factories across the Western world producing tens of thousands in a year. Alternative materials, such as <b>whalebone,</b> cane, gutta-percha and even inflatable caoutchouc (natural rubber) were all used for hoops, although steel was the most popular. At its widest point, the crinoline could reach a circumference of up to six yards, although by the late 1860s, crinolines were beginning to reduce in size. By the early 1870s, the smaller crinolette and the bustle had largely replaced the crinoline.|$|E
5|$|Wizard's {{first race}} as a five-year-old was a {{sweepstakes}} of 100 guineas each on 20 April at Newmarket. He faced three opponents and won the race from odds-on favourite Spaniard. He was then intended to face 1810 Derby winner <b>Whalebone</b> at Newmarket in early May, but Whalebone's owner, the 4th Duke of Grafton, paid a forfeit and the race never took place. He beat Middlethorpe at Newmarket after Middlethorpe unseated his rider {{in the early stages}} of the race. The match against Middlethorpe won him 500 guineas. The following day he beat Anthonio over five and a half furlongs. He faced Middlethorpe again in September when he fell lame and Middlethorpe beat him. This was his final race and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career Wizard earned 3850 guineas.|$|E

50|$|It was The Blyth School, a grammar school, {{which was}} built in 1929 in grounds owned by Philip Sewell, who died in 1906. It was named after Ernest Egbert Blyth. It had 750 girls in the early 1950s, 800 by 1956, 850 in 1964 and 800 in 1969. It was {{administered}} by the Norwich Education Committee. Two <b>whalebones</b> {{were given to the}} school by a former pupil and made into an arch.|$|R

5|$|Early {{examples}} of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional {{items such as}} the intricately carved <b>whalebone</b> Franks Casket, {{thought to have been}} produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at Dalmeny Midlothian, which contains a necklace of beads similar to those found in mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with filigree and garnet, similar to sword harness mounts found at Sutton Hoo. There is also a bun-shaped loom from Yetholm, Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian runic inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword pommel from Culbin Sands, Moray and the Burghead drinking horn mount. After Christianisation in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland {{to become part of the}} common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae {{consists}} of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 31002500 BC {{the houses are}} similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large midden containing ash, bones, shells, stone and organic waste. Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or <b>whalebone,</b> would have been visible from the outside. In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included <b>whalebone,</b> gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E

60|$|What I {{still look}} at most, in {{connection}} with that Luggage, is the extraordinary quantity of writing-paper, and all written on! And not our paper neither,--not the paper charged in the bill, for we know our paper,--so {{he must have been}} always at it. And he had crumpled up this writing of his, everywhere, in every part and parcel of his luggage. There was writing in his dressing-case, writing in his boots, writing among his shaving-tackle, writing in his hat-box, writing folded away down among the very <b>whalebones</b> of his umbrella.|$|R
50|$|The role of Osedax in the {{degradation}} of marine vertebrate remains is controversial. Some scientists think that Osedax is a specialist on <b>whalebones</b> while others {{think that it is}} more of a generalist. This controversy is due to a biogeographic paradox: despite the rarity and ephemeral nature of whale falls, Osedax has a broad biogeographic range and is surprisingly diverse. One hypothesis advanced to explain this paradox is that Osedax are able to colonize a variety of vertebrate remains besides <b>whalebones.</b> This hypothesis is supported by an experiment involving cow bones suspended above the sea floor. A variety of Osedax species successfully colonized these bones. Osedax have also been observed colonizing terrestrial mammal bones mixed in with galley waste from a surface vessel. Other scientists have countered this hypothesis by pointing out how the cow bone experiment does not match any natural habitat and also the low probability of terrestrial mammal bones arriving at the ocean floor in significant quantities. They also point out other cases of food falls in which the remains disappeared too swiftly for Osedax colonization and the lack of any observed colonization in similar cases. The true role of Osedax in {{the degradation}} of marine vertebrate remains is important to marine vertebrate taphonomy. Burrows closely similar to those made by Osedax species have been found in the bones of ancient marine birds and plesiosaurs, suggesting that the genus may once have had a wider range of foods.|$|R
5|$|Only {{fragments}} of artifacts survive from the Brythonic speaking kingdoms of southern Scotland. Pictish {{art can be}} seen in the extensive survival of carved Pictish stones, particularly in the north and east of the country. These display a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno (Angus). There are a few survivals of Pictish silver, notably a number of massive neck-chains including the Whitecleuch Chain, and also the unique silver plaques from the cairn at Norrie's Law. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata is much more difficult to identify, but may include items such as the Hunterston brooch, which with other items such as the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed. Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art include metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved <b>whalebone</b> Franks Casket, thought to have been produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. After the Christian conversion of what is now Scotland in the seventh century, artistic styles in Northumbria interacted with those in Ireland and Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E

25|$|Narborough Bone Mill {{was further}} downstream, {{and did not}} have any road access, as bones were {{delivered}} by boat, and the ground bonemeal was taken away by boat. It was built in the early nineteenth century, and was used to grind bones from local slaughterhouses, <b>whalebones</b> from the King's Lynn whaling industry, and bones from cemeteries in Hamburg. The mill ceased to work in 1884 or soon afterwards, when the Nar Valley Drainage Board built a sluice near the mouth of the river, preventing use of the river by boats.

40|$|Ephemeral {{reducing}} environments such as hydrothermal vents and whale falls create oases of chemosynthetic {{primary production}} in the nutrient poor deep sea. The polychaete family Siboglinidae has adapted to occupy these niches of chemical nutrition. This likely requires high levels of dispersal, either through long-living larvae or a “stepping-stone” dispersal method. Here we seek to identify recently found specimens of Osedax from <b>whalebones</b> {{off the coast of}} Oregon and Antarctica. Once species identity was determined, we sought to elucidate connectivity between known populations of Osedax from Monterey Bay and Sagami Bay. To accomplish this, we sequenced the mitochondrial marker COI and inferred relationships through a haplotype network and maximum likelihood tree...|$|R
