2500|$|In 2008, the {{government}} instituted a [...] "Plan of Voluntary Return" [...] which encouraged unemployed immigrants {{from outside the}} EU {{to return to their}} home countries and receive several incentives, including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the Spanish Social Security. The programme had little effect; during its first two months, just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer. What the programme failed to do, the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs. In 2011 alone, {{more than half a million}} people left Spain. For the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative, and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners.|$|R
40|$|Lawyers {{and judges}} {{speak to each}} other in a {{language}} of precedents—decisions from cases that have come before. The most persuasive precedent to cite, of course, is an on-point decision of the U. S. Supreme Court. But Supreme Court opinions are changing. They contain more factual claims about the world than ever before, and those claims are now rich with empirical data. This Supreme Court factfinding is also highly accessible; fast digital research leads directly to factual language in old cases that is perfect for arguments in new ones. An unacknowledged consequence of all this is the rise of what I call “factual precedents”: the tendency of lower courts to cite Supreme Court cases as authorities on factual subjects, as evidence that the factual claims are indeed true. Rather than citing, for example, evidence from the record to establish that carpal tunnel syndrome regularly resolves without surgery, lower courts instead cite language from a Supreme Court opinion for that point. This Article carefully describes how lower courts are using Supreme Court facts today and then argues that these factual precedents are unwise. The Supreme Court is not a factfinding institution. Facts change over time. And, unlike legal precedents, one cannot be certain that factual statements from the Supreme Court are carefully deliberated and carry the force of law. I argue that Supreme Court statements of fact should not receive any authoritative force separate from the force that attaches <b>to</b> <b>whatever</b> legal conclusions <b>they</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> originally. If a fact is so central to the legal holding that the two meld together, then the Supreme Court is free to so state and thus insulate the factual conclusion from future challenges by making it part of the legal rule. But the presumption, I suggest, should be no precedential value for generalized factual claims—even if they are facts found in the U. S. Reports...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the recent turn in strategy research to practice-based theorizing. Based on a data set of 51 meeting observations, the paper examines how strategy meetings {{are involved in}} either stabilizing existing strategic orientations or proposing variations that cumulatively generate change in strategic orientations. Eleven significant structuring characteristics of strategy meetings are identified and examined {{with regard to their}} potential for stabilizing or destabilizing existing strategic orientations. Based on a taxonomy of meeting structures, we explain three typical evolutionary paths through which variations emerge, are maintained and developed, and are selected or de-selected. The findings make four main contributions. First, <b>they</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the literature on strategy-as-practice by explaining how the practice of meetings is related to consequential strategic outcomes. Second, <b>they</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the literature on organizational becoming by demonstrating the role of meetings in shaping stability and change. Third, they extend and elaborate the concept of meetings as strategic episodes. Fourth, <b>they</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the literature on garbage can models of strategy-making...|$|R
