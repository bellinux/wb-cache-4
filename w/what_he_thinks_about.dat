500|$|When Lester {{is caught}} masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about {{their lack of}} {{intimacy}} {{is the first time}} he says aloud <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> her. By confronting the issue and Carolyn's [...] "superficial investments in others", Lester is trying to [...] "regain a voice in a home that [...] the voices of mother and daughter". His final turning point comes when [...] Angela and he almost have sex; after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter. He holds her close and [...] "wraps her up". Mendes called it [...] "the most satisfying end to [...] journey there could possibly have been". With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a [...] "mythical quest". After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks [...] "to meet his fate". Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure. As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester's death. His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's staring into Lester's dead eyes is [...] "the culmination of the theme" [...] of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.|$|E
500|$|Whilst Gwen by {{the third}} series has become a more militant character, Rhys retains his everyman status and takes {{on the role of}} {{audience}} surrogate; press material describes him as [...] "the ordinary guy in the street" [...] and [...] "the normal person's eyes and ears" [...] who [...] "says <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> the situations Torchwood find themselves in, bringing the reality back to them". Paul Collins comments of the significance of Rhys having the first dialogue in the serial, remarking that this is Torchwoods [...] "determination to establish its domestic credentials before subverting them". Rhys becomes a reluctant hero; Kai Owen states that he [...] "would rather not get involved if he had the choice", but when faced with the life-or-death situations in the serial [...] "he doesn't run away from it" [...] because the character has [...] "seen so many things". This, in Owen's eyes, makes the Rhys seen in Children of Earth a [...] "very brave hero who has grown in stature". Rhys retains core character status for the fourth series, [...] Whilst Kai Owen explains that Rhys will always be at the forefront of [...] "Gwen's troubles or fights or adventures" [...] because of his concern for her, he remains unafraid to tell her when she has become too consumed by her job. Davies links the relationship between Gwen and Rhys in the fourth series to the show's continued exploration of human sexuality, stating that [...] "open sexuality has to include everything" [...] including [...] "a husband/wife great big crime-fighting team... happily in love".|$|E

So far as the science and the sociology of the revolution are concerned, the average editor is a generation or so behind the facts. He is intellectually slothful, accepts no facts until they are accepted by the majority, and prides himself upon his conservatism. He is an instinctive optimist, prone to believe that what ought to be, is.

60|$|Fortunately for the doctors, {{they very}} seldom find {{themselves}} in this position, {{because it is so}} difficult to prove anything against them. The only evidence that can decide a case of malpractice is expert evidence: that is, the evidence of other doctors; and every doctor will allow a colleague to decimate a whole countryside sooner than violate the bond of professional etiquet by giving him away. It is the nurse who gives the doctor away in private, because every nurse has some particular doctor whom she likes; and she usually assures her patients that all the others are disastrous noodles, and soothes the tedium of the sick-bed by gossip about their blunders. She will even give a doctor away for the sake of making the patient believe that she knows more than the doctor. But she dare not, for her livelihood, give the doctor away in public. And the doctors stand by one another at all costs. Now and then some doctor in an unassailable position, like the late Sir William Gull, will go into the witness box and say <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> the way a patient has been treated; but such behavior is considered little short of infamous by his colleagues.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the letter}} reached Hester {{there was a}} {{consultation}} over it, to which old Mr. Caldigate was admitted.

There was not a word to show that Mrs. Bolton had herself accepted the decision to which everyone else had come in the matter;--everything, rather, to show that she had not done so. But, as the squire said, it does not do to inquire too closely into all people's inner beliefs. 'If everybody were to say <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> everybody, nobody would ever go to see anybody.' It was soon decided that Hester, with her baby, should go on an early day to Puritan Grange, and should stay there for a couple of nights. But there was a difficulty as to Caldigate himself. He was naturally enough anxious to send Hester without him, but she was as anxious to take him. 'It isn't for my own sake,' she said,--'because I shall like to have you there with me. Of course it will be very dull for you, but it will be so much better that we should all be reconciled, and that everyone should know that we are so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Meantime, if your honour were in London, {{you would}} see a great {{embankment}} rising high and dry out of the Thames on the Middlesex shore, from Westminster Bridge to Blackfriars.

Lastly, a muddle of railways in all directions possible and impossible, with no general public scheme, no general public supervision, enormous waste of money, no fixable responsibility, no accountability but under Lord Campbell's Act.

40|$|Economic {{analysis}} and popular opinion often conflict. An {{example is the}} connection between the revenues and expenditures of the public sector.

For example, if an average citizen in any country is asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> or she <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> the desirability of a particular expenditure increase, the answer is often related to how the respondent thinks the increase will be financed. Similarly, while most people do not like tax increases, again their attitudes seem likely to depend to at least some extent upon what they think will be financed. 1 People are right. Revenues and expenditures are inextricably linked. Indeed, as Musgrave (1969) has long emphasized, “a theory of public finance remains unsatisfactory unless it comprises both the revenue and expenditure sides of the fisca...|$|R
40|$|The New Testament {{episode of}} Paul’s {{encounter}} with the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers of Athens, in chapter 17 of the Acts of the Apostles (vv. 16 – 34), illumi-nates the relationship between early Christianity and its intellectual and religious environment in the Roman empire. Here Paul the Apostle is in fact forced to explain his message in terms he attempts to make comprehensible for an audience of edu-cated Athenians, in accordance with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> knows <b>about</b> that audience. At least that is how Luke, the writer of the Acts, tries to describe the episode, at which he was apparently not himself present. 1 This episode gives {{us the opportunity to}} raise questions about the paradoxical relations that can be imagined between Epicureanism and Paul’s missionary prac-tice, or more widely between Epicureanism and early Christianity. Research on this topic already has a fairly long history but has probably not yet found its direction, or the right tone or a conclusion. 2 A kind of Christian prejudice seems to be the rule in this area. Those who venture there immediately encounter in general two sorts of indignant reaction: — From those who approach Epicureanism in the tradition of a free-thinking humanism and a materialist philosophy, the cry goes up: how can anyone intro-duce into the genesis of Christianity those fathers of atomism and a materialist hedonism, those liberators of humanity, or even those ancestors of dialectical Marxism, 3 Epicurus or Lucretius? Are all religions not an ‘opium of the people’? — From historians and theologians of Christianity there is the same outcry: how can people dare to detect a similarity, still less a kinship against nature, between two doctrines as opposed as that atheism, for which Epicurus and his followers 4 are frequently criticized, and the Christian faith? What is more, Paul warned his disciples against philosophy, for example in Col. 2. 8 : ‘Be on your guard; do not let your minds be captured by hollow and delusive speculations based on tradi...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims at (1) {{identifying and}} describing {{the types of}} speech acts {{in terms of the}} locutionary acts, the illocutionary acts and the perlocutionary acts delivered by the main character in Ryan Fleck’s Half Nelson outside and inside the school and (2) describing the way the main character copes with the life outside and inside the school. This research employed a descriptive qualitative method. The existence of number was used to reveal the frequencies of the types of speech act. The object of this research was the main character’s utterances in Ryan Fleck’s Half Nelson. The data were in the form of scenes that were analyzed based on Austin’s classification of types of speech act and Searle’s classification of illocutionary acts, and Holmes’s theory of context. The researcher was the primary instrument in this research. The secondary instrument was the data sheet. The data analyses of this research were based on the types of speech acts outside and inside the school. The results show that: first, related to the types of speech act, in terms of locutionary acts, there are three kinds of form, i. e. declarative, interrogative, and imperative. Declarative is the most dominant form used outside and inside the school. It is used in almost all functions of illocutionary act types. Regarding with the illocutionary acts, the main character, Dan, employs four types of act outside the school, i. e. assertive, directive, expressive, and commissive. Assertive holds the highest frequency. In the daily life, he feels that the condition around him is not in line with his opinion. Therefore, he uses his utterances to assert <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believes to be the case. Declaration is not performed by him outside the school since he is as a common person, who has no institutional position. On the other hand, inside the school, directive, assertive, expressive, commissive, and declaration are found. Directive is in the highest frequency because he is a teacher and a basketball coach who performs questioning, requesting, commanding, encouraging, suggesting, etc. Concerning the perlocutionary acts, there are four types of act found outside the school, i. e. get h to know, get h to do something, to express feeling, and get h to expect something. The most-dominant act is get h to know. <b>He</b> often expresses <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believes to others, so that they recognize it. Further, there are five kinds of perlocutionary act found inside the school, i. e. to get h to do something, get h to know, express feeling, praise, and get h to expect something. As a teacher, he employs the acts aimed to get h to do something most, such as questioning, requesting, commanding, etc. Second, he cannot completely split between both lives, outside and inside the school because of the effects of cocaine on his brain. However, he can be honest to tell <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> and feels <b>about</b> his life to people he likes or considers them as his ‘friends’ everywhere...|$|R
