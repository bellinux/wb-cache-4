5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report.

5|$|After {{visiting his}} ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design {{based on some}} simple but nuanced {{techniques}} he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration {{of the relationship between}} enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known <b>were</b> <b>disappointed,</b> but the new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects.|$|E
