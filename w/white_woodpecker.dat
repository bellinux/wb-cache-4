50|$|A {{small brown}} and <b>white</b> <b>woodpecker</b> with {{distinctive}} pink-rimmed white irises. Barred brown and white above, lightly streaked dirty white below. Tail spotted white. Paler brown crown (edged red in male) and eyestripes contrasting with white supercilia and cheeks.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white</b> <b>{{woodpecker}}</b> (Melanerpes candidus) is a South American {{species of}} woodpecker (family Picidae) {{native to the}} wooded grasslands of Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina. It is a bright white bird with black wings and a distinctive small bright yellow eye patch. The IUCN has rated it as a [...] "least-concern species".|$|E
50|$|Groups {{of up to}} ten <b>white</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> are {{sometimes}} seen flying with floppy wing-beats in procession. The diet is varied and includes fruits, berries and seeds, the bird being a significant disperser of some species of seed. It forages in noisy family groups and also raids wild bee and wasp nests, feeding on the adult insects, larvae and honey. It breeds between September and November. It may sometimes nest communally, but very little is known of its breeding habits.|$|R
50|$|Spring water {{spots are}} {{developed}} {{largely in the}} areas of Sanbuk-myeon, Yeongbuk-myeon, Ildong-myeon, and Hwahyeo-myeon to attract tourists. The Korea National Arboretum, commonly known as Gwangneung Arboretum, is located in the village of Jikdong-ril, Soheul-eup. It is the biggest arboretum in South Korea. It is also known to be a home to <b>white</b> bellied black <b>woodpeckers.</b> The arboretum also houses the Gwangneung Forest Museum and Gwangneung Forest Beach.|$|R
40|$|Aluminum, one of {{the most}} {{important}} materials in the United States and the world, is produced by reducing aluminum oxide (alumina), a refined bauxite ore, in an electrolytic cell or "pot". An aluminum reduction plant typically has several hundred of these pots, each producing several thousand pounds of aluminum per day. With a sincere and proven commitment to protecting the environment, aluminum plants are successfully coexisting with their surrounding neighbors. Some immediate neighbors- of this particular plant are pine trees and ground vegetation, the protected red cockaded <b>woodpecker,</b> <b>white</b> tail deer, fox squirrels, and, of course, mankind. As noted earlier, these plants use many pots to meet the world's demand for aluminum. The lower half of the pot is a rectangular steel shell that is lined with carbon blocks and insulating materials. The carbon lining blocks are made of calcined anthracite coal, using coal tar pitch as a binding agent...|$|R
50|$|Another {{bird species}} found here, {{one that is}} truly endangered, is the red-cockaded woodpecker. It found {{throughout}} the Sam Houston National Forest and frequently spotted by observant visitors. The small black and <b>white</b> <b>woodpecker</b> with distinctive large white cheek patches is slightly larger than a bluebird. The male has a single streak of red feathers {{on each side of}} his head. Its unique high-pitched, squeaky call can be recognized at considerable distances.|$|E
50|$|Its {{preferred}} hunting {{technique is}} to soar high {{until it has}} spotted suitable prey, and then dive down on it, usually right into the forest canopy, {{but it has also}} been observed to catch a <b>white</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Melanerpes candidus) that had been mobbing it in mid-air, after launching itself from its perch. It likes to hunt along ridges and forest edges where it can access the canopy-level from an oblique direction rather than just from directly above, and where ground-living prey is also more accessible.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{has a large}} {{distribution}} in South America {{to the east of}} the Andes. Its range extends from Suriname and French Guiana, through much of Brazil to southeastern Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina. It is found at altitudes of up to about 2000 m, and is non-migratory, but prone to making short distance movements. Its habitat is forest edges, open dry woodland, wooded savannah, scrubland with scattered trees, plantations, orchards, parkland and mangroves. It is opportunistic and adaptable, being seen in city suburbs, and expanding its range into areas of felled timber.|$|E
25|$|The bird is shiny blue-black {{with white}} {{markings}} on its neck {{and back and}} extensive white on {{the trailing edge of}} both the upper- and underwing. The underwing is also white along its forward edge, resulting in a black line running along the middle of the underwing, expanding to more extensive black at the wingtip. In adults, the bill is ivory in color, and chalky white in juveniles. Ivory-bills have a prominent crest, although in juveniles it is ragged. The crest is black in juveniles and females. In males, the crest is black along its forward edge, changing abruptly to red on the side and rear. The chin of an ivory-billed woodpecker is black. When perched with the wings folded, birds of both sexes present a large patch of white on the lower back, roughly triangular in shape. These characteristics distinguish them from the smaller and darker-billed pileated woodpecker. The pileated woodpecker normally is brownish-black, smoky, or slaty black in color. It also has a white neck stripe, but the back is normally black. Pileated woodpecker juveniles and adults have a red crest and a <b>white</b> chin. Pileated <b>woodpeckers</b> normally have no white on the trailing edges of their wings and when perched, normally show only a small patch of white {{on each side of the}} body near the edge of the wing. However, pileated woodpeckers, apparently aberrant individuals, have been reported with white trailing edges on the wings, forming a white triangular patch on the lower back when perched. Like all woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker has a strong and straight bill and a long, mobile, hard-tipped, barbed tongue. Among North American woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker is unique in having a bill whose tip is quite flattened laterally, shaped much like a beveled wood chisel.|$|R
50|$|The ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} {{ranks among}} the largest woodpeckers {{in the world and}} is the largest in the United States. The closely related and likewise possibly extinct imperial woodpecker (C. imperialis) of western Mexico is, or was, the largest woodpecker. The ivory-billed has a total length of 48 to 53 cm, and based on very scant information, weighs about 450 to 570 g. It has a typical 76 cm wingspan. Standard measurements attained included a wing chord length of 23.5 - 26.5 cm, a tail length of 14 - 17 cm, a bill length of 5.8 - 7.3 cm, and a tarsus length of 4 - 4.6 cm.The bird is shiny blue-black with white markings on its neck and back and extensive white on the trailing edge of both the upper- and underwing.
