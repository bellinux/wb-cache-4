5|$|Although Godwin {{was fond}} of his children, he was, in many ways, ill-equipped to care for them. As Todd explains, he <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> annoyed by their noise, {{demanding}} silence while he worked. However, {{when he took a}} trip to Dublin to visit Wollstonecraft's sisters, he missed the girls immensely and wrote to them frequently.|$|E
5|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the Vietnam War, North Vietnam supplied the Viet Cong in the South by two methods. The first was to extend the Ho Chi Minh Trail southward into the tri-border region of Laos/Cambodia/South Vietnam. The Trail, a labyrinth of paths, roads, river transportation systems and way-stations, <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> being expanded and improved. It served as a logistical jugular vein, for both men and material, for the North Vietnamese war effort against South Vietnam. The second method was to transport supplies by sea.|$|E

5|$|On October 8, a {{circulation}} {{associated with an}} area of disturbed weather acquired convection and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen-E. Upon formation, the depression was forecast to dissipate because of strong wind shear. Moving little, its development <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> hindered by wind shear. The depression had difficulty organizing, and on October 9, it became so disorganized that advisories were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The Armada <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> being modernized {{with the}} latest {{developments}} in naval warfare. It adopted steam navigation in the 1830s, ironclad plate armor in the 1860s, and torpedoes in the 1880s. By 1889, Brazil had the fifth or sixth most powerful navy {{in the world and the}} most powerful battleships in the western hemisphere. The Army, despite its highly experienced and battle-hardened officer corps, was plagued during peacetime by units which were badly paid, inadequately equipped, poorly trained and thinly spread across the vast Empire.|$|E
5|$|The He 111 <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> {{upgraded}} and modified, {{but became}} obsolete {{during the latter}} part of the war. The German Bomber B project was not realised, which forced the Luftwaffe to continue operating the He 111 in combat roles until the end of the war. Manufacture of the He 111 ceased in September 1944, at which point piston-engine bomber production was largely halted in favour of fighter aircraft. With the German bomber force virtually defunct, the He 111 was used for logistics.|$|E

During its six-episode run, Napoleon Dynamite had no consistent schedule; it <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> shifted on the Fox schedule in favor of football and award shows. On May 15, 2012, Fox announced a schedule for its 2012–13 season that dropped Napoleon Dynamite from the listings. The complete series was released on a single DVD in November 2014 by Olive Films.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{classified}} as a supercell following further analysis of its erratic nature and extreme attributes. During the event, the Bureau of Meteorology <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> surprised by the frequent changes in direction, {{as well as the}} severity of the hail and the duration of the storm. The event was also unique as the time of year and general conditions in the region were not seen as conducive for extreme storm cell formation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its sister, {{which was}} {{intended}} for emergency use only, this light <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> manned by Coast Guard personnel, after the Coast Guard {{took charge of the}} lighthouses in the United States in 1939, who served two-week rotating tours. These men lived in the circular portion of the lighthouse. The dwelling encompassed not only the superstructure, but also part of the foundation, as shown by the ring of portholes in its side.|$|E

5|$|Always a tomboy, James quickly {{developed}} {{an interest in}} sports. Her godfather gave her a baseball bat and glove to celebrate her first holy communion. She excelled at hockey, baseball and synchronized swimming as a young child. Her mother wanted her to focus on swimming {{due to the lack}} of opportunities for girls in hockey in the 1970s. Her passion was for hockey, however, and she <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> playing ball hockey with the neighbourhood boys from the time she was in kindergarten. James first played organized hockey in a Flemingdon Park boys house league at the age of eight, and then only after her mother threatened legal action as officials opposed her inclusion.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|As the {{university}} president, Middleton <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> involved in personnel decisions, {{some of them}} making national news. One such ordeal occurred in February 1955 when the Board of Supervisors {{decided that it was}} time for the head football coach, Gaynell Tinsley, to be relieved following a break-even record in seven years. His successor, Paul Dietzel, was a 29-year-old assistant coach at the United States Military Academy. Dietzel had a rough beginning at LSU with three losing seasons, and calls for his removal became louder. Middleton supported Dietzel, however, and in his fourth season as coach the LSU Tigers not only had an undefeated season, but also won the Sugar Bowl and were declared the national champions.|$|E

5|$|Balakirev's despotism {{strained}} {{the relationship}} between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Each side's {{front line}} <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> under {{observation}} by snipers and lookouts during daylight; movement was therefore restricted {{until after the}} dusk stand-to and night had fallen. Under the cover of darkness, troops attended to vital maintenance and resupply, with rations and water being brought to the front line, fresh units swapped places with troops moving to the rear for rest and recuperation. Trench raiding was also carried out and construction parties formed to repair trenches and fortifications, while wiring parties were sent out to repair or renew the barbed wire in no man's land. An hour before dawn, everyone would stand-to once more.|$|E
5|$|Gilly {{was later}} seen using his new look {{in attempt to}} get the {{affections}} of Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). After failing he acted out of character and struck up a scam date with Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) to make Steph jealous but it back-fired when his false tooth came loose in Cheryl's mouth. He later has relationships with Cheryl and Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark). Another change implemented during this period was a dramatic change to the character's appearance after new series producer Lucy Allan and Quinlan came to a mutual decision to transform his hairstyle by shaving it all off, a stark contrast as during his early years he <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> seen with long hair.|$|E

5|$|Hassett {{struggled}} in two warm-up matches against Tasmania before the Australians left for England, and despite winning both fixtures, {{it was not}} to be a happy tour on the field. In the first match on English soil, against East Molesey, Bill Johnston, Australia’s leading wicket-taker in 1948, broke down with a serious knee injury. Hassett {{struggled in}} the opening first-class matches in England, passing 40 only once in six innings. In the last match before the Tests, against Sussex, he hit an unbeaten 108. Australia's progress before the Tests <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> curtailed by bad weather. Of the six first-class matches that Hassett played, three did not reach the second innings, although Australia did manage two victories.|$|E
5|$|He {{served on}} the boards of the Electricity Trust and the Housing Trust, among others. Here, unused to not being in {{absolute}} control, and having little specific scientific knowledge, he occasionally stumbled in his decisions. This also created difficulties with the other board members, who were reluctant to disagree with their former boss, regardless of their expertise. But his thrift, a theme throughout his Premiership, did not abate; he <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> forcing the trusts to use cost-saving methods and old vehicles for their work. This extended to his family property; he vigorously opposed his son's desire to install a new irrigation system in the orchard.|$|E
5|$|Himmler met {{his future}} wife, Margarete Boden, in 1927. Seven years his senior, {{she was a}} nurse who shared his {{interest}} in herbal medicine and homoeopathy, and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, Gudrun, was born on 8 August 1929. The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house. Himmler <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts—mostly unsuccessful—to raise livestock for sale. They had a dog, Töhle.|$|E
