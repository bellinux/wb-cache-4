5|$|In 1986, the {{wreckage}} of an Avenger was found off the Florida coast during {{the search for the}} <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Space Shuttle Challenger. Aviation archaeologist Jon Myhre raised this wreck from the ocean floor in 1990. He mistakenly believed {{it was one of the}} missing planes.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{part of the}} Department of Transportation, {{were the}} primary {{investigators}} into the crash of Flight 2511. The <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DC-6 {{was taken to a}} hangar at nearby Wilmington Airport, where the fuselage was reassembled on a wood-and-chicken-wire frame. Investigators recovered approximately 90% of the fuselage, which was then assembled on the frame in the Wilmington hangar.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{aircraft}} was salvaged by 63 Maintenance Unit between 11 and 16 May 1941 {{and was taken}} to Oxford to be stored. The aeroplane was armed with four machine guns in the nose but carried no ammunition. Several pieces of the plane still exist, including the two engines {{and a piece of}} the fuselage.|$|E

5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Mackandal has expert {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} the forest, using its herbs and fungi as weapons against the planters. The ecological landscape of Haiti is used to represent the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Revolution, being initially described as fertile and bountiful with the plantations, but later as worn down and bare. The powerful climate of the Caribbean is more similar to Africa than Europe, making nature an ally of the slaves. Natural elements also act on their own, with Henri Christophe's Citadel being attacked by fungi and thunderstorms before its completion.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan {{came under}} intense {{international}} scrutiny after the raid. The Pakistani government denied {{that it had}} sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009. The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. After the raid, there was an unconfirmed report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crashed helicopter.|$|E

5|$|While {{on holiday}} at a {{resort in the}} French Alps with Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Professor Calculus, Tintin reads about a plane crash in the Gosain Than Massif in the Himalayas of Tibet. He then has a vision of his friend Chang Chong-Chen, badly injured and calling for help from the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crashed plane. Convinced of Chang's survival, Tintin flies to Kathmandu, via Delhi, with Snowy and a sceptical Captain Haddock. They hire a Sherpa named Tharkey and, {{accompanied}} by porters, travel overland from Nepal towards the crash site.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the company's former test pilot, Lou Leavitt, had {{purchased}} the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> XR-1A {{at a price}} of 4 cents per pound. Leavitt had formed a new company, Helicopter Air Transport, intending to provide helicopter flight training {{in anticipation of a}} postwar aviation boom, and he returned the XR-1A to flying condition. The projected boom failed to materialise, however, and HAT quickly entered bankruptcy, Leavitt selling the XR-1A to Frank Piasecki, another former Platt-LePage employee who had now started his own helicopter company. Piasecki soon grounded the aircraft due to airworthiness concerns, and used the airframe {{in the development of the}} PA-2B, a planned tiltrotor which failed to proceed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{is driven}} back to Area 51 {{along with two}} other Men in Black, Howard Grodin and Jeff Smoodge. After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E

5|$|The demons {{attempt to}} destroy the Ray Line {{underneath}} Filgaia. It was the last resort of the Guardians to connect their remaining strength together and maintain the planet. These plans are temporarily thwarted at the last moment, with Zeikfried being thrown through a dimensional rift in space when the three confront him. Finding himself transported to the underwater <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Photosphere, Zeikfred is met by a deformed visage of Mother, who devours him. However, the remaining Demons find another way to disrupt the Ray line by creating their own tear drop designed to destroy rather than create life and using the Elw teleportation system distribute it all over Filgaia, throwing {{the forces of nature}} into chaos. It is also revealed that one of the Quarter Knights was not originally a demon, but Jack's lost love Elmina, which fueled his lust for vengeance.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|As Généreux {{pulled away}} to the west, Thompson, who had already been wounded several times, succeeded in turning his {{battered}} ship so that his broadside was directed at the stern of Généreux. Despite the collapsed <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mizzenmast and fore topmast, his gunnery teams managed to cut away enough of the obstruction to fire a raking broadside at the French vessel. Although Leander had inflicted severe damage, the size {{and power of the}} French ship was beginning to tell, and Lejoille was able to turn Généreux southwards again. The ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15:30, by which time Leanders crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at the French ship. Eventually Lejoille succeeded in bringing Généreux across Leanders bow and hailed the British ship, asking if they had surrendered. Unable to continue fighting due to the wreckage that lay across the forward guns, Thompson ordered a French flag raised on a pike, which was sufficient for Lejoille to cease firing.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Australian Navy sent {{a team of}} {{clearance}} divers and HMAS Kimbla, a boom defence vessel, to Botany Bay {{and brought}} <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> VH-TVC to <b>the</b> surface. After a week Kimbla was replaced by HMAS Walrus, a smaller workboat from which the Navy divers worked for many weeks, locating and recovering many smaller pieces <b>of</b> <b>wreckage.</b>|$|R

5|$|As part of {{the buildup}} to this feud, Hardy {{strongly}} implied that {{he was responsible for}} all of Jeff's accidents leading back to November, including an assault in a hotel stairwell that prevented Jeff from appearing at Survivor Series, an automobile accident where Jeff's car was run off the road, and a pyrotechnics malfunction where {{part of the}} pyro from Jeff's entrance was fired directly at Jeff, in an attempt to stop Jeff holding the WWE Championship. Despite Hardy's attempts to goad Jeff into fighting him, Jeff refused to fight his brother, but, on the March 3 episode of SmackDown!, Jeff viciously attacked him during a promo where Hardy implied that he was also responsible for the fire that burned down Jeff's house, {{going so far as to}} reveal that he had in his possession a dog collar that supposedly belonged to Jeff's dog, Jack (who perished in the fire), that he claimed to have salvaged from the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. At WrestleMania XXV, Hardy defeated Jeff in an Extreme Rules match, and in a stretcher match on the following episode of SmackDown.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{affected}} Papua New Guinea on {{two separate}} occasions {{while it was}} active, with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28December and 1January, before grazing the archipelago between 12-14January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people {{not to go to}} beaches. As it affected the archipelago, Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100km/h (60mph) to parts of the archipelago including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500people homeless and caused 17deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat. At 00:00UTC on 30December, the automatic weather station at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55km/h (35mph).|$|E
5|$|Mermaid and Loire joined {{battle at}} 07:00, and the {{artillery}} exchange became close and furious after a boarding attempt by Loire was foiled by the helmsman of the British ship. Both ships took severe damage, Mermaid knocking away {{several of her}} opponent's spars, but suffering in turn from the musketry of the soldiers still aboard the Loire. At 09:15, the French vessel lost another spar, and Newman determined to rake his opponent. As he attempted to complete this manoeuvre, a shot from Loire brought down Mermaid's mizzenmast, making her unmanageable and disabling a number of her guns. Seeing an opportunity to escape, the battered Loire disengaged, making significant distance before Newman's crew could clear the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mast. High winds further hampered Mermaid's repair efforts by tearing away several sails and spars and drowning the ship's carpenter when he was blown overboard. By the time Mermaid was ready for action once more, Loire had escaped.|$|E
50|$|After impact, {{the plane}} broke apart and was {{propelled}} {{up the mountain}} approximately 132 ft, coming to rest inverted. A fire broke out, and <b>the</b> residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village came to aid, attempting to put the fire out with hand-held extinguishers. All but one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injured passengers were able to escape <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injured or killed passengers were natives of Nome, Gambell, or Savoonga.|$|R
25|$|Fry and ten <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{children}} died on scene.

5|$|Rome's {{control over}} the city ended {{following}} {{the chaos of the}} Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established.In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised {{what was left of the}} province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses.|$|E
5|$|Shephard soon {{encounters}} more stranded Marine {{units in}} the <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base, and tries {{to break through the}} black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.|$|E
5|$|The ship ferried Allied {{prisoners of}} war back to Australia before departing Sydney on 8 November and arrived at Plymouth on 16 December. The navy {{originally}} intended to reduce her to Category B reserve, but decided to assign Wrangler to the Naval Training Command on 18 January 1946 and she became the chemical warfare training ship based at Devonport Royal Dockyard. From September 1946 until 1950 the ship was with the Rosyth Local Flotilla as a boys' training ship and had her 40mm guns removed during her December 1946 – January 1947 refit. Two years later Wrangler was in a collision that damaged her Carley floats and main deck plating. In 1950–51 she {{was assigned to the}} 4th Training Flotilla. The ship was allocated to the Type 15 programme on 4 January 1950 and sailed to Devonport in February 1951 to prepare for the reconstruction. From June 1951 to 10 March 1953 she was rebuilt by Harland & Wolff at Belfast, Northern Ireland, with the new pennant number F157. On re-commissioning in 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Between 1953 and 1955 she served as part of the 5th Frigate Squadron in the Mediterranean. In 1954 Wrangler was involved in the search for <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BOAC de Havilland Comet airliner G-ALYP, that crashed in the Mediterranean Sea near the island of Elba. On 4 February 1955, she ran aground at Villefranche sur Mer, France; she was refloated on 6 February 1955 by French Navy and Italian Navy tugs.|$|E

The teams used explosives to destroy beach obstacles and blow gaps in the sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and vehicles. The dozer tanks pushed <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way to create clear lanes for further landings.|$|R
