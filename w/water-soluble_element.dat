As allanite and monazite preferentially incorporate Th over U (Klimm et al. 2008; Skora and Blundy 2012; Stepanov et al. 2012), the coexisting fluid {{is characterized by a}} relative enrichment of U over Th (Figure  2). Significant enrichment of Th is only possible by allanite/monazite dissolution in hydrous melts (Hermann 2002; Klimm et al. 2008; Stepanov et al. 2012). On the other hand, U is a <b>water-soluble</b> <b>element</b> and very susceptible to dissolution from crustal rocks into aqueous solutions. Thus, the Th/U ratios of subduction-zone fluids may provide a distinction between the aqueous solutions and the hydrous melts at the slab-mantle interface in the subduction channel.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{assess the}} effect of {{transport}} in controlling the chemical weathering proxies, via its effect on grain size as well as chemical breakdown that occurs during the transport. Degree of alteration can be calculated based on major and trace element compositions. Typically this involves tracking the relative abundance of a <b>water-soluble</b> <b>element</b> compared to an insoluble element {{in order to assess}} the degree of alteration (e.g., Nesbitt et al. 1980). We also examine whether chemical weathering and grain size exert important influences on the trace element composition of the fine-grained sediment. If these effects dominate, then it seems unlikely that rare earth element (REE) or other trace element groups can be used as effective provenance tools. Garzanti et al. (2010) have demonstrated that in South Asia the REE character of sediment is strongly controlled by the presence of a small volume of ultra-dense minerals, such as zircon and monazite and that these in turn are subject to hydrodynamic sorting and concentration so that differences between sediments from different rivers may be small compared to differences between different grain size fractions in a single point bar deposit.|$|E

Seismic tomography shows that subducted oceanic slabs sink as far as the bottom of the mantle transition zone at 650 km depth. Subduction to greater depths is less certain, but there is evidence that they may sink to mid-lower-mantle depths at about 1,500 km depth.|$|R
40|$|The {{frequent}} haze days {{around the}} Chinese capital of Beijing {{in recent years}} have aroused great attention owing to the detrimental effects on visibility and public health. To discover the potential health effects of the haze, oxidative capacities of airborne particles collected in Beijing during haze and clear days were comparably assessed by a plasmid scission assay. Eleven <b>water-soluble</b> trace <b>elements</b> (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, Se, Tl, and Zn) in the size-segregated airborne particles were quantitatively analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and most of the <b>water-soluble</b> trace <b>elements</b> were found to mainly concentrate in the fine particle size of 0. 56 - 1. 0 mu m. In comparison with clear days, the mass concentrations of 11 analyzed <b>water-soluble</b> trace <b>elements</b> remarkably increased during haze days, and the oxidative capacities determined by the plasmid scission assay were markedly elevated accordingly during the haze days under the same dosage of particles as for those during clear days. <b>Water-soluble</b> trace <b>elements</b> in airborne particles, such as Cu, V, and particularly Zn, were found to have significantly positive correlations with the plasmid DNA damage rates. Because Cu, V, and Zn have been considered as bioavailable elements, the evident increase of these elements during haze days may be greatly harmful to human health...|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} plasmid {{scission}} assay (PSA), the cell apoptosis assay, and ICP-MS {{were employed to}} study the oxidative potentials and trace element compositions of the airborne particulate matter (PM) in Beijing during a one year-long field campaign from June 2010 to June 2011. The cell damages induced by PM reveled by the cell apoptosis assay showed a similar variation pattern to the DNA damages obtained by PSA, verifying the feasibility of the PSA in analyzing the oxidative capacity of PM samples. The PSA experiments showed that the particle-induced DNA damage was highest in summer, followed by spring, winter and autumn in descending order. The percentages of the oxidative damages to plasmid DNA induced by the water-soluble fractions of PM under the particle doses from 10 to 250 μg/ml were generally lower than 45 %, with some values peaking at above 50 %. The peak values were frequently present in late spring (i. e. April and May) and early summer (i. e. June) but they were scarcely observed in other seasons. These peak values were mostly associated with haze days or the days with low wind speed (less than 4 m/s), indicating that the PM samples during haze had higher oxidative potential than those during non-haze periods. The oxidative potential induced by the water-soluble fraction of the PM displayed a significant positive correlation with the concentrations of the <b>water-soluble</b> <b>elements</b> Cd, Cs, Pb, Rb, Zn, Be and Bi, demonstrating that the particle-induced oxidative potentials were mainly sourced from these elements. The exposure risk represented by the mass concentration of these elements in unit volume of atmosphere was higher in summer and winter, and lower in autumn and spring. The haze day PM samples not only had higher level of oxidative potentials but also had higher concentrations of <b>water-soluble</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{differences}} {{result from}} processes that occur during the subduction of oceanic crust and mantle lithosphere. Oceanic crust (and {{to a lesser}} extent, the underlying mantle) typically becomes hydrated to varying degrees on the seafloor, partly {{as the result of}} seafloor weathering, and partly in response to hydrothermal circulation near the mid-ocean-ridge crest where it was originally formed. As oceanic crust and underlying lithosphere subduct, water is released by dehydration reactions, along with <b>water-soluble</b> <b>elements</b> and trace elements. This enriched fluid rises to metasomatize the overlying mantle wedge and leads to the formation of island arc basalts. The subducting slab is depleted in these water-mobile elements (e.g., K, Rb, Th, Pb) and thus relatively enriched in elements that are not water-mobile (e.g., Ti, Nb, Ta) compared to both mid-ocean ridge and island arc basalts.|$|R
40|$|Coal {{contains}} many potentially harmful trace elements. Coal combustion in unvented stoves, which {{is common in}} most parts of rural China, can release harmful emissions into the air that when inhaled cause health issues. However, few studies have dealt specifically with the toxicological mechanisms of the particulate matter (PM) released by coal and other solid fuel combustion. In this paper, PM 10 particles that were generated during laboratory stove combustion of raw powdered coal, clay-mixed honeycomb briquettes, and wood charcoal were analysed for morphology, trace element compositions, and toxicity as represented by oxidative DNA damage. The analyses included Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Plasmid Scission Assay (PSA). Gravimetric analysis indicated that the equivalent mass concentration of PM 10 emitted by burning raw powdered coal was higher than that derived by burning honeycomb briquette. FESEM observation revealed that the coal burning-derived PM 10 particles were mainly soot aggregates. The PSA results showed that the PM 10 emitted by burning honeycomb briquettes had a higher oxidative capacity than that from burning raw powdered coal and wood charcoal. It is also demonstrated that the oxidative capacity of the whole particle suspensions were {{similar to those of the}} water soluble fractions; indicating that the DNA damage induced by coal burning-derived PM 10 were mainly a result of the water-soluble fraction. An ICP-MS analysis revealed that the amount of total analysed <b>water-soluble</b> <b>elements</b> in the PM 10 emitted by burning honeycomb briquettes was higher than that in PM produced by burning raw powdered coal, and both were higher than PM from burning wood charcoal. The total analysed <b>water-soluble</b> <b>elements</b> in these coal burning-derived PM 10 samples had a significantly positive correlation with the level of DNA damage; indicating that the oxidative capacity of the coal burning-derived PM 10 was mainly sourced from the water soluble <b>elements.</b> The <b>water-soluble</b> As, Cd, Ge, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Tl, and Zn showed the highest correlation with the oxidative potential, implying that these elements in their water soluble states were the primary responsible factor for the plasmid DNA damage. The exposure risk was further assessed using the particle mass concentrations multiplied by the percent of DNA damage under the dose of 500 μg ml− 1. The results revealed that the exposure risk of burning raw powdered coal was much higher than that of burning honeycomb briquette...|$|R
40|$|Water-soluble redox-active metals are {{potentially}} toxic {{due to its}} ability to catalytically generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo, leading to oxidative stress. As part of the Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology (SCAPE), we developed a method to quantify <b>water-soluble</b> <b>elements,</b> including redox-active metals, from {{a large number of}} filter samples (N = 530) in support of the center's health studies. PM 2. 5 samples were collected during 2012 – 2013 at various sites (three urban, two rural, a near-road site, and a road-side site) in the southeastern United States, using high-volume samplers. <b>Water-soluble</b> <b>elements</b> (S, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Br, Sr, Ba, and Pb) were determined by extracting filters in deionized water and re-aerosolized for analyses by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using an online aerosol element analyzer (Xact, Cooper Environmental). Concentrations ranged from detection limits (nominally 0. 1 to 30 ng m − 3) to 1. 2 μg m − 3, with S as the most abundant element, followed by Ca, K, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Ba. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) identified four factors that were associated with specific sources based on relative loadings of various tracers. These include brake/tire wear (with tracers Ba and Cu), biomass burning (K), secondary formation (S, Se, and WSOC), and mineral dust (Ca). Of the four potentially toxic and relatively abundant metals (redox-active Cu, Mn, Fe, and redox-inactive Zn), 51 % of Cu, 32 % of Fe, 17 % of Mn, and 45 % of Zn were associated with the brake/tire factor. Mn was mostly associated with the mineral dust factor (45 %). Zn was found in a mixture of factors, with 26 % associated with mineral dust, 14 % biomass burning, and 13 % secondary formation. Roughly 50 % of Fe and 40 % of Cu were apportioned to the secondary formation factor, likely through increases in the soluble fraction of these elements by sulfur-driven aerosol water and acidity. Linkages between sulfate and water-soluble Fe and Cu may account for some of the past observed associations between sulfate/sulfur oxide and health outcomes. For Cu, Mn, Fe, and Zn, only Fe was correlated with PM 2. 5 mass (r = 0. 73 – 0. 80). Overall, mobile source emissions generated through mechanical processes (re-entrained road dust, tire and break wear) and processing by secondary sulfate were major contributors to water-soluble metals known to be capable of generating ROS...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{interpret}} the marine clastic record preserved in the sedimentary basins of the East Asian marginal seas, {{it is important to}} understand how sediment transport and chemical weathering affect the composition of sediment enroute to its sink. Here we present a new data set for fine-grained sediment (< 63  μm) from the Yangtze River and its major tributaries, which represents a baseline for interpreting sediment in the East China Sea. We demonstrate that there is no significant coherent downstream variation in the major element contents, which are generally more enriched than the average upper continental crust, except for <b>water-soluble</b> <b>elements</b> including Sr, Rb, Na, and K. Nd isotopes show that most of the sediment comes from the eastern and middle Yangtze Craton, as well as the Songpan-Garze Terrane. Chemical weathering varies significantly across the basin with upstream tributary sediments being relatively unweathered compared to those in the lower reaches. However, sediments in the main Yangtze stream show no trend in chemical weathering along its course, with some of the least weathered materials being found closest to the delta. Grain size and the abundance of hydrodynamically sorted heavy minerals affect the bulk geochemistry, especially the rare earth elements (REEs).|$|R

However, the chemical characteristics of different particulate size ranges and the biological mechanisms responsible for these adverse health effects are not well known. The principal aims of this thesis were to validate a high volume cascade impactor (HVCI) for the collection of particulate matter for physicochemical and toxicological studies, and to make an in-depth chemical and source characterisation of samples collected during different pollution situations. The particulate samples were collected with the HVCI, virtual impactors and a Berner low pressure impactor in six European cities: Helsinki, Duisburg, Prague, Amsterdam, Barcelona and Athens.

Destruction of rock by explosives exposes new surface areas {{with an abundance of}} <b>water-soluble</b> <b>elements.</b> The common remediation technique used for acid mine water is treatment with lime or with caustic soda. These tech-niques are not effective enough to keep the environment free of residues and don’t provide a sustainable treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD). The long- term environmental result of treatment with caustic soda is saline soil and could in addition, lead to irreversible soil sterility. A remediation technique for cleaning highly polluted AMD water should raise the pH and immobilise the heavy metals, keeping them out of the system permanently. With an organic medium – an organic material, a mixture of a specific Casuarina needle and a specific, pine bark with 2 other semi decomposed plants- it was proven that even in pH ranges of below pH 3. 5, high concentrations of Mn and Fe may still be removed. Only, after immobilising and binding heavy metals and treating up to 10, 000 m AMD per day, for at least two years, the organic medium has to be replaced.

Coarse (PM 10 ? 2. 5), accumulation (PM 2. 5 ? 0. 25), and quasi-ultrafine (quasi-UF, PM 0. 25) mode particles were collected weekly at five sampling sites in the Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor and at one site near the University of Southern California campus (urban site). All PM samples were analyzed for organic (total and water-soluble) and elemental carbon, organic species, inorganic ions, and total and <b>water-soluble</b> <b>elements.</b> Quasi-UF mode particles showed the highest redox activity at all Long Beach sites (on both a per-mass and per-air volume basis). A significant association (R 2 = 0. 61) was observed between the two assays, indicating that macrophage ROS and DTT levels are affected at least partially by similar PM species. Relatively small variation was observed for the DTT measurements across all size fractions and sites, whereas macrophage ROS levels showed more significant ranges across the three different particle size modes and throughout the sites (coefficients of variation, or CVs, were 0. 35, 0. 24 and 0. 53 for quasi-UF, accumulation, and coarse mode particles, respectively). Association between the PM constituents and the redox activity was further investigated using multiple linear regression models. The results showed that OC was the most important component influencing the DTT activity of PM samples. The variability of macrophage ROS was explained by changes in OC concentrations and water-soluble vanadium (probably originating from ship emissions ? bunker oil combustion). The multiple regression models were used to predict the average diurnal macrophage ROS and DTT levels {{as a function of the}} OC concentration at one of the sampling sites...|$|R

30|$|The {{transfer}} of crustal {{components in the}} form of fluids at subduction zones occurs in several steps, and the agents of mass transfer vary with time and space (e.g., Bebout 2007; Zheng 2012). While aqueous solutions are primarily responsible for extraction of <b>water-soluble</b> incompatible <b>elements</b> such as LILE from subducting crustal rocks (e.g., Hacker 2008; Bebout 2014), hydrous melts play a dominant role in mobilizing water-insoluble incompatible elements such as LREE from the subducting rocks (e.g., Hermann et al. 2006 a; Zheng et al. 2011 a). The nature of subduction-zone fluids is dictated by dehydration and melting of crustal rocks under different physicochemical conditions. The mobile agents migrate in pervasive and channelized ways at the slab-mantle interface, resulting in geochemical modification of both slab crust and wedge mantle rocks (e.g., Zheng 2012; Bebout 2013). Although we are not able to directly sample pristine fluids from deeply subducted crustal rocks, working backwards from metamorphic, anatectic and magmatic products in UHP metamorphic terranes provides insights into the geochemical property and behavior of subduction-zone fluids at the subarc depths. This overview outlines our present understanding of continental subduction-zone fluids and their implications for chemical geodynamics (Additional file 1 presents the glossary for the subduction factory).|$|R
30|$|Orogenic peridotites {{are common}} in many UHP terranes (Brueckner and Medaris 2000; Nimis and Morten 2000; Zhang et al. 2000), {{providing}} us with an excellent target to study the reaction of subduction-zone fluids with the mantle wedge at the slab-mantle interface in subduction channels (Scambelluri et al. 2007; Zheng 2012). According to the occurrence of crustal derivatives in the orogenic peridotites, two types of crustal metasomatism may take place at mantle depths (Zheng 2012). One is modal metasomatism that is indicated {{by the presence of}} new mineral phases such as serpentine, chlorite, amphibole, phlogopite, apatite, carbonate, sulfide, titanite, ilmenite, and zircon, which are absent in primitive and depleted mantle sources. The metasomatic products may occur in serpentinized to chloritized peridotites or in pyroxenites and hornblendites. The new mineral phases are mineralogically and geochemically distinguishable from primary peridotite minerals. The other is cryptic metasomatism that is indicated by the absence of such new mineral phases but the enrichment of fluid-mobile incompatible trace elements such as LILE and LREE relative to HFSE and HREE. In the extreme case, only enrichment of highly incompatible <b>water-soluble</b> trace <b>elements</b> (e.g., LILE) occurs in orogenic peridotites, similar to the product of fluid metasomatism in forearc settings above oceanic subduction zones.|$|R

The traffic emissions (mainly particles from car exhaust) enriched the ultrafine, submicron, and fine PM particles with elemental carbon.

However, for each PM fraction, the carcinogenic equivalent ratios, assumed as a measure of the hazard from 16 PAHs in this paper, were similar at the two sampling points.

Melting of oceanic crusts cannot produce high-magnesian OIB lavas. Ancient oceanic crusts (> 1 Ga) are isotopically too depleted to meet the required values of most OIB. Subducted oceanic crusts that have passed through subduction zone dehydration {{are likely to be}} depleted in <b>water-soluble</b> incompatible <b>elements</b> (e. g., Ba, Rb, Cs, U, K, Sr, Pb) relative to water-insoluble incompatible elements (e. g., Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti). Melting of residual crusts with such trace element composition cannot produce OIB. Oceanic crusts, if subducted into the lower mantle, will be > 2 % denser than the ambient mantle at shallow lower mantle depths. This negative buoyancy will impede return of the subducted oceanic crusts into the upper mantle. If subducted oceanic crusts melt {{at the base of the}} mantle, the resultant melts are even denser than the ambient peridotitic mantle, perhaps by as much as similar to 15 %. Neither in the solid state nor in melt form can bulk oceanic crusts subducted into the lower mantle return to upper mantle source regions of oceanic basalts. Deep portions of recycled oceanic lithosphere are important geochemical reservoirs hosting volatiles and incompatible elements as a result of metasomatism taking place at the interface between the low-velocity zone and the cooling and thickening oceanic lithosphere.

Vermicomposts contain nutrients such as nitrates, exchangeable phosphorus, soluble potassium, calcium, and magnesium in plant available forms (Orozco et al. 1996; Edwards 1998) and have large particular surface area that provides many microsites for microbial activity and for the strong retention of nutrients (Shi-wei and Fu-zhen 1991). Uptake of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) by rice (Oryza sativa) plant was highest when fertilizer was applied in combination with vermicompost (Jadhav et al. 1997). N uptake by ridge gourd (Luffa acutangula) was higher when the fertilizer mix contained 50 % vermicompost (Sreenivas et al. 2000). Apart from providing mineralogical nutrients, vermicomposts {{also contribute to the}} biological fertility by adding beneficial microbes to soil. Mucus, excreted through the earthworm`s digestive canal, stimulates antagonism and competition between diverse microbial populations resulting in the production of some antibiotics and hormone-like biochemicals, boosting plant growth (Edwards and Bohlen 1996). In addition, mucus accelerates and enhances decomposition of organic matter composing stabilized humic substances which embody <b>water-soluble</b> phytohormonal <b>elements</b> (Edwards and Arancon 2004) and plant-available nutrients at high levels (Atiyeh et al. 2000 c). Adding vermicasts to soil improves soil structure, fertility, plant growth and suppresses diseases caused by soil-borne plant pathogens, increasing crop yield (Chaoui et al. 2002; Scheuerell et al. 2005; Singh et al. 2008). Kale (1995) reported the nutrient status of vermicomposts with organic carbon 9.15 - 17.98 %, total nitrogen 0.5 - 1.5 %, available phosphorus 0.1 - 0.3 %, available potassium 0.15 %, calcium and magnesium 22.70 - 70 mg/ 100 g, copper 2 – 9.3 ppm, zinc 5.7 - 11.5 ppm and available sulphur 128 – 548 ppm.|$|R

Six PM 10 samples (indoor smoker's living room; indoor non-smoker's living room and kitchen; and outdoor Beijing city; winter versus summer) were selected to represent typical indoorBeijing PM 10 environments that contain high particle mass. The PM 10 collected from a kitchen and two smoker's homes had the lowest TD 50 (toxic dosage of PM 10 causing 50 % plasmid DNA damage), being as low as 45 μg ml− 1 (kitchen) and 100 μg ml− 1 (living room), which suggests a high oxidative capacity, with the PM 10 generated in kitchens appearing to be the most toxic. The indoor PM 10 from the non-smoker's home and outdoor PM 10 samples demonstrated high TD 50 values and were deemed less bioreactive (i. e. caused limited DNA damage). FESEM observations revealed that four types of particle species were prevalent in Beijingindoor PM 10; soot aggregates, minerals, coal fly ash and unknown fine particles. IA showed that higher percentages of soot and unknown fine particles were associated with the lower TD 50 values, suggesting that soot and the unknown fine particles may be important components responsible for the observed plasmid DNA damage. The <b>water-soluble</b> trace <b>elements</b> were negatively correlated with the TD 50 values, implying that the DNA damage may be attributed to the water-soluble fraction of the PM 10.

40|$|Mars is wet. Or {{at least}} it was wet. Vast canyons, {{numerous}} gullies, and even possible ocean deposits attest to the presence of abundant water on the planet, but magmas do not seem to have contained much of it. The logical way to transport water to the surface of a planet is in magma that erupts to form volcanoes and lava flows. Where did the water come from if not from magmas? Where did it go? Why are the magmas apparently so dry? Two studies of Martian meteorites may provide answers to these questions. Both use a combination of analyses of meteorites and laboratory experiments. One study, led by Harry Y. (Hap) McSween of the University of Tennessee (UT) and coworkers from UT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Oakridge National Laboratory, and the University of South Florida, measured the abundances of <b>water-soluble</b> trace <b>elements</b> in crystals in a Martian meteorite. They found the centers of the minerals, which formed first and at high pressure, had much more of these elements than the rims. McSween and coworkers cite data showing that the elements are highly soluble in the presence of very hot water. Experiments at MIT show that magma must have contained about 1. 8 wt % H 2 O to crystallize the minerals observed in the Martian meteorite studied. The scientists conclude that magmas have delivered lots of water to the Martian surface. The other study, by Meenakshi (Mini) Wadhwa (Field Museum, Chicago) focused on the concentration of the element europium in six meteorites from Mars. By using experimental data obtained by Gordon McKay and Loan Le (Johnson Space Center), Wadhwa concludes that the magmas in which the meteorites formed experienced varying amounts of interaction with the crust of Mars, which must be oxidized. She suggests that the oxidation is due to chemical reactions of rock and water [...] probably the same water that carved the surface features on Mars. References...|$|R

EF PM and PM constituents were significantly affected by fuel quality, operational mode, and emission standards. A significant correlation (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. [*] 79, p [*]<[*] 0.

40|$|Emissions of volcanoes {{and their}} {{depositions}} {{do have an}} immediate impact on their surrounding environment. In the present study, emissions and depositions of the active volcanic and geothermal system Vulcano (Italy) were investigated by active moss biomonitoring (Fig. 1) {{in the spring of}} 2012. Sphagnum moss bags were exposed for periods of 3 days, 3, 6 and 9 weeks. Soil and rainwater samples as well as meteorological data were also collected. After exposure, mosses were oven-dried, grinded and each sample was extracted either in deionized water or HNO 3 (with H 2 O 2). Extraction solutions were analyzed by ICP-MS for total concentrations of Li, Mg, Sr, Ba, Cr, Mn, S, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Mo, W, Tl, As, Sb, Bi, I, and Se. Soil and rain water samples were analyzed for the same trace elements. For elements such as As and Tl, deionized water extracts showed comparable concentrations to HNO 3 extracts, indicating either the absence of particles or the presence of <b>water-soluble</b> particles. <b>Elements</b> such as Pb, Ba, Se and Sr were only dissolved to about 10 % or less in deionized water, indicating a significant share of water-insoluble particle formation. Distribution patterns of emissions and depositions over the whole island of Vulcano allowed classifying all investigated elements into four groups based on their origin (Fig. 2). Lithium was found ubiquitously on the island thus likely is of either marine or geogenic origin (group a in Fig. 2). The elements Mg, Fe, Sr, Mn, Zn, Co, and W were found predominantly on the crater where bare soil was present, and were grouped as “soilborne elements” (group b). These elements are characterized by deposition close to their source of origin. Elements with higher concentrations at the fumarolic field were grouped according to their transport characteristics. The elements I, Se, Tl, Bi, Sb, As, and S were considered as true volatiles (group c) being found also further away from the fumarolic field than Pb, Cr, Mo, and Ba which were interpreted to be predominantly emitted as particles (group d). Moss-bag biomonitoring proved to be an effective tool for the study of emission and deposition processes in active volcanic areas which also allows a classification of elements accumulated on the moss by their origin and distribution patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{seasonal}} variation and {{spatial distribution of}} atmospheric particles at three islands in the Taiwan Strait were investigated. Atmospheric particles (PM 10) were collected at three offshore islands (i. e., Kinmen islands, Matsu islands, and Penghu Islands) and two coastal regions (i. e., Xiamen and Fuzhou) in the years of 2008 – 2012. Field sampling {{results indicated that the}} average PM 10 concentrations at the Kinmen islands were generally higher than other sampling sites, suggesting that a superimposition phenomenon was regularly observed during the air pollution episodes at Kinmen Islands and Xiamen region. PM 10 samples were analyzed for their chemical composition, including <b>water-soluble</b> ions, metallic <b>elements,</b> and carbonaceous content. The most abundant water-soluble ionic species of PM 10 were recognized as SO 42 –, NO 3 –, and NH 4 +, indicating that PM 10 was mainly composed of secondary inorganic aerosols. Although natural crustal elements dominated the metallic content of PM 10, the most abundant anthropogenic metals of PM 10 were Zn and Pb. Enrichment factor calculations showed that Ni, Cr, and Zn were the enriched elements emitted mainly from anthropogenic sources. Moreover, the OC concentration of PM 10 was always higher than that of EC at all sampling sites. High OC/EC ratios of PM 10 were commonly observed at the sampling sites on the Matsu Islands, the Fuzhou region, and the Penghu Islands. Source apportionment results indicated that vehicular exhausts were the main source of PM 10, and followed by industrial boilers, secondary aerosols, soil dusts, biomass burning, petrochemical plants, steel plants, oceanic spray, and cement plants at the island and coastal sampling sites in the Taiwan Strait...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} characteristics of ambient particulate matters in {{urban and rural}} areas of Hong Kong were determined in this study. A monitoring program starting from November 2000 to February 2001 (winter) and June 2001 to August 2001 (summer) for PM 10 and PM 2. 5 was performed at three monitoring stations in Hong Kong. Twenty-four-hour PM 10 and PM 2. 5 samples were collected once every 6 days at two urban sites, PolyU and KT, and every 12 days at a background site, HT, with Hi-Vol samplers. High concentrations of OC, EC (except in PolyU), <b>water-soluble</b> ions and <b>elements</b> were observed in winter among the three sampling sites for PM 10 and PM 2. 5 fractions. Seasonal variations were significant in background HT. Dilution effect due to the increase in mixing depth and precipitation in summer reduced the concentrations of particulate matters. Long-range transport could contribute to the higher concentrations of particulate matter in the winter. Chemical mass closure calculations were performed for PM 10 and PM 2. 5 observed. Mass closure improved when separate factors (1. 4 and 1. 9 respectively) were used to convert water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and water-insoluble organic carbon (WINSOC) into corresponding organic masses. The urban sites showed high percentages of water-soluble ions in winter and high percentages of carbonaceous species in summer. Better results were obtained for the chemical mass closure analysis in winter than in summer. High temperature and solar radiation in summer increased the rate of the complex photochemical reaction in the atmosphere. Therefore the chemical mass closure analysis would underestimate the volatized species and secondary aerosols during summer. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The 16 th Universiade, an {{international}} multi-sport event, was hosted in Shenzhen, China from 12 to 23 August 2011. During this time, officials instituted the Pearl River Delta action plan {{in order to}} enhance the air quality of Shenzhen. To determine the effect of these controls, the current study examined the trace <b>elements,</b> <b>water-soluble</b> ions, and stable lead isotopic ratios in atmospheric particulate matter (PM) collected during the controlled (when the restrictions were in place) and uncontrolled periods. Fine particles (PM 2. 5) were collected at two sampling sites in Shenzhen: “LG”—a residential building in the Longgang District, with significant point sources around it and “PU”—Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School in the Nanshan District, with no significant point sources. Results from this study showed {{a significant increase in the}} concentrations of elements during the uncontrolled periods. For instance, samples at the LG site showed (controlled to uncontrolled periods) concentrations (in ng·m− 3) of: Fe (152 to 290), As (3. 65 to 8. 38), Pb (9. 52 to 70. 8), and Zn (98. 6 to 286). Similarly, samples at the PU site showed elemental concentrations (in ng·m− 3) of: Fe (114 to 301), As (0. 634 to 8. 36), Pb (4. 86 to 58. 1), and Zn (29. 5 to 259). Soluble Fe ranged from 7 %– 15 % for the total measured Fe, indicating an urban source of Fe. Ambient PM 2. 5 collected at the PU site has an average 206 Pb/ 204 Pb ratio of 18. 257 and 18. 260 during controlled and uncontrolled periods, respectively. The LG site has an average 206 Pb/ 204 Pb ratio of 18. 183 and 18. 030 during controlled and uncontrolled periods, respectively. The 206 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios at the PU and the LG sites during the controlled and uncontrolled periods were similar, indicating a common Pb source. To characterize the sources of trace elements, principal component analysis was applied to the elements and ions. Although the relative importance of each component varied, the major sources for both sites were identified as residual oil combustion, secondary inorganic aerosols, sea spray, and combustion. The PM 2. 5 levels were severely decreased during the controlled period, but it is unclear if this was a result of the controls or change in meteorology...|$|R
40|$|Shipping {{emissions}} {{have significant}} influence on atmospheric environment as well as human health, especially in coastal areas and the harbour districts. However, the contribution of shipping emissions on the environment in China {{still need to be}} clarified especially based on measurement data, with the large number ownership of vessels and the rapid developments of ports, international trade and shipbuilding industry. Pollutants in the gaseous phase (carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, total volatile organic compounds) and particle phase (particulate matter, organic carbon, elemental carbon, sulfates, nitrate, ammonia, metals) in the exhaust from three different diesel-engine-powered offshore vessels in China (350, 600 and 1600  kW) were measured in this study. Concentrations, fuel-based and power-based emission factors for various operating modes as well as the impact of engine speed on emissions were determined. Observed concentrations and emission factors for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, total volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter were higher for the low-engine-power vessel (HH) than for the two higher-engine-power vessels (XYH and DFH); for instance, HH had NO x EF (emission factor) of 25. 8  g kWh − 1 compared to 7. 14 and 6. 97  g kWh − 1 of DFH, and XYH, and PM EF of 2. 09  g kWh − 1 compared to 0. 14 and 0. 04  g kWh − 1 of DFH, and XYH. Average emission factors for all pollutants except sulfur dioxide in the low-engine-power engineering vessel (HH) were significantly higher than that of the previous studies (such as 30. 2  g kg − 1 fuel of CO EF compared to 2. 17 to 19. 5  g kg − 1 fuel in previous studies, 115  g kg − 1 fuel of NO x EF compared to 22. 3 to 87  g kg − 1 fuel in previous studies and 9. 40  g kg − 1 fuel of PM EF compared to 1. 2 to 7. 6  g kg − 1 fuel in previous studies), while for the two higher-engine-power vessels (DFH and XYH), most of the average emission factors for pollutants were comparable to the results of the previous studies, engine type {{was one of the most}} important influence factors for the differences. Emission factors for all three vessels were significantly different during different operating modes. Organic carbon and elemental carbon were the main components of particulate matter, while <b>water-soluble</b> ions and <b>elements</b> were present in trace amounts. The test inland ships and some test offshore vessels in China always had higher EFs for CO, NO x, and PM than previous studies. Besides, due to the significant influence of engine type on shipping emissions and that no accurate local EFs could be used in inventory calculation, much more measurement data for different vessels in China are still in urgent need. Best-fit engine speeds during actual operation should be based on both emission factors and economic costs...|$|R

However, studies on the characteristics of PM and its composition emitted from diesel vehicles are still scarce, especially under real-world driving conditions. In this study, six excavators and five trucks that provided a wide range of emission standards and operation modes were tested, and PM emissions and their constituents - including organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), <b>water-soluble</b> ions (WSIs), <b>elements,</b> and organic species like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), n-alkanes, and hopanes - as well as steranes were analyzed and characterized. The average emission factors for PM (EFPM) from excavator and truck emissions were 829 +/- 806 and 498 +/- 234 mgkg(- 1) fuel, respectively. EFPM and PM constituents were significantly affected by fuel quality, operational mode, and emission standards. A significant correlation (R- 2 = 0. 79, p < 0. 01) was found between EFPM for excavators and the sulfur contents in fuel. The highest average EFPM for working excavators was 904 +/- 979 mgkg(- 1) fuel as a higher engine load required in this mode. From pre-stage 1 to stage 2, the average EFPM for excavators decreased by 58 %. For trucks, the average nonhighway EFPM at 548 +/- 311 mgkg(- 1) fuel was higher than the highway EFPM at 497 +/- 231 mgkg(- 1) fuel. Moreover, the reduction rates were 63. 5 and 65. 6 % when switched from China II and III to China IV standards, respectively. Generally, the PM composition emitted from excavators was dominated by OC (39. 2 +/- 21. 0 %) and EC (33. 3 +/- 25. 9 %); PM from trucks was dominated by EC (26. 9 +/- 20. 8 %), OC (9. 89 +/- 12 %), and WSIs (4. 67 +/- 5. 74 %). The average OC/EC ratios for idling and working excavators were 3 to 4 times higher than those for moving excavators. Although the EFPM for excavators and trucks was reduced with the constraint of regulations, the element fractions for excavators increased from 0. 49 % in pre-stage 1 to 3. 03 % in stage 2, and the fraction of WSIs for the China IV truck was 5 times higher than the average value of all other-level trucks. Furthermore, as compared with other diesel vehicles, wide ranges were found for excavators of the ratios of benzo[a] anthracene/(benzo[a] anthracene + chrysene) (0. 26 - 0. 86), indeno[1, 2, 3 -cd] pyrene/(indeno[1, 2, 3 -cd] pyrene + benzo[ghi] perylene) (0. 20 - 1. 0), and fluoranthene = (fluoranthene C pyrene) (0. 24 - 0. 87), which might be a result of the complex characteristics of the excavator operation modes. A comparison of our results with those in the literature revealed that on-board measurement data more accurately reflect actual conditions. Although the fractions of the 16 priority PAHs in PM from the excavator and truck emissions were similar, the equivalent concentrations of total benzo[a] pyrene of excavators were 31 times than that for trucks, implying that more attention should be paid to non-road vehicle emissions...|$|R
