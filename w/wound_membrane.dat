The theoretical principle of process of precipitate removal from membrane surface in spiral <b>wound</b> <b>membrane</b> module was substantiated. The proposed method of regeneration allows recovering membrane flux without loss of selectivity and mechanical properties. The physical and mathematical models of fouled spiral <b>wound</b> <b>membrane</b> modules regeneration using of temperature cavitation phenomenon under subatmospheric pressure were developed. The equations of mass transfer kinetics in system liquid ? solid were expanded to marrow conditions in membrane channel. The objective laws of mass transfer during cake layer removal in channel of spiral <b>wound</b> <b>membrane</b> modules were defined experimentally. The results were generalized in a form of dimensionless equation for mass transportation equations coefficient determination. The proposed equation is reliable in a range of Reynolds from 0, 4 to 60. The proposed mathematical model was solved using numerical methods. The calculations using mathematical model were carried out and influence of hydrodynamic conditions, process temperature and cleaning solutions volume is determinated. The most rational flow regime is corresponding to Reynolds number values in a range from 15 to 25. The impact of process temperature and cleaning solution volume is negligible. It was experimentally defined that using of temperature cavitation phenomenon promote of increasing of intensity of cake layer removal process from membrane surface in spiral wound module. The regeneration can be carried out using environmentally acceptable cleaning solutions such as desalinated water and solutions of citric acid and sodium hydrocarbonate. The experimental examination of regeneration process effectiveness was carried out. The possibility of membrane flux recover for 90 ? 95 % was proved. It was shown by the experimental determination of total resistance to flux through the membrane of clean membrane module, fouled membrane module and regenerated membrane module that increase membrane flux after regeneration has occurred due to decreasing of cake layer resistance. Those results prove the principles of proposed physical model. The influence of technological parameters on mass transfer effectiveness during cake layer removal using temperature cavitation phenomenon was determinated. The methods of process intensification using periodical operating pressure increasing were substantiated. The effectiveness of periodical operating pressure increasing as an intensification technique which allows increase regeneration coefficient in 1, 5 times was proved. The factors which influence on regeneration process effectiveness were determinated using experiment planning method. The regression equations were obtained. The recommendations for using of proposed technique of fouled spiral <b>wound</b> <b>membrane</b> modules regeneration under absolute pressure of 0, 005 - 0, 009 MPa and operating temperature of 45 ?C were developed. The method of regeneration of spiral <b>wound</b> <b>membrane</b> modules regeneration and variants of technological schemes for its realization were proposed.

These spiral <b>wound</b> <b>membrane</b> modules contain mesh-like spacer structures {{used to create}} an intermembrane space and improve water mixing. Spacers create inhomogeneous water flow patterns resulting in zones favouring biofilm growth, possibly leading to biofouling thus hampering water production. Oxygen sensing planar optodes were used to visualize variations in oxygen decrease rates (ODR). ODR {{is an indication of}} biofilm activity. In this study, ODR images of multiple repetitive spacer areas in a membrane fouling simulator were averaged to produce high resolution, low noise ODR images. Averaging 40 individual spacer areas improved the ODR distribution image significantly and allowed comparison of biofilm patterning over a spacer structure at different positions in an RO filter. This method clearly showed that most active biofilm accumulated on and in direct vicinity of the spacer. The averaging method was also used to calculate the deviation of ODR patterning from individual spacer areas to the average ODR pattern, proposing a new approach to determine biofilm spatial heterogeneity. This study showed that the averaging method can be applied and that the improved, averaged ODR images can be used as an analytical, in-situ, non-destructive method to assess and quantify the effect of membrane installation operational parameters or different spacer geometries on biofilm development in spiral <b>wound</b> <b>membrane</b> systems characterized by complex hydrodynamic conditions...|$|E

How these molecules enter target cells is not fully understood. It is debated whether granzymes enter via perforin pores formed at the plasma membrane or whether perforin and granzymes are first endocytosed and granzymes are then released from endosomes into the cytoplasm. We previously showed that perforin disruption of the plasma membrane induces a transient Ca 2 + flux into the target cell that triggers a <b>wounded</b> <b>membrane</b> repair response in which lysosomes and endosomes donate their membranes to reseal the damaged membrane. Here we show that perforin activates clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis, which removes perforin and granzymes from the plasma membrane to early endosomes, preserving outer membrane integrity. Inhibiting clathrin- or dynamin-dependent endocytosis shifts death by perforin and granzyme B from apoptosis to necrosis.

The goal {{of this study was}} to 1), determine the size of <b>membrane</b> <b>wounds</b> as a function of time after in vitro sonication of DU 145 prostate cancer cells under conditions that caused extensive acoustic cavitation; and 2), theoretically model transport processes leading to intracellular loading. Our overall hypothesis was that intracellular loading is governed by passive diffusion through porous <b>membrane</b> <b>wounds</b> of up to 300 -nm radius containing pores that permit entry of molecules up to at least 28 -nm radius over a timescale of minutes. Experimental measurements showed intracellular loading of molecules with radii from 0. 6 to 28 nm, where most loading occurred after sonication over a timescale up to minutes and where smaller molecules were taken up to a greater extent and over a longer timescale than larger molecules. Theoretical modeling predicted that <b>membrane</b> <b>wounds</b> would have a 300 -nm radius initially and then would shrink, with a half life of 20 to 50 s. Uptake was shown to occur predominantly by diffusion and the increasing levels of uptake with decreasing molecular size was explained primarily by differences in molecular diffusivity and, for the largest molecule, geometrical hindrance within the wound. Mathematical modeling was simplified, because transport through porous wounds of possibly complex internal nanostructure was governed largely by transport at the edge of the wound, and depended only weakly on the size, number, and distribution of nanopores within the wound under the conditions relevant to this study.

Gastroenterology. 96 : 1238 - 1248) and the transient plasma <b>membrane</b> <b>wounds</b> shown here to occur in endothelial cells under normal culturing conditions. Scraping of endothelial cells from the culturing substratum released into the culture medium a potent growth-promoting activity for Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts...|$|R

This paper summarises a potential of {{membrane separation}} process, namely ultrafiltration and nanofiltration, in fractionation of whey components, such as proteins and lactose. It also brings data from desalination of lactose from natural salty whey (from various Czech dairies). Whey was treated by pilot-plant ultrafiltration (Bollene, France) on tubular ceramic membranes (Membralox, Pall) and obtained permeates were purified by nanofiltration spiral <b>wound</b> <b>membranes.</b> We compared two different commercial nanofiltration membranes NTR- 7450 -S 2 F (Nitto Denko) and FILMTEC NF 270 - 2540 (Dow) under various conditions. Permeate flow rates on the 500 nm ultrafiltration membrane achieved 6. 9 – 44. 5  L/h. m 2. bar and mass concentration factors were 1. 2 – 16. 5. This value suggests potential industrial application. Lactose apparent rejections on NTR- 7450 -S 2 F were {{in a range of}} 82 – 98 % and slightly lower (82 – 90 %) on the FILMTEC NF 270 - 2540 membrane. Rejections of ions were comparable for both membranes. All experiments confirmed severe membrane fouling on both membranes...|$|R

Feed spacers employed in conventional spiral <b>wound</b> <b>membranes</b> create turbulence to minimise concentration polarisation. Research demonstrates that feed spacers can enhance biological growth within membrane elements. In combination with the strong link between fouling and surface hydrophobicity chemical modification of feed spacers could help counteract biofouling potential. In this study, an evaluation of feed spacers coated with diglyme using plasma polymerisation was assessed. Low energy density treatment was associated {{with an increase in}} biofouling, compared with the control, consistent with insufficient cross-linking of the diglyme monomer to the spacer surface. Increasing energy density treatment resulted in fouling performance approaching that of, or slightly better than the control. It is possible that batch recirculation type experiments may not best facilitate assessment of biofouling potential in single-pass cross-flow membrane systems. The study demonstrated that plasma treatment of conventional feed spacers has potential to reduce affinity for bacterial attachment, and may provide a viable and complementary approach to direct membrane surface modification for biofouling control. Further studies to quantify changes associated with diglyme plasma polymerisation and establish optimum conditions for biofouling minimisation are recommended. © 2013, Elsevier B. V...|$|R
