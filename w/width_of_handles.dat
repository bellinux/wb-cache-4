50|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of full and partial tang designs. In perhaps the most common design in full tang knives, the handle is cut {{in the shape of the}} tang and handle scales are then {{fastened}} to the tang by means of pins, screws, bolts, metal tubing, epoxy, etc. The tang is left exposed along the belly, butt, and spine <b>of</b> the <b>handle,</b> extending both the full length and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>handle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{extent of}} the stick head along the X+ axis, towards the 'heel' of the Head is {{confined}} by the rule requirement that the stick head and the handle meet in a smooth continuous fashion at the line C-C and by a rule restriction on the shape <b>of</b> the <b>handle,</b> {{which is that the}} stick-handle must not project beyond the line B1-B1. It is possible to envisage a stick where the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>handle</b> did not extend beyond the line A1-A1, thus allowing a significant extension of the stick head along the X+ axis, but the practicalities of such a design seem to be limited and have not been explored. The length of the Head (or toe) along the X- axis has varied enormously, especially since the Second World War and again after the introduction of the timber lamination process in the early 1980s.|$|R

5000|$|According to the {{original}} description by Barclay Philips, [...] In the earth with which the coffin was filled were numerous small fragments of carious bone, apparently charred, {{some of which were}} picked out; and about the centre, as if, said one of the men, they had rested on the breast of the body interred, were found the following curious relics: —An Amber Cup, hemispherical in shape, rather deep in proportion to its width, with a [...] " [...] lip [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] nick," [...] and ornamented merely with a band of fine lines running round the outside, about half an inch from the top. There is one handle, large enough for the insertion of a finger, ornamented with a fillet {{on each side of the}} surface, which is flat, similar to that on the cup itself. From the fact of the rim not being perfectly round, and the band before mentioned not passing over the space within the handle, and its being marked off with a line at each end, seemingly cut across, we may conjecture it to have been made and carved by hand. There are two small chips in the rim.That on the left <b>of</b> the <b>handle</b> is fresh, and was caused by the man who found the cup accidentally striking it, as he told me, with his spade, when he first came upon it that on the right is not so large, but is ancient, as is shown by its appearance. The cup is perfectly smooth inside and out, excepting where the earth in which it was buried still adheres to the surface but since its exhumation the amber has cracked slightly in every part. On the cup being lifted by the handle, this broke into two pieces, having received a blow from the workman's spade, but fortunately the fragments fit very exactly, and I have therefore easily repaired it.The following are the dimensions of the cup, which I have carefully measured, expressed in inches and decimal parts: — External diameter, 3.5 inches; internal, 3.35. Height, 2.5 depth, 2.4. Internal diameter at and below band, 3'; <b>width</b> <b>of</b> lip, '125. Distance of band from upper rim <b>of</b> lip, [...]5; <b>width</b> <b>of</b> band of six fillets, [...]3. <b>Width</b> <b>of</b> <b>handle</b> at upper and lower end, 1.5 in centre,"6.

Projection <b>of</b> <b>handle</b> from surface <b>of</b> cup to outer surface <b>of</b> <b>handle,</b> [...]85; average thickness of cup, [...]2.According to these measurements I find, by calculation, that the capacity of the cup is a little more than half a pint.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{permitted}} <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>handle</b> (51 mm) {{is illustrated}} in the diagram by {{the distance between the}} dotted lines A-A and A1-A1. A hockey stick handle will rarely be of the maximum permitted width: most are between 46 mm and 48 mm at the widest point. The maximum permitted 'deviation' is shown by the lines B-B and B1-B1 respectively. The line B-B is 20 mm further along the X- axis than the line A-A and the line B1-B1 is 20 mm further along the X+ axis than the line A1-A1. There is no limit to the length of a protrusion along the y-axis specified, so the deviation curve or curves may be of any length {{along the length of the}} stick-handle. Some goalkeeping sticks have an outward curve on the toe side (within the line B-B) that extends for almost half the total length of the stick.|$|R

50|$|Riders use {{modified}} motocross bikes with after market {{parts to}} lower weight and improve performance. Riders will often shave down the seat foam {{to give a}} wider range of motion and better grip on the seat. Steering stabilizers are also common, and help keep the front tire running straight when tricks requiring the rider to let go <b>of</b> the <b>handle</b> bars are performed. Many riders will also shorten the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>handle</b> bars, {{to make it easier to}} put the legs around the bars, like such tricks as the 'heelclicker' or 'rodeo'. Excess cables, such as brakes and clutch cables are usually redirected away from the bars, to avoid riders getting their boots caught on the bike. The engine and mechanical details of a FMX bike are fairly stock, not needing the fine tuning of a racing bike. Riders may also choose to have 'lever' on their handlebars to help then when performing 'Kiss Of Death Backflips.' A 'lever' is usually a metal plate or pipe coming off the handle bars, and going in front of the riders wrist or lower arm to stop the rider from rotating during the flips, but letting the bike continue to move. Bikes have after market performance pipes that give more power. The bike must have very strong suspension and very high quality tires.|$|R

The main objective of a workout session is to induce an adaptation stimulus, which requires overload of involved muscles by voluntary effort, yet this overload may be highly influenced {{by the size of}} the spinal cord lesion. Krancykl construction is designed to allow exercise on any wheelchair and with adjustable height or <b>width</b> <b>of</b> crank <b>handles,</b> where even the grip handle may be altered. The aim of this study was to determine the differences in body composition, performance and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) in paraplegics with a different level of paralyses after a 12 week training programme of a unilateral regime on Krankcycle equipment (a crank machine). The study sample included four men and one women at a different spine lesion level. The 12 weeks programme was successfully completed by four participants, while one subject got injured during the intervention process. Three participants were paraplegics and one was quadriplegic with innervation of the biceps humeri, triceps humeri and deltoideus. The Krankcycle 30 min programme was followed by four other exercises, which were performed after themselves rather than in a circuit training manner as the latter would result in much longer rest periods between exercises, because paraplegics have to be fixed by straps during exercise on hydraulic machines. The RPE after the workout decreased following the twelve week adaptation period...|$|R

5000|$|It will be {{appreciated}} after {{a glance at}} the illustration of the 'English' style hockey stick that stopping a ball on the ground with the handle held vertically would not be easy. If the ball is lined up centrally with the centre <b>of</b> the <b>handle</b> (red) it would be likely to deflect off the heel side of the head. Even with the ball positioned central to the head (blue) stopping would not have been very secure with an upright handle. Presenting the stick at an angle of 35° or more (40° in the illustration) solves the problem of the ball running off the head by presenting a very long area behind the ball (relative to the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the ball) but presents the problem of the best or optimum position to stop the ball for the following action. For hitting the optimum positions seems to be where a line projected through {{the leading edge of the}} shaft <b>of</b> the <b>handle</b> passes through the centre of the ball because it is the position closest to the centre line <b>of</b> the <b>handle</b> where the entire <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the head is behind the ball. Stopping the ball closer to the toe of the stick is acceptable but not optimal, as adjustment, which takes time, is necessary before the next intended action. [...] In the modern stick the vertical handle position is still not as secure as an angled presentation <b>of</b> the <b>handle</b> but the angle now can be considerably less, because of the tighter heel bend and the stopping and hitting positions of the ball are easier to determine. The line of the leading edge <b>of</b> the <b>handle</b> still projects close to the center of the ball when the angle <b>of</b> the stick <b>handle</b> is in the 30°-50° range and a line through the centre <b>of</b> the <b>handle</b> will project to the back and underside of the ball.|$|R
