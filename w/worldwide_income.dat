40|$|In this paper, I {{place the}} United States’ {{adherence}} to citizenship-based taxation {{in the context}} of the states’ tax systems. Forty-one states impose general income taxes on the <b>worldwide</b> <b>incomes</b> of their respective residents. These state tax systems are important repositories of experience that confirm the administrative benefits of citizenship-based taxation. Domicile today plays an important role in state tax systems as a gap-filler when more objective statutory residence laws fail to assign any state of residence to the taxpayer. Citizenship is an administrable proxy for domicile and serves a similar gap-filling role in the taxation of individuals whose income and activities straddle national boundaries...|$|R

Moreover, non-residents are also taxed on certain Swiss assets or on the income from certain Swiss sources, such as from real estate, permanent business establishments or pensions. The income and assets of spouses are pooled and taxed jointly, but at a lower rate to offset the effects of tax progression.|$|E
25|$|The Isle of Man is a low-tax {{economy with}} no capital gains tax, wealth tax, stamp duty, or {{inheritance}} tax {{and a top}} rate of income tax of 20%. A tax cap is in force; {{the maximum amount of}} tax payable by an individual is £120,000 or £240,000 for couples if they choose to have their incomes jointly assessed. The £120,000 tax cap equates to an assessable income of £589,550. Personal income is assessed and taxed on a total <b>worldwide</b> <b>income</b> basis rather than a remittance basis. This means that all income earned throughout the world is assessable for Manx tax rather than only income earned in or brought into the Island.|$|E

40|$|Taxation of Personal Income (a {{comparison}} of the legislation in the Czech republic and selected countries of EU) The topic of taxation of personal income has been chosen {{by the author of}} this diploma thesis. The original purpose was to describe and analyze the legislation in two states, Czech Republic and Slovak Republic, which had existed as a common state more than 70 years in the 20 th century. Therefore it could be interesting to follow up, what had happened during the last 20 years after the disintegration of the common state. This thesis is divided into five parts (including an introduction and a conclusion), which are generally subdivided into the chapters and subchapters. The thesis was written in accordance with the law applicable on the 1 st October 2013. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the author deals with the Czech laws regulating an income tax of individuals. She defines and briefly explains an essential terminology related to that part of legislation including some proposed amendments of the Acts. As a main source the Law on Income Taxes, no. 586 / 1992 was used.

40|$|The {{current system}} of taxing the income of {{multinational}} firms in the United States is flawed across multiple dimensions. The system provides an artificial tax incentive to earn income in low-tax countries, rewards aggressive tax planning, and is not compatible with any common metrics of efficiency. The U. S. system is also notoriously complex; observers are nearly unanimous in lamenting the heavy compliance burdens and the impracticality of coherent enforcement. Further, despite a corporate tax rate one standard deviation above that of other OECD countries, the U. S. corporate tax system raises relatively little revenue, {{due in part to}} the shifting of income outside the U. S. tax base. In this proposal, we advocate moving to a system of formulary apportionment for taxing the corporate income of multinational firms. Under our proposal, the U. S. tax base for multinational corporations would be calculated based on a fraction of their <b>worldwide</b> <b>incomes.</b> This fraction would be the sum of (1) a fixed return on their expenses in the United States and (2) the share of their worldwide sales that occur in the United States. This system is similar in significant respects to the current 2 ̆ 2 residual profit split 2 ̆ 2 method of the U. S. transfer pricing regulations and the OECD Guidelines, as well as to the current method that U. S. states use to allocate national income across states...|$|R

The income shifting is then inferred by comparing shares of after-tax profits, assets and sales of the affiliated members.
