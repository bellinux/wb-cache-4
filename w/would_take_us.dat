They <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> back to a meaner time when money was the measure of all things. We stand for the future that was sought and won and which must now be defended and enhanced.|$|E
500|$|Orbital {{inclination}} has a 100 ka periodicity, while eccentricity's 95 and 125ka periods could inter-react {{to give a}} 108ka effect. While it {{is possible}} that the less significant, and originally overlooked, inclination variability has a deep effect on climate, the eccentricity only modifies insolation by a small amount: 1–2% of the shift caused by the 21,000-year precession and 41,000-year obliquity cycles. [...] Such a big impact from inclination would therefore be disproportionate in comparison to other cycles. One possible mechanism suggested to account for this was the passage of Earth through regions of cosmic dust. Our eccentric orbit <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> through dusty clouds in space, which would act to occlude some of the incoming radiation, shadowing the Earth.|$|E
500|$|Conditions, however, had not {{improved}} since the earlier attempt. Temperatures had risen {{and it was}} uncomfortably warm, with men sinking to their knees in soft snow as they struggled to haul the boats through the pressure ridges. [...] On 27 December ship’s carpenter Harry McNish rebelled and refused to work. He argued that Ship’s Articles had lapsed since Endurance’s sinking, {{and that he was}} no longer under orders. Shackleton’s firm remonstrance finally brought the carpenter to heel, but the incident was never forgotten. [...] Two days later, with only seven and a half miles’ (12km) progress achieved in seven back-breaking days, Shackleton called a halt, observing: [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> over three hundred days to reach the land". The crew put up their tents and settled into what Shackleton called [...] "Patience Camp", which would be their home for more than three months.|$|E

2500|$|Despite an {{effective}} demonstration, {{the project was}} abandoned, and eventually more conventional solutions, such as those based on radar, became available. Skinner complained that [...] "our problem was no one <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> seriously." [...] It seemed that few people would trust pigeons to guide a missile, no matter how reliable the system appeared to be.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 June, a solo {{interview}} by Fletcher {{was published by}} Fabulous magazine in time for Father's Day. Fletcher stated that [...] "McBusted {{was an opportunity to}} have fun without knowing where it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>us,</b> but McFly is for life. McBusted has been amazing fun, but it's not where our passion is. McFly is more than a band, we live and breathe it. We want to make album number six." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “Our goalkeeper Asım Tevfik, left-forwarder Emin Bülent {{and right}} midfielder Ali Sami Yen were {{commissioned}} {{for the task}} of determining the new team colours. After we had {{been in and out}} of several shops, we saw two different elegant-looking wool materials in Fat Yanko’s store at Bahçekapısı (between Eminönü and Sirkeci in Istanbul, now called Bahçekapı). One of them was quite dark red, resembling the cherry colour, and the other a rich yellow with a touch of orange. When the sales clerk made the two fabrics fly together with a twist of his hand they became so bright that it reminded us of the beauty of a goldfinch. We thought we were looking at the colours flickering in burning fire. We were picturing the yellow-red flames shining on our team and dreaming that it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> to victories. Indeed it did.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should say}} {{we had better}} keep along by {{the edge of the}} bush, {{and see if we can}} strike some other path. It would be useless to go back by this one, as it <b>would</b> simply <b>take</b> <b>us</b> to the place we started from." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{should have}} sunk into English mud, for eternity, {{as sure as}} our metal and {{kentledge}} <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>us</b> down," [...] responded Tom; [...] "such a point-blanker would have torn off a streak of our wales, outboard, and not even left the marines time to say a prayer!--tend bow there!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Dodge {{approached}} Jacques Gershkovitch, a Russian immigrant in Portland guest {{conducting the}} Portland Symphony (which {{would later become}} the Oregon Symphony), about the orchestra after seeing him conduct. Though Gershkovitch first explained {{that he did not}} teach children, Dodge insisted that he come listen to the youth ensemble she had assembled. One orchestra member recalled: [...] "I well remember the excitement of that night when Gershkovitch climbed the stairs to Mary Dodge's attic, where we had assembled to play for him. He listened as we played our hearts out. He applauded us and said that if we got the missing instruments, he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> on." [...] In an attempt to hand over the baton to Gershkovitch, he simply stated [...] "I take." [...] Initially, Dodge remained as associate director of the orchestra; she also assisted with sectionals, appointed a board of directors, and designated the ensemble as the Portland Junior Symphony Orchestra in 1924. The original board of directors established the mission of the orchestra: [...] "to encourage appreciation and rendition of orchestral music by young people, to give public symphonic and popular concerts, to discover and develop latent talent among the children of Portland." [...] Six years later, Dodge resigned while the orchestra was financially sound. She continued to teach and became increasingly dedicated to a scientific approach to bowing. Dodge died in 1954.|$|E
2500|$|With most of {{the album}} being revamped, other musicians joined the project, {{including}} Midi Mafia, RedOne, Toby Gad, Frank Ocean, and Brian Kennedy, the latter of which was consulted to replace Cox as the album's executive producer. Together, they crafted a bunch of new songs, including [...] "Freedom", [...] "One Thing" [...] and [...] "Today" [...] which Norwood later described as sounding [...] "more true to the sound" [...] that she had initially envisioned for the album. However, in early 2008, her A manager, Brandon Creed, presented Norwood several demo tracks that were produced by Rodney Jerkins, including [...] "Right Here (Departed)". Her former main producer on previous albums such as Never Say Never (1998) and Full Moon (2002), Jerkins hadn't worked with Norwood since 2002, due to conflicting schedules and a disagreement on her decision to work with Timbaland on Afrodisiac in 2003. Again, the album was reconstructed, with Jerkins taking over executive duties. On her decision to collaborate with Jerkins, Norwood commented: [...] "With Rodney being the person who produced , I, of course, wanted to go from there because of our history and all the music we have made in the past. It felt like {{the right thing to}} do [...] I wanted to see where that chemistry <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> creatively this time round." [...] With Jerkins on board, providing the bulk of Human, the sound of the album shifted drastically, with Norwood and her team abandoning most R records in favour of his international pop sounds.|$|E

"I don't wish {{to throw}} our lives away, chief; if I wanted to throw my own away, I {{have no right}} to {{sacrifice}} yours and your men's; but scouts on the look out <b>would</b> surely <b>take</b> <b>us</b> at a distance for a party of their own men returning from some plundering expedition, probably as part of the party ahead, who had hung back for some purpose on the road." ...|$|R

25|$|However, Richard D. Gill {{has argued}} that Jaynes {{misunderstood}} Bell's analysis. Gill {{points out that in}} the same conference volume in which Jaynes argues against Bell, Jaynes confesses to being extremely impressed by a short proof by Steve Gull presented at the same conference, that the singlet correlations could not be reproduced by a computer simulation of a local hidden variables theory. According to Jaynes (writing nearly 30 years after Bell's landmark contributions), it <b>would</b> probably <b>take</b> <b>us</b> another 30 years to fully appreciate Gull's stunning result.|$|R

60|$|In {{this place}} I began to {{consider}} that the Canary and Cape de Verde islands lay not for off: but having no instrument, I knew not what latitude, or when to stand off to sea for them; yet my hopes were, I should {{meet some of the}} English trading vessels, who <b>would</b> relieve and <b>take</b> <b>us</b> in.|$|R

60|$|It {{was past}} noon when the Dawn anchored; {{and the wind}} got more to the eastward, {{about half an hour}} afterwards.
