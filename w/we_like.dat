The group originally formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers {{while they were}} still attending high school.

5|$|We {{probably}} have more influences than {{we know what}} to do with. We have two main styles that have been influences. For instance, <b>we</b> <b>like</b> Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set if we get a chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.|$|E

5000|$|On {{his death}} in 1760, Buffon gave him a glowing homage : [...] "Mirabaud always joined feeling to esprit, and <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> to read him just as <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> to hear him but he had so little {{attachment}} to what he produced, he so feared the noise and glare, that he sacrificed those which could contribute most to his glory [...] » ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{wanted to}} make our own games. We already {{designed}} and developed Ironsword, and didn't {{really want to do}} any more of that kind of work. But {{if we were going to}} do a sequel to anything, it may have well been something <b>we</b> <b>liked,</b> and I think <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> the original Jetpac.

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>like</b> {{fair play}} and straightforwardness. We {{have a deep}} {{interest}} {{and a sense of}} responsibility for {{what goes on in the}} wider world. We both share a commitment to global trade and have both traditionally promoted strong trans-Atlantic links. Furthermore, as former colonial powers, we both have important international interests.|$|E
25|$|In August 1968, before Cream officially disbanded, Bruce {{recorded}} {{an acoustic}} free jazz album with John McLaughlin, Dick Heckstall-Smith and Jon Hiseman. This was issued in 1970 as Bruce's second solo album, Things <b>We</b> <b>Like.</b> The album was {{a precursor to}} the jazz fusion boom in the early 1970s, and more recently has been sampled by many hip hop artists Artifacts and Smif-N-Wessun.|$|E

25|$|We clam {{up and get}} tense. But I {{think the}} {{national}} show will improve {{in the next few}} weeks. We want to include the best segments of IMT in the national show. IMT is a lot more spontaneous than the national show – we've run up to an hour overtime. <b>We</b> <b>like</b> to get the audience to participate and if we can find someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts and just adlib.|$|E
25|$|The Bohr–Mollerup theorem {{is useful}} {{because it is}} {{relatively}} easy to prove logarithmic convexity for any of the different formulas used to define the gamma function. Taking things further, instead of defining the gamma function by any particular formula, we can choose the conditions of the Bohr–Mollerup theorem as the definition, and then pick any formula <b>we</b> <b>like</b> that satisfies the conditions {{as a starting point for}} studying the gamma function. This approach was used by the Bourbaki group.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know where}} this will lead, if anywhere, but the right thing is {{to sit down and}} have these conversations and see if we want our {{championship}} in more than eight cities or do <b>we</b> <b>like</b> playing exclusively in domes. None of the cities where we play our championship is named New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago or Miami. We don't play on a campus. We play in professional football arenas.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, the Los Angeles Times ran a 1,500-word feature {{article about}} the Avenel project. [...] At that time, one of three {{remaining}} original residents, Serril Gerber, told the Times {{that he and his}} wife had joined with nine other couples in seeking out Ain, hiring him to build a low-cost complex with a high quality of design. Gerber said, [...] "We'd seen these modern houses in magazines, and <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> the idea of having a living space that is both indoors and outdoors. <b>We</b> <b>liked</b> the idea of doing something really modern, and <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> Greg. He was a radical person in his thinking, because he wanted to put his ideas in the service of regular people. That was his mission, really." [...] Each couple contributed $11,000 to the project.|$|R

500|$|Popular French bands such as Justice, Daft Punk and Phoenix {{have been}} known to include {{influences}} of The Age of Plastic. Justice said that they were [...] "totally fascinated by The Buggles’ first album [...] It’s full of stuff <b>we</b> <b>like</b> - there’s a bit of electro, a bit of pop, a bit of classical going on there… <b>We</b> <b>like</b> the way they operated too, as an autonomous duo…" ...|$|E
500|$|We cannot {{agree on}} a word that <b>we</b> <b>like,</b> let alone a title that <b>we</b> <b>like.</b> In fact, the only word that even means anything, that even says anything, is [...] "jaws".

[...] He said, [...] "Okay, we'll call the thing Jaws.|$|E
500|$|Despite the film's {{failure to}} enjoy {{immediate}} success, Wiseau paid {{to keep the}} billboard up for over five years, {{at the cost of}} [...] a month. Its bizarre imagery and longevity led to it becoming a minor tourist attraction. When asked how he managed to afford to keep the billboard up for so long in such a prominent location, Wiseau responded: [...] "Well, <b>we</b> <b>like</b> the location, and <b>we</b> <b>like</b> the billboard. So we feel that people should see The Room. [...] we are selling DVDs, which are selling okay." ...|$|E
30|$|In future <b>we</b> would <b>like</b> {{to explore}} some more {{objective}} functions. <b>We</b> would <b>like</b> to test our approach more extensively. In order {{to select a}} single solution from the final Pareto optimal front we have developed a semi-supervised approach.

500|$|In a 1995 {{interview}} with the Metro, Mick Quinn said, [...] "We listen {{to a lot of}} different kinds of music.

500|$|Röyksopp enjoy using classic synthesizers, {{including}} the monophonic Korg MS-20, the polyphonic Roland Juno-106, and multiple {{members of the}} Akai Sampler Series. The band has stated that they prefer using analogue synthesizers over digital ones. Svein Berge said, [...] "It's fairly limited the fun you can have {{with the use of}} a mouse. <b>We</b> <b>like</b> to mix." ...|$|E
500|$|We're {{always going}} to have to be {{involved}} [...] Maybe it's part of our national character, you know <b>we</b> <b>like</b> to have these problems nice and neatly wrapped up, put a ribbon around it.

5000|$|As well as {{explaining}} {{the origin of}} the company's name: <b>We</b> <b>liked</b> the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! <b>We</b> also <b>like</b> that it means alpha‑bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for! ...|$|R

500|$|In Northern Rhodesia (now called Zambia), Achebe {{found himself}} {{sitting in a}} whites-only section of a bus to Victoria Falls.

500|$|Though {{construction}} was well underway, {{in late summer}} 2006, new Mayor of Newark Cory Booker promised to reevaluate the deal and considered backing out. In October, Booker conceded there would be [...] "a first-class arena built {{in the city of}} Newark, whether <b>we</b> <b>like</b> it or not," [...] and soon after the Devils struck a deal including both property and monetary givebacks that appeased city officials.
