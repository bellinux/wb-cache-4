40|$|In Czech Republic, {{two species}} of <b>savory</b> namely <b>summer</b> <b>savory</b> (Satureja hortensis L.) and <b>winter</b> <b>savory</b> (Satureja montana L.) are grown. Aim of this work is to {{summarize}} information about biological characteristics and requirements of both species on environmental conditions, production of these drugs in the Czech Republic and abroad, effective substances and their effects and possibilities of savory utilization in manufacturing industry and agriculture. Overground parts and leaves of savory plants are exploited like a spice or a drug that positively influences digestion, reduces flatulence and has also anti?inflammatory effects. Major components of volatile oil savory are phenolic compounds carvacrol and thymol. Just carvacrol and thymol are considered as allelopathic compounds of mint, sweet basil, caraway and others. On the basis some studies, {{we can assume that}} they are also potential allelopathic compounds of <b>savory.</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>savory</b> is more suitable for growing in the Czech Republic especially in the ecological agriculture than <b>winter</b> <b>savory.</b> We can easily include this crop in the crop rotation because it is an annual plant and there is a lower hazard of failure e. g. frost damage.

40|$|Background : <b>Summer</b> <b>savory</b> is {{an annual}} grass plant, with a {{branched}} stem with {{the length of}} 10 to 30 cm that is distinguishable from the similar species due to having grayish green appearance and its leaves are narrow and long. In recent years, the anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antispasmodic, stomach invigorator and digestion facilitator characteristics of this species have been proved. Materials and Methods: This study aimed to examine the type and amount of essence compounds in the <b>summer</b> <b>savory</b> was performed in two vegetative and reproductive phonological stages. To identify the amount of plant essence components a total of 30 samples were randomly taken from Shater Abad heights in two vegetative and flowering phonological stages and its essence was produced by Clevenger apparatus. GC/MS was used to identify essence constituents. In all spectra given by GC/MS, the Kovats index was calculated for each peak by the pattern of exiting the normal alkenes and spectrum inhibition index. Results: The total amount of plant essence in two phonological stages before flowering (vegetative stage) and after flowering (reproductive stage) was 0 / 5 and 0 / 4 percent (w/v), respectively. The number of compounds identified in the vegetative stage was 27 compounds and for reproductive stages was 19 compounds upon which nearly 98 % of plant essence were identified. Conclusion: The results {{show that there is}} no significant difference in both vegetative and reproductive stages in terms of the type of main compounds of the <b>summer</b> <b>savory</b> essence, although the relatively large changes are seen in two phonological stages listed in terms of the numbers of identified compounds. Also the results obtained from this study showed that three main compounds of the <b>summer</b> <b>savory</b> essence are Thymol, gamma- Terpinene and Carvacrol, respectively, which their anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and antioxidant characteristics completely confirm the medicinal property and therapeutic effects of essence of this plant...|$|R

For this purpose three individual trials were conducted using a completely randomized block design with three replications.

The results showed that although both application methods increased vase-life and marketability of carnation, it was statistically non significant. In the second trial, the effects of selected essential oils at the concentration of 100, 150 and 200 ppm were investigated.
