5|$|Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, {{finally coming}} to his senses, thanks the young hero for {{stopping}} him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon {{thought of as}} a fad. Wanting nothing more than to create heroes, Blue was sucked into one of his own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost touch <b>with</b> <b>reality</b> and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete. He snaps his fingers, and the space station's onboard computer warns {{of a large number of}} UFOs heading towards Earth. Blue tells Joe that a hero will be needed twice more to save the world. Joe attempts to leave but not before Silvia requests a V-Watch from her father and to accompany her boyfriend. Viewtiful Joe and a newly transformed Silvia head out to stop the impending threat together.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond <b>with</b> <b>reality,</b> but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
