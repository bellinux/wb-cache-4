And therefore our express pleasure and commandment is that, all delays and excuses laid apart, you do presently upon the duty of your allegiance obey and fulfill whatsoever the bearer hereof shall direct you to do in our name.

5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we <b>will</b> <b>answer</b> and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

25|$|The IRF {{gives the}} {{probability}} that a person with a given ability level <b>will</b> <b>answer</b> correctly. Persons with lower ability have less of a chance, while persons with high ability are very likely to answer correctly; for example, students with higher math ability are more likely to get a math item correct. The exact value of the probability depends, in addition to ability, on a set of item parameters for the IRF.|$|E
25|$|It {{also shows}} a special {{concern for the}} poor, for widows and the fatherless: all Israelites are {{brothers}} and sisters, and each <b>will</b> <b>answer</b> to God for his treatment of his neighbor. This concern for equality and humanity extends also to the stranger who lives among the Israelites. The stranger is often mentioned {{in tandem with the}} concern for the widow and the orphan. Furthermore, there is a specific commandment to love the stranger.|$|E
25|$|For {{infinite}} chess, mathematical {{investigations have}} shown that in a general endgame, one player can force a win in {{a finite number of}} moves. More specifically, it has been found that infinite chess is decidable; that is, given a position (such as , and assuming pawns do not promote) of a finite number of chess pieces which are uniformly mobile and with constant and linear freedom, and (for example) White to move, there is an algorithm that <b>will</b> <b>answer</b> if White can win or force a draw, against any defense by Black.|$|E

25|$|Once a call via {{the local}} {{emergency}} number is placed, a dispatcher <b>will</b> <b>answer</b> {{and ask the}} caller {{about the nature of}} the emergency. Due to dual training in joint dispatch centers, the dispatcher is able to answer calls concerning both the fire department and EMS. While the caller is being interviewed about call specifics, the dispatcher is already working on the computer, which will provide prompt questions, provide advice, and suggest response resources for this emergency. This computer system, while operating in German, is extremely similar to the AMPDS algorithm used by Emergency Medical Dispatchers in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The origin {{is similar}} to the one in the {{original}} film as Peyton discovers his synthetic skin, is attacked and left for dead by Durant and his gang. In this version, however, Peyton is already married to Julie, and she is killed in the explosion. As in the films, Westlake becomes the Darkman, and seeks vengeance on Durant and his gang. Darkman's headquarters are in an abandoned observatory overlooking the city, and he is wanted by the police for his actions against Durant's gang. The pilot ends with some scenes from the first film (particularly of Darkman and Durant fighting) and Darkman stating that Justice <b>will</b> <b>answer</b> with a brand new face.|$|E
25|$|Victor and Becker {{escape to}} the airport with Max in pursuit. After an intense shootout with the UFE, Max catches up with them as they are {{preparing}} to board a jet. Becker (toting a grenade launcher) and his men try to stop Max and allow Victor time to escape, but Max shoots and detonates one of Becker's grenades in mid-air, giving the player the option to either kill Becker, or allow him to die from his wounds. With Da Silva driving in pursuit, Max disables Victor's plane, and approaches an injured Victor {{with the intent to}} kill him, but he relents after Da Silva persuades him to spare Victor so that he <b>will</b> <b>answer</b> for the crimes he committed. Victor taunts Max that he will be set free, and Max responds by breaking his leg.|$|E

25|$|Another major {{aspect of}} the {{gameplay}} is the alethiometer, (a rare truth-telling device which features in the novels). Once the player {{has access to the}} Alethiometer, it can be asked certain set questions. The device has thirty-six symbols on its outer edge, each with three meanings. These meanings are discovered over the course of game; some are learned automatically as the plot advances, others must be sought out by the player and can be missed. For each question, Lyra is given three words, and each word is assigned a hand on the Alethiometer. If Lyra knows the corresponding symbol of a given word, the hand automatically turns to the correct symbol. Words she doesn't know must be guessed by the player. When the three hands are all pointing at symbols, the player confirms the selection and Lyra asks the question. A balancing minigame then begins, where the player must press buttons corresponding to the on-screen display. The more symbols which were correctly identified {{in the first part of}} the game, the easier the balancing game is. If the player successfully completes the balancing game, the Alethiometer <b>will</b> <b>answer</b> the question.|$|E
25|$|Samādhāna (Hindi: समाधान, meaning Reconciliation): The poet {{states that}} Samādhāna {{is the end}} goal of each poetic creation, and expounds on this concept, using the Rāmāyaṇa as a {{timeless}} metaphor. Janaka apologises to Aṣṭāvakra for Bandī's insult and Aṣṭāvakra calms down. He again challenges Bandī to a verbal duel, requesting Janaka to be the neutral arbiter. Aṣṭāvakra says that he will let Bandī begin the debate and <b>will</b> <b>answer</b> to Bandī's points. The debate begins in extemporaneous verses. Bandī and Aṣṭāvakra alternately compose verses on the numbers one to twelve. Bandī can then only compose {{the first half of}} a verse on the number thirteen. Aṣṭāvakra completes the verse and thus defeats Bandī. He is acclaimed by the assembly and Janaka accepts him as his preceptor. Bandī reveals that he is the son of Varuṇa and has submerged Kahola along with several other Brāhmaṇas in water to help his father carry out the twelve-year Varuṇa sacrifice. Bandī accepts his defeat and surrenders to Aṣṭāvakra. The old sage Yājñavalkya also bows down to Aṣṭāvakra and accepts the boy as his Guru. Bandī goes back to the ocean whence Kahola returns. Kahola tells his son that he would be ever indebted to him for redeeming his father. Aṣṭāvakra requests Kahola to return to the waiting Sujātā. On their way back home, Kahola asks Aṣṭāvakra to bathe in the river Samaṅgā, which is the daughter of Gaṅgā. Aṣṭāvakra's deformities are cured on bathing in the river. Sujātā is elated on seeing her husband and her no-longer handicapped son. Aṣṭāvakra stays a lifelong Brahmacārin and becomes a great Ṛṣi. At the end of the epic, Aṣṭāvakra goes to the court of Sītā and Rāma in Ayodhyā, after the battle of Rāmāyaṇa. Aṣṭāvakra is elated on seeing the queen and the king. Sītā bows down to the Guru of her father and Aṣṭāvakra blesses her.|$|E
500|$|The East India Company {{attacked}} the two principal Maratha forces of Scindia and the Raja of Berar {{from the north}} and the south. Of the other Maratha leaders, Holkar was hesitant to enter the war in cooperation with his rival, Scindia, and remained aloof from the hostilities, and the Gaekwad of Baroda placed himself under British protection. Operations in the north were directed by Lieutenant General Gerard Lake who entered Maratha territory from Cawnpore to face Scindia's main army which was commanded by the French mercenary, Pierre Perron. A second British force under the command of Major General Wellesley confronted a combined army of Scindia and Berar in the Deccan. Wellesley was determined to gain the initiative through offensive action and told his senior subordinate, Colonel James Stevenson, that [...] "a long defensive war would ruin us and <b>will</b> <b>answer</b> no purpose whatever".|$|E
