The exhibition provided visitors <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> the National Assembly. On 1 March 2010, the building was again reopened to the public as a Welsh history museum and exhibition.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of a}} sea chart, which can be updated <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E

5|$|Chad Harris-Crane first {{appears in}} the episode airing on September 23, 1999, in which, after {{discovering}} he was adopted, he moves from Los Angeles to Harmony to find his real parents. Chad married Latoya Harris while he {{was working as a}} music producer in Los Angeles. Latoya refused to accompany Chad to Harmony as {{she did not want to}} leave her friends and family. While in Harmony, Chad encounters two people <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> his past - Orville Perkins and Crystal Harris. Orville, a senile old man, erroneously believes Chad is Eve's long-lost son with Crane Industries CEO Julian Crane and claims to have evidence proving this connection. In a desperate attempt to keep her past hidden, Eve burns down Orville's house and any evidence inside and places him in a retirement home. Chad later meets jazz singer Crystal Harris, who was Eve's confidante during her relationship with Julian and subsequent pregnancy. Crystal also offers information about Chad's birth and parents, but is killed by a French drug cartel's assassin Antoine, who mistakes her for socialite Sheridan Crane, before she can deliver it to him.|$|E
5|$|From its inception, users {{would use}} the {{newsgroup}} to discuss {{the quality of the}} episode, as well as to talk about continuity errors and trivia. They would also discuss cultural references, usually related to pop culture. Another common topic is freeze frame gags, which are jokes that can only be seen when the viewer tapes the episode and freezes the image. All of these many discussions were compiled and submitted to The Simpsons Archive, which contains at least 330 episode guides as well as other guides. The newsgroup also provides The Simpsons Archive <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> the characters and the setting, as well as a compilation of articles about the show and interview with its cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|The Anthony Roll is {{a record}} of ships of the English Tudor navy of the 1540s, named after its creator, Anthony Anthony. It {{originally}} consisted of three rolls of vellum, depicting 58naval vessels along <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> their size, crew, armament, and basic equipment. The rolls were presented to KingHenry VIII in 1546, and were kept in the royal library. In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys, who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book, which {{is now in the}} Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by William IV to his daughter, Mary Fox, who sold it to the British Museum in 1858; it is now owned by the British Library.|$|E

5|$|The plenum {{put forward}} three points {{to solve the}} {{problems}} alleged by Tho; (1) to get party cadres to focus on technical economic and management responsibilities, (2) cadres were to be organized and get specialized training in economic and administrative fields to reequip them <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> how to run an increasingly complex economy, and (3) engineer a shift in the internal balance of power.In a Nhân Dân (The People) editorial, Lê Đức Thọ stressed the need to go beyond political slogans and remonstration to enhance the level of management skills of party cadres in party-level organizations. Lê Đức Thọ wanted to change the party's role in the economy from that of implementer to one of supervisor. The central leadership faced an obstacle; most party cadres had what the party leadership considered an outdated education from 20 to 30 years ago, while the party lacked young cadres. To solve this problem, the central party leadership began talking about the need to introduce personnel planning, a retirement age, rotation of officials and tenure length for cadres and sensitive posts.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{calls in}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and informs her that four African American {{men have been}} kidnapped in Philadelphia. One of them has been found dead exhibiting depigmentation. A {{specialist}} from the CDC believes that the men have died from a disease, and has requested Scully to investigate the case. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) joins Scully and {{has some of the}} evidence samples from Sanders' autopsy analyzed by Agent Pendrell, who finds a seed from a rare West African passionflower. Mulder takes the seed to his UN informant Marita Covarrubias and asks for her help; she provides him <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> the incident on the plane.|$|E
5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} bad shape. The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope <b>with</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E
