5|$|The {{emergence}} of mining increased {{the migration of}} native African people in search of employment to the province from elsewhere in Africa. The mining industry improved {{the standard of living}} of those living along Northern Rhodesia's railroads, and increased the influx of white people, the Europeans from South Africa who wanted to maintain their superiority over the native African population. Native Africans were poorly treated by the whites and discouraged from working in the mines; this evolved into a racial struggle. The high rate of immigration to the region increased the number of unplanned settlements. The BSAC introduced a hut tax in 1901 in North-Eastern Rhodesia and between 1904 and 1913 in North-Western Rhodesia for all migrants. The tax was high (in some cases, six months' wages), and intended to create a system of debt bondage and generate income for investment in other mines. Unrest caused by tax increases was suppressed {{with the help of the}} British South Africa Police. The imposition of tax was a strategy adopted to create bond labour and sustain demand during the 1920s when the demand for miners was higher. The company was able to maintain low wages on account of predominance of migrant labour from rural regions. The African miners had three major issues: low wages compared to European miners, a prohibition against working in mines reserved for Europeans despite high skills, and <b>workplace</b> <b>harassment</b> and brutality.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Background: <b>Workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> {{of women}} {{agricultural}} workers {{has become an}} increasing concern in the U. S. Women agricultural workers are largely low-income, Latina, and work in predominately male environments, increasing the risk of sexual harassment. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the risks, protective factors, and health consequences of <b>workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> by eliciting the perspectives of women agricultural workers. Methods: A longstanding campus-community partnership enabled a qualitative study using focus groups. Two focus groups with 20 women agricultural workers were conducted in Yakima Valley, Washington. Four coders analyzed and gleaned interpretations from verbatim transcripts using the grounded theory approach. Results: Three major themes were gleaned from the focus groups. First, <b>workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> is pervasive and frequent in the agriculture industry; 75 % of participants shared a personal or peers' story of being sexually harassed while at work. Second, personal and work environment related risk and protective factors either perpetuate or prevent <b>workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment,</b> respectively. These risk factors also hinder workers from reporting harassment to authorities. Third, <b>workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> leads to psychological, relational, and familial distress in women agricultural workers. Conclusions: Sexual harassment has become a social norm in the agriculture industry. Cultural, economic, work environment, and interpersonal factors increase the risk of harassment. Several theories are proposed to help public health professionals, community health workers, legal advocates, and health providers intervene at the prevention, research, and policy levels to reduce the risk of sexual harassment in the agriculture industry...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{both the}} discourse and dynamics of <b>workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> and bullying, {{and on this}} basis develops {{an analysis of the}} relationship between these discourses, a topic which has hitherto been unexamined. My analysis builds upon a review of literature on <b>workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> and bullying from 1979 to 1997. The emergence of the workplace bullying discourse in UK trade union publications, the media and self-help texts is traced. Empirical data based on interviews is used to explore three themes: (i) the characters of the <b>workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> and bullying discourses; (ii) men's and women's experiences of workplace bullying and sexual harassment; and (iii) how both the workplace bullying and sexual harassment of men and women is underpinned by gender prejudice. My main data source is sixty men's and women's accounts of cross-sex or same-sex workplace bullying and/or sexual harassment in professional/managerial and subordinate jobs, produced in fifty qualitative, in-depth interviews and ten questionnaires. I show that many women embrace the <b>workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> discourse to condemn unwanted male sexual conduct and many workers deploy the workplace bullying discourse to problematise a range of experiences previously understood as parts of the social relations of work. My data reveals that workplace bullying is often a campaign in which allegations of poor work performance are used to encourage an unwanted employee to resign and/or to set him or her up for dismissal. I demonstrate that the <b>workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> and bullying of men and women is gendered: men are sexually harassed when they fail to conform to ideals of hegemonic masculinity and men and women are bullied by line managers because they do not appear to conform to normatively defined gender roles. My argument is that while men's and women's experiences of workplace bullying and sexual harassment might be conceptualised together as examples of 'abuse of power', the specificities of <b>workplace</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> and bullying must remain visible. As such, I propose conceptualising men's and women's experiences of workplace bullying and sexual harassment as a continuum to highlight the similarities and differences between these experiences...|$|R
