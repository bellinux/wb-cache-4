5|$|A {{review of}} olivaceous warbler records {{commenced}} in 1986, and {{continued through the}} 1990s. The results of this review were published in 1999: six of the previously accepted records were rejected as not meeting modern identification standards. In 2003, following the split of olivaceous warbler into two species, the accepted records were all reviewed again to ascertain <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two they wereall nine proved to be eastern olivaceous warblers. Following the split of Bonelli's warbler into two species, the committee reviewed all the 121 accepted records, and concluded that 51 were western and two were eastern; for the remainder, not enough evidence was available to make a firm decision. The committee had previously stated that it would regard as western Bonelli's warbler all except proven eastern Bonelli's warblers, however, this announcement rescinded that decision.

5|$|After Guy and Joanna have sex, Martin arrives to {{tell them}} that Joanna is Guy's mother. She met Guy's father whilst she was an {{exchange}} student in Switzerland.

Guy drives the ambulance to Wales, with Mac and the paralysed Martin with him. Whilst Mac tries to phone the police, Guy drives into a field and almost goes over a cliff. The first series ends with Guy, Mac and Martin teetering on the edge – a literal cliffhanger – while ending up in a discussion about <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Three Musketeers they are most like.|$|E

5|$|Another wooden palace, Tranovola ("Silver House"), {{was under}} {{construction}} {{at the same}} time as Bevato and is considered by historians to represent the first true hybrid of Creole and traditional Merina aristocratic architecture. Its innovations included a roof of wood shingles, a second storey, the addition of a veranda, glass windows, multiple interior rooms (as opposed to a single open interior space) and the use of curved shapes as design elements. Historic sources offer conflicting accounts of these two buildings. Some maintain that Bevato was relocated and remodelled to become Tranovola, while others maintain the buildings were separate but debate <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two houses was the first two-storey building in the Rova (still other sources award this innovation to Marivolanitra). The design of Radama's tomb likewise embodies the hybrid style that was to influence and inspire not only the majority of the buildings built at the Rova in the 19th century, but ultimately architecture throughout the entire highland region of Madagascar—particularly in its use of equidistant pillars supporting the overhanging roof to create a veranda.|$|E

5|$|As the CPL playoffs {{began on}} February 5, a February 21 {{championship}} game clash between Okafor and Alexander was pondered {{in the local}} press after the 32-team brackets were announced. The CPL playoffs began with victories over Perspectives Charter by 71–37 and North Lawndale Charter High School 75–63. Against North Lawndale, Alexander had 27 points, 15 rebounds and 5 blocks. On February 16, Curie defeated Simeon 71–64. Alexander had 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 6 blocks earning a February 19 CPL semifinals rematch against Hyde Park Academy High School who they have already beaten twice this season. Alexander and Curie won 58–56 to reach the anticipated city championship matchup with Young and Okafor at the Jones Convocation Center. Alexander had a triple double with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 blocks. The matchup was the most anticipated city championship game since at least 1998 when fellow McDonald's All-Americans Quentin Richardson of Young and Corey Maggette of Fenwick High School were both top 15 players. On February 20, Alexander improved his first place total in the Mr. Basketball USA Tracker, holding eight first place and two second place votes. Curie won the city championship 69–66 in quadruple overtime as Alexander had 20 points, 14 rebounds and 4 blocks according to Chicago Tribune and Comcast SportsNet, while the Chicago Sun-Times and Sports Illustrated credited him with just 12 rebounds. This came against Okafor who had 16 points and 9, 8 or 4 rebounds before fouling out with 2:13 remaining in regulation depending on <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three sources you believe. The CPL Championship game was attended by Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel and was the lead story on the late edition of SportsCenter. Seven days later, Curie was forced to forfeit all of its wins and the CPL championship due to the academic ineligibility of seven of its players. The title will remain vacant.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{was troubled}} {{by the fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E
