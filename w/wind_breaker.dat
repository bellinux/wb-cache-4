It is used as timber, <b>wind</b> <b>breakers,</b> shade tree, as stake for the climbers and making Cricket bats. Realizing these {{importance}} and demand {{for the production of}} quality planting stock, a green house experiment was conducted at College of Forestry, Ponnampet, Karnataka, India, to evaluate the performance of microbial inoculants viz., Trichoderma, P-solubilizer and N-fixer for growth promoting activity of Silver oak. The experiment was conducted in Completely Randomized Design with ten treatments and three replications. Height, girth and total number of leaves of the plants were recorded at 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after transplanting. The growth of the plants was significantly different between the treatments in all the growth stages for different parameters studied except for number of leaves. The leaves number decreased in later stages i. e. 120 days after transplanting.

40|$|Detailed daily {{topographic}} maps {{of beach}} and inner nearshore areas indicate a cyclic pattern to processes and responses in this non-tidal environment. This pattern {{is the result}} of complex interaction between changes in shoreline configuration, discontinuous nearshore sand bars, and environmental variables uch as barometric pressure, <b>wind</b> velocity, <b>breaker</b> height, and longshore currents. Of the 18 variables measured, barometric pressure appears to provide the best index for changes in coastal processes. The results of these variations are morphologic hanges in the beach and inner nearshore area.

This experiment has been carried out since 1994 / 1995 cropping season in Selengen Village, Lombok 8 arat District, West Nusa Tenggara. In 1998 / 1999 the observation was focused on carrying capacity and soil properties. Feeding through grazing and cut and carry was applied to measure the carrying capacity. The experiment used randomized complete block design and the treatments were arranged to split split plot design replicated four times. The main-plot treatments were (1) with <b>wind</b> <b>breaker</b> and (2) without <b>wind</b> <b>breaker.</b> The sub-plot treatments were four combinations of native grass land, introduced grass, and introduced legume: (A) native grass land, (B) native grass land + Paspalum sp.,(C) native grass land + Arachis gambrara, and (D) native grass land + Paspalum sp. + Arachis gambrara. The sub-sub-plot treatments were (a) grazing and (b) cut and carry. Furthermore the combination between treatments with <b>wind</b> <b>breaker</b> (1) and native grass land +Paspalum sp. +Arachis gambrata (D) was called silvy-pasture system, while the combination between treatments without <b>wind</b> <b>breaker</b> (2) and native grass land (A) was named native grass land.

An important part of this ecosystem is a juniper tree called a “ahuejote” that is native to the shallow waters of the lake/canals. These stem erosion, act as <b>wind</b> <b>breakers</b> and favor the reproduction of a variety of aquatic species. Some of these endemic species include a freshwater crayfish called an acocil, and the Montezuma frog. However, the most representative animal from these waters is the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). This amphibian was used as a medicine, food and ceremonial object during the Aztec empire. It was considered to be an incarnation of the god Xolotl, brother of Quetzalcoatl. It has been studied due to its abilities to regenerate limbs and other body parts. It can also reach sexual maturity as a larva, which no other amphibian can do. While mostly aquatic, it does have limited ability to breathe air. As of 2003, there were only 600 axolotls known to exist in the wild. Most of the threat to the species is loss of habitat and pollution, but the introduction of non-native fish such as tilapia has also had disastrous effects on the population of this and other species. Conservation efforts include research and environmental education. The Grupo de Investigación del Ajolote en Xochimilco (GIA-X) is a nonprofit research group dedicated to the preservation of the axolotl, which is in danger of extinction. It works to better understand the creature {{as well as with the}} local community to protect what is left of its habitat. In addition to species that live in the area year round, the wetlands here host about forty percent of the migratory bird species that arrive to Mexico, roughly 350, use the wet areas around Xochimilco for nesting. Many of these come from the United States and Canada. However, much of this habitat has been urbanized. About 700 species have been found in the area overall. Some of the migratory species include pelicans, storks, buzzards and falcons.|$|R

40|$|Passive {{gains are}} {{becoming}} essentials {{with the introduction}} of new buildings thermal regulations. To optimize such gains, districts ground plan have to be based not only on urban consideration, but on bioclimatic considerations as well. Bioclimatism first purpose is {{to take advantage of the}} local climate and modify it if needed to obtain as much passive gains as possible for the building performance and interior comfort to be improved. The second one is to create a good exterior climate and pedestrian comfort. In fact, the first total factor of energy savings is the density of buildings. It is then of the greatest importance to attract population downtown by offering comfortable exterior spaces that can compete with more rural areas. This thesis will then focus on the wind flows impact on the outdoor and pedestrian comfort. To conduct this research, some points need to be clarified. First, what is the optimum scale to study and adapt the climate to our needs? The scale of the district had several advantages compared to a city or a dwelling scale: it is a representative city sample, its scale is reduced enough for limited data quantity to allow the evaluation of the development decisions impact on the building performance, it has a reduced number of decision makers diminishing the decision complexity and a certain amount of freedom remains allowing to adapt at best the local climate to the project needs. Second, who will be the actors of the bioclimatic conception during the project? The planner and the conception team are ubiquitous during a district conception phase and have a central position in the decision making. Hence, it is with them that the integration of the bioclimatic approach will be the more effective. Third, the success of the thesis is based on the capacity to make the heat engineers and the conception team exchange on the subject of bioclimatism. As a result, it had to be realized in a company possessing at least heat engineers and one of the conception team professions. The French company SCE, part of the Keran group, offered such environment with urban planning and energy and building activities. The process of the study was the following. A benchmark was made on the existing software that could be use by the company to realize pedestrian and outdoor comfort analysis. Then, an outdoor comfort study was made on a district construction project in the French town of Cancale. The project buildings impact on one another was analyzed. For each high frequency wind incidences, simulations were run first in 2 D dimension and second in 3 D dimensions. Based on the wind speed values inside the district zone calculated by the software, discomfort zone had be highlight.

40|$|Breaking waves {{markedly}} {{increase the}} rates of air–sea transfer of momentum, energy and mass. In light to moderate <b>wind</b> conditions, spilling <b>breakers</b> with short wavelengths are observed frequently. Theory and laboratory experiments have shown that, as these waves approach breaking in clean water, a ripple pattern that is dominated by surface tension forms at the crest. Under laboratory conditions and in theory, the transition to turbulent flow is triggered by flow separation under the ripples, typically without leading to overturning of the free surface 15. Water surfaces in nature, however, are typically contaminated by surfactant films that alter the surface tension and produce surface elasticity and viscosity 16, 17. Here we present the results of laboratory experiments in which spilling breaking waves were generated mechanically in water {{with a range of}} surfactant concentrations. We find significant changes in the breaking process owing to surfactants. At the highest concentration of surfactants, a small plunging jet issues from the front face of the wave at a point below the wave crest and entraps a pocket of air on impact with the front face of the wave. The bubbles and turbulence created during this process are likely to increase air–sea transfer...|$|R
40|$|The voltage {{transients}} generated {{during the}} breaker operations in cable systems, for instance, a wind park collection grid, can reach very low rise times. The rise times of these transients can be almost 50 times {{shorter than the}} rise time of a lightning pulse. Such transients can generate a very high voltage stress on the internal transformers insulation. In this paper, a test case is studied using verified models {{of different types of}} transformers and wind turbine layouts in order to account for typical wind turbine layouts found in modern wind farms. A critical switching scenario is chosen in order to provoke the highest possible voltage transients during a current interruption. Furthermore, internal overvoltages are estimated using model of a similarly sized winding. Simulations show that the magnitude of the voltage transients is higher than the basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) defined by present standards. Moreover, it is found that the rise time of the voltage surges is much shorter than the rise time of the lightning pulse. The shortest rise time of 40 ns is obtained in a wind turbine layout where the <b>wind</b> turbine <b>breaker</b> is placed near the transformer. Due to very short rise times of the transients, very high internal overvoltages are estimated in dry-type transformer windings. These internal overvoltages are much higher than overvoltages recorded at the basic lightning impulse level. For a wind turbine layout where a breaker is placed {{in the bottom of a}} tower and a dry-type transformer in a nacelle, the highest turn-to-turn voltage of about 1. 5 pu is estimated. This is almost 4 times higher turn-to-turn voltage then the voltage obtained during the BIL test. In a wind turbine layout where a breaker is placed close to the transformer, the amplitude of the turn-to-turn voltages reached 1. 8 pu due to lower stray capacitances and thus a shorter rise time of voltage strikes...|$|R

At higher frequencies, in the VHF band, the Bragg wavelength for backscatter is reduced so that at 152. 2 MHz the dominant scatter is from a wave with a wavelength just shorter than 1 m, compared with 5 m at 30 MHz. At this wavelength, the Bragg waves are heavily modulated by underlying wind waves and swell which produce significant broadening of the first-order Bragg peaks. The broadening of the peaks does not significantly impair our ability to locate {{the frequency of the}} peak and hence to derive surface current measurements.

The geometric properties of the parasitic capillaries or the plunging jet formed when steady monochromatic waves break have been rather well described over the last decades, both experimentally and by means of numerical simulations. However, owing to their variability, the basic features of <b>wind</b> wave field <b>breakers</b> of various scales as observed at sea or even in laboratory are far from being identified up to now.

Visualizations of gravity-capillary to gravity-scale wave breaker profiles were made simultaneously with single-point wave elevation and slope measurements. It is shown that microscale breakers exhibit a characteristic signature in slope suggesting the formation of a bulge on the forward face of the wave crest but parasitic ripples are not systematically generated ahead. Such breakers are observed for a wide range of wave steepness and wave slope skewness thus weakly dependent on wavelength and wind forcing. In comparison, short gravity-scale breaking waves present a much more complex shape. A number of their geometric properties are then analysed statistically as function of wind speed...|$|R
