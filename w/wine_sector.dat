25|$|The Hungarian {{equivalent}} for {{sparkling wine}} is ’pezsgő’. The beginning of significant sparkling wine production in Hungary is dated {{back to the}} first half of the 19th century. The first wineries of sparkling wine were founded near Pozsony (today Bratislava) by Johann Fischer and dr. Michael Schönbauer in 1825 (first in Central-Europe) and Esch és Társa in 1835. A couple of decades later the main producers moved to the Buda Hills and Budafok nearby the capital creating a new center of production, the so-called ’Hungarian Champagne’ still existing nowadays. At the end of the 19th century the two most important wineries were József Törley és Társa moving from Reims, France to Budafok in 1882 and Louis és César-François founded in 1886. After the Soviet era the Hungarian <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> was reborn. New and old wineries are seeking for the forgotten roots. Most of the Hungarian sparkling wines are made by the charmat and transvasée methods and a small but steadily growing amount by the traditional, champagneois method. The sorts of grape used during production can be international like Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Riesling, Muscat Ottonel, Muscat Lunel or natives like Olaszrizling, Kékfrankos, Furmint, Királyleányka, Hárslevelű, Kéknyelű and Juhfark.|$|E

Building on the values of the “wine culture ” and founded on information backed by science, broad education & self-regulation, WIM aims at promoting moderate and responsible behavior in the consumption of wine as a social and cultural norm. Considering the global and national trends in the wine market, the drinking patterns and the alcohol & health policy, Bodegas de Argentina (BAAC) decided to mobilize concrete actions to contribute to the reduction of alcohol related harm, by adapting and implementing the WIM programme in Argentina. BAAC decided to engage the whole national wine value chain in the WIM programme and empower them with necessary knowledge and tools to properly implement it and disseminate the WIM message. The first step was to adapt the WIM programme and message to the cultural and linguistic context respecting the programme’s common approach and creating an action plan with 2 main phases. With the Argentinean wine value chain participating in WIM and having the proper skills to do, the challenge now lies in reaching consumer.

50|$|For {{some time}} the <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> has been seeking ways of {{producing}} wines {{with a low}} alcohol content.

Research on yeast population dynamics show that the use of M. pulcherrima in sequential inoculation with Saccharomyces uvarum during fermentation can produce Shirazi wine and Chardonnays of reduced alcohol content.

The <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> required regulation of more technical aspects, such as the development of wine-growing potential, wine production techniques, oenological practices and processes, rules on designation and presentation, rules governing the movement and release for consumption of wine products, protection of designations of origin, and so on.|$|E

At the same time, the European Union was considering reforms to the <b>wine</b> <b>sector,</b> aiming at reducing the need for subsidies. This also implied reforms of the European Union wine regulations, which went into effect on August 1, 2009.

50|$|In {{the early}} days of the CAP, the <b>wine</b> <b>sector</b> of the then-European Economic Community (EEC) was in {{reasonable}} equilibrium for a rather short period of time. During this time, there were no regulations as to plantations and few interventions into the market, as this was not needed. However, the early post-World War II saw the introduction of many technological innovations within viticulture, which soon led to increased production, while the demand stayed constant. This resulted in a surplus of wine. The answer from EEC was to intervene in the market to make some guarantee as to sales, while still keeping the freedom to plant new vineyards, which aggravated rather than solved the problem of overproduction. While looking like a very illogical policy in hindsight, this was in keeping with the view that what the EEC was aiming to do was to balance variations in production from year to year.|$|E
