500|$|Adams {{returned}} to Boston in 1779 {{to attend a}} state constitutional convention. The Massachusetts General Court had proposed a new constitution the previous year, but voters rejected it, and so a convention was held to try again. Adams was appointed to a three-man drafting committee with his cousin John Adams and James Bowdoin. They drafted the Massachusetts Constitution, which was amended by the convention and approved by voters in 1780. The new constitution established a republican form of government, with annual elections and a separation of powers. It reflected Adams's belief that [...] "a state is never free except when each citizen is bound by no law <b>whatever</b> <b>that</b> he has not approved of, either directly, or through his representatives". By modern standards, the new constitution was not [...] "democratic"; Adams, like most of his peers, believed that only free males who owned property {{should be allowed to}} vote, and that the senate and the governor served to balance any excesses that might result from majority rule.|$|E

That was, however, until he visited Berlin, which influenced the album's lush sound. Wainwright declared, [...] "Basically, a huge wave of German Romanticism descended on the recording process, and almost drowned me." [...] Wainwright cited two reasons for the change in direction and the heightened dramatic flare: the cancer diagnosis received by his mother (folk musician Kate McGarrigle) during the album's genesis, which he found [...] "fueled his creative intensity in some kind of displaced attempt to get her well", and the New York Metropolitan Opera's commissioning Wainwright to write an opera, making Release the Stars a way of training for such a large project. Revealing the overall theme in January 2007, Wainwright declared the album was about opening up and following impulses.

500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} praised Storm of Zehirs {{use of the}} Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition rules {{with the}} exception of GameSpy, who expressed skepticism of the ruleset in a preview of the game.

[...] Unlike Neverwinter Nights 2 and Mask of the Betrayer where defeated characters would be automatically revived after a battle, Storm of Zehir requires a powerful spell or a [...] "Coin of Waukeen" [...] to resurrect dead allies.

[...] Mike Marqusee has described Dylan's output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, when he recorded these three albums, as [...] "a body of work that remains unique in popular music." [...] For Patrick Humphries, [...] "Dylan's body of work during the 14-months period... stands unequalled in rock's 30-year history. In substance, style, ambition and achievement, no one has even come close to matching Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{included}} in Pitchforks list of their staff's favorite music books.

500|$|One of the curiosities of {{the place}} is Hautville's Quoit, which, to save time, should also be looked for on {{approaching}} the village. (Enter iron gate on L. {{a few hundred yards}} before reaching tollhouse, and search backwards along the hedge bordering road.) It is a large stone, which legend says was hurled by Sir J. Hautville (whose effigy is in Chew Magna Church) from the top of Maes Knoll. The famous [...] "druidical remains" [...] will be found near the church. About 50yards from the entrance to the churchyard take a lane to the L. leading to an orchard: the stones will be observed in the field beyond (admission free, but field closed on Sundays). The [...] "remains" [...] consist of three contiguous circles. The first is of considerable area, and is marked out by twelve large stones, only three of which remain upright; a smaller circle of eight stones lies just beyond; and a third circle of eight will be found farther away in an orchard on the R. The two larger circles have each a few scattered stones thrown off as a kind of avenue. Standing apart from the circles is a curious group of three stones huddled together in a garden abutting on the churchyard, from which they can be easily seen by looking over the W. boundary wall. These mystic rings probably had the same origin (<b>whatever</b> <b>that</b> may have been) as that of the more famous circle at Avebury in Wiltshire, with which they should be compared. The proximity of Maes Knoll is comparable with that of Silbury Hill. A ridiculous theory suggests that the monoliths were erected as a trophy after one of Arthur's victories. Arthur is connected to the site because a site in the nearby village of Camerley is reputed to be the location of Camelot in an oral tradition. The stones are of a reddish hue similar to that described in the Arthurian legend as connected to Camelot and to a sword that was seen in a stone near to Camelot. The country story is that a local wedding once took place on a Sunday, when the frivolous guests would insist on winding up with a dance.
