40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (MTB) is a monocyte/macrophage (M/M) parasite, {{which has}} developed several mechanisms {{to survive and}} multiply intracellularly. On the other hand, infected cells are engaged {{in the effort to}} reduce mycobacterial viability. On this ground, we report that MTB infection predisposes M/M to a pro-apoptotic ATP-based signalling, which is aimed at decreasing MTB replication. In fact, we show that mycobacterial infection leads to an increased expression of P 2 X(7) purinergic receptors, which is paralleled by intracellular accumulation and subsequent extracellular release of ATP by infected macrophages. Activation of this signal <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> apoptosis in MTB-infected cells, since blocking P 2 X(7) receptor by means of oxidized ATP (oATP) prevents MTB induced cell death. Finally, we show that an ATP stimulation of MTB-infected M/M, besides increasing cellular apoptosis, strongly enhances intracellular MTB killing, as evaluated through Colony Forming Unit assay, and such effect is subverted through oATP pulsing of infected cells. Taken together, our data indicate a role of P 2 X(7) purinergic receptors in MTB-induced M/M apoptosis, suggesting the existence of an autocrine/paracrine loop leading to apoptosis of infected M/M and the feasible protective role of ATP-triggered cell death in tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{strength}} of composite sandwich panels typically used in pleasure boats and naval industry. The {{focus is on}} the influence of fabrication processes onto the mechanical behavior, namely onto buckling strength. Both, experimental and numerical analyses were carried out in the Ship Structures Laboratory of the University of Genova on rectangular specimens, whose dimensions and geometry <b>were</b> <b>conceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> buckling collapse, being this one a typical failure mode under compressive loading for thin skins sandwich. Tests on both hand layup fabricated and infusion made panels were carried out measuring compressive load vs. shortening and lateral deflection. Videos of the tests were taken and used to gather some measurements and to assess failure time and location. Experimental results were compared with different numerical models, developed considering large deformations in the PVC core under buckling conditions. Various finite element types and different implementation were considered to model complex interactions between core and skins. The conclusions of this paper aim to provide designers of pleasure and naval crafts with some hints about different strategies to build up costeffective numerical models for predicting buckling and post-buckling behavior of sandwich hulls, taking advantage of calibrations obtained through experimental testing...|$|R
