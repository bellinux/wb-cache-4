5|$|Through {{the rest}} of January and February, the {{battalion}} remained in defensive positions, with crews rotating to the neighboring 776th Tank Destroyer Battalion {{in order to train}} on self-propelled tank destroyers. The 824th <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> conversion to the new equipment by early March, but this was delayed in order to support the 100th Division's attack on Bitche as part of Operation Undertone from 15–19 March.|$|E
5|$|After {{less than}} a month at Burnham, the {{battalion}} began moving overseas. In early January 1942 they were sent to Fiji, where they were based at Sambeto, near the airfield at Namaka. Shortly after their arrival, the 37th Battalion became part of the 14th Brigade along with the 30th and 35th Battalions. Later this brigade became part of the New Zealand 3rd Division. The brigade was responsible for defending the Namaka airfield and during its stay on Fiji, the 37th Battalion was tasked as a mobile reserve, the other battalions occupying fixed defensive positions as the island <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> a possible Japanese invasion.|$|E

5|$|A concert film, Under Great White Northern Lights premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 2009. The film, {{directed}} by Emmett Malloy, documents the band's summer 2007 tour across Canada and contains live concert and off-stage footage. Jack and Meg White {{appeared at the}} premiere and made a short speech before the movie started about their love of Canada and why they chose to debut their movie in Toronto. The tour was {{in support of the}} album Icky Thump, and they performed in every province. Jack conceived the idea of touring Canada after learning that Scottish relatives on his father's side had lived for a few generations in Nova Scotia before relocating to Detroit to work in the car factories. Additionally, their 10th anniversary occurred during the tour on the day of their show in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and in this shot, Jack and Meg are dancing {{at the conclusion of the}} concert.

5|$|A large repair {{was carried}} out at Plymouth Dock (i.e. Devonport) for the sum of £78,909 between March 1814 and March 1816, but {{with the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars she was laid up for a number of years. Canopus was fitted for sea at Devonport in May 1834, and {{underwent}} further repairs between December 1839 and May 1842. She <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> sea again in early 1845, spending time under the command of Fairfax Moresby, before being laid up at Devonport in 1848. She was fitted out there as a receiving ship between June and October 1862, and served as a tender to , the Devonport guardship. Canopus became a mooring hulk in 1869, with her masts being removed in April 1878. She was finally sold after 89 years service with the Royal Navy in October 1887 to J. Pethick, and was broken up.|$|E
5|$|As {{the third}} {{son of a}} cadet (junior) branch of the Fürstenberg princely family, Karl Aloys <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> a {{military}} career. His tutor, Lieutenant Ernst, was in active service in the Habsburg military, and took six-year-old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with him. In this way, he learned as a child the Habsburg military manual, and {{came into contact with}} important military men who later furthered his education and career; he also acquired an honorary rank as Kreis-Obristen, or Colonel of the Imperial Circle, {{by the time he was}} ten years old. As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister Count Franz Moritz von Lacy and Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon; he was also invited to dine with Emperor Joseph II. He started his service in 1777 as a Fähnrich (ensign) in the Habsburg military organization. He saw his first field service during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1777–78), although he was not involved in any battles.|$|E

5|$|Both sides had {{suffered}} severe damage and casualties, but both were also {{aware that the}} battle would inevitably be rejoined and so {{the aftermath of the}} British defeat was one of frenzied activity at Gibraltar, Algeciras and Cadiz. While the British and French squadrons conducted hasty repairs, the French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> a rescue mission, a heavy squadron arriving at Algeciras on 12 July. As the squadron departed with Linois's squadron, it was attacked again by Saumarez's squadron at the Second Battle of Algeciras and caught at night by faster and more manoeuvrable ships, which resulted in the British inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish rearguard but failing to destroy the French squadron for a second time.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Dubourdieu, Captain Péridier on Flore ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The {{battered}} Favorite led with an attempt to round Amphion and rake her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention. The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers {{to bear on the}} British squadron. Hoste <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to wear, turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised. Favorite, which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{decision}} to replace Melbourne with HMS Invincible, the postponed refit was cancelled outright. The Australian carrier <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> disposal, and was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 30 June 1982. She was towed to the mooring dolphins near Bradley's Head, where she remained until 1985. Melbourne was capable of being reactivated as a helicopter-equipped anti-submarine warfare carrier within 26 weeks, but was never required to do so. A Sydney-based group proposed in 1984 to purchase Melbourne and operate her as a floating casino moored in international waters off Eden, New South Wales, but nothing came of this. Melbournes air wing was disbanded at HMAS Albatross on 2 July 1982, with the transfer of 805 Squadron's Skyhawks to 724 Squadron and 816 Squadron being absorbed into 851 Squadron. The Skyhawks remained in service as fleet support aircraft until 30 June 1984, while the Trackers were withdrawn from service on 31 August 1984 after being used as land-based maritime patrol aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Hodalj {{praised the}} Sisak OG command for {{managing}} {{to keep the}} operation a secret until it was launched, making sure it would surprise the JNA. The secrecy {{was reflected in the}} apparent last-minute rerouting of the 102nd Infantry Brigade to the offensive, although the Zagreb Operational Zone deployed it to Sunja, to the east of Sisak. Still, the Sisak OG failed to prepare detailed river crossing plans, or even issue maps and written brigade-level commands for the crossingsrelying on oral commands instead. Likewise, the troops were not equipped to endure the cold weather in the open, limiting their effectiveness. Hodalj concluded that the offensive exceeded needs and capabilities of the Sisak OG. Even though the 1991 HV investigation concluded that the offensive <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> ten days and was approved by Zagreb Operational Zone command, there are no documents pertaining to the preparations other than those issued by the Sisak OG itself. Regardless of the poor preparation of the offensive, the 102nd Infantry Brigade was subject to public criticism in Croatia for fleeing the battlefield in the aftermath of Operation Whirlwind.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Senate called the Arctic Resolution, to fund an expedition to the North Pole. Hall, aided by the Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson, successfully lobbied for, and received, a grant of $50,000 from the U.S. Congress to command the expedition and began recruiting personnel in late 1870. He secured the U.S. Navy tugboat Periwinkle, a 387-ton screw-propelled steamer. At the Washington Navy Yard the ship was fitted as a fore topsail schooner, and renamed Polaris. She <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> Arctic service by the addition of solid oak timber all over her hull, and the bow was sheathed in iron. A new engine was added, and one of the boilers was retrofitted to burn seal or whale oil.|$|E
5|$|In September 1799 Sercey {{dispersed}} {{his remaining}} ships. Brûle-Gueule {{was sent back}} to France on 26 September carrying condemned political prisoners; the corvette was eventually wrecked on the Pointe du Raz with heavy loss of life. Preneuse was ordered to operate against British trade off the coast of Southeast Africa, sailing from Port Louis on 4 August. Lhermitte focused his efforts on the Mozambique Channel and the approaches to the British Cape Colony and on 20 September encountered a squadron anchored in Algoa Bay comprising the 24-gun naval storeship HMS Camel, the 16-gun HMS Rattlesnake (1791) and the schooner Surprise, the former ships lying with their masts and rigging removed. This force was supporting an expeditionary army under General Francis Dundas fighting the Third Xhosa War. Camel was laden with military supplies but neither ship <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> battle, with a 30 of Camels sailors and 15 from Rattlesnake trapped on shore by the surf.|$|E
