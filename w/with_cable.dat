5|$|Although Jardine {{had retired}} from regular {{first-class}} competition, {{he continued to}} play club cricket. Jardine and his wife initially lived in Kensington but moved to Reading {{after the birth of}} their first child, daughter Fianach. A second daughter, Marion, followed but the family suffered from financial worries. Jardine, as well as working in journalism, earned money from playing bridge. The family also tried unsuccessfully to engage in market gardening. To make more money, Jardine became a salesman <b>with</b> <b>Cable</b> & Wireless before working for a coal mining company in the late 1930s. In 1939, he returned to cricket journalism and according to Christopher Douglas, achieved his highest standard as a writer.|$|E
5|$|Following its brief {{theatrical}} run, Universal Studios quickly {{sold the}} film's rights to cable companies, allowing Tender Mercies {{to be shown}} on television. When the film unexpectedly received five Academy Award nominations nearly a year after its original release, the studio attempted to redistribute the film to theaters; however, the cable companies began televising the film about {{a week before the}} Oscar ceremony, which essentially halted any attempts at a theatrical rerelease. When the film first played on HBO in March 1984, it surpassed the three major networks in ratings for homes <b>with</b> <b>cable</b> televisions. Tender Mercies was released on VHS some time later, and was first released on DVD on June 22, 1999.|$|E

Even still, the related joint sales and shared services agreement structures became increasingly common during the 2000s; these outsourcing agreements proliferated between 2011 and 2013, when station owners such as Sinclair and the Nexstar Broadcasting Group began expanding their portfolios by acquiring additional stations {{in an effort to}} drive scale as well as to gain leverage in retransmission consent negotiations <b>with</b> <b>cable</b> and satellite television providers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis, {{responsible}} for New York City's green areas, and Ron Delsener, {{one of the}} city's most influential concert promoters, developed the idea of helping Central Park financially with a free open-air concert, under the legal guidance of Bob Donnelly. The city would use profits from merchandising, television, and video rights to renovate the park. Earlier park performances by Elton John and James Taylor showed that this concept could be a success. Davis authorized the project, and Delsener entered discussions <b>with</b> <b>cable</b> TV channel HBO to decide who would perform.|$|E

25|$|Despite being {{regarded}} as a calm, cool cricketer, in 2005 Gayle {{was involved in the}} dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board and a number of players over sponsorship issues. These players had personal sponsorship deals <b>with</b> <b>Cable</b> and Wireless, who used to sponsor West Indian cricket. However, since the West Indies had recently become sponsored by Cable and Wireless' rivals Digicel the West Indies Cricket Board demanded the players dropped their Cable and Wireless deals. When the players refused to back down, the West Indies Cricket Board dropped them for the first Test against South Africa. Gayle later cut his deal <b>with</b> <b>Cable</b> and Wireless and rejoined the side for the second Test. He was charged with conduct contrary to the spirit of cricket during a Test against New Zealand in March 2006, but was subsequently found not guilty. Later that year, during October's Champions Trophy tournament in India, he was fined 30 percent of his match fee after repeated verbal exchanges with the Australian batsman Michael Clarke. He also publicly criticised the West Indies Cricket Board during the 2007 tour of England, which led to an official reprimand and warning.|$|E

25|$|Five {{different}} {{studies have}} shown that gay characters appearing on TV decreases the prejudice among viewers.

Cable and streaming services are lacking in diversity, according to a GLAAD report, with many of the LGBT characters being gay men (41% and 39% respectively). The total number of LGBT characters counted on cable was reported to be 31% up from 2015, and bisexual representations saw an almost twofold increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{next phase}} of this service {{was to be a}} {{combined}} IPTV and digital terrestrial television service similar to BT Vision and TalkTalk TV. Virgin Media signed an agreement <b>with</b> <b>Cable</b> & Wireless to become the unbundled local loop (LLU) network provider, providing access to 4million homes outside of the Virgin Media cable franchise network and would include linear pay broadcast channels and video on demand. This was originally scheduled to be released during 2008 but was delayed and scaled back as Virgin Media concentrated on improving its cable broadband proposition instead of focusing on competing with Sky in the premium television market. As of 2010, no further developments have been announced and the plans appear to have been abandoned.|$|E
25|$|As {{they are}} not {{organized}} by the PGA Tour itself, certain events (such as the major championships) {{are not part of}} the overall broadcast contracts, but are broadcast under separate contracts with their respective organizers.

As of 2015, as part of an agreement with the United States Golf Association, the year's second major, the U.S. Open, is carried by Fox Sports and is usually carried over broadcast television each day of the tournament.
