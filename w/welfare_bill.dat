500|$|Writing for the Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, the Liberal Democrat MP Duncan Hames {{argued that}} the {{programme}} would contribute little to the subject: [...] "We do {{need to have a}} rational, informed debate about how to improve our welfare system, but the editorial line taken by supposedly factual ‘reality TV’ adds very little to that." [...] The programme was condemned by the current Ladywood MP, Labour's Shabana Mahmood: [...] "I found it shocking that Channel 4 or any other organisation would present poverty as entertainment. It was profoundly wrong." [...] In the Radio Times, Clare Short, who represented the constituency prior to Mahmood, said the series was [...] "totally unrepresentative" [...] of the area, and condemned it as [...] "crummy and misleading". Others have also criticised Benefits Street, arguing it does not present a balanced view of the subject. Labour MP Anne Begg, chair of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, said that the programme was a [...] "misrepresentation" [...] of people claiming benefits, arguing that it focused on those claiming unemployment benefits which makes up a small proportion of the overall <b>welfare</b> <b>bill.</b> Referring to the first episode that featured a shoplifter, Chris Williamson (also a Labour MP) said it was [...] "irresponsible" [...] to portray him as a typical benefits claimant. Owen Jones, a columnist for The Independent, described the series as [...] "medieval stocks updated for a modern format". In an article for the Birmingham Mail, writer and television personality Samantha Brick, a native of Birmingham, said that the series was an [...] "atrociously unbalanced" [...] view of the city. Shadow Welfare Minister Chris Bryant claimed that the residents of The Bishop's Avenue in Hampsteadknown as Billionaire's Row because of its expensive propertieswere as likely to have drink and drugs problems as the residents of James Turner Street.|$|E
