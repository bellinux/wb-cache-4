25|$|The {{national}} accounts balance would be {{positively related to}} carbon emissions. The {{national accounts}} balance shows the difference between exports and imports. For many richer nations, such as the United States, the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries, leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods. <b>We</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country, so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels.(Holtz-Eakin, 1995, pp.;85;101).|$|E
25|$|Geronimo {{was raised}} with the {{traditional}} religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. <b>We</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E

2500|$|During the October Revolution and Russia's disintegration, Sfatul Țării was {{established}} and Stroescu nominally {{stood in the}} regional election. At the time, Pelivan argues, Stroescu was [...] "a great nationalist, but less of a democrat", and alienated from his constituents because [...] "(since 1900) he lived mostly abroad." [...] As noted by Halippa, Stroescu and Hertza were {{trying to set up}} a distinct PNM for the boyars: [...] "their action did not lead to much , although we revolutionaries never objected to them being elected to Sfatul Țării , since <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> all intellectual forces needed to be consulted in political matters". Historian Charles Upson Clark claims that he even served for a while as the legislature's president, during Bessarabia's brief existence as a nominally independent Moldavian Democratic Republic. However, Stroescu is known to have been seriously ill from September 1917 to the early months of 1919, leaving for England and France, and only championed the union of Bessarabia with Romania from afar.|$|E
