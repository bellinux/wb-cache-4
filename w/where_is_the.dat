5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style {{is that he is}} able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In <b>Where</b> <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} death of Duncan his two young sons were sent away for greater safety—exactly <b>where</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> subject of debate. According to one version, Malcolm (then aged about nine) was sent to England, and his younger brother Donalbane was sent to the Isles. Based on Fordun's account, it was assumed that Malcolm passed most of Macbeth's seventeen-year reign in the Kingdom of England at the court of Edward the Confessor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Where</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mind located? If {{the mind}} is a {{physical}} phenomenon of some kind, {{it has to be}} located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either {{the mind is}} internal to the body (internalism) or the mind is external to it (externalism). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Kiarostami {{directed}} several short films including Toothache (1980), Orderly or Disorderly (1981), and The Chorus (1982). In 1983, he directed Fellow Citizen. It {{was not until}} his release of <b>Where</b> <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> Friend's Home? {{that he began to}} gain recognition outside Iran.These films created the basis of his later productions.|$|E

25|$|In {{the year}} 470, Western Emperor Anthemius began a {{campaign}} against Euric, king of the Visigoths who were campaigning outside their territory in Gaul. Anthemius requested help from Riothamus, and Jordanes writes that he crossed the ocean into Gaul with 12,000 warriors. The location of Riothamus's army was betrayed to the Visigoths by Arvandus, the jealous praetorian prefect of Gaul, and Euric defeated him {{in the battle of}} Déols after Riothamus army was driven from Avaricum (Bourges) where he had been welcomed by the Bituriges before the fight. Riothamus was last seen retreating northward in Burgundy, <b>where</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> town of Avallon, when Euric besieged Arvernum (Clermont-Ferrand) in actual Auvergne just south of the Bituriges territory.|$|E

25|$|<b>Where</b> <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> Friend's Home?, And Life Goes On (1992) (also {{known as}} Life and Nothing More), and Through the Olive Trees (1994) are {{described}} by critics as the Koker trilogy, because all three films feature {{the village of}} Koker in northern Iran. The films also relate to the 1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake, in which 40,000people died. Kiarostami uses the themes of life, death, change, and continuity to connect the films. The trilogy was successful in France in the 1990s and other Western European countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Finland. But, Kiarostami did not consider the three films to comprise a trilogy. He suggested that the last two titles plus Taste of Cherry (1997) comprise a trilogy, given their common theme of the preciousness of life. In 1987, Kiarostami {{was involved in the}} screenwriting of The Key, which he edited but did not direct. In 1989, he released Homework.|$|E
25|$|Point-and-click {{adventure}} {{games are}} those where the player typically controls their character through a point-and-click interface {{using a computer}} mouse or similar pointing device, though additional control schemes may also be available. The player clicks to move their character around, interact with non-player characters, often initiating conversation trees with them, examine objects in the game's settings or with their character's item inventory. Many point-and-click games would include a list of on-screen verbs to describe specific actions {{in the manner of}} a text adventure, but newer games have used more context-sensitive user interface elements to reduce or eliminate this approach. Often, these games come down to collecting items for the character's inventory, and figuring <b>where</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right time to use that item; the player would need to use clues from the visual elements of the game, descriptions of the various items, and dialogue from other characters to figure this out. Later games developed by Sierra Online including the King's Quest games, and nearly all of the LucasArts adventure games, are point-and-click based games.|$|E

[...] "Are we to believe Will & Grace will now be about a married woman, {{her husband and her}} gay roommate? That they'll all still live together? That Connick will no longer have merely special-guest status? The inevitable breakup and annulment to come are as obvious as the sweeps-timing of the ceremony." ...|$|E

Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story.

500|$|After {{the initial}} excitement, audiences quickly diminished. Operagoers were nonplussed {{by the absence}} of big {{traditional}} arias and choruses. A contemporary critic summed it up: [...] "'Is this our Verdi?' they asked themselves. 'But <b>where</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> motive; where are the broad melodies... where are the usual ensembles; the finales?'" [...] By the time of Verdi's death in 1901 the work had fallen out of the international repertoire. The rising young conductor Arturo Toscanini was a strong advocate of the work, and did much to save it from neglect. As musical director of La Scala (from 1898) and the Metropolitan Opera (from 1908), he programmed Falstaff from the start of his tenure. Richard Aldrich, music critic of The New York Times, wrote that Toscanini's revival [...] "ought to be marked in red letters in the record of the season. Falstaff, which was first produced here on Feb.4. 1895, has not been given since the following season, and was heard in these two seasons only half a dozen times in all." [...] Aldrich added that though the general public might have had difficulty with the work, [...] "to connoisseurs it was an unending delight".|$|E
