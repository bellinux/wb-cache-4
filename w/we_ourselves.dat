25|$|The moral {{influence}} {{view has}} historically come {{into conflict with}} a penal substitutionary view of atonement, as the two systems propose radically different criteria of salvation and judgment. The moral influence paradigm focuses on the moral change of people, leading to a positive final judgment for which the criteria focuses on inner moral character. By contrast, a penal substitutionary paradigm denies the saving value of human moral change. It focuses on faith in Christ and on his death on our behalf, leading to a positive final judgment based on what Christ has done for us and our trust in that - not on any positive moral qualities that <b>we</b> <b>ourselves</b> possess.|$|E

There can be a kind of upholding of ourselves, of making <b>ourselves</b> important, while <b>we</b> compare <b>ourselves</b> with someone else, no matter in what way, and that is conceit.|$|R

500|$|Jaded {{with their}} lifestyles in California {{and the various}} people frequenting the studios, the group moved the {{sessions}} to Caribbean Sound Basin in Maraval, a suburb of Port of Spain, Trinidad. The studio complex was one of Trinidad's few high-end recording locations and was founded in 1990 by Trinidadian businessman Robert Amar, who wanted to attract both local and international recording artists with a state-of-the-art facility and the area's culture. The group intended to use to the studio only to polish their previous sessions' output, but ended up writing and recording what became most of the album for two months. D'wayne Wiggins said of the move in an interview for Musician, [...] "the record company really wanted to put what we had out, but <b>we</b> <b>ourselves</b> didn't feel like the album was done." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing in the New Statesman, George Eaton {{stated that}} he was {{surprised}} by the moderate stance that Chomsky took in Occupy, remarking that the [...] "self-described anarchist sounds very much like a social democrat", offering the [...] "cautious, provisional response one might expect from a Labour shadow cabinet minister" [...] rather than the words of a radical revolutionary. Arguing that he was exhibiting [...] "passionate sanity" [...] at a time when much of the Left was gripped by conspiracy theories, he also criticized Chomsky for being [...] "maddeningly banal" [...] at points during the book, but ultimately thought that there was [...] "much to commend Chomsky's radical pessimism." [...] In a brief review in The Independent, Arifa Akbar highlighted that although Chomsky's claims regarding class war carried with them [...] "the ring of an old Marxist manifesto", the notion that <b>we</b> <b>ourselves</b> need to change in order to allow the state to change was [...] "very contemporary".|$|E
500|$|The second {{movement}} {{begins with}} a soft instrumental introduction of thirteen measures. Horns and trombones play the same note three times in unison, which is later sung with the word [...] "" [...] ("Realize" [...] or Recognize")“. The rhythm dominates the introduction. The choir picks up, singing it first on a unison C, marked ppp. After several repetitions, the phrase is continued in measure 26: [...] "" [...] (that the Lord is God) with a rapid crescendo from Lord to God. The Swiss musicologist Michael Eidenbenz, writing for the , describes the section as mystical and reflective (""). In a middle section the divided voices express, mostly in homophony, gradually more intense: [...] "" [...] (He has made us, and not <b>we</b> <b>ourselves,</b> his people). The continuation [...] "" [...] (and the sheep of his pasture) is presented expessively by the lower voices, then repeated by pure triads in A major and B major, first by three soprano parts, then three alto parts, finally three male voices, with a solo violin.|$|E
500|$|In his 1961 article [...] "The Abstract Sublime", {{originally}} published in ARTnews, the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes Friedrich's 1809 painting The Monk by the Sea, Turner's The Evening Star and Rothko's 1954 Light, Earth and Blue as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, [...] "Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us {{on the threshold of}} those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail—a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape—is no longer necessary; <b>we</b> <b>ourselves</b> are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night." ...|$|E

500|$|Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation {{was looking}} ever more tenuous {{and the idea}} of [...] "no {{independence}} before majority rule" [...] was gaining considerable ground in British political circles. Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to abandon the Federation and [...] "go it alone". In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian branch of the Dominion Party adopted the policy of [...] "Southern Rhodesia first", prompting strong protests from the party's Northern Rhodesian division; the Dominion Party splintered into separate Federal and territorial entities a month later. When black nationalist riots broke out in the townships in October 1960, Harper condemned the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead and the governing United Federal Party (UFP) as too lenient on the protesters, and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black Rhodesians believe that [...] "trouble pays dividends". Arguing against black representation in the Legislative Assembly, he said that if there were black MPs [...] "they will share the restaurant with us and they will share the bars with us. We will be living cheek by jowl with them, and what sort of legislation can {{the people of this country}} expect when <b>we</b> <b>ourselves</b> are being conditioned to living cheek by jowl with Africans?" ...|$|E

And that's exactly {{what we wanted to}} do." [...] 2 years later in a 2000 interview with the Finnish The Christian Underground Zine issue 4, the fanzine's interviewer asked Antestor: [...] "However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth). What kind of experiences did you get from that?" [...] The band replied: [...] "Pretty bad, actually. I can not say they did anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing." [...] The interviewer also asked: [...] "Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?" [...] Antestor replied: [...] "Nothing like that. They just said that it is not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words 'Lord' and 'Jesus' from our lyrics. <b>We</b> <b>ourselves</b> removed a few texts because {{we did not want to}} provoke unnecessarily." ...|$|E
