Indigo, used as a dye, made its way to the Greeks and the Romans via various trade routes, and was valued as a luxury product. The cashmere <b>wool</b> <b>fiber,</b> also known as pashm or pashmina, was used in the handmade shawls of Kashmir. The woolen shawls from Kashmir region find written mention between 3rd century BCE and the 11th century CE. Crystallized sugar was discovered {{by the time of the}} Gupta dynasty, and the earliest reference to candied sugar comes from India. Jute was also cultivated in India. Muslin was named after the city where Europeans first encountered it, Mosul, in what is now Iraq, but the fabric actually originated from Dhaka in what is now Bangladesh. In the 9th century, an Arab merchant named Sulaiman makes note of the material's origin in Bengal (known as Ruhml in Arabic).|$|E
2500|$|Alpaca fiber {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to sheep <b>wool</b> <b>fiber.</b> [...] Its softness comes from having a different smoother scale surface than sheep wool. American breeders have enhanced the softness by selecting for finer fiber diameter fiber, similar to merino <b>wool.</b> <b>Fiber</b> diameter is a highly inherited trait in both alpaca and sheep. The difference in the individual fiber scales compared to sheep wool also creates the glossy shine which is prized in alpaca. Alpaca fibers have a higher tensile strength than wool fibers. In processing, slivers lack fiber cohesion and single alpaca rovings lack strength. Blend these together and the durability is increased several times over. More twisting is necessary, especially in Suri, and this can reduce a yarn's softness.|$|E

30|$|In this study, <b>wool</b> <b>fibers</b> are dyed with {{a natural}} {{colorant}} extracted from walnut bark in presence and absence of mordants. The effect of aluminum sulfate, ferrous sulfate, and stannous chloride mordants on colorimetric and fastness properties of <b>wool</b> <b>fibers</b> was investigated. Juglone was identified as the main coloring component in walnut bark extract by UV visible and FTIR spectroscopic techniques. The results showed that pretreatment with metallic mordants substantially improved the colorimetric and fastness properties of <b>wool</b> <b>fibers</b> dyed with walnut bark extract. Ferrous sulfate and stannous chloride mordanted <b>wool</b> <b>fibers</b> shows best results than potassium aluminum sulfate mordanted and unmordanted <b>wool</b> <b>fibers.</b> This is ascribed due to strong chelating power of ferrous sulfate and stannous chloride mordants.|$|R

50|$|Wool {{has also}} been {{traditionally}} used to cover cloth diapers. <b>Wool</b> <b>fiber</b> exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and {{the interior of the}} <b>wool</b> <b>fiber</b> is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain dry. Wool felted and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor. Some modern cloth diapers use felted wool fabric for covers, and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} convert the textile fibers in yarns, these must be {{subjected}} to twisting operation which confers them a certain tensile strength. Twisting also results in certain effects, such as crepe effect. The importance of knowing the twisting behavior consists in the possibility to avoid fiber degradation {{as the result of}} an excessive twisting. The present work took for study three types of chemical fibers (wool-type rayon, wool-type polyester, wool-type polyacrylonitrile) and two types of <b>wool</b> <b>fibers</b> S 11 and S 12. The main characteristics of <b>wool</b> type chemical <b>fibers</b> (fiber count, nominal length, breaking length, relative elongation, brightness) and of <b>wool</b> <b>fibers</b> (diameter, almeter length, uster irregularit) have been measured. Then the fibers were subjected to thermal treatments in certain conditions. From the researches performed for the both wool blends, S 11 and S 21, one can notice that the torsional rigidity/stiffness increases after the thermal treatment and the <b>wool</b> <b>fibers</b> changes their handle accordingly. The rayon fibers present the biggest torsional rigidity, as compared to the other types of analyzed fibers, both untreated and heat treated. After heat treatment, the rayon fibers considerable improves their handle. The variation coefficient of breaking torsion increases in the case of heat treated polyester and poly-acrylonitrile fibers while for rayon and <b>wool</b> <b>fibers</b> this coefficient decreases. ...|$|R

5000|$|An S {{number on}} the label of a wool suit, or other {{tailored}} wool apparel, indicates the fineness of the <b>wool</b> <b>fiber</b> used {{in the making of}} the apparel.

The S numbers for fine wool products are intended to state, with precision, the fineness of the <b>wool</b> <b>fiber</b> used in the product, as measured in micrometres. Fiber fineness is one of the factors determining the quality and performance of a wool product. In recent years it has also become an important marketing device used by many mills, garment makers, and retailers.

5000|$|To {{measure the}} {{fineness}} of sheep <b>wool</b> <b>fiber</b> before microscopes and lasers were so used, English wool handlers {{in the city}} of Bradford described wool by estimating (with experienced eyes) how many 560-yard hanks of single strand yarn could be made by a good spinner from a pound of [...] "top."

From the finest wools, more than 80 hanks could be spun; from the strongest, perhaps 36 or fewer. Using ranges denoted by the stronger end (that is “44s” ran up to “46s”) wool lots were classified and prices derived.|$|E

50|$|Wool is {{produced}} by follicles which are small cells located in the skin. These follicles {{are located in the}} upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the <b>wool</b> <b>fibers</b> grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three types of <b>fiber,</b> Kemp (<b>wool),</b> medullated <b>fibers</b> and true <b>wool</b> <b>fibers.</b> Secondary follicles only produce true <b>wool</b> <b>fibers.</b> Medullated fibers share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out. Wool's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat. Wool has a high specific heat coefficient, so it impedes heat transfer in general. This effect has benefited desert peoples, as Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes for insulation.|$|R
