5|$|A revised edition, the Nord Stage 2 {{appeared}} in September 2011, containing an improved synthesizer model and sampler functionality, {{as seen in}} the Nord Wave. The three models of the Stage 2 are the HA-88, containing 88 fully <b>weighted</b> keys, the HA-76, containing 76 <b>weighted</b> keys, and the SW-73, containing 73 semi-weighted keys. An updated model, the Stage 2 EX, with extended memory capacity, was announced in 2015.|$|E
5|$|For {{substances}} in solution the isoelectric point (pI) {{is defined as}} the pH at which the sum, <b>weighted</b> by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the <b>weighted</b> sum of concentrations of negatively charged species. In the case that there is one species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take the example of glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.|$|E

25|$|In November 2011, the ICC {{released}} the first Twenty20 International rankings for the men's game, {{based on the}} same system as the Test and ODI rankings. The rankings cover a 2 to 3-year period, with matches since the most recent 1 August <b>weighted</b> fully, matches in the preceding 12 months <b>weighted</b> two-thirds, and matches in the 12 months preceding that <b>weighted</b> one-third. To qualify for the rankings, teams must have played at least eight Twenty20 Internationals in the ranking period.|$|E
25|$|These grades can be <b>weighted</b> {{according}} to their level, and combined to calculate the classification of a degree. An undergraduate degree will weight level 3 modules {{twice as much as}} level 2, and in postgraduate programmes all M level modules are equally <b>weighted.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{rational}} Bézier curve adds adjustable {{weights to}} provide closer approximations to arbitrary shapes. The numerator is a <b>weighted</b> Bernstein-form Bézier curve and the denominator is a <b>weighted</b> sum of Bernstein polynomials.

25|$|Electricity tariffs in Bolivia are {{far lower}} than average tariffs in Latin America.

25|$|The <b>weighted</b> {{average cost}} of capital is an {{approach}} to determining a discount rate. The WACC method determines the subject company's actual cost of capital by calculating the <b>weighted</b> average of the company's cost of debt and cost of equity. The WACC must {{be applied to the}} subject company's net cash flow to total invested capital.|$|E
25|$|Although {{weighting}} GPAs is {{a widespread}} practice in the United States, there is little research into whether <b>weighted</b> GPAs are better than unweighted GPAs. In one study, <b>weighted</b> GPAs were not suitable for predicting any college outcomes, but unweighted GPA were strong predictors of college GPA. However, standardized test scores were better predictors than either type of GPA.|$|E
25|$|The various {{alternatives}} (see diagram), {{taken in}} different combinations, form a logic tree of 1440 branches for the Time Independent model, and, when the four probability models are factored in, 5760 branches for the Time Dependent model.

25|$|Visa {{requirements}} for German citizens are administrative entry restrictions {{by the authorities}} of other states placed on citizens of Germany.

As of 1 January 2017, British citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 173 countries and territories, ranking the British passport 4th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Austrian, Belgian, Dutch, French, Luxembourgish, Norwegian and Singaporean passports) according to the Henley visa restrictions index. Additionally, the World Tourism Organization also published a report on 15 January 2016 ranking the British passport 1st in the world (tied with Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Singapore) in terms of travel freedom, with a mobility index of 160 (out of 215 with no visa <b>weighted</b> by 1, visa on arrival <b>weighted</b> by 0.7, eVisa by 0.5, and traditional visa <b>weighted</b> by 0).|$|E

25|$|A <b>weighted</b> graph is a graph {{in which}} a number (the weight) is {{assigned}} to each edge. Such weights might represent for example costs, lengths or capacities, depending on the problem at hand. Some authors call such a graph a network. <b>Weighted</b> correlation networks can be defined by soft-thresholding the pairwise correlations among variables (e.g. gene measurements). Such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in shortest path problems such as the traveling salesman problem.|$|E
