5|$|Initially, the {{division}} {{was used to}} provide a pool of reinforcements for {{the division}}s which {{had been sent to}} the Korean War theater, and in January 1951 it provided 650 enlisted fillers for overseas service. Later that month, it was given 4,006 new recruits for its three infantry regiments and artillery assets, and each unit created a 14-week training program to prepare these new soldiers for combat. Because of heavy casualties and slow reinforcement rates, the Army looked to the National Guard to provide additional units to relieve the beleaguered Eighth Army. At the time, the 45th Infantry Division <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> overwhelmingly of high school students or recent graduates and only about 60 percent of its divisional troops had conducted training and drills with the division for a year or more. Additionally, only about 20 percent of its personnel had prior experience of military service from World War II. Nevertheless, the division was one of four National Guard divisions identified as being among the most prepared for combat based on the effectiveness of its equipment, training, and leadership. As a result, in February 1951, the 45th Infantry Division was alerted that it would sail for Japan.|$|E
25|$|By 11 September 1915, Townshend had {{concentrated}} {{his forces}} at Ali Gharbi along the Tigris river. At his disposal {{he had the}} Poona Division, as well the 6th Indian Cavalry Brigade, 10th Royal Field Artillery Brigade, {{as well as two}} battalions from the 12th Division's 30th Indian Brigade. In all, Townshend's force <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> 11,000 men and 28 artillery pieces. Townshend's force advanced along the Tigris from Ali Gharbi. Without any rail or motorized transport, they were reliant either on animal transport or river transport. Accompanying his force, Townshend was supported by a mixed riverine force manned by the Royal Navy and Royal Indian Marine. However, the transport available to him was only adequate. Despite lobbying for an advance, Nixon had refused anything that would ease Force D's logistical situation. Not only had Nixon not accepted additional logistical support, he had failed to ask for the return of animals that his predecessor had sent back to India, which were required to haul Townshend's supplies.|$|E
25|$|The {{judgment}} of Seville of May 1511 recognized the viceregal title to Diego Columbus, but limited it to Hispaniola {{and to the}} islands discovered by his father, Christopher Columbus; his power was nevertheless limited by royal officers and magistrates constituting a dual regime of government. Therefore, king Ferdinand II of Aragon as regent of his daughter the queen Joanna separated the territories of the mainland, designated as Castilla de Oro, from the viceroy of Hispaniola, establishing as General Lieutenant to Pedrarias Dávila in 1513 with functions {{similar to those of}} a viceroy, remaining Balboa subordinated as governing of Panama and Coiba on the Pacific Coast, and that after his death returned to Castilla de Oro. The territory of Castilla de Oro did not include either Veragua (which <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> approximately between the Chagres River and cape Gracias a Dios), due to this territory was subject to a lawsuit between the Crown and Diego Columbus, or the region farther north, towards the Yucatán peninsula, explored by Yáñez Pinzón and Solís in 1508–1509, due to its remoteness. The conflicts of the viceroy Columbus with the royal officers and with the Audiencia, created in Santo Domingo in 1511, caused his return to the Peninsula in 1515.|$|E

This corridor was hung with examples of Wyld's maps and there were examples of his guides and globes on display tables. The corridor was decorated with blue arabesques and lit by globe-shaped lamps with crimson tassels hung from ornate beams. The internal pillars were painted in a rich brown and decorated with copies of Moorish architectural designs from the Alhambra in Granada.

2500|$|Early in the Global War on Terror, Fontes {{served at}} US Central Command J5 {{overseeing}} issues of political-military cooperation in Afghanistan. In June 2004, she {{was moved to}} Combined Forces Command - Afghanistan headquarters in Kabul and served under David Barno {{as the head of}} the CJ5 staff for political-military coordination. Her staff was responsible for keeping General Barno [...] "on message", overseeing the policies impacting military operations, and performing liaison work with both the Afghan Ministry of Defense and United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. At the end of her first year in Afghanistan and following Karl Eikenberry's assumption of command from Barno, Fontes volunteered to lead the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Tarinkot. Daniel Green, the political adviser for the PRT, reported that though some Soldiers at the PRT had initial concerns due to her gender, those worries were shortly put to rest. She had been active in engaging with the Afghan people. Green said that Fontes, then a Lieutenant Colonel, pitched in a few hundred dollars of her own money to host a lunch on the PRT for local Afghan leaders. An article in Vanity Fair relates a story that she once refused to depart a meeting with Afghan elders in Chora District under threat of small arms fire, for fear of appearing weak in the face of the Taliban. Green asserts that in early 2006, she survived the first suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack in Urozgan Province due in part to the device's failure to detonate all of the mortar shells of which it <b>was</b> <b>comprised.</b> She departed Afghanistan in May 2006 to attend the US War College, graduating in 2007. She had been promoted that year to colonel. She was subsequently assigned as the chief of the American Security Assistance Office in Pakistan.|$|E
2500|$|Venetians had {{important}} {{ties and}} considerable {{support among the}} Montenegrins, with solid ground established previously during the Cretan war. Venice strongly considered placing Montenegro under its own protection. In 1685, Montenegrin Metropolitan Rufim Boljević had died."The most loyal friend of Venice" [...] at the time, as said by Venetians themselves; after a brief tenure of Vasilije Veljekrajski was replaced by Visarion Borilović Bajica. Borilović ascended to the throne as a protege of his relative Patriarch of Peć Arsenije III Čarnojević. Previously a great supporter of Venice, after establishment of contact with Emperor's representatives in 1688, Arsenije became an important ally of the Habsburgs in the Balkans. Venetians were worried that under Arsenije's influence, who himself was of Montenegrin origin, the Montenegrins would lean more towards the Austrians, and thus kept at distance Visarion as well. The course of the Great Turkish war did not always coincide with Venetian interests, and thus this two-sided politics resulted in indecisive and irregular shape {{of the war in}} Montenegro. In their effort to win over Montenegrins at their side, Venice sent a detachment of Hajduks, led by their compatriot Bajo Pivljanin to Cetinje to rise the population against the Ottomans in 1685. Detachment <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> mainly by Montenegrins from Grbalj and Boka Kotorska. Previously, they demonstrated their intents during a short night attack on Herceg Novi on 22 August 1684. The Vizier of Skhoder, Suleyman Bushati, after threatening and pacifying the tribes of Kuči and Kelmendi, gathered an army and marched towards Cetinje, when the Pivljanin and his hajduks, accompanied by Venetian detachment and joined by some Montenegrins decided to make a last stand. The confrontation resulted in Battle of Vrtijeljka, where the Ottoman forces annihilated the hajduks and penetrated to Cetinje. After plundering Cetinje, Bushati retreated. Undetermined, with result in low rate of mobilisation, Montenegrin attitude towards the war quickly changed, {{and despite the fact that}} handful of them was forcibly mobilised during Bushati's attack on Budva in 1686 they were now in favor of Venice.|$|E

2500|$|Penniman {{was famous}} for her skill in {{gardening}} and her garden was stocked with a rare variety of plants and shrubs. And {{it was here that}} two herbaria were made by Mrs. Penniman and her youngest daughter Adelia, who was born in 1800. The region around the High Bridge was discovered by a Massachusetts botanist, who botanized {{the west side of the}} state in 1829, to be “a remarkable region, rich in rare and interesting plants.” A part of this “remarkable region" [...] <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> in the Penniman farm, and here, in 1814, the mother/daughter botanists found and preserved their specimens. They doubtless followed the windings of the river in both directions and are known to have gone often through the woods then on the site of the Fort in their search for wild flowers. Not satisfied with the pressed flowers in the herbarium, they carried home the plants from their native haunts and cultivated and improved them in the home garden. Botany was said to be Mrs. Penniman’s “favorite amusement.” This was before any manual of botany had been published in this country. But botanical textbooks were not the only books published in the old country to be found in this home. A granddaughter of Penniman tells how each of Scott’s novels was purchased as soon as it appeared, and how eagerly it was read and the question of authorship discussed by the whole circle of friends of the family. It may be that the specimens in these small herbaria were the oldest in the state, for the oldest in the herbaria of the University of Vermont are dated 1819. There were 80 or 90 specimens in each herbarium, although quite a number of cultivated plants are included. Many of the botanical names have long since been changed, and one at least, the ground or moss pink, had not been listed in the Vermont Flora, though reported as a recent “find” from Wallingford and also from Colchester.|$|E
