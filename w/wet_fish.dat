25|$|Any fish {{processing}} usually occurs in deck houses or below deck. A <b>wet</b> <b>fish</b> stern trawler stores {{the fish in}} ice or sea water which has been refrigerated. A freezer stern trawler stores the fish in frozen boxes or blocks, and a factory stern trawler processes the catch. A pelagic stern trawler may use fish pumps to empty the codend.|$|E
25|$|Set netters – also operate gillnets. However, during fishing {{operations}} the vessel is not {{attached to the}} nets. The size of the vessels varies from open boats to large specialised drifters operating on the high seas. The wheelhouse is usually located aft, and the front deck is used for handling gear. Normally the nets are set at the stern by steaming ahead. Hauling is done over the side at the forepart of the deck, usually using hydraulic driven net haulers. <b>Wet</b> <b>fish</b> is packed in containers chilled with ice.

2500|$|Over the centuries, several {{variants}} of dried fish have evolved. The stockfish (fresh dried, not salted) category is often wrongly {{mixed with the}} clipfish, or salted cod, category where the fish is salted before drying. After 2–3 weeks in salt the fish has salt-matured, and is transformed from <b>wet</b> salted <b>fish</b> to clipfish through a drying process.

50|$|The sonaghan trout (Salmo nigripinnis) {{is another}} species of salmonid unique to Lough Melvin. It {{can have a}} light brown or silvery hue with large, {{distinctive}} black spots.

500|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Stroma were highly self-sufficient, and many practiced additional trades such as carpentry or roof-laying {{in addition to}} their [...] "day jobs" [...] in fishing or crofting. They built their own houses and boats, produced most of their own food, maintained farm equipment, shod their own horses, and made their own clothes, boots and shoes. In the 1920s they built their own wind turbines to recharge the batteries of their radio sets. By the end of the 19th century the island had three shops including a grocery. Any additional needs were met by purchasing supplies from shops at Wick and Thurso on the mainland or by mail-order from catalogues. For a while, they were also able to use the services of a floating shop which came periodically from Orkney to Stroma. Customers were rowed out to buy groceries, flour, animal feed, paraffin and clothes in exchange for lobsters, <b>wet</b> salted <b>fish</b> and eggs.|$|R

50|$|On 19 July 1974, {{more than}} nine months after {{the signing of the}} agreement, one of the largest <b>wet</b> <b>fish</b> stern {{trawlers}} in the British fleet, C.S. Forester, which had been fishing inside the 12 nmi km limit, was shelled and captured by the Icelandic gunboat V/s Þór after a 100 nmi km pursuit. C. S. Forester was shelled with non-explosive ammunition after repeated warnings. The trawler was hit by at least two rounds, which damaged the engine room and a water tank. She was later boarded and towed to Iceland. Skipper Richard Taylor was condemned to 30 days of imprisonment and fined £5,000. He was released on bail after the owners paid £2,232. The trawler was also allowed to depart with a catch of 200 tons of fish. Her owners paid a total of £26,300 for the release of the ship.|$|E
40|$|Effects of PCBs {{were studied}} in common terns (Sterna hirundo). Hatchlings from eggs {{collected}} from Dutch breeding colonies and incubated artificially were raised to {{an age of}} 21 d. The birds were fed fish spiked with PCB 126 alone or in combination with PCB 153 (1 : 1, 000), resulting in concentrations in the food ranging from 0. 01 to 1. 2 ng toxic equivalents (TEQs) /g wet weight. The most sensitive effect parameter was induction of hepatic CYP 1 A-associated ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation (EROD) activity, and a nonlinear concentration–effect relationship could be determined with the TEQ concentration (r = 0. 967, p < 0. 001). Induction of pentoxyresorufin-O-depenthylation and methoxyresorufin-O-demethylation activities was observed at dose levels {{similar to those that}} induced EROD activity. The estimated lowest-observed-effect level for induction of CYP 1 A in the common tern was approx. 25 ng TEQ/g liver lipid, which was caused by concentrations in the food of approx. 0. 6 ng TEQ/g <b>fish</b> <b>wet</b> weight. At these concentrations, a 50 ␛eduction in plasma total thyroxine compared with controls also was observed. Concentrations of plasma total thyroxine were negatively correlated with hepatic TEQ concentrations (r = 0. 523, p < 0. 01), but the shape of the nonlinear concentration–effect relationship did not allow determination of a lowest-observed-effect level. No changes were found for hepatic hydroxylation of testosterone. Bursa weight decreased proportionally to hepatic concentrations of TEQs (r = 0. 433, p < 0. 05) and showed a similar sensitivity as that observed for EROD activity. Concentrations of TEQs in The Netherlands are approx. 0. 1 ng TEQ/g <b>wet</b> weight <b>fish,</b> which is approximately six times lower than the lowest-observed-effect level for CYP 1 A induction in terns as estimated in this study. It is concluded that no overt effects on growth and development in the common tern are expected with this background exposure during the posthatch period...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the quality of salt cured fish in Kanyakumari District, Madras State was done during the years 1963 and 1964 to obtain {{necessary}} basic information to formulate quality standards for these products which are gaining importance in the export trade. 155 trade samples of sun-dried, dry-salted, wet-cured and pit-cured fishery products were examined for their chemical quality and organoleptic characteristics. 26. 5 % of the sun-dried products, 25 % of the <b>wet</b> cured <b>fish,</b> 55. 21 % of the dried salted products and none of the pit cured samples were found to be good in quality. The sun dried products were generally found to have heavy admixture of sand and were inadequately dried. The chief defects in the salt cured fish products were found to be the use of spoiled fish, imperfect cleaning and washing, use of impure salt, inadequate salting, curing and drying, and unhygienic conditions in all stages. Quality standards must be formulated for each variety of salt cured fish product and adequate measures taken to rectify the defects and enforce the quality standards...|$|R
40|$|The Mexican cichlid, Cichlasoma beani has {{potential}} to be a candidate for the aquarium trade and the food industry. However, currently there are no studies regarding the effect of environmental factors on the species in culture conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the potential of C. beani to be maintained in cultured conditions. Additionally, the fish were exposed to different temperatures to examine the effect of temperature on growth, condition and survival of cultured juveniles in 26, 28 and 30 °C, for six weeks in recirculation systems. Fish were fed 2. 4 mm pellets (40 % protein, 15 % fat) at a ration rate of 5 % body weight per day (dry weight food: <b>wet</b> weight <b>fish).</b> An aggressive behavior in all treatments led to lowered survival, making it impossible to conclude that temperature had an effect on the recorded variables. However the results showed a tendency that indicated the final weight and specific growth rate at 30 °C was greater than in 26 and 28 °C, perhaps due to a better metabolism and nutrient assimilation...|$|R
