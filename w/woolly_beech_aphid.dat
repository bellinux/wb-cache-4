50|$|Cryptococcus fagisuga, {{commonly}} known as the <b>beech</b> scale or <b>woolly</b> <b>beech</b> scale, is a felted scale insect in the superfamily Coccoidea that infests beech trees of the genus Fagus. It is associated with the transmission of beech bark disease because the puncture holes it makes in the bark allow entry of pathogenic fungi which have been identified as Nectria coccinea var. faginata and sometimes Nectria galligena.|$|R
50|$|The <b>beech</b> blight <b>aphid</b> (Grylloprociphilus imbricator) is {{a common}} pest of American beech trees. Beeches are also used as food plants by some species of Lepidoptera (see list of Lepidoptera that feed on beeches).|$|R
50|$|<b>Beech</b> blight <b>aphids</b> colonize {{branches}} of the tree, but without serious harm to otherwise healthy trees. Below these colonies, deposits of sooty mold develop caused by the fungus Scorias spongiosa growing saprophytically on the honeydew the insects exude. This is also harmless to the trees.|$|R
40|$|Specialist herbivores {{are thought}} to often enhance or {{maintain}} plant diversity within ecosystems, because they prevent their host species from becoming competitively dominant. In contrast, specialist herbivores are not generally expected to have negative impacts on non-hosts. However, we describe a cascade of indirect interactions whereby a specialist sooty mold (Scorias spongiosa) colonizes the honeydew from a specialist <b>beech</b> <b>aphid</b> (Grylloprociphilus imbricator), ultimately decreasing the survival of seedlings beneath American beech trees (Fagus grandifolia). A common garden experiment indicated that this mortality resulted from moldy honeydew impairing leaf function rather than from chemical or microbial changes to the soil. In addition, aphids consistently and repeatedly colonized the same large beech trees, suggesting that seedling-depauperate islands may form beneath these trees. Thus this highly specialized three-way beech-aphid-fungus interaction {{has the potential to}} negatively impact local forest regeneration via a cascade of indirect effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{explanation for}} the change in leaf colour during autumn is still debated. Autumn colours could be a signal of defensive commitment towards insects (coevolution) or an adaptation against physical damage due to light at low temperatures (photoprotection). These two hypotheses have different predictions: under the coevolution hypothesis, insects should not prefer red leaves in autumn and grown better in spring on trees with green autumn leaves. Under the photoprotection hypothesis insects should prefer and grow better on trees with red leaves because they provide better nutrition. Studying colour preference in autumn and growth rates in spring of a southern <b>beech</b> <b>aphid</b> species (Neuquenaphis staryi) on Nothofagus alessandrii we found preference for green leaves in autumn but not differential performance of aphids in spring. We suggest that aphid preference for green might have evolved to exploit better their host during the autumn rather than to improve their performance in spring. Citation: Ram√≠rez, C.

50|$|Scorias spongiosa is a {{specialist}} and grows {{exclusively on the}} honeydew formed by colonies of the <b>beech</b> blight <b>aphid,</b> Grylloprociphilus imbricator. This aphid is found only on one host plant, the American beech tree, Fagus grandifolia, where it congregates on branches and twigs, creating copious amounts of honeydew that drip onto vegetation below. The large quantity of honeydew enables this fungus to grow to a large size, much bigger than other sooty mould fungi, which produce only a thin black layer {{on the surface of}} leaves. On tree trunks this fungus has been known to grow into a mass of hyphae as big as a football, but it is more usual for the agglomeration on branches or twigs to reach a diameter of about fifteen centimetres.|$|R
