I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people.

5|$|After {{the trade}} Chamberlain {{found himself on}} a {{promising}} Sixers team that included guards Hal Greer, a future Hall-of-Famer, and talented role players Larry Costello, Chet Walker and Lucious Jackson. Cherry remarks {{that there was a}} certain tension within the team: Greer was the formerly undisputed leader and was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> his authority, and Jackson, a talented center, was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain blocked the center spot; however, as the season progressed, the three began to mesh better. Chamberlain did not care for the Sixers' coach, Dolph Schayes, because Schayes, according to him, had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players in the NBA.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} {{to relieve the}} citadel ended in farce. Badly-drilled reinforcements sent by the Habsburgs fled in fear of the Ottomans, and their {{attempts to}} re-board their boats at Solin Bay caused many vessels to sink. Niccolo dalla Torre and the papal commissioner managed to escape. Kružić himself– who had left the fortress {{to make contact with}} the reinforcements- was captured and executed; the sight of his head on a stick overwhelmed the remaining defenders of Klis, who were now <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the fortress in return for safe passage north. After Kružić's death, and with a lack of water supplies, the Klis defenders finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom, on 12 March 1537. Many of the citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated to the city of Senj, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army.|$|E

25|$|In late February 2006, IAEA Director Mohammad El-Baradei {{raised the}} {{suggestion}} of a deal, whereby Iran would give up industrial-scale enrichment and instead limit its program to a small-scale pilot facility, and agree to import its nuclear fuel from Russia (see nuclear fuel bank). The Iranians indicated that while they would not be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> their right to enrichment in principle, they were willing to consider the compromise solution. However, in March 2006, the Bush Administration {{made it clear that they}} would not accept any enrichment at all in Iran.|$|E
25|$|Eden {{resigned}} from the House of Commons in March 1957. He retained much of his personal popularity in Britain and soon regretted his retirement, and contemplated standing again. Several Conservative MPs were reportedly <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> their seats for him, although the party hierarchy were less keen. He finally gave up such hopes in late 1960 after an exhausting speaking tour of Yorkshire. Macmillan initially offered to recommend him for a viscountcy, which Eden {{assumed to be a}} calculated insult, and he was granted an earldom (which was then the traditional rank for a former Prime Minister) after reminding Macmillan that he had already been offered one by the Queen herself. He entered the House of Lords as the Earl of Avon in 1961.|$|E

25|$|Guy's {{decision}} to leave the secure base provided by his well-watered assembly point at La Saphorie, {{was the result of}} a Crusader war council held the night of July 2. Though reports of what happened at this meeting are biased due to personal feuds among the Franks, it seems Raymond argued that a march from Acre to Tiberias was exactly what Saladin wanted while La Saphorie was a strong position for the Crusaders to defend. Furthermore, Guy shouldn't worry about Tiberias, which Raymond held personally and was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> for the safety of the kingdom. In response to this argument, and despite their reconciliation (internal court politics remaining strong), Raymond was accused of cowardice by Gerard and Raynald. The latter influenced Guy to attack immediately.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eve of}} Kenya's {{independence}} in August 1963, British officials belatedly realized that the new Kenyan regime was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the Somali-inhabited areas it had just been granted administration of. Led by the Northern Province People's Progressive Party (NPPPP), Somalis in the NFD vigorously sought union with their kin in the Somali Republic to the north. In response, the Kenyan government enacted a number of repressive measures designed to frustrate their efforts in {{what came to be}} known as the Shifta War. Although the conflict ended in a cease-fire, Somalis in the region still identify and maintain close ties with their brethren in Somalia. They have traditionally married within their own community and formed a cohesive ethnic network.|$|E
25|$|Gwalior is {{also known}} for not {{participating}} in the 1857 rebellion, mainly due to non-co-operation with Rani Lakshmibai. After Kalpi (Jhansi) fell {{into the hands of}} the British on 24May 1858, Lakshmibai sought shelter at Gwalior Fort. The Maharaja of Gwalior was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> his fort without a fight as he was a strong ally of the British, but after negotiations, his troops capitulated and the rebels took possession of the fort. The British attacked Gwalior in no time, the battle was fought by Lakshmibai. Indian forces numbered around 20,000, and British forces around 1600 assisted by Maharaja of Gwalior troops. Lakshmibai's example is remembered to this day by Indian nationalists. She died fighting, and Gwalior was free from rebels. There is a statue of Lakshmibai on her horse which commemorates her contribution to the fight for independence. Tatya Tope and Rao Sahib escaped. Tatya Tope was later captured and hanged in April 1859.|$|E

25|$|His next {{aim was to}} {{make the}} {{imperial}} crown hereditary. Henry tried to secure the Imperial election of his son Frederick II as King of the Romans, which however met with objections raised by Archbishop Adolf of Cologne. Spending the winter in Hagenau Castle, the emperor and his ministeriales evolved the idea of a hereditary monarchy. Though they would have lost their right to elect the kings, the secular princes themselves wished to make their Imperial fiefs hereditary and to be inheritable by the female line as well, and Henry agreed to consider these demands. The emperor also bought the support of ecclesiastical princes by announcing that he would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the Jus Spolii and the right to receive recurring earnings from church lands during a period of sede vacante. At the Diet of Würzburg, held in March/April 1196, he managed to convince the majority of the princes to vote for his proposal. However, Archbishop Adolf of Cologne did not even put in an appearance and several princes, predominantly in Saxony and Thuringia, were still dissatisfied.|$|E
25|$|One {{version of}} the story of the {{creation}} of the Onibaba involves the baby girl of a wealthy family in Kyoto. Although already five-years-old and otherwise healthy and happy, the child had not uttered a sound since birth. Worried and desperate, the family consulted doctor after doctor with no success until they came upon a fortune teller who told them that the cure was to feed the girl the fresh liver of a living fetus. This gruesome task was passed on to her nanny who set off on the search after leaving her own similarly aged daughter an omamori, an amulet for protection. The nanny’s search for a woman <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> her unborn child’s liver lasted for weeks and months before the nanny, tired and weary, reached Adachigahara, where she decided to stay in a cave to wait for pregnant travelers to pass by. Years passed before a lone pregnant woman approached her cave. Desperate, the nanny jumped upon the woman and retrieved the fetus’ liver. Only after accomplishing her goal did she realize that the woman was wearing the omamori she had given her daughter many years ago. Driven insane by this realization, the nanny became a yōkai and from then on attacked passers-by and ate their flesh.|$|E

500|$|Charles had {{formulated}} a plan {{to circumvent}} that problem, and to free enough of his troops to send a sizable relief fortress into northern Italy, where Wurmser held Mantua against the French. [...] If the French would agree to an armistice, he would take command of the fortresses; the French would withdraw, and he could send a sizable force to northern Italy to help relieve Mantua.

500|$|On no {{issue was}} Brownlee's {{relationship}} with the King government more critical {{than it was for}} the control of natural resources. [...] The terms under which Alberta, like Saskatchewan and Manitoba, entered Canada left control of its natural resources with the federal government; the British North America Act gave control of the older provinces' natural resources to their provincial governments. [...] While Alberta did receive compensation {{in the form of an}} annual grant, Brownlee, like his three immediate predecessors, felt that it was insufficient. [...] The federal government had been committed since 1920 to the principle of transferring resource control to the province; only the specific terms of the transfer remained to be established. [...] Alberta, though <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> the grant, felt that it was owed compensation for land grants and mineral leases that were made by the federal government, but which Alberta would be expected to honour after the resources were transferred.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Laliberté {{bought out}} Gauthier, and with 95% ownership, has {{continued}} to expand the brand. In 2008, Laliberté split 20% of his share equally between two investment groups Istithmar World and Nakheel of Dubai, {{in order to further}} finance the company's goals. In partnership with these two groups, Cirque du Soleil had planned to build a residency show in the United Arab Emirates in 2012 directed by Guy Caron (Dralion) and Michael Curry. But since Dubai's financial problems in 2010 caused by the 2008 recession, it was stated by Laliberté that the project has been [...] "put on ice" [...] for the time being and may be looking for another financial partner to bankroll the company's future plans, even <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> another 10% of his share.

500|$|Following the debates, Perot did not {{campaign}} {{and was not}} seen on television until {{later in the week}} when ABC aired a 30-minute sequel to an autobiographical infomercial shown on October 17. The spot cost Perot $370,000. CBS aired an infomercial on October 24 entitled The Ross Perot Nobody Knows, and two days later another was shown on ABC, preceding the kickoff of Monday Night Football, which cost $940,000. Perot hoped to better explain his earlier exit as Election Day neared. Reports circulated that a security official from the campaign had contacted the Dallas Police in August to urge them to perform a sting operation targeting Bush campaign adviser James Oberwetter, in response to allegations that Republicans planned to wiretap Perot's office. Perot claimed during an interview with 60 Minutes that [...] "Republican operatives" [...] also threatened to disrupt his daughter's wedding, which forced him to withdraw in July. He reported the story to the FBI, but no evidence of any wrongdoing was found. The New York Times argued that the story could help Perot with voters and his overall image by presenting him as a man [...] "who was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> his goal to protect his family"; nevertheless, his lack of evidence drew criticism.|$|E
500|$|After the Battle of Schliengen, though, Moreau {{had only}} one avenue of escape, via the {{smallest}} Rhine crossing at Hüningen, which he used to move his army back to France. The question remained, however, who would control the crossings after the 1796 campaign. Charles had formulated a plan to circumvent that issue, and to free enough of his troops to send a relief force into northern Italy, where Dagoburt von Wurmser held Mantua against the French. [...] If the French would agree to an armistice, he could take command of the Rhine fortresses; the French would withdraw, and he could send a sizable force to northern Italy to help relieve Mantua. [...] The Siege of Mantua was long and costly, and had tied up {{a significant portion of}} both the French and Austrian force. The French Directory was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>up</b> Mantua in exchange for the Rhine bridgeheads, which they deemed more important for the direct defense of France; Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke, their envoy sent to negotiate between the Austrians and the French in Italy, could not convince Napoleon Bonaparte to allow the Habsburgs to keep Mantua. Napoleon flatly refused the suggestion, maintaining that Mantua was the keystone to the conquest of Habsburg Italy and to maintaining pressure on the Habsburgs in their capital of Vienna.|$|E
