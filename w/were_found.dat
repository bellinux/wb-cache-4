In Almagro, 137survivors washed onshore on October25, 120ofwhom reached shore by either a life jacket or a life boat. Eighteen other survivors were buried in a common grave in Almagro and nine other bodies, also found in Almagro, were shipped to Tacloban. In Tacloban, six other survivors were buried, but over 60survivors were also found on the island, and were transported on four buses and taken to receive medical treatment. Twenty-two <b>were</b> <b>found</b> on Samar Island, including two in Calbayog. Overall, the shipwreck was confirmed to have killed 77, even though 261others were listed missing.|$|E
5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. They {{appear to be}} unusually complex for nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints <b>were</b> <b>found</b> nearby that resembled aetosaurs, although they were not present in the same layer. Because the tracks <b>were</b> <b>found</b> {{so close to the}} nests, it is likely that aetosaurs built them.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance <b>were</b> <b>found</b> to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E
