30|$|Several {{studies had}} been {{conducted}} to assess biomechanical properties of the loops, used for anterior retraction in labial orthodontics, but no such attempt had been done so far in lingual orthodontics. In 2006, Safavi et al. [8] conducted a study to compare biomechanical characteristics of T-loop, vertical helical loop, L-loop, and opus loop of 0.016 [*]×[*] 0.022 <b>wire</b> <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> but did not consider the modeling of brackets (whether lingual or labial) or tooth along with the root or the compensatory curvatures. They obtained higher force in their study as they did not consider placement of wire in the brackets. Hence, the moment obtained by them was also higher and was not truly representative of moment obtained during orthodontics tooth movement. The M/F ratio of T-loop (13.4) was also higher in their study because {{of the difference in}} the loop design and length, difference in the material used for fabricating the loop (made of stainless steel), degree of compensatory curvatures, and importantly the fact that their study was on labial orthodontics. Such higher M/F ratios at anterior end in their study are representative of root movement that is difficult to attain on 1  mm activation in reality.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} resistance to electrochemical corrosion <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> made <b>of</b> Cr-Ni <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> designed for use in endourological treatment. The influence of strain formed in the process of drawing and methods <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> surface preparation to corrosive resistance in artificial urine solution were analysed. Design/methodology/approach: Wire corrosion tests were carried out in the solution of artificial urine {{with the use of the}} system for electrochemical tests VoltaLab®PGP 201. Resistance to electrochemical corrosion was evaluated on the ground of recorded curves of anodic polarization by means of potentiodynamic method. Mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> were tested by means of static uniaxial tension test. Findings: Potentiodynamic tests carried out in artificial urine enabled to determine how the resistance to pitting corrosion <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> changes, depending on strain formed in the drawing process as well as on the method <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> surface preparation. Deterioration of corrosive properties <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> along with the increase in the formed strain hardening was observed.

Exemplary anodic polarisation curves were given. It was proved that with the applied strain, corrosion properties decrease.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{mechanical}} properties (force deflection) of five different types of archwires used in initial stage of orthodontic treatment. Materials and methods: A modified three-point bending test was performed on the sample <b>of</b> 75 <b>wires</b> <b>of</b> conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> multistranded <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> superelastic NiTi, thermal NiTi and multistranded coaxial NiTi (15 each). The load exerted by each <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> was measured at the deflections of 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 mm during loading and subsequent unloading process at 37 °C temperature. Results: Force-deflection diagrams were determined from the passive position to an activation of 2 mm and then during deactivation forces on deactivation (unloading) at a deflection of 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 mm were compared by post hoc Tukey′s analysis of variance. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) in deactivation forces were observed among wires. The multistranded <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire had the lowest mean deactivation force (0. 82 N), while the conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> group had the highest mean value (3. 56 N). Conclusion: The multistranded coaxial NiTi wires exhibited lighter and more continuous forces hence should be the first choice <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> during the initial stages of treatment followed by thermal NiTi and superelastic NiTi. Multistranded <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wires can also be considered as an economical alternative to more expensive NiTi wires...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{orthodontic}} treatments, <b>wires</b> <b>of</b> different metallic alloys {{are used}} for alignment, leveling, correction of the molar position, space closing, finish and retention. The purpose of {{the paper is the}} characteristics <b>of</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires,</b> with a square traverse section, which were produced using a rolling mill built for this purpose, are presented hereDesign/methodology/approach: With respect to finish and retention, these wires are responsible for adequate positioning of the upper teeth on the lower teeth. Wires that are subjected to incisor torque require high resistance and stiffness. For this, <b>wires</b> <b>of</b> rectangular austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> are used due to high modulus of elasticity and good corrosion resistance in the oral environment. Because of the rectangular geometry, wire production requires process development suitable for industrial scale manufacture with geometric characteristics and mechanical properties better adapted to the use conditions. Findings: To obtain wires with such characteristics, a rolling mill was developed for the production <b>of</b> rectangular <b>wires</b> by a rolling process with the objective of reducing cost of the cold drawing process that is currently used which utilize complex and expensive wire-drawing dies. In addition to the rolling process itself, wire deformation, microhardness, tension and bend tests were also performed. Research limitations/implications: A rolling-mill was built that successfully produced dental wires within acceptable tolerances and physical/mechanical properties. These wires exhibited excellent hardness and tensile strength, although slightly less than analogous commercial wires. It is expected that this problem are corrected by using initial wires with a higher hardness, since this property is directly related with the tensile strength.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of {{aluminum die casting}} as enclosures where internal equipment is rotating inside of the casting and could fracture requires a strong housing to restrain the fractured parts. A typical example would be a supercharger. In case of a failure, unless adequately contained, fractured parts could injure people operating the equipment. A number of potential reinforcement materials were investigated. The initial work was conducted in sand molds to create experimental conditions that promote prolonged contact of the reinforcing material with molten aluminum. Bonding of Aluminum bronze, Cast iron, and Ni-resist inserts with various electroplated coatings and surface treatments were analyzed. Also toughening of A 354 aluminum cast alloy by <b>steel</b> and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire mesh with various conditions was analyzed. A practical approach to reinforcement of die cast aluminum components {{is to use a}} reinforcing steel preform. Such performs can be fabricated from steel wire mesh or perforated metal sheet by stamping or deep drawing. A hemispherical, dome shaped casting was selected in this investigation. A deep drawing die was used to fabricate the reinforcing performs. The tendency of aluminum cast enclosures to fracture could be significantly reduced by installing a <b>wire</b> mesh <b>of</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> or a punched austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> sheet within the casting. The use of reinforcements made <b>of</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> mesh or punched austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> sheet provided marked improvement in reducing the fragmentation of the casting. The best strengthening was obtained with austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire and with a punched <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> sheet without annealing this material. Somewhat lower results were obtained with the annealed punched <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> sheet. When the annealed 1020 steel wire mesh was used, the results were only slightly improved because of the lower mechanical properties of this unalloyed steel. The lowest results were obtained with unreinforced 356 aluminum casting. Good strength can be obtained with a sound die casting without any defects produced by squeeze casting. The use of higher pressure to produce the squeeze casting has been shown to increase the strength of a hemispherical dome casting. This dome shape casting has been produced both with and without reinforcement and tested to determine its pressure resistance under internal pressure of water. Only a slight improvement in strength could be determined because of water leaks at the seal between hemispherical dome and its flat supporting side. However, when the ability of the casting was tested under the compressive force of a plunger, the strengthening effect <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> mesh or sheet was evident. Higher loads to failure were obtained because of the reinforcement <b>of</b> the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> and punched sheet. Rather than a sudden failure occurring, the reinforcement <b>of</b> the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> or the punched hard <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> sheet held the material together and prevented any loss of the fractured casting to the surroundings. Unalloyed steel did not have the required strength or mechanical properties to increase the properties of the casting...|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} above, {{the basic}} geometry {{is similar to}} that of BepiColombo/MMO PWI/WPT-S. Each wire boom is composed of a 15 -m-long conductive wire and a 60 -mm-diameter sphere on its top. The conductive <b>wire</b> is made <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> (SUS 316 L, diameter: 0.18  mm) and covered by a polyimide insulator (diameter: 0.43  mm) except a 0.7 -m-long top-side area, which is coated by Aerodag (a graphite paint). The sphere is an Al alloy (7075 -T 7351) shell with thickness of less than 1  mm attached to the tip <b>of</b> the conductive <b>wire.</b> In this configuration, the conductive top part, i.e., the 60 -mm-diameter sphere and the 0.7 -m-long conductive wire (its cross section: less than 5 % of the sphere’s), become the probe for contact with ambient plasma. Such surfaces are preferred to have uniform conductivity, photoelectron emissivity, and secondary photoelectron yield. The sphere surface, which has a much larger area than that <b>of</b> the conductive <b>wire</b> part, is coated with TiAlN with a Ti:Al ratio of 2 : 1 and thickness of ~  1  μm, as the spherical probe of MMO PWI WPT-S. As the prelaunch test, the nonuniformity of the photoelectron emissivity under the illumination of a deuterium lamp was evaluated using a vacuum chamber with the help of Prof. Kobayashi (Saitama University). In this study, the photoelectron emission from the vacuum ultraviolet light is observed using an electron emission microscope (EEM) (Suharyanto et al. 2006). The sputtered TiAlN and TiN surface exhibits a nonuniformity of 1.2 %, whereas the reference surface, which is a baked carbon coating (baked Aerodag) used in the Geotail PANT spheres, exhibits a nonuniformity of 2.0 %. The evaluation of the performance and degradation of TiAlN in space is one of the objectives for Arase’s WPT, as the pretest of BepiColombo’s WPT. The conductive part <b>of</b> the <b>wire’s</b> top-side area limits the influence of the surface potential of the insulated part on the top sphere. The remaining surface area, covered with polyimide, limits the coupling of the long conductive wire to ambient plasma. Inside of the deployment unit, the wire is covered with a copper-meshed shield (diameter: 0.61  mm).|$|R
40|$|The thesis treats {{roll pass}} design in <b>wire</b> rod rolling <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> for {{sequences}} and series built up by two-symmetrical grooves. It is focused on predicting rolling flexibility, also called working range, as well as product quality. For analysing the flexibility a computer program has been developed. The minimum and maximum roll gap and corresponding bar areas for series of grooves including "oval", "round", "false round", "square" and "diamond" shapes are calculated. Six pass designs used in Swedish mills are analysed. Full-scale rolling is compared with laboratory experiments for the square-oval and false round (round) -oval series. The false round-oval series offers the largest working range and that the flexibility is smaller for pass sequences designed for high reductions. The false round-oval series are also acknowledged as a series for high quality steels and are usually better than the square-oval series having a tendency for defect formation. The thesis also includes high-speed rolling <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> rod in blocks. Here interstand tensions are utilised {{in order to keep}} the process stable. For obtaining the required dimensional tolerances of the product they are kept as low as possible. However interstand tensions could be used in order to increase the working range and move the product range towards smaller wire cross sections. For analysing this possibility, a narrow spread technology is utilised. At present time a practical problem is referred to the fixed gearings in the common blocks, which require a certain and given level of interstand tensions and corresponding reductions. This problem can however be solved by means of new block design and modern process control technology. Roll stands can be separately driven and controlled at very high speeds. Thus the eight stand blocks can be subdivided into four plus four passes blocks with a cooling line between enabling also higher productivity without violating the product quality because defect formations caused by a too high rolling temperature. The true working range of a series for a specific steel grade is however not only dependent on the possible spectrum <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> dimensions that can be obtained but might also depend on its ability to decrease or eliminate defects such as surface cracks. Thus, the behaviour of artificial V-shaped cracks in the longitudinal direction has been investigated and compared for the square-oval and false round (round) -oval series mentioned above. In agreement with other research works it was established that efficient rolling conditions for reducing the cracks are obtained when the cracks open up at the same time as their depth is reduced. If the V-shaped crack is closed by contact between its oxidized side surfaces the rolling schedule is not optimal for getting a high quality product. A deeper understanding of the experimental results was obtained by means of an FE-analysi...|$|R
40|$|Um fator importante que {{define a}} eficácia dos aparelhos ortodônticos fixos é o atrito existente entre as superfícies de fios e braquetes. Assim, este estudo teve como objetivo {{investigar}} o coeficiente de atrito estático entre fios de aço inoxidável e beta-titânio (TP Orthodontics) e braquetes de aço inoxidável (Dynalock&# 174; - Unitek), braquetes estéticos com slot de aço inoxidável (Clarity&# 174; - Unitek) e estéticos convencionais (Allure&# 174; - GAC). Para tanto, construiu-se um equipamento no Departamento de Engenharia Mecânica e Mecatrônica da PUCRS. Antes de serem iniciados os testes, foi quantificado o erro de método e constatou-se que não houve interferência significante (p> 0, 05) do fator operador nas medições. Então, pôde-se calcular o valor do coeficiente de atrito, obtido pela divisão da força de atrito pela carga normal. O método estatístico utilizado neste estudo foi Análise de Variância (ANOVA) e teste de Comparações Múltiplas (Tukey). Constatou-se que: 1) a combinação com menor coeficiente de atrito foi composta pelo fio de aço inoxidável e braquete Dynalock&# 174; e a que apresentou maior coeficiente foi a do braquete Allure&# 174; com o fio de beta-titânio; 2) o fio de beta-titânio apresentou coeficiente de atrito significativamente maior do que o fio de aço inoxidável; 3) o braquete Dynalock&# 174; não apresentou diferenças significativas em relação ao coeficiente de atrito do braquete Clarity&# 174; quando o fio utilizado foi de beta-titânio. No entanto, quando o fio testado foi de aço inoxidável, apresentou coeficiente de atrito significativamente menor. O braquete Clarity&# 174; apresentou coeficiente de atrito significativamente menor do que o braquete Allure&# 174;. An important factor {{that defines the}} effectiveness of the appliances is the friction between the surfaces <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> and brackets. Thus, that study was developed in order to investigate the static friction coefficient between <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and beta-titanium wires (TP Orthodontics) and the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets (Dynalock&# 174; - Unitek), esthetic brackets with a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> slot (Clarity&# 174; - Unitek) and conventional esthetic brackets (Allure&# 174; - GAC). For this purpose, an equipment was built in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics at PUCRS. It should be stressed that before the tests began, the Method Error was quantified and it was found that there was no significant interference (p> 0, 05) by the factor operating in the measurements. From then, the friction coefficient could be calculated, obtained by dividing friction force by the normal load. The statistic method used in these study was Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Multiple Comparison test (Tukey). It was found that: 1) the combination with the lowest friction coefficient was constituted by the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire against the Dynalock&# 174; bracket, and the one with the highest friction coefficient was that of the Allure&# 174; bracket with the beta-titanium wire; 2) the beta-titanium wire presented a friction coefficient that was significantly higher than the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire; 3) the Dynalock&# 174; bracket did not present any significant differences in relation to the friction coefficient of the Clarity&# 174; bracket when the <b>wire</b> used was <b>of</b> beta-titanium.

40|$|AbstractCorrosion fatigue {{strength}} <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> {{is controlled by}} tangled interaction among environmental, mechanical and metallurgical factors. In order to estimate corrosion {{fatigue strength}} it is indispensable to understand {{the role of an}} each influencing factor. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present briefly surveyed results on metallurgical factors on corrosion fatigue strength <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> such as austenitic, martensitic and duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> mainly based upon author’s experimental results. The targeted dominant metallurgical factors focussed upon are chemical compositions, heat treatment, manufacturing process and microstructures. The emphasis is placed upon effect of Molybdenum content on corrosion fatigue strength <b>of</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> in 3 %NaCl aqueous solution, tempering temperature on corrosion fatigue strength of 13 % Chromium <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> in 3 %NaCl aqueous solution and volume percent ferrite on corrosion fatigue strength <b>of</b> duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> in potassium alum aqueous solution. The surface and fracture surface observation by optical and scanning electron microscopy revealed that corrosion pit formed at corrosion fatigue crack initiation area. In light of relatively smaller effect of corrosive environment on corrosion fatigue crack propagation rate it can be surmised that corrosion fatigue strength <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> is governed by crack initiation process. It can be concluded that corrosion fatigue strength <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> is strongly influenced by metallurgical factors such as chemical compositions, heat treatment, manufacturing process and microstructures. The information obtained in this survey directly lead to prevention of corrosion fatigue failure in <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> made components, selection <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> in corrosive environments and development <b>of</b> corrosion resistant <b>stainless</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R
