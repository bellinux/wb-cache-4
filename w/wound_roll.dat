This necessitated an oval planform for the box even though it was only provided with a single posting aperture. At one end of the oval is the stamp machine and at the other is the posting aperture.

The machines were set to vend two halfpenny stamps in exchange for one old penny, the stamps being supplied in a long continuously <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> known as a coil. Boxes were again made in two sizes, designated Type D and Type E, and carried raised lettering on the castings indicating the position of the stamp vending machine, as well as an array of small enamel plates warning users of the danger of bent coins and the need to wait for stamps to be issued before inserting more money. Several of each have survived in use in England and in the Isle of Man.|$|E

The air-entrainment can be obtained theoretically using the modified nonlinear Hakiel model. In this research work, air-entrainment model established by Hamrock and Dowson was applied to estimate the initial air film layers into a <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> in the winding system with a nip-roller. Moreover, {{the characteristics of a}} <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> were examined under varying tension and varying speed conditions. The numerical results showed the radial stress, tangential stress, and friction force distributions at central inside a <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> under the condition for a <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> without wrinkle and slippage phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Feasibility and {{construction}} of closed loop winding tightness controller was studied. Both basic PI-controller and LQR state feedback controller were applied. The controllers were tuned and tested in winding simulations and in pilot winder trial runs. The chosen feedback variable was the web thickness or strain in the roll radial direction measured {{by means of the}} density measurement. The controller output was the Wound On Tension, which was converted to the winder control variables, nip load, web tension and winding force, by means of the inverted nip model. The nip model was constructed as the experimental response surface model. The nip model data was measured in the pilot winder with several different winder reference values and web speeds and the response surface model was fitted to the data by means of the least squares method. The experimental nip model was inverted and used as a component in winding control and simulation. Two theoretical nip models were reviewed and compared to the experimental nip model. The density measurement was implemented with a novel algorithm based on the time varying least squares method. The Wound On Tension measurement was done by means of the indirect method, which uses the roll deformation data from the density measurement and the <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> stress model. The method was improved compared to the earlier implementations by using the large deformations total stress version of the <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> model augmented with the viscoelastic material model and the centrifugal forces. A new method for indirect web calliper measurement was introduced based on the roll model and radial deformation data. The various versions of the <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> stress models were implemented and their results compared. The total stress version was found to be suited for the Wound On Tension measurement from the radial deformation measurement data. The algorithms were tested with pilot winder trial runs with two printing paper grades, the LWC paper and the Newsprint paper. The computed radial pressures were verified with the direct pressure measurements. reviewe...|$|E

As {{has been the case}} in previous <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> stress analyses based on one-dimensional models, the present approach ac-counts for the anisotropic and nonlinear material properties of the layered web material, and the incremental manner in which the roll is wound. In addition, the present develop-ment accounts for arbitrary cross-sectional geometry and material of the core, and the presence of nonuniform tension across the web’s width during winding. The solution is developed through an axisymmetric, two-dimensional, finite element analysis which couples individual models of the core and layered web region substructures. The core’s stiffness matrix at the core-web interface provides a mixed boundary condition for the web region’s first layer. In several parameter studies, variations of the stress components in the roll’s radial and cross-width directions are discussed and compared with predictions of the simpler companion one-dimensional model.

40|$|A winding {{simulation}} model predicting the internal stress state of a <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> {{would provide an}} indispensable tool for the optimal selection of the winding parameters and, above all, a fast way to design new winding concepts - such as winding drum covers and winding geometry. Hence, the nip-induced stresses and nip-induced tension are of the outmost interest to the manufacturer of the winding apparatus. In this thesis, a rigorous contact mechanical model for the winding nip is presented. Under the assumptions of the linear elastic web and paper roll material and compliant winding drum, the indentation, stick and slip equations are derived. The wound-on-condition, a mathematical statement for the initially free sheet becoming finally {{a part of the}} roll, is presented. A variant of the Panagiotopoulos Process is introduced as a solution procedure and numerical results are presented. An invariant condition is derived and, hence, the number of independent winding parameters is reduced from three to two. In the numerical part of the thesis, the basic mechanism of the nip-induced tension is presented and the following items are studied: the influence of the winding force, the layer-to-layer friction coefficient, the <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> and winding drum radius, drum cover compliancy and the elastic constants of paper on the nip-induced tension.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} rotation on the internal loads in a <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> and the dynamics of a fully <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> under angular acceleration. Two different types of winding are distinguished: constant transport speed and constant rpm. The original scheme proposed by Benson accounted for large deformation, and used a nonlinear elastic constitutive law; in this paper, the Benson model is first expressed in dimensionless form and extended to account for roll rotation in both cases: constant rpm and constant transport speed. Additionally, tangential dynamics are considered to account for angular acceleration of a fully-wound roll. In general, it is seen that the inclusion of angular velocity in the Benson model alters the lap deformation, interlayer pressure and lap tension profiles compared to the case with no rotation, to an extent determined by the magnitude of angular velocity. A direct consequence {{of this is that}} there is now an upper bound on the number of laps that can be safely wound onto the core without loss of contact between the outer-most laps, and this is a function of rotational speed and wrapping tension, among other parameters. A numerical algorithm is then described to account for angular acceleration due to a constant core torque applied after the roll has been completely wound. This allows one to determine the slip profile through the roll at various instants during the motion...|$|E

The model accounts for radial and axial displacements and radial, circumferential, axial and shear stresses. The roll build-up is modeled as an incremental accretion process. The material behaviour of the roll is considered as hyperelastic, orthotropic and radially nonlinear. The numerical solution is developed using the {{finite element method}} and the total Lagrangian formulation. The model is applied to the winding of paper rolls. It is shown that centrifugal forces may considerably affect the resulting stress distributions. For nonzero Poisson’s ratios significant edge effects in the roll stresses are found. In particu-lar, high shear stresses and shear stress gradients are discovered {{in the vicinity of the}} core near the roll ends. A remarkable stress leveling phenomenon is found where the effect of a non-constant incoming web tension is evened out in the roll axial direction. ...|$|R

The results show that the in-plane tensile moduli (E 11 = 2. 7 GPa, E 22 = 5. 7 GPa) of the film are quite different and smaller than the out-of-plane modulus (E 33 = 13. 0 GPa) of the film. Similarly, the out-of-plane thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the film is much larger than the in-plane CTE (α 3 ≈ 10 α 2). This large anisotropy in the moduli and the expansion coefficients will influence the winding and thermal stresses generated in the wound rolls. ^ The radial and circumferential stresses in the layers of the <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> were evaluated using the elastic constants of the film obtained in chapter 2. Expressions were derived to determine the influence of elastic constants of the film and the core on the radial and circumferential stresses in the roll. Stresses generated due to the thermal expansion of the assembly during operating temperature changes were also evaluated. The analysis showed that because of the applied winding stress, the layers near the core have compressive radial stresses. The circumferential stresses in the layers also decrease, becoming compressive in some cases for the layers near the core. ^ The influence of the interfacial pressure (compressive stress) on the dielectric behavior of the film was the subject of chapter 4. Applying interfacial pressure, parallel to the electric field, changes the apparent dielectric breakdown strength of the film.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} for predicting {{the stress and}} displacement fields within a magnetic tape pack, where those quantities are allowed to vary in both the pack’s radial and transverse (cross-tape) directions. As {{has been the case}} in previous analyses based upon one-dimensional <b>wound</b> <b>roll</b> models, the present approach accounts for the anisotropic and nonlinear constitutive properties of the layered tape, and the incremental manner in which the pack is wound. Further, such widthwise variation effects as differential hub compliance and nonuniform winding tension, which can be significant in data cartridge design, are also treated in the model. The pack is analyzed through a two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model that couples individual representations of the hub/ flange and layered tape substructures. The bulk radial elastic modulus of the tape, which depends on the in-pack radial stress, is measured for a variety of media samples, and a reduced-order model is developed to capture the nonlinear modulus-stress correlation. The stiffness matrix of the hub/flange at its interface with the media provides a mixed boundary condition to the tape substructure. In this manner, design-specific hubs can be readily analyzed, and criteria for their optimization explored. Simulations of several cartridge designs are presented, and the roles of hub compliance and wound-in tension gradient in setting the pack’s stress field and cross-tape width change are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This Thesis {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the thorough investigation {{of the effects of}} core material parameters on the structural behaviour of <b>wound</b> <b>rolls</b> in core-roll winding systems. The underlying theme in this work is the derivation, based on the theory of elasticity, of an analytic expression for the core material's elasticity modulus as a function of only material parameters and geometry. The approach undertaken herein is purely theoretical and encompasses the rigorous analysis of principally two models; linear isotropic and anisotropic. As for the former, both planar and axisymmetric geometries are investigated; {{and in the case of}} the anisotropic model, an axisymmetric plane stress situation is studied. Moreover, finite-element modelling and analysis for the isotropic condition is carried out to confirm the theoretical findings. The objective is then to apply the results; namely, the inclusion of Poisson's ratio and elasticity modulus of the core material, to modify existing energy-balance roll structure formulae. This undertaking is called for if the aim is to have a valid winding model that simulates the actual winding process; i. e., one which incorporates sensing the presence of the core through layers of wound material. Results are further compared with existing winding models and conclusions are given...|$|R

40|$|Booms {{and other}} {{structures}} consisting mainly of thin spring strips are undergoing development. These structures {{are designed to}} be lightweight, to be compactly stowable, and to be capable of springing to stable configurations at full extension once released from stowage. Conceived for use as self-deploying structures in outer space, portable structures of this type may also be useful on Earth in applications in which there are requirements for light weight and small transportation volume. The elements common to these structures are spring strips with curved cross sections [...] similar to spring strips of the type commonly used as compactly stowable carpenters' measuring tapes. These structures exploit the nonlinear mechanical properties of such tapes, namely (1) strong resistance to axial buckling while they are straight and (2) ease with which they can be <b>wound</b> into compact <b>rolls</b> once they have been initially bent. For a structure that contains multiple such strips, the net effect of the combined nonlinear characteristics is the following: (1) When at full extension, the structure is in a stable state, in which it is rigid and strong. (2) When stowed compactly, the structure is in a state that is semistable in the sense that only a small force is needed to restrain the structure against deployment. (3) The strain energy stored in the spring strips during compaction is sufficient to deploy the structure to full extension when the restraint is removed...|$|R
5000|$|On 5 June, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, CINC of the Combined Fleet ordered Cruiser Division 7 {{to shell}} Midway in {{preparation}} for a Japanese landing. Cruiser Division 7 and DesDiv 8 were 410 mi away from the island, so they made a high-speed dash at 35 kn. The sea was choppy and the destroyers lagged behind. At 2120, the order was canceled; however, due to a mixup, Cruiser Division 7 did not receive the order till 0210 the following day, when it was just 50 mi off Midway. This placed Cruiser Division 7 within range of the submarine , which was spotted by the cruiser [...] Kumano signaled a 45° simultaneous turn to starboard to avoid possible torpedoes. The emergency turn was correctly executed by the flagship and , but the third ship in the line, Mikuma, erroneously made a 90° turn. Behind her, Mogami turned 45° as commanded. This resulted in a collision in which Mogami rammed Mikumas portside, below the bridge. Mogamis bow caved in and she was badly damaged. Mikumas portside oil tanks ruptured and she began to spill oil, but otherwise her damage was slight. The destroyers [...] and [...] were ordered to stay behind and escort Mogami and Mikuma. At 0534, retiring Mikuma and Mogami were bombed from high altitude by eight Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses from Midway, but they scored no hits. At 0805, six USMC Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bombers and six Vought SB2U Vindicators from Midway attacked Mikuma and Mogami but they did not achieve any direct hits. A Vindicator flown by Capt. Richard E. Fleming attacked after being set ablaze by anti-aircraft fire. His bomb missed and he crashed into the sea. The following morning, 6 June 1942, Mikuma and Mogami were heading for Wake Island when they were attacked by three waves of SBD Dauntless dive-bombers, comprising 31 aircraft, from the aircraft carriers [...] and [...] Arashio and Asashio were each hit by a bomb. Mogami was hit by six bombs. Mikuma was hit by at least five bombs in the forecastle, bridge area and amidships and set afire. The hit on the forecastle put the forward guns out of commission. The hit near the bridge area set off some AA shells and caused considerable damage to the bridge and personnel. The hit amidships set off several torpedoes and the resulting explosions destroyed the ship. Captain Sakiyama was severely <b>wounded.</b> Mikuma <b>rolled</b> to port and sank at [...] (It has also been suggested that either Asashio or Suzuya scuttled Mikuma the following day).|$|R
