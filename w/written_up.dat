5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} {{the bulk of}} his results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly <b>written</b> <b>up</b> without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E
5|$|Irene was Johnson's only play, and {{was first}} {{performed}} on 6 February 1749 in a production {{by his friend}} and former pupil, David Garrick. The play was a commercial success and earned Johnson more money than anything else he had <b>written</b> <b>up</b> to that point. It was never revived during his lifetime, {{and there is no}} subsequent evidence of any other full-scale productions of Irene anywhere until 1999, {{making it one of the}} most unsuccessful plays ever written by a major author.|$|E
5|$|Overton {{was told}} {{he would not be}} given the decorations he had earned in Korea, {{including}} the awards from his previous tour which had not yet been <b>written</b> <b>up.</b> Overton had twice been pinned with a Distinguished Flying Cross personally by Fifth Air Force commander Lieutenant General Glenn O. Barcus, and he had been considered for several Silver Star Medals. Overton was also given a bad efficiency report which characterized him as insubordinate. Overton lost his temporary rank of captain. The military delayed official recognition of his credits and ace status until December 1953. He became one of 40 US aces during the war. Overton resigned his commission before the war ended.|$|E

5|$|Pat Secor, Hoppus' boss at {{music store}} The Wherehouse, was {{attempting}} {{to start his own}} record label, named Filter Records. Secor pulled money from his savings and helped finance and produce the demo recording. Buddha was recorded live at local Santee studio Doubletime, compiling a collection that represented nearly all of the songs the band had <b>written</b> <b>up</b> to that point. Hoppus and friends Cam Jones and Kerry Key created the cassette artwork, and the original cassette packaging was compiled by the band and Hoppus' family. Locally distributed to several San Diego record stores and available for purchase at early concerts, Buddha helped the trio cement an audience and was a deciding factor in their signing to local label Cargo in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} is fairly well understood by historians. The {{patron of the}} aqueduct– a rich individual or the city of Nîmes itself– would have hired a large team of contractors and skilled labourers. A surveyor or mensor planned the route using a groma for sighting, the chorobates for levelling, {{and a set of}} measuring poles five or ten Roman feet long. His figures and perhaps diagrams were recorded on wax tablets, later to be <b>written</b> <b>up</b> on scrolls. The builders may have used templates to guide them with tasks that required a high degree of precision, such as carving the standardised blocks from which the water conduit was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since {{it takes a long time}} to produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are <b>written</b> <b>up</b> to a year in advance. So the strike would have had to go on for a while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no mention}} of Hungarian Jews in the Vrba–Wetzler report.

In the second installment the next day he described having overheard the SS say they were looking forward to Hungarian salami. Vrba's failure to mention Hungarian Jews until 1961 has led several historians, including Miroslav Kárný and Randolph L. Braham, to dispute Vrba's later recollections, although they do not doubt the Vrba–Wetzler report itself.|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got <b>written</b> <b>up</b> in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, new {{prisoners were}} {{expected}} to pay garnish, a donation to the prisoners' committee. When the commissioners reported to parliament between 1815 and 1818, male prisoners were paying five shillings and sixpence, increased to eight shillings and sixpence {{by the time the}} anonymous witness was writing in 1833. Women were asked for a smaller sum. The fee allowed prisoners to use the snuggery, where water could be boiled and meals cooked, and candles and newspapers obtained. Prisoners failing to pay were declared defaulters by the prison crier, had their names <b>written</b> <b>up</b> in the kitchen, and were sent to Coventry.|$|E
50|$|Do Ra-hee (Park Bo-young) enters Dongmyung, a {{newspaper}} company, {{as an intern}} in the entertainment section. She soon discovers the dirty and hidden aspects of the journalism industry and learns the passion and enthusiasm of the press. She has to make non-existing news by corroborating stories. Her first assignment as an official journalist is to do a <b>write</b> <b>up</b> of a sexual assault scandal involving an upcoming young actor, Woo Ji-han (Yoon Kyun-sang), of a film studio JS. From her investigation of the new evidence of the scandal given to her for the <b>write</b> <b>up,</b> she found the evidence to be fabricated. So she told her boss, Ha Jae-kwan (Jung Jae-young) she {{is not going to}} do the <b>write</b> <b>up.</b> Her boss did the <b>write</b> <b>up</b> and post the scandalous article on their website. Later, from Seon-woo's (Bae Sung-woo) her ex-mentor suggestion she do a <b>write</b> <b>up</b> exposing the fabricated evidence used against the actor. The company refuses to use the <b>write</b> <b>up.</b> So, Ra-hee's colleagues assisted by posting the <b>write</b> <b>up</b> in the internet using public computers. This results in the arrest and prosecution of the film studio manager Jang (Jin Kyung) for corruption. The actor thanked her for clearing his name of the scandal. The movie ends with Ra-hee rushing out of the airport terminal where she send off her boyfriend Seo-jin (Ryu Deok-hwan) after receiving a tip off of a potential entertainment scoop.|$|R

5|$|When the Crypto Jews {{arrived on}} the island of Puerto Rico, they were hoping to avoid {{religious}} scrutiny, but the Inquisition followed the colonists. The Inquisition maintained no rota or religious court in Puerto Rico. However, heretics were <b>written</b> <b>up</b> and if necessary remanded to regional Inquisitional tribunals in Spain or elsewhere in the western hemisphere. As a result, many secret Jews settled the island's remote mountainous interior far from the concentrated centers of power in San Juan and lived quiet lives. They practiced Crypto-Judaism which meant that they secretly practiced Judaism while publicly professing to be Roman Catholic. Still, since Jews weren't permitted to worship, the Crypto Jews eventually intermarried with Catholics and therefore, Puerto Rico virtually had no Jewish history of which to speak.|$|E
5|$|While Kline was {{concerned}} with lighting, print quality, and color, Bonnie Prendergast, the script supervisor, took notes that would be <b>written</b> <b>up</b> after the company had finished for the day. Prendergast's role was to ensure continuity in wardrobe, actor position, and prop placement. Any changes in dialogue or ad-libbed lines were similarly written down. Assistant director Danny McCauley was responsible for collaborating with unit production manager Phil Rawlins to finalize shooting orders and assigning extras. Rawlins, McCauley, production manager Lindsley Parsons Jr., and Katzenberg were all tasked with keeping things moving {{as fast as possible}} and keeping the budget under control; every hour on stage cost the production $4000.|$|E
5|$|The news of FreeSpace 2 {{being in}} {{development}} was confirmed in a chat on November 6, 1998. FreeSpace 2 {{was developed in}} less than one year. The Volition team revealed they had <b>written</b> <b>up</b> a story and will be targeting high-end hardware with dogfights for {{a greater number of}} ships and even larger and more deadly capital ships. The team set themselves the goals of setting new standards for both single-player and multiplayer space combat simulations, and started to modify the FreeSpace game engine for FreeSpace 2. This team was the same team which had worked on Descent: FreeSpace, plus several new members. In order to flesh out the story, Volition hired Jason Scott as a full-time writer before work even started. The linear mission structure was adopted as it was decided it would help the immersion factor of the story greatly. As the relations between the Terrans and Vasudans dominated the first game, it was decided to scale the focus down to a personal level with Admiral Bosch and his decisions to rebel. Scott's close work with the designers, and co-ordination of the voice recording process helped to tightly integrate the story into the missions, giving a more sophisticated feel to the story.|$|E
