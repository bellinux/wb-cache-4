25|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> {{had other}} forms of autonomy. The provincial {{government}} system in 1975 we were promised. Bougainvillians were promised that after 5 years or after a few years, the provincial government {{will be replaced by}} the independent nation of Bougainville. So with this in mind, with this past history, we don't trust Papua New Guinea any more....|$|E

25|$|The next printed {{account was}} a 36-page tract in the Nahuatl language, Huei tlamahuiçoltica ("The Great Event"), which was {{published}} in 1649. This tract contains a section called the Nican mopohua ("Here it is recounted"), which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> touched on above. The composition and authorship of the Huei tlamahuiçoltica is assigned by a majority of scholars to Luis Laso de la Vega, vicar of the sanctuary of Tepeyac from 1647–1657.|$|E
25|$|In depth-first order, {{we always}} attempt {{to visit the}} node {{farthest}} from the root node that we can, but with the caveat {{that it must be}} a child of a node <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> visited. Unlike a depth-first search on graphs, {{there is no need to}} remember all the nodes we have visited, because a tree cannot contain cycles. Pre-order is a special case of this. See depth-first search for more information.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the name are {{controversial}} and are attributed by some authors to ancient Celtic tribes. According to a local legend, King Afonso I (Afonso Henriques) exclaimed to incite his troops storming the stronghold: Coragem! Já estamos com o pé nela! (Courage! <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> set a foot in it!). A more plausible hypothesis is, however, that penela is a diminutive of penha, a place selected to build a fortress on.|$|E

60|$|A {{stone or}} two <b>had</b> <b>already</b> whistled past our ears, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been forced in {{self-defence}} to draw our swords, when the tall minister whom <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> observed shoved {{his way through}} the crowd, and by dint of his lofty stature and commanding voice prevailed upon them to be silent.|$|R

25|$|Those {{representatives of}} the bourgeoisie who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture {{are a bunch of}} counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once {{conditions}} are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of them <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> seen through; others we have not. Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like Khruschev for example, who are still nestling beside us.|$|E
25|$|By taking limits, certain {{rational}} {{products with}} infinitely many factors can be evaluated {{in terms of}} the gamma function as well. Due to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, analytic functions can be written as infinite products, and these can sometimes be represented as finite products or quotients of the gamma function. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> seen one striking example: the reflection formula essentially represents the sine function as the product of two gamma functions. Starting from this formula, the exponential function as well as all the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions can be expressed {{in terms of the}} gamma function.|$|E
25|$|It {{must also}} be {{mentioned}} that {{quite a few of}} these men were not just enthusiastic amateurs but had been ‘professionals’ in their field before the war; there were quite a few sportsmen who had represented their country for instance, even at Olympic level. Then there were those like Raoul Bailleux, a theatre director in Brussels before the war, who during his time in the Colony wrote, produced and directed a number of ‘entertainments’ for the delectation of the Colony. Not to mention Camille Fabry, whom <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> met, a well-known poet and writer with a number of books to his name before the war.|$|E

25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells {{us to look at}} another bit unless <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It is easy to see that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E
500|$|In April 2015, Amnesty International posted online {{a letter}} from Manning in which she wrote, [...] "I am now {{preparing}} for my court-martial appeal before the first appeals court. The appeal team, with my attorneys Nancy Hollander and Vince Ward, are hoping to file our brief before the court {{in the next six}} months. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> had success in getting the court to respect my gender identity by using feminine pronouns in the court filings (she, her, etc.)." ...|$|E
500|$|Tsvetan Tsvetanov, Bulgaria's {{interior}} minister, {{reported that}} the two suspects responsible {{were members of the}} militant wing of Hezbollah; he said the suspected terrorists entered Bulgaria on 28 June and remained until 18 July. Israel had already previously suspected Hezbollah for the attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the report [...] "further corroboration of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> known, that Hezbollah and its Iranian patrons are orchestrating a worldwide campaign of terror that is spanning countries and continents." [...] Netanyahu said that the attack in Bulgaria was just one of many that Hezbollah and Iran have planned and carried out, including attacks in Thailand, Kenya, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan, Cyprus and Georgia.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{will go with}} you!" [...] an officer, whom I {{afterward}} came to {{know was}} Lieutenant Stockwell cried heartily, whereupon the sergeant, puffed up because of what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> done, declared that Jacob, he, and I would act as messengers.|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> {{passed by}} broad {{daylight}} {{the scene of}} our encampment at Coos Falls, and at length we pitched our camp on the west bank, {{in the northern part}} of Merrimack, nearly opposite to the large island on which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> spent the noon in our way up the river.|$|R
500|$|Principal {{photography}} for The Revenant {{began in}} October 2014. A planned two-week break from filming in December {{was extended to}} six weeks which forced Tom Hardy {{to drop out of}} Suicide Squad. In February 2015, Iñárritu, who shot the film using natural lighting, stated that production would last [...] "until the end of April or May", as the crew is [...] "shooting in such remote far-away locations that, by the time we arrive and have to return, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> spent 40% of the day". Brad Weston, president and CEO of New Regency Pictures, stated that principal photography had been challenging due to the ambitious nature of the film. Ultimately, principal photography wrapped in August 2015.|$|E
500|$|Shankara in his {{discussions of}} the Advaita Vedanta {{philosophy}} referred to the early Upanishads to explain the key difference between Hinduism and Buddhism, stating that Hinduism asserts that Atman (soul, self) exists, whereas Buddhism asserts {{that there is no}} soul, no self.Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , page 64; Quote: [...] "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [...] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.";Edward Roer (Translator), , pages 2-4Katie Javanaud (2013), , Philosophy Now;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 63, Quote: [...] "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept.

500|$|Final Fantasy XIII-2 {{was first}} hinted at {{three months after}} the January 2010 release of Final Fantasy XIII. Kitase said in an {{interview}} [...] "If we could do a XIII-2, we could direct all our attention to the story and refine what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> built." [...] Toriyama stated in the October 2010 Ultimania Omega companion book that he hoped to continue the story. Two months later, Nomura released a drawing of Lightning along with the words [...] "She must not be forgotten". On January 11, 2011, Square Enix registered the domain name FinalFantasy13-2game.com via a proxy company that it had used to register websites for several other unannounced games. Final Fantasy XIII-2 was officially announced at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo on January 18, 2011. The teaser trailer showed Lightning, outfitted in armor, drawing her weapon and engaging Caius, who was not yet named. To promote the game's release in Japan, Japanese singer Yuko Oshima was appointed the leader of a group of thirteen official test players.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{an error}} is generated, it will {{generally}} propagate through the calculation. For instance, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>already</b> {{noted that the}} operation + on a calculator (or a computer) is inexact. It follows that a calculation of the type [...] is even more inexact.|$|E
