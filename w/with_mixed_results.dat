5|$|A {{large number}} of {{molecular}} alterations are under study for their prognostic impact in AML. However, only FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA and c-KIT are currently included in validated international risk stratification schema. These are expected to increase rapidly in the near future. FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs) {{have been shown to}} confer a poorer prognosis in AML with normal cytogenetics.

Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.|$|E
5|$|Thrasher and Blastus are {{two teenage}} robots {{who live on}} the planet of Insanus. Their planet is {{inhabited}} by murderous robots who seek to kill one another for no apparent reason. Slightly less horrific than their peers, the duo seek to make it through high school, and navigate their lives <b>with</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>results.</b> Thrasher (Patton Oswalt), a tall and lanky robot, wishes to gain the affections of an attractive female robot named Maimy (Jessie Cantrell). Meanwhile, Blastus (John Gemberling), a small and rotund robot, just wants to be popular. As with Blastus, unlike most robots on Insanus, he is mostly sensitive and non-criminal, much to the disapproval of his mother. In his quest to be cool, however, he is incredibly impulsive and overconfident in his abilities. Thrasher, though calm and reserved, often falls prey to Blastus' badly-thought out plans.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1930s {{the number}} of active {{personnel}} remained low and out of necessity training opportunities were limited. After 1936, however, the Army attempted to improve the conditions of service for its members and to reinvigorate the training program, while individual units began to undertake their own recruiting campaigns. Nevertheless, {{it was not until}} 1938, as tensions grew in Europe and the prospect of war became more likely, that an attempt was made to expand the establishment of the Militia. At this time an effort was made to determine the readiness of the Militia to expand if mobilised. During the continuous training camps undertaken throughout 1938, each component unit was assessed <b>with</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>results.</b> The following year, 1939, saw further expansion {{and by the end of}} April of that year, the division's posted strength had grown to 9,589 personnel.

40|$|In {{this article}} we provide an {{empirical}} illustration of hypotheses, developed in the literature, {{on the role of}} density and strength of ties in innovation networks.

These findings, in line <b>with</b> the <b>mixed</b> <b>results</b> in the literature, seem to indicate that the distinction between exploration versus exploitation, albeit useful, is still too general. There may be a stronger sectoral effect in how exploration and exploitation settle in network structural properties than anticipated thus far. ...|$|R
40|$|In lexicalized phrase-structure or {{dependency}} parses, a word's modifiers tend to fall near {{it in the}} string. We {{show that}} a crude way to use dependency length as a parsing feature can substantially improve parsing speed and accuracy in English and Chinese, <b>with</b> more <b>mixed</b> <b>results</b> on German. We then show similar improvements by imposing hard bounds on dependency length and (additionally) modeling the resulting sequence of parse fragments. This simple "vine grammar" formalism has only finite-state power, but a context-free parameterization with some extra parameters for stringing fragments together. We exhibit a linear-time chart parsing algorithm with a low grammar constant...|$|R
