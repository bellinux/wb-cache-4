2500|$|Manhattan Valley has gentrified {{significantly}} {{since the}} 1980s. With this gentrification, rents {{in the area}} rose. The population of estimated Latino residents was fast dwindling by 1987. Meanwhile, nonprofit groups started to renovate many structures that were owned by the city, as well as build housing on previously vacant tracts of land. Reactions to this gentrification were mixed. In 1990, one resident stated, [...] "The crime situation is our biggest threat [...] but if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> it, we're also faced with gentrification." [...] Coinciding with this gentrification in 1990, crime was declining steeply, although drug dealings were still common; one large drug arrest {{had been made in}} December of that year. The Frederick Douglass Houses, which had become frequented by drug dealers, was thought to be stymieing the development of new housing in the area, which included two apartment towers that had been constructed in the preceding two years.|$|E

No espionage can tell you more than we will proclaim once {{a week on the}} house-tops. If you desire to have a Castle detective employed about the United Irishman office in Trinity Street I shall make no objection, provided the man be sober and honest. If Sir George Grey or Sir William Somerville would like to read our correspondence, we make him welcome for the present – only let the letters be forwarded without losing a post.

2500|$|When {{applying}} for a position at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Lexell submitted a paper called [...] "Method of analysing some differential equations, illustrated with examples", which was highly praised by Leonhard Euler in 1768. Lexell's method is as follows: for a given nonlinear differential equation (e.g. second order) we pick an intermediate integral—a first-order differential equation with undefined coefficients and exponents. After differentiating this intermediate integral we compare it with the original equation and get the equations for the coefficients and exponents of the intermediate integral. After we express the undetermined coefficients via the known coefficients we substitute them in the intermediate integral and get two particular solutions of the original equation. Subtracting one particular solution from another <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the differentials and get a general solution, which we analyse at various values of constants. The method of reducing {{the order of the}} differential equation was known at that time, but in another form. Lexell's method was significant because it was applicable to a broad range of linear differential equations with constant coefficients that were important for physics applications. In the same year, Lexell published another article [...] "On integrating the differential equation a'n'd'n'y + ba'n-1'd'm-1'ydx + ca'n-2'd'm-2'ydx'2 + ... + rydx'n = Xdx'n"d'n'y + ba'n-1'd'm-1'ydx + ca'n-2'd'm-2'ydx'2 + ... + rydx'n = Xdx'n|journal=Novi Commentarii Academia Scientarum Imperialis Petropolitanae|volume=14|issue=1|pages=215–237}} presenting a general highly algorithmic method of solving higher order linear differential equations with constant coefficients.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rae Wear, Bjelke-Petersen demanded total {{loyalty of}} the media and was unforgiving and vindictive if {{reporting}} was not to his satisfaction. In 1984, he reacted to a series of critical articles in the Courier-Mail by switching the government's million-dollar classified advertising account to the rival Daily Sun. He banned a Courier-Mail reporter who was critical of his excessive use of the government aircraft and Wear claims other journalists who wrote critical articles became the subject of rumour-mongering, were harassed by traffic police, or found that [...] "leaks" [...] from the government dried up. Journalists covering industrial disputes and picketing were also afraid of arrest. In 1985, the Australian Journalists Association withdrew from the system of police passes because of police refusal to accredit certain journalists. Journalists, editors and producers were also deterred from critical stories by Bjelke-Petersen's increasing use of defamation actions {{in order to try to}} [...] "stop talk about a corrupt government". Queensland historian Ross Fitzgerald was threatened with criminal libel in 1984 when he sought to publish a critical history of the state. The premier and his ministers launched 24 defamation actions against the Opposition leader and Labor Party and trade union figures, with 14 of them publicly funded. He saw no role for the media in making government accountable, telling the Australian Financial Review in 1986: [...] "The greatest thing that could happen to the state and the nation is when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the media. Then we would live in peace and tranquillity and no one would know anything." ...|$|E
