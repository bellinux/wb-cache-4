5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E

500|$|Vanderbilt {{was drawn}} to the notion that Graysmith went from a {{cartoonist}} {{to one of the most}} significant investigators of the case. He pitched the story as: [...] "What if Garry Trudeau <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and tried to solve the Son of Sam"? As he worked on the script, he became friends with Graysmith. The filmmakers were able to get the cooperation of the Vallejo Police Department (one of the key investigators at the time) because they hoped that the film would inspire someone to come forward with a crucial bit of information that might help solve this decades-old cold case.|$|E

500|$|During {{the editing}} phase, Singer {{thought that they}} had {{completed}} the film two weeks early, but <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and realized that they needed that time {{to put together a}} sequence that convinced the audience that Dean Keaton was Söze — and then do the same for Verbal Kint because the film did not have [...] "the punch that Chris had written so beautifully." [...] According to Ottman, he assembled the footage as a montage but it still did not work until he added an overlapping voice-over montage featuring key dialogue from several characters and had it relate to the images. Early on, executives at Gramercy had problems pronouncing the name Keyser Söze and were worried that audiences would have the same problem. The studio decided to promote the character's name. Two weeks before the film debuted in theaters, [...] "Who is Keyser Söze?" [...] posters appeared at bus stops, and TV spots told people how to say the character's name. [...] Despite these efforts, all the actors in the film consistently mispronounce his name as [...] "Soze" [...] instead of [...] "Söze".|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, {{a two-part}} hip hop track {{entitled}} [...] "Bow Down/I Been On" [...] was released onto Beyoncé's Soundcloud account. [...] "Bow Down", produced by Hit-Boy, was written after Beyoncé <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> with a chant stuck in her head, feeling angry and defensive. This was melded with a Timbaland-produced second half, [...] "I Been On", that makes prominent {{use of a}} pitch-distorted vocal as a homage to the Houston hip hop scene. Michael Cragg of The Guardian described the song as [...] "brilliantly odd", commending its loud, abrasive production, while Pitchforks Lindsay Zoladz noted the song's assertiveness and believed it served as an introduction {{of what was to}} come. [...] "Bow Down/I Been On" [...] was perceived as a significant departure from Beyoncé's existing catalogue, particularly for its aggressive nature. The song's atmosphere and its controversial [...] "Bow down, bitches" [...] refrain drew a mixed reaction from those who questioned whether the lyric was aimed at women or merely a moment of braggadocio. Beyoncé clarified after the album's release, where elements of [...] "Bow Down" [...] appear on the track [...] "Flawless", that the song and its refrain were intended as a statement of female empowerment.|$|E
500|$|Science fiction Grand Masters, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl collaborated for {{the first}} time on The Last Theorem. The novel {{initially}} was Clarke's, and he began working on it in early 2004. But in 2006, at the age of 88, ill health brought on by complications from post-polio syndrome, and writer's block, impeded his progress, and he asked Pohl for help. Pohl explained: [...] "Arthur said to me that he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and didn't know how to write any of the books he had contracted. The stories had just gone out of his head." [...] Clarke gave Pohl a 40–50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes, and over the next two years, Pohl wrote the book. Pohl said that [...] "Everything in the novel is something he either suggested or wrote or I discussed with him." [...] Some of Clarke's notes were so obscure that even Clarke himself could not understand them. Pohl, only two years younger than Clarke, had health problems of his own: he could no longer type and wrote the book out in longhand, leaving it up to his wife to translate his [...] "indecipherable scribbles". Clarke reviewed and approved the final manuscript of The Last Theorem in early March 2008, just days before he died. Pohl died five years later in September 2013.|$|E

2500|$|Before the 1984 season got underway, Boros' notoriety {{from his}} use of a {{computer}} became a distraction {{in the eyes of}} team management and baseball traditionalists. Longtime friend Phil Regan recalled, [...] "He received some criticism for using computers in the mid-1980s and now everyone in the game uses computers." [...] In their book on baseball's fascination with statistics, Alan Schwartz and Peter Gammons wrote:"Baseball's conservatives howled in horror. As 1984 neared, you'd think that George Orwell was in the press box: Almost every article on baseball and computers used a silly, futuristic lead, with machines replacing managers and robots turning double plays[...] [...] [...] Steve Boros <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> as the standard bearer of baseball's on-field information revolution. After one year on the job, having been profiled in dozens of publications and all but cast as a circus freak, he became unpopular enough in his own clubhouse that he was fired midway through the 1984 season." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stone's fourth studio {{album was}} written and {{recorded}} {{in about a}} week in Devon in early 2008. [...] "I kind of <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> and wanted to make an album", she says. [...] "It's very, very raw. It's a bunch of musicians, writers and myself, and we're just jamming, basically." [...] In promotion of the album, entitled Colour Me Free!, Stone played concerts throughout the United Kingdom in February and March. Originally scheduled for release in April 2009, Colour Me Free! was finally released on 20 October 2009, after EMI delayed the album's release. Joss revealed that her record company also fought her about the original cover of her new album, calling it [...] "offensive". It was changed to simple text and no picture of the singer on the American edition, the original cover was used on the other editions worldwide. In late August 2010, it was reported that Stone had left EMI and formed her own independent record label, Stone'd Records. EMI announced in late December that they would be releasing a greatest hits album, The Best of Joss Stone 2003–2009. The compilation was released on 30 September 2011. In 2010, She collaborated with Puerto Rican recording artist Ricky Martin for [...] "The Best Thing About Me Is You", and peaked at No. 74 on the U.S Billboard Hot 100 and which topped the Hot Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs chart, this was Stone's first number-one on all two charts, which also made her the first Briton of non-Hispanic origin to reach No. 1 on the Hot Latin Tracks and Latin Pop Songs chart.|$|E

60|$|Here I {{must say}} a word about a little follower, present even now before my eyes. I have been {{accompanied}} on my whole journey from Barnegat to Pike's peak by a pleasant floricultural friend, or rather millions of friends--nothing more or less than a hardy little yellow five-petal'd September and October wild-flower, growing I think everywhere in the middle and northern United States. I had seen it on the Hudson and over Long Island, and {{along the banks of the}} Delaware and through New Jersey, (as years ago up the Connecticut, and one fall by Lake Champlain.) This trip it follow'd me regularly, with its slender stem and eyes of gold, from Cape May to the Kaw valley, and so through the canons and to these plains. In Missouri I saw immense fields all bright with it. Toward western Illinois I <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> in the sleeper and the first thing when I drew the curtain of my berth and look'd out was its pretty countenance and bending neck.|$|E

"I do not pretend," [...] {{the latter}} {{continued}} gravely, [...] "to account for that, {{but it is}} my duty to warn you, Sir Everard, that that devotion may lead her to great lengths. Lady Dominey is naturally of an exceedingly affectionate disposition, and this return to a stronger condition of physical health and a fuller share of human feelings has probably reawakened all those tendencies which her growing fondness {{for you and your}} position as her reputed husband make perfectly natural. I warn you, Sir Everard, that you may find your position an exceedingly difficult one, but, difficult though it may be, there is a plain duty before you. Keep and encourage your wife's affection if you can, but let it be a charge upon you that whilst the hallucination remains that affection must never pass certain bounds. Lady Dominey is a good and sweet woman. If she <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> with that hallucination still in her mind, and any sense of guilt on her conscience, all our labours for these last months might well be wasted, and she herself might very possibly end her days in a madhouse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had had a}} {{hard time}} of it and was pretty well done up. My meat had lasted me well enough on short rations and I had filled up on cabbages; but I was often a long time without water, having to depend entirely on melted snow in the hollows of the rocks. I hurried down to the hut; it was a rough shed evidently erected for the use of whalers, and round it were ashes of fires, empty meat-tins, and other signs of the stay of sailors here. For the next month I lived here. The birds were returning. There was a stream close at hand, and enough drift-wood on the shores to enable me to keep up a {{constant}} fire. I <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> in November to see a vessel entering the bay. The crew would scarce believe me when I told them that I passed the winter on the island alone, and that I had lived for six months on seal-meat, penguins, and cabbages. I learned from them that the bay was known as Hillsborough Bay, and the cove where the whaler entered as Betsy Cove, and that it was a regular rendezvous of whalers. I fished with them all through the summer, and went home in the ship, and was soon down again on the books of Godstone & Son." ...|$|E
60|$|That itself indeed, for our restless friend, became {{by the end}} of a {{week the}} very {{principle}} of reaction: so that he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> with such a sense of having played a part as he needed self-respect to gainsay. He hadn't in the least stated at Lancaster Gate that, as a haunted man--a man haunted with a memory--he was harmless; but the degree to which Mrs. Lowder accepted, admired and explained his new aspect laid upon him practically the weight of a declaration. What he hadn't in the least stated her own manner was perpetually stating; it was as haunted and harmless that she was constantly putting him down. There offered itself however to his purpose such an element as plain honesty, and he had embraced, by the time he dressed, his proper corrective. They were on the edge of Christmas, but Christmas this year was, as in the London of so many other years, disconcertingly mild; the still air was soft, the thick light was grey, the great town looked empty, and in the Park, where the grass was green, where the sheep browsed, where the birds multitudinously twittered, the straight walks lent themselves to slowness and the dim vistas to privacy. He held it fast this morning till he had got out, his sacrifice to honour, and then went with it to the nearest post-office and fixed it fast in a telegram; thinking of it moreover as a sacrifice only because he had, for reasons, felt it as an effort. Its character of effort it would owe to Kate's expected resistance, not less probable than on the occasion of past appeals; which was precisely why he--perhaps innocently--made his telegram persuasive. It had, as a recall of tender hours, to be, for the young woman at the counter, a trifle cryptic; but there was a good deal of it in one way and another, representing as it did a rich impulse and costing him a couple of shillings. There was also a moment later on, that day, when, in the Park, as he measured watchfully one of their old alleys, he might have been supposed by a cynical critic to be reckoning his chance of getting his money back. He was waiting--but he had waited of old; Lancaster Gate as a danger was practically at hand--but she had risked that danger before. Besides it was smaller now, with the queer turn of their affair; in spite of which indeed he was graver as he lingered and looked out.|$|E
