2500|$|One Christian {{view is that}} Jesus mediates a New Covenant {{relationship}} between God and his followers and abolished the Mosaic Laws, according to the New Testament ( [...] ; , [...] etc.) From a Jewish perspective however, the Torah {{was given to the}} Jewish people and B'nei Noah as an eternal covenant (for example , , [...] ) and will never be replaced or added to (for example , [...] ). There are differences of opinion as to how the new covenant affects the validity of biblical law. The differences are mainly as a result of attempts to harmonize biblical statements that the biblical law is eternal ( [...] , [...] ) <b>with</b> <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> statements that suggest that it does not now apply at all, or at least does not fully apply. Most biblical scholars admit the issue of the Law can be confusing and the topic of Paul and the Law is still frequently debated among New Testament scholars (for example, see New Perspective on Paul, Pauline Christianity); hence the various views.|$|E
6000|$|Ver. 18. [...] "And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him." [...] Obedience {{is better}} than sacrifice. Noah is at the beck of God, what he bid him do, that does he; and indeed this is in truth to worship God, yea, this is to know and worship God. It is said of Abraham, when he went at God's command to offer up Isaac, that he counted it going to worship the Lord (Gen 22:5). And God saith of Hezekiah, that he did [...] "judgment and justice," [...] judging {{the cause of the}} poor and needy; and then adds, Is not this [...] "to know me, saith the Lord?" [...] (Jer 22:15,16). I bring these to shew, that {{obedience}} to the word of God, is the true character of God's people in all ages; and this very text, as also such others before, is on purpose recorded by the Holy Ghost, to shew you, that Noah was obedient in all things; yea, I may add, these commands were to discover the proof of him, whether he would be obedient in all things; and this was also his way <b>with</b> <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> churches (2 Cor 2:9). The sincerity of love, and of the uprightness of the heart, is greatly discovered by the commandments of God. [...] "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them," [...] saith Christ, [...] "he it is that loveth me" [...] &c. (John 14:21).|$|E

The Forward, New York's leading Yiddish-language newspaper, not only dropped him as a writer, but also openly attacked him for promoting Christianity.

5000|$|According to Peter C. Hodgson and James C.

In Strauss's [...] "Life of Jesus", he disagreed with the previous ideas that historical Jesus can be easily reconstructed in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> Manuscripts. Strauss pointed out that Christian tradition is fundamentally mythical, and that while he did not claim that there are no historical facts in the sources, there is too little evidence to reconstruct the historical image of Jesus to serve the Christian faith. Raising critical questions about Jesus's historical image made Strauss an important figure in the field of theology.|$|E
50|$|R. G.

R. G. Spurling disagreed with Landmarkism, an ecclesiology which held that only churches descending from churches with Baptist doctrine were true Church and that they should not associate with Christians of other traditions. Spurling felt that there needed to be another reformation of the Church that went beyond the Protestant Reformation so that Christians would be united together by love and not by creeds, which he believed divided. As long as something was not contrary to the New Testament, believers should be able to practice their faith in the form they chose.|$|E
