40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{described}} a novel technique for producing an electro-optical intensity synthesizer which can generate different periodic time domain waveforms through only sine or cosine wave applied-voltages.

Every electro-optical element has the same applied-voltage function but different azimuth angles and ratios between the longitudinal and transverse lengths.

These ranged from very simple ones much like the Quad Chromatic Pitch Generator (which was obviously too simple for desirable music) to far more complex schemes using nearly the full capabilities of the AD8 (which was already known to be too expensive). These simulations could be operated in real-time and their Relative Enjoyment Factor (REF) measured to determine how usable each design would be as a functional music synthesizer. The target goal was a REF above 80. Numerous designs were evaluated and considered along with their estimated production cost.

50|$|During {{the second}} half of the '80s, Kawai {{developed}} and released a number of digital synthesizers. The most known of these are the K series: Kawai K1, K1mkII, K3 (SSM2044-based filters), K4 and K5. These machines follow different synthesis approaches. The K4 use subtractive synthesis based on sampled waveforms, the K1 and K5 are additive synthesizers. The K1 is one of the first popular synthesizers that has no filter whatsoever; all sounds are made by stacking wave samples and applying frequency modulation. The K3 is hybrid in the sense that it does employ additive synthesis for <b>waveform</b> <b>generation,</b> but these waveforms are static and cannot be modulated as in a true additive synthesizer; instead, waveshaping is done using a low-pass filter, therefore characterizing this machine as a subtractive synthesizer. Uniquely for their price range, all instruments feature aftertouch. Kawai also manufactured rack versions of most of these instruments, Kawai Q-80 MIDI sequencer (1988), and an external MIDI programming device, MM-16 MIDI Mixer (MIDI processor with slider controllers). Kawai XD-5, a drum synthesizer based on the K4 engine, was produced in 1989-1990.|$|E

This thesis {{is devoted to}} the analysis and implementation of a newly proposed modulation technique for inverter operation. The technique known as delta modulation has been used previously in voice transmission. In inverter applications, analog implementation of DM has several distinct advantages over other modulation techniques. These are easy implementation, inherent V/f ratio control, low order harmonic attenuation and easy harmonic and commutation controls. [...] In this thesis, the delta modulation technique as the applied for inverter switching <b>waveforms</b> <b>generation</b> is analyzed. A Fourier analysis of the delta modulated inverter output has been carried out in order to study the harmonic behaviour of the inverter output. The analytical results confirms the advantageous features of the delta modulation technique. Practical implementation of the modulation process for inverter operations was realized and the results obtained in analytical studies were verified for a single phase bridge inverter. [...] Loading characteristics of a single phase delta modulated inverter were studied under different types of passive and dynamic loads. The passive loads were resistive and R-L loads. The dynamic loads were single phase induction motors. Theoretical results are verified experimentally for loading characteristics. [...] A modulation and a logic circuit were designed and implemented for a three phase inverter switching. The implementation involved the design and construction of a three phase sine reference wave generator, a three phase modulation circuit and the logic circuits for generation of proper switching waveforms of the three phase inverter switches.

40|$|At {{the level}} of {{fundamental}} research, fibre lasers provide convenient and reproducible experimental settings {{for the study of}} a variety of nonlinear dynamical processes, while at the applied research level, pulses with different and optimised features – e. g., in terms of pulse duration, temporal and/or spectral intensity profile, energy, repetition rate and emission bandwidth – are sought with the general constraint of developing efficient cavity architectures. In this talk, we review our recent progress on the realisation of different regimes of pulse generation in passively mode-locked fibre lasers through control of the in-cavity propagation dynamics. We report on the possibility to achieve both parabolic self-similar and triangular pulse shaping in a mode-locked fibre laser via adjustment of the net normal dispersion and integrated gain of the cavity [1]. We also show that careful control of the gain/loss parameters of a net-normal dispersion laser cavity provides the means of achieving switching among Gaussian pulse, dissipative soliton and similariton pulse solutions in the cavity [2, 3]. Furthermore, we report on our recent theoretical and experimental studies of pulse shaping by inclusion of an amplitude and phase spectral filter into the cavity of a laser. We numerically demonstrate that a mode-locked fibre laser can operate in dif- ferent pulse-generation regimes, including parabolic, flattop and triangular <b>waveform</b> <b>generations,</b> depending on the amplitude profile of the in-cavity spectral filter [4]. An application of technique using a flat-top spectral filter is demonstrated to achieve the direct generation of sinc-shaped optical Nyquist pulses of high quality and of a widely tuneable bandwidth from the laser [5]. We also report on a recently-developed versa- tile erbium-doped fibre laser, in which conventional soliton, dispersion-managed soli- ton (stretched-pulse) and dissipative soliton mode-locking regimes can be selectively and reliably targeted by programming different group-velocity dispersion profiles and bandwidths on an in-cavity programmable filter [6].
