50|$|Jesus then sends Mary to {{tell his}} brethren or {{brothers}} of the news. Previously in the Bible the word brethren {{had been used to}} describe Jesus' family. Mary delivers the message to his disciples, however, and scholars agree that they <b>were</b> whom <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> referring to. According to Alford this is said to show that since his resurrection a new closeness exists between Jesus and his followers and to confirm that even after the resurrection <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> <b>fully</b> human and a brother to other men.|$|R
2500|$|Although Christian orthodoxy {{holds that}} <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> <b>fully</b> human, the Epistle to the Hebrews, for example, states that Christ was 'holy and without evil' (7:26).

50|$|Candidly recalling his own {{journey of}} rediscovery of Jesus, Yancey {{demonstrates}} to his readers {{the arc of}} many Christians' intellectual faith walk. First he addresses possible misconceptions about Jesus physical appearance (probably not tall and gaunt, based on what one knows today of Jews of the time), moves onto his character, and his interactions with people and his disciples. He sincerely questions preconceived notions about <b>who</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> and is, drawing {{from a number of}} sources including many of Hollywood's various celluloid representations.|$|R

50|$|Apart from {{telling a}} miracle story {{that shows the}} power of Jesus, {{the author of the}} Gospel uses this story to advance a clearly {{theological}} purpose. It shows a character <b>who</b> understands <b>who</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> and the proper way to respond to him - with faith. The beggar, on being called to Jesus, discards his cloak, symbolising the leaving behind of possessions. And the use of the title, 'Son of David' - the only occasion on which this is used in the Gospel of Mark - serves to identify Jesus as the Messiah.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis {{is not just}} to {{understand}} <b>who</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ <b>was</b> in Koran and what role he played, but also to show that he was an important and respeted person not just in New Testament but also in the main book of Islam - Koran. Nowdays when Islamic radicals get in Christian lands and show themselves as true muslims doing disaster, profane people have bad opinion regarding the whole Islam in general and not every man knows that there is even written about Jesus in Koran. That's why I find important to create some kind of dialog between Islam and Christianity, to show that the most important person of Christian religion, <b>Jesus,</b> <b>is</b> respected in Koran, being human being, and to explain why Islam can't allow to take Jesus as divine being. Of course I will mention Marie - mother of <b>Jesus,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> another important person in Christianity and Islam and who can't be mother of God in Islam. The resons why <b>Jesus</b> can'b <b>be</b> Allah's son will be mentioned as well. And also I will use comparing analysis of Muslim and Christian Jesus for better understanding <b>who</b> muslim <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> and what mission for humankind he already brought and will bring in future.
