These albums {{produced more}} than twenty chart singles for the duo on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including the number 1 hits [...] "If You Ever Stop Loving Me", [...] "Something to Be Proud Of", [...] "Lucky Man", [...] "Back <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Knew</b> It All", and [...] "Roll with Me". Ten more of their songs reached the top 10 on the country charts, including the number 3 hit [...] "Gone", the most played country song by a duo in 2005. Tattoos & Scars, My Town, and You Do Your Thing are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1999, they were awarded Favorite New Artist—Country at the American Music Awards. Both the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association named them Duo of the Year in 2000, an award for {{which they have been}} nominated by both associations in every year since. In 2009, they were inducted into the Grand Ole Opry.|$|E
500|$|In June 2000, Killswitch Engage {{released}} {{their debut}} album, titled Killswitch Engage through Ferret Records. The band got its recording deal {{as a favor}} for the artwork bassist Mike D'Antonio created for Ferret. The label's CEO, Carl Severson signed the band without a contract simply to get the album {{out to the public}} because he thought the album [...] "ruled", and stated [...] "I had a one-off deal and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> they wanted to go someplace bigger, I figured it was in my best interest, as their friend, to make the best thing happen for them." [...] After the album was released, Severson showed it to Roadrunner Records A man, Mike Gitter.|$|E
500|$|Despite his struggles at {{the plate}} during the regular season, Ruiz was an {{integral}} part of the Phillies' postseason success. After the Phillies clinched the 2008 National League Championship Series, he commented that the glory of winning a crucial baseball game that clinched the series, which he had witnessed while growing up in Panama on television, [...] "happened to me", noting the aura of the moment, and that it culminated and validated the hard work he had put in over the years. Subsequently, in game 3 of the 2008 World Series, Ruiz tapped a ground ball up the third-base line for a walk-off infield single, the first in MLB history. Ruiz noted, [...] "I heard them cheering. And that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> 'Okay it's over'... I'll take a win." [...] The Phillies eventually won the World Series for the first time since 1980, doing so in five games, the last of which began on October 27 and ended on October 29 after it was suspended part-way through due to rain. For his performance in the playoffs, he earned the nickname [...] "Señor Octubre" [...] (Mr. October in Spanish).|$|E

500|$|The {{compilation}} album includes 19 {{songs by}} various artists. Thirteen {{of the tracks}} were previously unreleased; the six existing recordings were: [...] "Wish for You" [...] by Faith Hill, Sade's [...] "The Sweetest Gift", [...] "I Remember" [...] by Lauryn Hill, Seal's [...] "Secret", [...] "Fragilidad" [...] (1988) by Sting, and David Bowie's [...] "Everyone Says 'Hi'". Turlington said of the album: I went to friends first, as I did with the first CD. Bono and Chris Martin were great supporters of the project the first time around, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I wanted to include men on this album they were obvious choices. They are also both fathers to daughters. Others, such as Patti Smith and Rita Wilson, I've {{known for a long}} time, and some, like Edie Brickell and Paul Simon, I only met briefly but was a huge admirer. I generally wanted a diverse group of artists who were parents, {{or in the case of}} Edward Sharpe, who will be soon. We wanted to reach a broad audience on this issue with this particular project and with a range of perspectives.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, the duo {{went to the}} Ardent {{studios in}} Memphis, Tennessee to record their sixth album, Back <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Knew</b> It All. Once again, they worked with Blake Chancey as producer. This album's title track, co-written by Trent Willmon, was the duo's fastest-climbing single. Both it and followup [...] "Roll with Me", which {{included}} a backing vocal from Five for Fighting, went to number 1. [...] "One in Every Crowd", co-written by Montgomery with Kim Tribble and former Trick Pony bassist Ira Dean, was issued in January 2009 as the third single. By {{the middle of the}} year, this song peaked at number 5. The fourth single, the number 23 [...] "Long Line of Losers", was co-written and previously recorded by Kevin Fowler. Toby Keith, with whom Montgomery Gentry toured in mid-2008, contributed a guest vocal on the Terri Clark co-write [...] "I Pick My Parties", and Lillie Mae Rische of Jypsi made an appearance on [...] "God Knows Who I Am". Thom Jurek wrote of this album, [...] "The hardcore fans will love it, but this isn't the album that will win over many new ones." ...|$|E
500|$|Poe's {{characterization}} as an uncontrollable alcoholic is disputed. His drinking companion for a time, Thomas Mayne Reid, {{admitted that}} the two engaged in wild [...] "frolics" [...] but that Poe [...] "never went beyond the innocent mirth in which we all indulge... While acknowledging this as one of Poe's failings, I can speak truly of its not being habitual". Some believe Poe had a severe susceptibility to alcohol and became drunk after one glass of wine. He only drank during difficult periods {{of his life and}} sometimes went several months at a time without alcohol. Adding further confusion about the frequency of Poe's use of alcohol was his membership in the Sons of Temperance {{at the time of his}} death. William Glenn, who administered Poe's pledge, wrote years later that the temperance community had no reason to believe Poe had violated his pledge while in Richmond. Suggestions of a drug overdose have also been proven to be untrue, though it is still often reported. Thomas Dunn English, an admitted enemy of Poe and a trained doctor, insisted that Poe was not a drug user. He wrote: [...] "Had Poe the opium habit <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> him (before 1846) I should both as a physician and a man of observation, have discovered it during his frequent visits to my rooms, my visits at his house, and our meetings elsewhere – I saw no signs of it and believe the charge to be a baseless slander." ...|$|E

500|$|Hill {{started to}} {{participate}} in climbing competitions in the mid-1980s, but {{one of her first}} significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to free climb Ophir Broke in Ophir, Colorado, which has a difficulty rating of 5.12d and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said [...] "that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> for certain that this woman had extraordinary talent". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates {{the reason for this is}} that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: [...] "The big lesson for me... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't even imagine gripping... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 1953, {{after the}} {{fighting}} ceased, Nichols' 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron was dubbed the [...] "primary [...] collection agency of FEAF [...] ". Despite {{the fact that}} the Air Force effort was as large as the CIA and Naval intelligence units in Korea, the relatively junior Nichols remained entrusted with command. However, throughout the war, agent casualties had steadily climbed as the communists increased their security measures. From the end of 1952 onwards, insertions into the north had become virtual suicide missions. Nichols was haunted by the situation: [...] "I hate to call myself a man. I had {{to be the one to}} give the orders <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> someone was going to be killed." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, Schell {{returned}} to Germany {{and played the}} title role in William Shakespeare's Hamlet for German TV, a role that he would play on two more occasions in live theatre productions during his career. Along with Laurence Olivier, Schell is considered [...] "one of the greatest Hamlets ever," [...] according to some. Schell recalled that when he played Hamlet for the first time, [...] "it was like {{falling in love with}} a woman.... not until I acted the part of Hamlet did I have a moment <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I was in love with acting." [...] Schell's performance of Hamlet was featured as one of the last episodes of the American comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|When {{her parents}} {{took her to}} see the West End {{production}} of Les Misérables for her thirteenth birthday, [...] "that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I {{wanted to be on}} the stage." [...] Although she had not discovered her vocal ability until she was at college and had started working, Ellis cites her early influences as Liza Minnelli, Elaine Paige and Barbra Streisand; their music she would sing in her bedroom much to the disturbance of her older brother Andrew, now a keen fisherman. She has explained that fellow musical theatre actress Ruthie Henshall inspired her growing up: [...] " [...] was a success story from Suffolk … I think I identified with her because it was an actual story that I saw happen and was achievable. She was only a couple of years ahead of me and I could relate to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{complained to}} Victor Huguet (a French liaison officer serving with the British) about Wilson (6 October), but also told Wilson that French was getting “more unreasonable” and asked Wilson whether he (Murray) should resign; Wilson {{informed}} Billy Lambton, French’s secretary, {{of both of}} these incidents. Murray also (4–5 November) complained and threatened to resign when Wilson amended one of his orders without telling him. Murray later wrote (in 1930) [...] "Why did I stay with (this) War Office clique <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I was not wanted? I wanted to see Sir John through. I had been so many years with him, and knew better than anyone how his health, temper and temperament rendered him unfit, in my opinion, for the crisis we had to face. ..... the senior members (of GHQ staff) entirely ignored me, as far as possible, continually thwarted me, even altered my instructions." [...] He also claimed that Wilson's disloyalty had left him the impossible job of managing Sir John alone. Rawlinson noted in his diary that Murray became “a cipher at GHQ” (28 Nov 1914), was disliked by his subordinates (4 December) and that Sir John French often ignored his staff “chiefly because Murray is incapable of managing them and getting any good work out of them” (6 Dec 1914). Edmonds later claimed that Murray sometimes falsified the timing of orders, but he was given away by the time stamp which the duty clerk placed on them.|$|E

2500|$|After Navarro's {{departure}} {{in early}} 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were on the}} verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. That was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that this was the real deal, that the magic was about to happen again. Suddenly we could all hear, we could all listen, and instead of being caught up in our finite little balls of bullshit, we could all become players in that great universal orchestra again." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Catcher in the Rye" [...] {{was written}} after Rose watched a {{documentary}} on Mark David Chapman and {{wanted to write a}} song in dedication to John Lennon; the song is meant to criticize the book The Catcher in the Rye. [...] "Scraped" [...] takes the album back to an industrial rock style with Rose singing [...] "Don't you try to stop us now" [...] and [...] "All things are possible, I am unstoppable." [...] Discussing the origins of [...] "Riad N' The Bedouins", Rose stated [...] "Riad is the name my one time momentary brother-in-law of Erin Everly went by <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> him. Of part Lebanese descent and a former student of Pepperdine University, he claims to be an international arms dealer". Rose stated the song [...] "Sorry" [...] was about [...] "anyone talking nonsense at mine and the public's expense." [...] "I.R.S." [...] has Rose singing [...] "Gonna call the President, Gonna call myself a Private Eye, Gonna need the IRS, Gonna get the FBI" [...] over a guitar heavy track. [...] "Madagascar" [...] has been described as having a 'trip hop pulse' and its bridge features interwoven samples of quotes taken from the movies Mississippi Burning, Casualties of War, Cool Hand Luke, Braveheart, and Seven, and also contains several excerpts from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speeches [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] and [...] "Why Jesus Called A Man A Fool". [...] "This I Love" [...] is a song dating back to 1992 that Rose called [...] "the heaviest thing I've written". The song is a piano ballad with Rose singing to a former lover. [...] "Prostitute" [...] is another orchestral lined power ballad that features the lyrics [...] "Ask yourself, Why I would choose, To prostitute myself, To live with fortune and shame". According to early producer Youth, Rose 'labored' over the song due to past successes weighing heavily on him.|$|E
2500|$|Rumors {{began to}} {{circulate}} {{alleging that the}} Buccaneers were a disorganized and confused organization, and returning veterans were promised that changes were forthcoming. It was pointed out {{that none of the}} team's administrative staff had any experience in their position, {{at the same time that}} a team of rookie players and coaches was being fielded. These problems were addressed with the firings and resignations of six coaches and administrators at the beginning of the year. Head coach John McKay used the opportunity to take control of more aspects of the organization, and selected replacements of his choosing. McKay was criticized over his handling of the players, and was accused of cutting veterans who could have helped the team, such as Ira Gordon, over ego conflicts. A perception arose that McKay was intolerant toward challenges to his authority, as he frequently cut players who argued with him, and surrounded himself with former USC players and staff. Concern that McKay preferred players who would keep their mouth shut, rather than players with talent, produced resentment among veterans who worried that their limited career spans would be spent with a losing team. Critics accused McKay of attempting a style of play that was more appropriate for the college game, and noted Don Shula's comment that preparing for the Buccaneers was like preparing to play USC. Reporters who covered the team indicated that McKay did not respond to the losing streak with the humor that it was hoped he would, but that he became an [...] "old grouch" [...] who complained about his coaching assistants, game-day officiating, and opposing coaches who he accused of running up the score. This was reflected in a bitter tone that had crept into McKay's trademark humor, with comments such as [...] "I keep a picture of O.J. Simpson by my side at all times to remind me of the days <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> how to coach".|$|E
