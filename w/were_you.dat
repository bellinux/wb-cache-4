5|$|HeadGumIn 2015, {{following}} {{the success of}} Hurwitz and Blumenfeld's If I <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> podcast, the duo founded the HeadGum podcasting network. HeadGum includes 11 podcasts, {{many of which are}} hosted by comedians who were involved with CollegeHumor, including Streeter Seidell and Josh Ruben. Some of the notable program that {{can be found on the}} network includes Blumenfeld's very own If I <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> podcast, The Talk of Shame, and Gilmore Guys.|$|E
5|$|What <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? was {{released}} on September 27, 2011, by Hunt's independent record label Godless Hotspot in {{a joint venture with}} Nashville-based distributor Thirty Tigers. It was distributed by RED Distribution. Thirty Tigers reached out to Hunt during 2009 and offered their distribution and marketing services to him pending the album's completion. He subsequently assembled a marketing team and Godless Hotspot. What <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? was executive-produced by music manager and executive Randy Jackson, who originally helped Hunt get his first major-label record contract in 2003. The album's cover is a photograph taken by Hunt in North Hollywood that depicts an elderly woman looking askance at a collection of white garbage bags set against a concrete wall. The interior packaging of the album also features Hunt's photography, including a kaleidoscopic collage of photographed subjects in the fold-out CD booklet.|$|E

5|$|What <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? is {{the third}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Van Hunt, released September 27, 2011, on his independent label Godless Hotspot in {{a joint venture with}} distributor Thirty Tigers. It is the follow-up to Hunt's 2006 album On the Jungle Floor and follows a period of label conflict and mainstream obscurity for Hunt. Recording sessions for the album took place primarily at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles, where Hunt applied a minimalist recording approach and worked with a backing band comprising drummer Ruth Price, percussionist Melissa Mattey, and keyboardist Peter Dyer.|$|E
5|$|Written and {{produced}} by Hunt, What <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For? expands on his previous work's blend of R and rock music forms. Hunt sought {{to achieve a}} rawer musical aesthetic and incorporated rough rhythms, rock dynamics, and studio effects. Inspired by Hunt's experience in Los Angeles {{at the onset of}} the late-2000s recession, the album's subject matter deals with issues in contemporary society and dissonance in modern life. Music writers have noted the album for its predominantly rock style, incorporation of funk and soul, eccentric songs, varying musical structure, and Hunt's eclectic vocal range.|$|E

25|$|The {{play was}} written in January 2006, {{initially}} with the title If I <b>Were</b> <b>You,</b> which was then altered to I to I before reverting to the original. However, there were no plans to produce the play that year, as the Stephen Joseph Theatre already planned to produce revivals of Intimate Exchanges and Woman in Mind. However, on 21 February 2006, Alan Ayckbourn suffered a stroke. As a result, directorship of Intimate Exchanges passed to Tim Luscombe, {{and the production of}} Woman in Mind was eventually dropped altogether. Whilst in hospital, Ayckbourn decided to use his latest play as a goal to work towards. I to I was scheduled for the autumn slot vacated by Woman in Mind in June, rehearsed at the rehearsal studio at his home, and the play was announced to the public, now retitled as If I <b>Were</b> <b>You,</b> in July.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that If I <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> is part of a trend of Ayckbourn's adult plays taking {{inspiration}} from his family plays (in this case, The Jollies, which also deals with the adjustments and insights of being someone else) – the first example being Improbable Fiction and its derivation from The Boy Who Fell into A Book and My Very Own Story.|$|E

From that point on, Letterman slipped below Leno in the ratings, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno remained number one for the rest of its run.|$|E

After setting up his own label in 2009, Hunt began a new process for What <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> Hoping For?, writing and recording songs for 10 months. In an interview for the Chicago Tribune, {{he said of his}} expectations for the album's recording: [...] "I really wasn't sure what it would wind up being sonically. I love Bach cello suites, I love punk music, I love old blues, negro spiritual quartets, Muddy Waters' 'You Need Love.' There is a simplicity but also a bite that connects all that music, from the growl in the cello to the timbre in Muddy's voice. I wanted simple music, but with bite, over which I could lay my lyrical shenanigans." ...|$|E
