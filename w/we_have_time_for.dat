40|$|Long-term {{diseases}} are today {{the leading cause}} of mortality worldwide and are estimated to be {{the leading cause of}} disability by 2020. Person-centered care (PCC) has been shown to advance concordance between care provider and patient on treatment plans, improve health outcomes and increase patient satisfaction. Yet, despite these and other documented benefits, {{there are a variety of}} significant challenges to putting PCC into clinical practice. Although care providers today broadly acknowledge PCC to be an important part of care, in our experience we must establish routines that initiate, integrate, and safeguard PCC in daily clinical practice to ensure that PCC is systematically and consistently practiced, i. e. not just when we feel <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> it. In this paper, we propose a few simple routines to facilitate and safeguard the transition to PCC. We believe that if conscientiously and systematically applied, they will help to make PCC the focus and mainstay of care in long-term illness...|$|E
40|$|On March 11, 2011, a large {{earthquake}} that occurred offshore the northeast coast of Japan generated a large tsunami which devastated extensive {{areas of the}} Tohoku coastline and large casualties were recorded. Based on the experiences, coastal protection works in Japan {{are now in the}} process of modifications. In the present paper, Tokyo and Kanagawa are taken as examples and new methodologies are explained in the area. For the case of storm surge, a new model is applied to predict the future behavior of storm surge. For the case of tsunami, Genroku Kanto Earthquake (1703), Keicho Earthquake (1605) and Meiou Tokai Earthquake (1498) were mainly discussed in the numerical analysis, since tsunamis caused by these three earthquakes gave strong damages to coastal area of Kamakura, and left influences to Yokohama and Tokyo. New tsunami flood maps over coastal land area based on numerical simulations were presented to the residents of coastal region on April 2012 in Kanagawa prefecture. For Kamakura area, Keicho Earthqueke takes 90 minutes to reach the Kamakura coast and the height is over 12 m. But for the case of Genroku Kanto earthquake it takes 25 minutes and the height is 8 m. It appears that there are two different types of risk, 1) high wave comes but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> evacuation and 2) relatively small wave comes quickly and time is limited for evacuation. New countermeasures including soft and hard techniques are also required...|$|E
40|$|The {{assignment}} {{of this paper}} {{came at a time}} in my ministry when the limitations of time were being keenly felt. Frustration was beginning to rise and all the emotions and syndromes of the harried preacher were fast becoming for me the 20 th century's version of the infamous medieval torture, the shrinking room. The assignment has proven to be quite challenging and a real blessing. Time, or at least its use, touches on every aspect of the pastoral ministry. To address the subject of effective use of time by the parish pastor would necessitate a much longer study than <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> at one conference. To limit the paper I have arbitrarily eliminated such pertinent areas as a Scriptural study of the pastoral office, techniques for organizing and enabling members of a congregation to carry out their ministry more effectively, motivating the saints, effective leadership and effective systems for Christian churches. We will also not dwell extensively upon the God-given functions of a Christian congregation, though keeping clear objectives is a major key to the effective use of time in the parish ministry. Every effort has been made to keep this paper as practical as possible with the hope the listeners will be able to find some insights to help them with what is often a nagging problem: time management. I. A Pastor's Problem with Time The pastoral ministry is a diverse, multi-faceted calling. The world classifies it among the professions...|$|E
