25|$|After {{meeting her}} back stage {{at a private}} party, Panfilov <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{familiar}} with an obscure romance called Evening Ends (Уходит вечер). Pleasantly surprised with the affirmative, he decided to include this number in the film and later wrote a small role exclusively for the singer.|$|E
2500|$|According to Muhammad al-Bukhari, Muhammad {{stayed for}} three days between Khaybar and Medina, where he consummated his {{marriage}} to Safiyya. His companions <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{to be considered a}} slave (...) or a wife. The former speculated that they would consider Safiyya as Muhammad's wife, and thus [...] "Mothers of the Believers", if Muhammad ordered her to veil herself, else she would be his servant-girl.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948 Evans {{returned}} to the film studios after an absence of more than thirty years. At the instigation of Emlyn Williams she appeared in The Last Days of Dolwyn. The cast included Williams, Richard Burton, in his first film, and Allan Aynesworth, who had created the role of Algernon in The Importance of Being Earnest in 1895. This was Aynesworth's last film; Evans went on to make eighteen more {{over the next three}} decades. She played an elderly Welsh woman, and was well received by reviewers, although one <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> yet quite at home before the camera: [...] "there are indeed moments when she looks as disproportionate as a life-size Rembrandt in a one-room flatlet. But it is not, of course, the flatlet which stays in the memory". In the same year she played Countess Ranevskaya in Thorold Dickinson's film version of The Queen of Spades.|$|E
60|$|I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> not deluding {{herself with}} some {{impossible}} hope. It was not that, however.|$|R
60|$|Norman of Torn <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> {{angry with}} him and then, being new at love, he blundered.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a note}} in {{her voice}} which young Tom did not understand. Afterwards, when he {{reflected}} about the matter, he <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> unhappy.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me with those {{pleasant}} eyes of hers, which had remained as candid and as sympathetic as they had been more than twenty years before. I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> making a fool of me.|$|E
60|$|But all day as Serge worked he thought. And his {{thoughts}} were of Olga Ileyitch, the girl {{that he had}} seen with Kwartz, inspector of police. He wondered why she had killed Popoff, the inspector. He <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dead. There seemed no justice in it.|$|E
60|$|Her {{settlement}}-house {{classes were}} {{closed for the}} summer. She brooded over the settlement work and accused herself of caring less for people than for the sensation of being charitable. She <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a hypocrite.... Then she would take another cold bath to be fresh for the home-coming of Carl, the tired man whom she had to mother, and toward whom, of all the world's energies, {{she knew that she}} was not hypocritical.|$|E
60|$|Carley <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> {{narrow and}} dense to {{circumstances}} of life differing {{from her own}} when a remark of Flo's gave pause to her reflections.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> <b>been</b> {{transformed}} into Button-Bright?" [...] said Dorothy nervously. Then she looked steadily {{at the boy}} and asked, [...] "Are you Ozma? Tell me truly!" ...|$|R
50|$|Esther is a young, {{attractive}} waitress at {{a restaurant}} in Bangui. Nicolaides <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a pupulenge, (“slut”). He would like to sleep with her, but never does.|$|R
60|$|At {{the window}} of a house opposite, Patty often saw a little girl who sat there playing with an old doll or a torn book. She never seemed to run about or go out, and Patty often <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sick, she looked so thin and sober, and was so quiet. Patty began by making faces at her for fun, but the little girl only smiled back, and nodded so good-naturedly that Patty was ashamed of herself.|$|E
60|$|Josie {{hoped he}} would soon go out again, {{but he seemed to}} have no {{intention}} of doing so. So she climbed her ladder until she could look into the window above, which was also open. The old lady she had seen at breakfast was lying upon the bed, her eyes closed. Josie <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> asleep. The door leading from the room to the hallway also stood open. The weather was warm, and the old lady evidently wanted plenty of air.|$|E
60|$|Allie's {{hands shook}} {{as she opened}} the packages. That very hour might bring her freedom. She was {{surprised}} to find a complete outfit of woman's apparel, well made and of fine material. Benton, then, had stores and women. Hurriedly she made the change, which was very welcome. The dress did not fit her as well as it might have done, but the bonnet and cloak were satisfactory, as were also the little boots. She found a long, dark veil and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> expected to put that on.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> crying still, {{and what}} is the matter with her! Perhaps I had better go and see.' And he got up and, calling her by name, went out to the shed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes--the best song <b>she</b> {{has written}} <b>is</b> to be sung {{in the best}} manner to the best air that has been {{composed}} for it. I should not <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> going to sing it herself.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} her, and I winced also. She shrank in such simple pain {{from the fact}} of her defect. I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> bullied because of it, or only afraid lest {{visitors}} would dislike it.|$|R
60|$|I {{went home}} {{thinking}} {{of all these}} things and of Donna Giulia. I was rather amused at my unintentional kiss; I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> thinking of me.... She really was a charming creature, and I was glad {{at the idea of}} seeing her again on the morrow. I liked her simple, fervent piety. She was in the habit of going regularly to mass, and happening to see her one day, I was struck with her devout air, full of faith; she also went to confessional frequently. It was rather absurd to think she was the perverse being people pretended....|$|E
60|$|Skipper Simms paid no {{attention}} to him. His eyes swept aloft to the upper deck. There he saw a wide-eyed girl and a man looking down upon them. He <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the one they sought. There were other women aboard. He could see them, huddled frightened behind Harding and Norris. Some of them were young and beautiful; {{but there was something about}} the girl above him that assured him she could be none other than Barbara Harding. To discover the truth Simms resorted to a ruse, for he knew that were he to ask Harding outright if the girl were his daughter the chances were more than even that the old man would suspect something of the nature of their visit and deny her identity.|$|E
6000|$|Charles was asleep, and {{throwing}} a shawl round her, {{she sat down}} {{in the dim light of}} the lamp, relieved by the stillness, only broken by now and then a louder note of the music down-stairs. It was very comfortable, after all that buzz of talk, and the jokes that seemed so nonsensical and tiresome. There were but two people who could manage to make a party entertaining, and that was the reason it was so different last year. Then Amy <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the only person who felt sick at heart and dreary; but she only wondered for a moment--she murmured half aloud to herself, 'I said I never would think of him except at my prayers! Here I am doing it again, and on Christmas night. I won't hide my eyes and moan over my broken reed; for Christmas is come, and the circles of song are widening round! Glory! good will, peace on earth! How he sang it last year, the last thing, when the people were gone, before we went up to bed. But I am breaking my resolution again. I must do something.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Janet <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> dreaming. Granny Thomas' love potion {{seemed to}} have turned the world upside down. For Randall's arms were about her and Randall was {{pressing}} his lean bronzed cheek to hers and Randall was saying: ...|$|R
60|$|As Wayne {{received}} {{the ball in}} the pitcher's box, he paused and looked out across the field toward a white-crowned motor car, and he caught a gleam of Dorothy Huling's golden hair, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> glad.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{very pretty}} girl <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> too. I {{remember}} seeing {{her at her}} uncle's last year. I shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> to marry her cousin Bernard. He {{is to have the}} property, you know; and he's my nephew." ...|$|R
5000|$|Klausner {{was criticized}} {{by those who}} {{questioned}} whether she actually read the books she reviewed, given the time taken {{to read a book}} and the number of reviews Klausner published per day. Additionally, every book she read was given a 4 or 5 star review. Sarah Kaplan said [...] "Her unrelenting positivity made her reviews utterly uninformative." [...] Stanley, her husband, said: [...] "She's soft, I won't deny that." [...] Some <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> being paid for the reviews, and others <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> even a real person.|$|E
50|$|After {{meeting her}} back stage {{at a private}} party, Panfilov <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{familiar}} with an obscure romance called Evening Ends (Уходит вечер). Pleasantly surprised with the affirmative, he decided to include this number in the film and later wrote a small role exclusively for the singer.|$|E
5000|$|Jordis {{wrote the}} song {{about how she}} was {{stumbling}} over herself during the competition. Jordis went through a phase where she kept second guessing herself and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> right for INXS. After performing the song, Dave Navarro asked if she was losing a little edge and if she was losing a little fire. Jordis said she was stumbling {{and that is why}} wrote the song.|$|E
50|$|In Auckland, Mr Hammond {{is waiting}} for his wife, back from Europe. After talking to some other people waiting at the harbour, she lands in but takes her time, leading him to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sick during the voyage - <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not.|$|R
6000|$|... "I remember," [...] she said, [...] "Mrs. Curtis kept great order. In fact, between ourselves, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{rather a}} dragon; and Lady Temple, {{though she had}} one child then, seemed like my {{companion}} and playfellow. Dear little Lady Temple, I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> altered!" ...|$|R
60|$|Carley <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> not so {{constituted}} {{that such}} trickery alienated her. Deep {{in her heart}} she resented being made to show her cowardice. But then she realized {{that no one had}} really seen any evidence of her state. It was fun to them.|$|R
5000|$|According to Muhammad al-Bukhari, Muhammad {{stayed for}} three days between Khaybar and Medina, where he consummated his {{marriage}} to Safiyya. His companions <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{to be considered a}} slave (ma malakat aymanukum) or a wife. The former speculated that they would consider Safiyya as Muhammad's wife, and thus [...] "Mothers of the Believers", if Muhammad ordered her to veil herself, else she would be his servant-girl.|$|E
50|$|A Los Angeles Judge Gary Feess {{has ruled}} in favor of the health plan, citing that SAG P&H had not even {{followed}} their own rules. This judgement was later overturned by a higher California court (9th District Court) and sent back to the L.A. lower court. Where upon the Judge <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ever disabled and then retired from the Bench. The case was transferred to Judge Manuel Real, who is known for creating his own rules.|$|E
50|$|As the {{situation}} got worse, Beeny was permanently attached with Dredd as he fought to pacify select blocks and contain the infected. The grim {{nature of the}} work - executing any and all lawbreakers and infected - wore Beeny down, causing her to strike a citizen. Distraught, she tried to turn in her badge but Dredd refused, saying it was currently legal and he needed her too badly. He privately <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to be another promising career that burnt out.|$|E
5000|$|Chelsea Manning {{is alleged}} to have said [...] "Information should be free" [...] to Adrian Lamo when {{explaining}} a rationale for US government documents to be released to WikiLeaks. The narrative goes on with Manning <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "'hacker', 'cracker', 'hacktivist', 'leaker' or what".|$|R
5000|$|Her {{physical}} {{differences from}} her parents also leads her to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> in fact, a changeling. It is later revealed that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> indeed part fairy; her mother Aurora was half-fairy (due to familial circumstances that forced the real Aurora to be exchanged with a half-blood changeling.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> fond of him," [...] said the curate to himself, when he {{resolved}} {{to go to}} bed instead of beginning his sermon that night. [...] "I shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> for he is just the sort of man to make a girl fond of him." ...|$|R
