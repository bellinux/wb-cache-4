5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

Rajamouli used those birds in several shots.

500|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The album's title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the title's meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative of something else. So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'" [...] He reinforced, [...] "We're not trying to break new ground in music. We're {{just trying to make}} good music." [...] The album was described as a [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album [...] "doesn't seem like we're departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that {{we had a lot of}} potential and there's a lot of different stuff <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where we were going to go from there." ...|$|E

All that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> was to carry off about 2000 of the foot, who, running away in the rout of the left wing, rallied among our squadrons, and got away with us. Thus we stood till we saw all was lost, and then made the best retreat we could to save ourselves, several regiments having never charged, nor fired a shot; for the foot had so embarrassed themselves among the lines and works of the enemy, and in the vineyards and mountains, that the horse were rendered absolutely unserviceable.|$|E

At first, I had no thought of doing more than breaking down the bridge, and of perhaps checking the advanced cavalry; but when I found that the peasants who came along were quite willing to aid, {{it seemed to me that}} by cutting down the trees, so as to block the road and make a shelter for us, we might be able to cause the enemy considerable delay. I hardly hoped to succeed in holding out so long, or in inflicting such loss upon him as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It did not require any military knowledge whatever, and I should not have attempted it had I not seen that, thanks to the forest, we should be able to retreat when we could no longer hold the barricade of felled trees." ...|$|E
60|$|As we gazed {{upon the}} beauties thus {{revealed}} by Good, {{a spirit of}} emulation filled our breasts, and we set to work to get ourselves up {{as well as we}} could. The most, however, that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to array ourselves in our spare suits of shooting clothes, of which we each had several, all the fine clothes in the world could never make it otherwise than scrubby and insignificant; but Sir Henry looked what he is, a magnificent man in his nearly new tweed suit, gaiters, and boots. Alphonse also got himself up to kill, giving an extra turn to his enormous moustaches. Even old Umslopogaas, who was not in a general way given to the vain adorning of his body, took some oil out of the lantern and a bit of tow, and polished up his head-ring with it till it shone like Good's patent leather boots. Then he put on the mail shirt Sir Henry had given him and his 'moocha', and, having cleaned up Inkosi-kaas a little, stood forth complete.|$|E

Mother did not say much, but I am sure that at heart she is very grateful, for the earl himself came down to the Rectory and spoke warmly about us, and said that he should always be our fast friend, because we had given his cousin some help when he was roughly pressed by the Spaniards. I hope we shall have another sail with you in a short time, for we are not going back to the Netherlands at present, as things are likely to be quiet there now. Although he did not say so, I think Sir Francis thought that we were over young for such rough work, and would be more useful in a year's time; for, you see, in these sieges even pages have to take their share in the fighting, {{and when it comes to}} push of pike with the Spaniards more strength and vigour are needed than we possess at present. So we are to continue our practice at arms at the castle, and to take part in the drilling of the companies the earl is raising in case the Spaniards carry out their threat of invading England." ...|$|E

60|$|They had, it seems, quite mistaken us before, expecting {{nothing of}} an enemy or a pirate in those seas; and, not doubting but we {{had been one of}} their own ships, they seemed to be in some {{confusion}} when they found their mistake, so they immediately hauled upon a wind on the other tack, and stood edging in for the shore, towards the easternmost part of the island. Upon this we tacked, and stood after him with all the sail we could, and in two hours came almost within gunshot. Though they crowded all the sail they could lay on, there was no remedy but to engage us, and they soon saw their inequality of force. We fired a gun for them to bring to; so they manned out their boat, and sent to us with a flag of truce. We sent back the boat, but with this answer to the captain, that {{he had nothing to do}} but to strike and bring his ship to an anchor under our stern, and come on board us himself, when he should know our demands; but that, however, since he had not yet put us to the trouble of forcing him, which we saw <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> we assured them that the captain should return again in safety, and all his men, and that, supplying us with such things as we should demand, his ship should not be plundered. They went back with this message, and it was some time after they were on board before they struck, which made us begin to think they refused it; so we fired a shot, and in a few minutes more we perceived their boat put off; and as soon as the boat put off the ship struck and came to an anchor, as was directed.|$|E
6000|$|But the Adullamite spirit went to work, {{and finding}} that the bill [...] had the popular {{recommendation}} of a great phrase [household [...] suffrage], combined with the recommendation to them of a narrow [...] sphere of practical operation, determined to support the principle [...] of the bill and abandon our plan, although our mode of operation [...] had been warmly approved at party meetings held at my house. The [...] result was in a tactical sense highly damaging to us. Perhaps we [...] ought to have recognised {{that the idea of}} household suffrage, when [...] the phrase had once been advertised by a government as its [...] battle-ground, was irresistible, and that the only remaining [...] choice was whether it should be a household suffrage cribbed, [...] cabined, and confined by the condition of personal ratepaying, or [...] a household suffrage fairly conforming in substance and operation [...] to the idea that the phrase conveyed. The first was in our view [...] totally inadmissible; the second beyond the wants and wishes of [...] the time. But the government, it must be admitted, bowled us over [...] by the force of the phrase; and made it our next duty to bowl them [...] over by bringing the reality of the bill into correspondence with [...] its great profession. This <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in some degree, when [...] we reached the committee, for some of the restrictions included in [...] the measure were such as the double-facing liberal fringe did not [...] venture to uphold against the assaults of their own party.

The government were [...] beyond all doubt, at least for the moment, masters of the [...] situation. The question was raised, if not in its fullest breadth [...] yet in a form of considerable efficiency, by a proposal from Mr. [...] Hodgkinson, member for Newark, and a local solicitor little known [...] in the House.(152) He went there to support it, but without an [...] idea that it could be carried, and anticipating its defeat by a [...] majority of a hundred. Never have I undergone a stranger emotion [...] of surprise than when, as I was entering the House, our whip met [...] me and stated that Disraeli was about to support Hodgkinson’s [...] motion.
