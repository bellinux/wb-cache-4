When the war began, he decided to supply ammunition to the guerrilla fighters, yet in {{the capacity of the}} SDO of Habiganj. As the Mujibnagar government was yet to be formed and war of liberation remained to be formally launched, many police officers disagreed to give arms and ammunition without a written order. Khan fearlessly gave written note ordering to provide the freedom fighters with food and money. Collecting from the sub-divisional treasury, he arranged to send nearly three Crore taka to Agartala by a truck to help run the Bangladesh Government to be formed on 17 April 1971. Later he left Bangladesh, the then East Pakistan, and moved to Agartala, India across the border to physically participate in the war of liberation. He said, [...] "After reaching Agartala <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> building up an 'eastern administration'. Our main aim was to support the freedom fighters and to help the refugees who had escaped Bangladesh and lived in camps. We established a connection with the Mujibnagar Government after a few months of its formation on 17 April 1971. During the initial months, we had to struggle single-handedly". In July, he was asked to come to Kolkata (Calcutta) to join the government. There he began working at the Cabinet division as a deputy secretary. Later, in August, he was transferred to Defense Ministry.|$|E

Methedrone is currently a legal drug in many jurisdictions, however studies show that it shares major pharmacological properties with drugs that have been banned, such as mephedrone and methylone. Also, the effects of Methedrone are very similar to the effects of banned drugs in mice. This suggests that Methedrone may be just as harmful as most commonly found Illicit drugs.|$|E

First, we optimized our implementation of tessellation when rendering simple geometries like rectangles, lines, rounded rectangles, and ellipses." [...] These common-case optimizations claimed {{to improve performance}} {{in the range of}} 184% to 438%, depending on the primitive. The post continued: [...] "Second, to improve performance when rendering irregular geometry (e.g. geographical borders on a map), we use a new graphics hardware feature called Target Independent Rasterization, or TIR. TIR enables Direct2D to spend fewer CPU cycles on tessellation, so it can give drawing instructions to the GPU more quickly and efficiently, without sacrificing visual quality. TIR is available in new GPU hardware designed for Windows 8 that supports DirectX 11.1." [...] This was followed by a benchmark using some 15 SVGs, claiming performance improvements in the range of 151% to 523%. The section concluded: [...] "We worked closely with our graphics hardware partners to design TIR. Dramatic improvements were made possible because of that partnership. DirectX 11.1 hardware is already on the market today and we’re working with our partners to make sure more TIR-capable products will be broadly available." ...|$|E

50|$|On International Women’s Day 2016, WECF {{launched}} its publication ‘Women and Chemicals - The impact of hazardous chemicals on women. A thought starter {{based on an}} experts workshop’. With Women and Chemicals, WECF presents a deeper look at the nexus between gender roles and women’s exposure to hazardous chemicals worldwide and it summarizes existing information and initiatives on the topic. The Report demonstrates that women are often differently exposed due to their (entrenched) gender roles and because of biological susceptibilities and health impacts. In particular, the Report proposes {{an examination of the}} impacts of highly hazardous pesticides, mercury, and endocrine disrupting chemicals on the health of women everywhere. The Report concludes with a call for more political action for better health protection from harmful chemicals for all, but in particular for women as consumers and workers. The goal is to raise awareness about what people can do for their health and how they can change their own behaviors as consumers. As Alexandra Caterbow states: “in this report <b>we</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> women, because often men’s health impacts are already better known, from reduced sperm-counts to testicular cancer and genital malformations. We call on urgent legislative measures to better protect the health of women, men and children from hazardous chemicals. Immediate steps have to be taken to end use of highly hazardous pesticides, to phase out EDCs such as Bisphenol A from consumer products and packaging, to ban mercury use in artisanal small gold mining, and to promote the use of safer substitutes and non-chemical alternatives”.|$|E
