According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.|$|E

25|$|As of 2008, {{only a few}} new Marcellus wells were {{actually}} in operation, {{with at least one}} reported to be producing more than 3 million cubic feet (85 thousand m³) per day. Engelder, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> natural rock fractures in this area for more than 25 years, noted that drilling horizontally through the Marcellus shale perpendicular to the vertical fractures better connected the natural pathways for gas flow. Early results show that horizontal wells in this formation are producing gas at a rate more than double that of vertical wells, and at slightly lower cost overall, despite the much higher initial cost of drilling.|$|E

25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds {{are the most}} intelligent. While parrots have the {{distinction}} of being able to mimic human speech, studies with the African grey parrot have shown that some are able to associate words with their meanings and form simple sentences (see Alex). Parrots and the corvid family of crows, ravens, and jays are considered the most intelligent of birds. Not surprisingly, research has shown that these species tend to have the largest HVCs. Dr. Harvey J.

25|$|Other {{documents}} {{describe an}} alternative series of events. According to this version, Powell's family declined {{to retrieve the}} body, at which point Powell was buried at Holmead's Burying Ground in either June 1869 or February 1870. A.H. Gawler of Gawler's Funeral Home handled the reburial. The burial site was unmarked, and only Gawler and a few Army personnel knew where Powell was interred at Holmead's. Holmead's closed in 1874, {{and for the next}} decade bodies were disinterred and reburied elsewhere. Family members and friends reclaimed about 1,000 bodies. The remains of 4,200 Caucasians were removed to Rock Creek Cemetery, while several hundred African American remains were reinterred at Graceland Cemetery. According to the Washington Evening Star newspaper, Powell's body was exhumed by Gawler's on December 16, 1884. The identifying glass vial was recovered, but the paper it was supposed to contain was missing. Wesley Pippenger, a historian <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> Holmead's Burying Ground, asserts that Powell's remains were buried at Graceland Cemetery. With unclaimed white remains at Graceland moved to mass graves at Rock Creek Cemetery, Powell's remains may lay there.|$|E

Carolyn Collette, a literary critic <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> Davison's writing, identifies the different motives ascribed to Davison, including [...] "uncontrolled impulses" [...] or a search for martyrdom for women's suffrage. Collette also sees a more current trend among historians [...] "to accept what some of her close contemporaries believed: that Davison's actions that day were deliberate" [...] and that she attempted to attach the suffragette colours to the King's horse. Cicely Hale, a suffragette {{who worked at the}} WSPU and who knew Davison, described her as [...] "a fanatic" [...] who was prepared to die but did not mean to. Other observers, such as Purvis, and Ann Morley and Liz Stanley—Davison's biographers—agree that Davison did not mean to die.|$|E
500|$|A newly {{emergent}} threat {{facing the}} golden-crowned sifaka is hunting by the gold miners {{moving into the}} region's forests. [...] Although mining operations are small scale, the practice of gold mining takes a toll on the forested regions because deep mining pits are often dug near or underneath large trees, disturbing the extensive root systems and ultimately killing {{the trees in the}} area. The influx of gold miners has also increased poaching pressure. Although the species is protected from hunting by local fady (taboo) around Daraina, due to their likeness to humans, and by Malagasy law, the gold miners who have immigrated to the area have begun to hunt the golden-crowned sifaka as a source of bushmeat. In 1993, David M. Meyers, a researcher <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> the golden-crowned sifaka, speculated that if bushmeat hunting were to escalate, the species would go extinct in less than ten years since it is easy to find and not fearful of humans. [...] Indeed, bushmeat hunting by people from nearby Ambilobe has already extirpated at least one isolated population.|$|E
500|$|Many assertions {{about the}} year 2012 form part of Mayanism, a non-codified {{collection}} of New Age beliefs about ancient Maya wisdom and spirituality. The term is distinct from [...] "Mayanist," [...] {{used to refer to}} an academic scholar of the Maya. Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni says that while the idea of [...] "balancing the cosmos" [...] was prominent in ancient Maya literature, the 2012 phenomenon did not draw from those traditions. Instead, it was bound up with American concepts such as the New Age movement, millenarianism, and the belief in secret knowledge from distant times and places. Themes found in 2012 literature included [...] "suspicion towards mainstream Western culture", the idea of spiritual evolution, and the possibility of leading the world into the New Age by individual example or by a group's joined consciousness. The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but [...] "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism." [...] Aveni, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>studied</b> New Age and search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a [...] "disconnected" [...] society: [...] "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge." ...|$|E
