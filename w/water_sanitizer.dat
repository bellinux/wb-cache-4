40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to show the {{historical}} aspects of hands washing for healthy life and explains how can reduce the transmission of community-acquired infectious agents by healthcare workers and patients. This review article is prepared based on available database. The key words used were hands washing, risk assessment, hands hygiene, bacterial flora, contamination, infection, nosocomial, tap <b>water,</b> <b>sanitizer,</b> bacterial resistance, hands bacterial flora, washing methods, antiseptics, healthcare workers, healthcare personnel, from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Google Scholar. Data were descriptively analyzed. The insistence on hand washing {{has a history of}} 1400 years. The research results indicate that the bacteria released from the female washed hands in wet and dry condition was lower than from the male′s hands with a significance level (3 CFU vs. 8 CFU; confidence interval 95 %, P ≤ 0. 001). The valuable results of the study indicated that released amount of bacterial flora from wet hands is more than 10 times in compared to dry hands. In addition, established monitoring systems for washing hands before and after patient′s manipulation as well as after toilet were dominant indices to prevent the transfer of infectious agents to the patients. Increasing awareness and belief of the healthcare workers have shown an important role by about 30 % reduction in the transfection. Hand washing could reduce the episodes of transmission of infectious agents in both community and healthcare settings. However, hand washing is an important key factor to prevent transmission of infectious agents to patients. There is no standard method for measuring compliance. Thus, permanent monitoring of hand washing to reduce the transmission of infections is crucial. Finally, the personnel must believe that hand washing is an inevitable approach to infection control...|$|E
40|$|To prevent disease transmission, 0. 05 % {{chlorine}} {{solution is}} commonly recommended for handwashing in Ebola Treatment Units. In the 2014 West Africa outbreak this recommendation was widely extended to community settings, although many organizations recommend soap and hand sanitizer over chlorine. To evaluate skin irritation caused by frequent handwashing that may increase transmission risk in Ebola-affected communities, {{we conducted a}} randomized trial with 91 subjects who washed their hands 10 times a day for 28 days. Subjects used soap and <b>water,</b> <b>sanitizer,</b> or one of four chlorine solutions used by Ebola responders (calcium hypochlorite (HTH), sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC), and generated or pH-stabilized sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)). Outcomes were self-reported hand feel, irritation {{as measured by the}} Hand Eczema Score Index (HECSI) (range 0 - 360), signs of transmission risk (e. g., cracking), and dermatitis diagnosis. All groups experienced statistically significant increases in HECSI score. Subjects using sanitizer had the smallest increases, followed by higher pH chlorine solutions (HTH and stabilized NaOCl), and soap and water. The greatest increases were among neutral pH chlorine solutions (NaDCC and generated NaOCl). Signs of irritation related to higher transmission risk were observed most frequently in subjects using soap and least frequently by those using sanitizer or HTH. Despite these irritation increases, all methods represented minor changes in HECSI score. Average HECSI score was only 9. 10 at endline (range 1 - 33) and 4 % (4 / 91) of subjects were diagnosed with dermatitis, one each in four groups. Each handwashing method has benefits and drawbacks: soap is widely available and inexpensive, but requires water and does not inactivate the virus; sanitizer is easy-to use and effective but expensive and unacceptable to many communities, and chlorine is easy-to-use but difficult to produce properly and distribute. Overall, we recommend Ebola responders and communities use whichever handwashing method(s) are most acceptable, available, and sustainable for community handwashing.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of free-living protozoa in five meat-cutting plants was determined. Light microscopy after enrichment culturing was combined with sequencing of PCR-amplified, {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) -separated 18 S rRNA gene fragments, {{which was used}} as a fast screening method. The general results of the survey showed that a protozoan community of amoebae, ciliates, and flagellates was present in all of the plants. Protozoa were detected mainly in floor drains, in standing water on the floor, on soiled bars of cutting tables, on plastic pallets, and in out-of-use hot <b>water</b> knife <b>sanitizers,</b> but they were also detected on surfaces which come into direct contact with meat, such as conveyer belts, working surfaces of cutting tables, and needles of a meat tenderizer. After 7 days of incubation at refrigerator temperature, protozoa were detected in about one-half of the enrichment cultures. Based on microscopic observations, 61 morphospecies were found, and Bodo saltans, Bodo spp., Epistylis spp., Glaucoma scintillans, Petalomonas spp., Prodiscophrya collini, and Vannella sp. were the most frequently encountered identified organisms. Sequencing of DGGE bands resulted in identification of a total of 49 phylotypes, including representatives of the Amoebozoa, Chromalveolata, Excavata, Opisthokonta, and Rhizaria. Sequences of small heterotrophic flagellates were affiliated mainly with the Alveolata (Apicomplexa), Stramenopiles (Chrysophyceae), and Rhizaria (Cercozoa). This survey showed that there is high protozoan species richness in meat-cutting plants and that the species included species related to known hosts of food-borne pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was carried out to explore the {{potential}} source of contamination and the efficacy of different washing practices towards quality milk production. Materials and Methods: Probable sources of contamination viz. stored water, potable water, milker’s hands, milking pail, udder of individual buffalo and milk cans were subjected to different types of bacterial counts before the actual experiment to start. Twenty milch buffaloes thereafter were divided randomly into four treatment groups where washing was performed in each step viz. milker hands, udder of individual buffalo, milking pail and milk cans before milking either with water (T 0 : stored water, T 1 : potable <b>water)</b> or <b>sanitizers</b> (T 2 : 200 ppm chlorine solution, T 3 : 50 ppm iodophore solution) for 60 days. Bacterial counts again were performed for last 5 alternate days for all the sources involved along with the microbial load of raw milk. Data obtained were subjected to standard statistical analysis. Results: It was found that for all bacterial count stored water contributed significantly higher {{as compared to the}} potable water. Among the other potential sources of contamination (log/ 6 cm 2), standard plate count (SPC) and coliform count were significantly highest for milking pail (6. 73 ± 0. 02) and udder of milch buffaloes (3. 77 ± 0. 12), respectively, while for Staphylococci count both milking pail (3. 24 ± 0. 02) and milking can (3. 22 ± 0. 04) were contributed maximally (p 0. 05) for most of the parameters, even for the raw milk quality. Conclusion: Study revealed that milker hands, milking pails, udder of animals, milk cans and stored water used for washing of equipment are the potential source of contamination in raw milk. These were counted as critical point which needs attention for the production of high-quality milk. Potable water was found to be better than stored water. The use of either chlorine 200 ppm and iodophor 50 ppm is highly effective in reducing the bacterial population for quality milk production...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{utility of}} ozone in food processing {{lies in the}} fact that ozone is a 52 % stronger oxidant than chlorine. The widespread use of chlorine by the US food industry is under scrutiny and the acceptance of chlorine as the primary sanitizing agent for food process operations is being reconsidered by many processors and regulators. By US law, ozone is classified as a food additive thus its use in or on food is regulated. This classification disallows for ozone's use as a direct contact food sanitizing agent. However, quite recently the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been petitioned for the acceptance of ozone as a Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) substance. Prior to the regulatory acceptance of ozone as a direct contact food <b>sanitizer,</b> <b>water</b> containing an ozone residual can not be applied to food. This is not to imply that ozone has no other useful agricultural applications. Numerous agricultural applications exist aside from the use of ozone as a sanitizing agent for commodities or produce. The focus of this work is to determine the efficacy of ozone as a chlorine replacement in the sanitation of whole, fresh fruits and vegetables. A 200 gallon flume wash test system was constructed in the fruit and vegetables pilot plant of the Food Science and Nutrition Department, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Research studies, using ozone in pure water as a direct contact sanitizing agent have been conducted o...|$|R

KuKanichHand hygiene by {{healthcare}} {{workers is}} {{an effective means of}} preventing healthcare-acquired infections. However, hand hygiene compliance can be low among healthcare workers. This study used introduction of a gel sanitizer and informational poster as interventional tools in attempt to improve hand hygiene in two outpatient healthcare clinics. Healthcare workers at two outpatient clinics were observed for frequency of hand hygiene (attempts vs. opportunities). Gel sanitizer and informational posters were introduced together as an intervention. Direct observation of hand hygiene frequency was performed during baseline, intervention, and follow-up. A post-study survey of healthcare workers was collected. In both clinics, baseline hand hygiene was poor (11 % and 21 %) but significantly improved (p[less than or equal to] 0. 0001) after interventions (36 and 54 %), and was maintained (p> 0. 05) through the follow-up period (32 and 51 %). Throughout the study, post-contact hygiene was statistically observed more than pre-contact hygiene. In both clinics, healthcare workers self-reported a preference for soap and water, yet observations showed that sanitizer use predominated over soap and <b>water</b> use when <b>sanitizer</b> was available after the intervention. Fifty per cent of the surveyed healthcare workers considered the introduction of gel sanitizer to be an effective motivating tool for improving hand hygiene. Hand hygiene performance by healthcare workers in outpatient clinics may benefit from promoting gel sanitizer and using informational posters. Direct observation by trained observers may provide more accurate information of hand hygiene tool preference compared with survey results...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of murine norovirus 1 (MNV- 1) on onions and spinach by washing was investigated {{as was the}} risk of contamination during the washing procedure. To decontaminate wash <b>water,</b> the industrial <b>sanitizer</b> peracetic acid (PAA) {{was added to the}} water, and the survival of MNV- 1 was determined. In contrast to onions, spinach undergoes a heat treatment before freezing. Therefore, the resistance of MNV- 1 to blanching of spinach was examined. MNV- 1 genomic copies were detected with a real-time reverse transcription PCR assay in PAA-treated water and blanched spinach, and PFUs (representing infectious MNV- 1 units) were determined with a plaque assay. A <= 1 -log reduction in MNV- 1 PFUs was achieved by washing onion bulbs and spinach leaves. More than 3 log PFU of MNV- 1 was transmitted to onion bulbs and spinach leaves when these vegetables were washed in water containing approximately 5 log PFU/ml. No decline of MNV- 1 occurred in used industrial spinach wash water after 6 days at room temperature. A concentration of 20 ppm of PAA in demineralized water (pH 4. 13) and in potable water (pH 7. 70) resulted in reductions of 2. 88 +/- 0. 25 and 2. 41 +/- 0. 18 log PFU, respectively, after 5 min of exposure, but no decrease in number of genomic copies was observed. No {{reduction of}} MNV- 1 PFUs was observed on frozen onions or spinach during storage for 6 months. Blanching spinach (80 degrees C for 1 min) resulted in at least 2. 44 -log reductions of infectious MNV- 1, but many genomic copies were still present...|$|R
40|$|To prevent Ebola transmission, {{frequent}} handwashing {{is recommended}} in Ebola Treatment Units and communities. However, {{little is known}} about which handwashing protocol is most efficacious. We evaluated six handwashing protocols (soap and <b>water,</b> alcohol-based hand <b>sanitizer</b> (ABHS), and 0. 05 % sodium dichloroisocyanurate, high-test hypochlorite, and stabilized and non-stabilized sodium hypochlorite solutions) for 1) efficacy of handwashing on the removal and inactivation of non-pathogenic model organisms and, 2) persistence of organisms in rinse water. Model organisms E. coli and bacteriophage Phi 6 were used to evaluate handwashing with and without organic load added to simulate bodily fluids. Hands were inoculated with test organisms, washed, and rinsed using a glove juice method to retrieve remaining organisms. Impact was estimated by comparing the log reduction in organisms after handwashing to the log reduction without handwashing. Rinse water was collected to test for persistence of organisms. Handwashing resulted in a 1. 94 - 3. 01 log reduction in E. coli concentration without, and 2. 18 - 3. 34 with, soil load; and a 2. 44 - 3. 06 log reduction in Phi 6 without, and 2. 71 - 3. 69 with, soil load. HTH performed most consistently well, with significantly greater log reductions than other handwashing protocols in three models. However, the magnitude of handwashing efficacy differences was small, suggesting protocols are similarly efficacious. Rinse water demonstrated a 0. 28 - 4. 77 log reduction in remaining E. coli without, and 0. 21 - 4. 49 with, soil load and a 1. 26 - 2. 02 log reduction in Phi 6 without, and 1. 30 - 2. 20 with, soil load. Chlorine resulted in significantly less persistence of E. coli in both conditions and Phi 6 without soil load in rinse water (p< 0. 001). Thus, chlorine-based methods may offer a benefit of reducing persistence in rinse water. We recommend responders use the most practical handwashing method to ensure hand hygiene in Ebola contexts, considering the potential benefit of chlorine-based methods in rinse water persistence...|$|R
