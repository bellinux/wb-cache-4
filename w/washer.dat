5|$|Euphemisms for a heavy {{or violent}} rain include gully <b>washer,</b> trash-mover and toad-strangler.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{exhibits}} {{include two}} small de Laval steam turbines by Greenwood & Batley, {{and a small}} 'Wessex' steam turbine milk bottle <b>washer.</b> A winch used to move railway wagons at Hemyock Dairy near Wellington was built by J. Lynn of Sunderland. There is a runnable Crossley diesel engine dating from 1935. There is a Spirax Sarco 'Ogden pump' used to pump condensate from steam lines. The collection includes the boiler which powered the Telescopic Bridge, Bridgwater.|$|E
5|$|Iron Rattler {{is located}} in the Western-themed Crackaxle Canyon area of Fiesta Texas, sitting next to the Road Runner Express and The Gully <b>Washer.</b> It is Rocky Mountain Construction's second {{installation}} of I-Box track, and the first to feature a barrel roll inversion. Iron Rattler operates with two Rattler-themed trains manufactured by Gerstlauer. Each train is made up of six cars which seat riders in two rows of two. Riders are restrained {{through the use of a}} lap bar and a seat belt.|$|E
5000|$|Locking <b>washers,</b> {{which prevent}} {{fastening}} or loosening by preventing unscrewing {{rotation of the}} fastening device; locking <b>washers</b> are usually also spring <b>washers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{described}} above, {{the rubber}} <b>washers</b> sit {{directly on the}} axle box spring sitting area. Earlier,wooden <b>washers</b> were used. However, {{with the development of}} technology, rubber <b>washers</b> replaced wooden <b>washers.</b> Presently, RDSO, Lucknow which is a Research, Design & Standardization organization for the Indian Railways developed a new design for <b>washers</b> made from a polymer commonly known as HYTREL. Hytrel polymer is a product of M/s DuPont [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} {{replacement}} of the rubber <b>washers</b> with the hytrel <b>washers</b> was that the rubber <b>washers</b> were not lasting for the full Periodic overhaul cycle of the Railway Coaches which was one year. The <b>washers</b> also had to be replaced in the coaching maintenance depots leading to lifting and lowering of coaches.|$|R
5|$|Five {{years after}} his conversion, Lecrae teamed up with Ben <b>Washer</b> to found Reach Records, and {{at the age of}} 25 he {{released}} his first album, Real Talk. The following year it was re-released by Cross Movement Records and reached No. 29 on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart, staying on the chart for 12 weeks. The album later received a nomination at the 2007 Stellar Awards. In 2005, Lecrae co-founded the non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries (no longer operational since April 2015), which equipped local Christian leaders with tools, media, curriculum, and conferences that were based on the teachings of the Bible and relevant to hip-hop culture. Also in 2005, the debut album of 116 Clique, The Compilation Album, was released.|$|E
5|$|Born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Antonio {{initially}} {{worked as}} a car <b>washer</b> at a local police station with his brother Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, former leader of the cartel. By the late 1980s, he entered the drug trade, and later became the crime boss of Matamoros, where he controlled the city's drug trafficking shipments and all organized crime activities. Few details were known of Antonio's criminal career prior to 1999, when his brother Osiel confronted federal agents at gunpoint with several of his gunmen in Matamoros. In 1998, Antonio avoided arrest after FBI and DEA agents tracked his whereabouts inside a domicile in Houston. Back in Mexico, his brother Osiel was the Gulf Cartel's main leader and had created a paramilitary squad known as Los Zetas, formed by soldiers who left the Mexican military.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen <b>washer,</b> while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
50|$|Introduction of Hytrel <b>washers</b> was {{considered}} a breakthrough in the ICF dashpot design. However, the mass scale replacement of the rubber <b>washers</b> by Hytrel <b>washers</b> without adequate trials lead to massive failure of the axle Box housing.|$|R

50|$|On October 15, Arizona held it′s {{third annual}} <b>Washers</b> tournament in Phoenix at Ahwatukee Park. The 2016 Arizona <b>Washers</b> Wide Open Tournament was again {{sponsored}} by Westernstar <b>Washers</b> and Vintage T′s. The 2016 champions are Shawn Anderson and Joel Carlberg.|$|R
25|$|A {{common use}} of sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is in the}} production of parts <b>washer</b> detergents. Parts <b>washer</b> detergents based on sodium hydroxide {{are some of the most}} aggressive parts <b>washer</b> cleaning chemicals. The sodium hydroxide-based detergents include surfactants, rust inhibitors and defoamers. A parts <b>washer</b> heats water and the detergent in a closed cabinet and then sprays the heated sodium hydroxide and hot water at pressure against dirty parts for degreasing applications. Sodium hydroxide used in this manner replaced many solvent-based systems in the early 1990s when trichloroethane was outlawed by the Montreal Protocol. Water and sodium hydroxide detergent-based parts washers are considered to be an environmental improvement over the solvent-based cleaning methods.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 a {{study by}} the UK Health Protection Agency {{reported}} that 20% of cases may be caused by infected windscreen <b>washer</b> systems filled with pure water. The finding came after researchers spotted that professional drivers are five times more likely to contract the disease. No cases of infected systems were found whenever a suitable <b>washer</b> fluid was used.|$|E
25|$|Methanol {{is used as}} {{a solvent}} and as an {{antifreeze}} in pipelines and windshield <b>washer</b> fluid.|$|E
30|$|Conventional vertical-axis clothes <b>washers</b> are top-loading <b>washers</b> with a {{vertically}} mounted tub {{that contains}} an agitator {{at the center}} of the drum. During the washing cycle, the tub will be filled with water, and the agitator will rotate or pulse, turning the clothes around in the water to clean them. Conventional <b>washers</b> use a large amount of water per load, allowing the clothes to easily float and move in the detergent solution. Because energy is required to heat the water, conventional <b>washers</b> use a vast amount of energy as well as water (Bansal et al. 2011). However, conventional <b>washers</b> are sold for a lower price and complete a washing cycle faster than HE <b>washers</b> (Consumer Reports 2012).|$|R
5000|$|Perforated thrust <b>washers</b> - Initially {{brought to}} market by the Umnumzaan folding knife in 2008, Reeve's design of {{perforated}} <b>washers</b> reduce pivot friction, and serve to retain lubricant. [...] After their successful {{employment in the}} Umnumzaan, perforated thrust <b>washers</b> were incorporated into {{the design of the}} Sebenza.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} hand-held inside bird <b>washers</b> on the microbiological and hygienic quality of turkey carcasses. These <b>washers,</b> one per eviscerating line, are simple water wands that discharge water into the body cavity of each turkey as it moves on the eviscerating line. Total viable plate counts were made from calcium alginate swabs taken in a 10 cm 2 area adjacent to the left kidney. A sterile template was used to standardize the area to be swabbed. Two hundred turkeys were sampled after <b>washers</b> were used, and 200 were sampled after <b>washers</b> were not used. Bacterial counts from the two groups were not significantly different (P>. 05). Daily head counts of processed turkeys were recorded, and daily turbidity values of prechiller water were determined for 20 consecutive days of processing after hand-held <b>washers</b> were used and for 20 consecutive days of processing after hand-held <b>washers</b> were not used. No statistical difference was found between the groups for days when the <b>washers</b> were used or not used (P>. 05). It was concluded that hand-held inside bird <b>washers</b> had no effect on microbiological or hygienic turkey carcass quality as determined by total bacterial counts made from the body cavity or turbidity value of the prechiller water...|$|R
25|$|On 9 September 1967 {{there was}} a {{spontaneous}} underground explosion at the Michael; nine workers died and production was halted instantly, and permanently. Only the Lochhead pit remained active, together with the coal <b>washer,</b> and the railway requirements were minimal. Lochhead closed on 27 March 1970, and the only residual traffic was from external collieries to the <b>washer.</b> This could not continue and {{the last day of}} WPR operation was on 26 June 1970.|$|E

25|$|The sealing {{materials}} of aluminum electrolytic capacitors {{depend on the}} different styles. For larger screw-terminal and snap-in capacitors the sealing <b>washer</b> is made of a plastic material. Axial electrolytic capacitors usually have a sealing <b>washer</b> made of phenolic resin laminated {{with a layer of}} rubber. Radial electrolytic capacitors use a rubber plug with a very dense structure. All sealing materials must be inert to the chemical parts of the electrolyte and may not contain soluble compounds that could lead to contamination of the electrolyte. To avoid leakage, the electrolyte must not be aggressive to the sealing material.|$|E
5000|$|The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) {{provides}} {{standards for}} general use flat <b>washers.</b> Type A {{is a series}} of steel <b>washers</b> at broad tolerances, where precision is not critical.

40|$|World {{trade of}} clothes <b>washers</b> and driers {{is a new}} {{research}} {{that is part of}} a series of six reports on world trade of major household appliances (white goods). This survey provides an overview of the world trade of clothes <b>washers</b> and driers, with data and forecast at world-wide level and data on the evolution of appliances trade in 60 countries (selected according to their contribution to international trade of clothes <b>washers</b> and driers). The growth of clothes <b>washers</b> and driers imports and the role of clothes <b>washers</b> and driers exporting countries in the world marketplace are considered. The world imports and exports of clothes <b>washers</b> and driers are broken down by geographical area (European Union, Eastern Europe and Russia, Asia and Pacific, Middle East and Africa, North America, South America) and by developed / emerging countries. The analysis of the opening of clothes <b>washers</b> and driers markets covers six years, 1999 - 2004. Trade data are also available in a country format: historical series on clothes <b>washers</b> and driers exports and imports, origin of imports and destination of exports, consumption growth forecast for household appliances 2005 - 2006, country rankings to place all statistics in a broad worldwide context. The report provides a picture of opportunities for clothes <b>washers</b> and driers exporters arising from the increasing openness of markets and a rich collection of key country-data, allowing comparisons among specific interest areas. ...|$|R

25|$|Lens {{cleaning}} systems come in {{two main}} varieties: a small motor-driven rubber wiper or brush conceptually similar to windshield wipers, or a fixed or telescopic high-pressure sprayer which cleans the lenses with a spray of windshield <b>washer</b> fluid. Most recent lens cleaning systems are of the spray type, because UN regulations do not permit mechanical cleaning systems (wipers) {{to be used with}} plastic-lens headlamps, and most recent headlamps have plastic lenses. Some cars with retractable headlamps, such as the original Mazda MX-5, have a squeegee {{at the front of the}} lamp recess which automatically wipes the lenses as they are raised or lowered, although it does not provide <b>washer</b> fluid.|$|E
25|$|The low {{belt line}} and window design afforded the driver with {{outstanding}} visibility. The Pacer had {{laminated safety glass}} in the windshield. The articulated front wipers were hidden when in their parked position, and a rear wiper and <b>washer</b> was optional.|$|E
