40|$|We {{study the}} e¤ects of local status, where workers compare their wage to the wage of other workers {{within the same}} …rm. We assume a {{competitive}} labor mar-ket with unobservable e¤ort, where …rms condition wages on output as incentive for e¤ort. If workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about status are also more productive, such status concerns generate an equilibrium with heterogenous …rms where workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> and workers <b>who</b> do not <b>care</b> about status work together. Such …rms provide work-ers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about status with stronger incentives to exert e¤ort, compared with workers <b>who</b> do not <b>care.</b> The main result is that status concerns increase within …rm wage di¤erences and over all wage inequality. However, the heterogeneity in preferences raises aggregate output suggesting that society can bene…t from cultural diversity as there are ”gains from trade ” as workers may trade their di¤erent social concerns.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of local status, where workers compare their wage to the wage of other workers within the same firm. We assume a {{competitive}} labor market with unobservable effort, where firms condition wages on output as incentive for effort. If workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about status are also more productive, such status concerns generate an equilibrium with heterogenous firms where workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> and workers <b>who</b> do not <b>care</b> about status work together. Such firms provide workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about status with stronger incentives to exert effort, compared with workers <b>who</b> do not <b>care.</b> In addition, there will be homogenous firm who employ workers of the same type. The main result is that wage differences within heterogenous firms exceed the wage differences across homogenous firms. The difference from previous studies (e. g., Frank 1984) is that effort is elastically supplied and the payment for status is influenced by the relative supply of workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> and do not care about status. The positive correlation between status concerns and productivity is derived as part of the equilibrium, because workers <b>who</b> <b>care</b> about status signal their stronger motivation through investment in schooling. These results are maintained if one adds risk aversion and global status concerns, where workers also care about the average wage in society. Tel-Aviv Universit...|$|R
5|$|The story {{describes}} the romantic relationship between Annis Wychwood, a wealthy spinster, and Oliver Carleton, a rake <b>who</b> <b>cares</b> little for society's opinion of him. The two meet while jointly supervising Carleton's ward, Lucilla. Heyer granted her heroine {{a level of}} independence that was rare in Regency times and rare for Heyer's novels. Although the hero's personality {{is similar to that}} of many of Heyer's other heroes, in a departure from romance novel convention he experienced little personal growth in the novel; his primary change was to accept that he would like to have a wife.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, <b>who</b> <b>cares</b> less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E
5|$|The band joined Blink-182 for a European trek {{in early}} 2004, at the {{recommendation}} of Blink-182's bassist Mark Hoppus. Cain invited Hoppus to produce the band's sophomore album, and he accepted. In late 2004, the band continued touring internationally with Blink-182, this time in Japan. The group accumulated significant buzz, and were regarded as a must-see act on the Warped Tour 2004. The band recorded their second album, Commit This to Memory at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a suburban home converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and partially in Los Angeles, during {{a period in which}} Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. Commit This to Memory was the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. For this album, the band also had more time and funds create the album. During the recording of the album, the band embarked on their first headlining tour, The Sub-Par Punk <b>Who</b> <b>Cares</b> Tour 2004. By the end of 2004, the band played in over 270 shows that year.|$|E

25|$|In regards, to education, caring {{refers to}} the {{relationship}} between student and teacher, not just the person <b>who</b> <b>cares.</b> As educators respond to the needs of students, teachers may see the need to design a differentiated curriculum because as teachers work closely with students, we will be moved by their different needs and interests. The claim to care must not be based on a one time virtuous decision but an ongoing interest in the student’s welfare.|$|E

Kondō was adopted into another family at the age of 16. Kondō met Okita when Okita was sent to live in his household at the age of 9, when his family could no longer care for him. Kondō recognized and understood the young boy's discomfort and insecurity at living with a new family and welcomed him warmly. He served as Okita's mentor, older brother and at times took the role of father as Okita grew up. Okita is grateful to him and is extremely loyal to the point of vowing that he would commit seppuku should Kondō die.
