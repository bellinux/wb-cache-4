5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
5|$|An English folk tale {{tells how}} an old woman, a {{supposed}} witch, cursed her landlord {{and all his}} possessions when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad fell on his wife and caused her to collapse. The toad was thrown into the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch had died, and it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.|$|E

5|$|As the BBC {{broadcasting}} {{unit was}} about to order another batch of the monitor, it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> supplier had modified the drive units, meaning the LS3/5 design had to be fundamentally revised. The BBC's Designs Department was called upon to adapt the product {{in light of the}} supply changes. Modifications were made to adapt to the new drive units and deal with the altered resonance pattern, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A.|$|E
5|$|Damage Sustained by the System. Contrary to {{what was}} done in other places, {{electricity}} was not shut down in Grand Cayman before arrival of the hurricane. Total system failure came at around 01:40 hours on 12 September. Slight damage was sustained by the North Sound Road power plant, and more extensive damage occurred in transmission lines and several substations {{as well as in}} distribution grids. Furthermore, it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> submarine cable in the North Sound was damaged 1,500 feet offshore.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, {{using its}} Medium Resolution Instrument, {{through a variety}} of filters. The comet was 1.75–2.11 astronomical units (AU) (2.62–3.16×108 km) from the Sun and 1.87–1.30 AU from the spacecraft. It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> outgassing from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to the rotation of its nucleus. The dry ice content of the comet was measured and found to be about ten percent of its water ice content by number of molecules.|$|E
50|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> yellow-necked mouse can {{transmit}} the virus causing tick-borne encephalitis while being {{immune to the}} virus itself. It has also <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> yellow-necked mouse together with the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) are the natural reservoir for a hantavirus, the Dobrava virus, which causes a severe form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans.|$|R

5|$|Haunting Ground {{has been}} a subject of game studies {{regarding}} the relationship between players and their avatars. It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> altering states of Fiona's subjectivity change {{the role of the}} player in the game. The player is never a spectator, nor do they take on the embodiment of Fiona, but float between these states of involvement.|$|E
5|$|Impermeable plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma which acts like an {{impermeable}} solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls. However, later it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, {{as part of}} {{the review}} of the defences of Singapore against threats from European powers in the region, it was decided that forts be built {{on either side of the}} {{entrance}} to New Harbour. Fort Pasir Panjang was built on Labrador and Fort Siloso on Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa). It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> steep cliffs and thick mangrove swamps surrounding the two forts acted as an ideal natural barrier to intruders.|$|E

During 1993 it was moved temporarily to the East Lancashire Railway near Manchester and whilst there an exercise was undertaken to establish what repairs were necessary {{and how much}} they would cost.

5|$|In March 2007, it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{variation}} of radio emissions {{from the planet}} did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance {{may be caused by}} geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> A-43 turret {{was very}} tight for two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; {{there was no}} turret ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; {{and it was hard}} to rotate the turret manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. The turret was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.|$|E

5|$|The {{physiological}} {{function of the}} prion protein remains a controversial matter. While data from in vitro experiments suggest many dissimilar roles, studies on PrP knockout mice have provided only limited information because these animals exhibit only minor abnormalities. In research done in mice, it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cleavage of PrP proteins in peripheral nerves causes the activation of myelin repair in Schwann cells and {{that the lack of}} PrP proteins caused demyelination in those cells.|$|E
5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were growing so fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> level of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E

5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
