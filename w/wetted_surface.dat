For painting of <b>wet</b> <b>surfaces,</b> moisture curable coating systems based on epoxy resin and ketimine {{are found to}} be useful.

25|$|The lack of ballast {{makes it}} much easier to get a multihull on plane, {{reducing}} its <b>wetted</b> <b>surface</b> area and thus its drag.The absence of drag improves wind precision, giving it its great handling.|$|E
25|$|Airships {{and some}} bodies of {{revolution}} use the volumetric drag coefficient, {{in which the}} reference area is {{the square of the}} cube root of the airship volume (volume to the two-thirds power). Submerged streamlined bodies use the <b>wetted</b> <b>surface</b> area.|$|E

25|$|The {{laminar flow}} of polymer {{solutions}} is exploited by {{animals such as}} fish and dolphins, who exude viscous solutions from their skin to aid flow over their bodies while swimming. It {{has been used in}} yacht racing by owners who want to gain a speed advantage by pumping a polymer solution such as low molecular weight polyoxyethylene in water, over the <b>wetted</b> <b>surface</b> of the hull.|$|E
25|$|Forced to race, {{and lacking}} time for preparation, Conner and SDYC {{looked for a}} way to prevail. They {{recognized}} that a catamaran was not expressly prohibited under the rules. Multihulls, due to a lower <b>wetted</b> <b>surface</b> area and vastly lower mass, are inherently faster than equal-length monohulls. Conner, however, left nothing to chance and commissioned a cutting edge design with a wing sail, named—as his 12-metre yachts had been—Stars and Stripes.|$|E
25|$|The planing {{hull form}} is {{configured}} to develop positive dynamic pressure {{so that its}} draft decreases with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the <b>wetted</b> <b>surface</b> and therefore also the drag. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is {{to have at least}} one chine, which makes for more efficient planing and can throw spray down. Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective planing hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping. Sail boats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.|$|E
30|$|SPR {{works by}} {{physical}} adhesion to fatty residues forming a gray deposit. SPR is available commercially in a pre-mixed liquid form. Jasuja et al., Rohatgi et al. concluded that SPR {{is one of}} the most suitable methods of latent print development on non-porous <b>surfaces</b> especially on <b>wet</b> <b>surfaces</b> (Jasuja et al. 2015; Rohatgi and Kapoor 2016); although SPR seems to perform equally well on dry and <b>wet</b> <b>surfaces</b> (Cuce et al. 2004).|$|R

30|$|Evaporation of a {{normally}} <b>wet</b> <b>surface</b> by extremely dry {{gas flowing}} onto a <b>wet</b> <b>surface</b> changes the ambient environmental conditions, accelerates evaporation, leads to loss of water content, dries, and eventually desiccates peritoneal cells. This clinical experiment of laparoscopy using cold dry gas has been practiced too long. It {{is time to}} re-establish and re-duplicate the peritoneal condition as closely as possible. Preventing peritoneal dehydration, maintaining peritoneal integrity, and reducing cellular damage has already been demonstrated.|$|R
500|$|This packing {{material}} {{can either be}} random dumped packing such as Raschig rings or structured sheet metal. [...] Liquids tend to wet {{the surface of the}} packing and the vapors pass across this <b>wetted</b> <b>surface,</b> where mass transfer takes place. [...] Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor–liquid equilibrium, the vapor–liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when modeling packed columns it is useful to compute a number of theoretical plates to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect to more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing performance.|$|E
2500|$|When sailing in {{a strong}} wind, {{the crew of the}} proa act as ballast, {{providing}} a force to counteract the torque of the wind acting on the sail. [...] The weight of the crew can provide considerable torque as they move out along the akas towards the ama. [...] A skilled crew can balance the proa so that the ama leaves the water and skims over its surface; this is called [...] "flying the ama", and gives the proa its nickname, the [...] "flying proa". [...] Flying the ama (the <b>wetted</b> <b>surface)</b> significantly reduces the drag of the proa. The proa gets its great potential for speed by combining the long, narrow shape of the vaka with the large amount of torque that the crew can apply on the amas.|$|E
2500|$|Comanche—100-foot monohull, {{launched}} October, 2014—was {{designed by}} VPLP and Guillaume Verdier and was completed within 13 months. With an overall length of 100ft, it vied {{to be the}} world’s fastest monohull with a 24-hour distance record of 620nm during a 2015 race across the Atlantic, subject to ratification by the World Sailing Speed Record Council. In December, 2014 it placed second in the annual Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. In 2015, it was first in the same race, covering 628 nautical miles in just under two days and nine hours. With a 25.5-foot beam it achieves speed similar to performance multihull sailing craft by being sailed heeled one on one edge to minimize <b>wetted</b> <b>surface.</b> In April, 2015 Comanche broke the course record at the Les Voiles de Saint Barth yacht race. At {{the time of its}} building, Comanches hull represented [...] "one of the largest single-hull infusions" [...] performed in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|Viscous drag - This type of drag is {{also known}} as [...] "skin friction" [...] as it is thought to derive entirely from the {{frictional}} resistance of water molecules imposing a force as they slide past the <b>wetted</b> <b>surface</b> of the hull and its appendages.

3000|$|... in Table  1. The {{difference}} between the fractal dimensions suggests that the pore length of the slit-like pores is smaller {{than that of the}} pores whose aspect ratios are close to unity for a given characteristic size. This can have major implications for predicting heat transfer through heat convection at pore-scale in The Geysers. The heat convection is dependent on the <b>wetting</b> <b>surface</b> and residing time. The <b>wetting</b> <b>surface</b> is dependent on the pore length, while the residing time is dependent on the characteristic size of the conduit controlling the flow conductance.|$|R

M. multifasciata were active {{as long as}} the light condition permitted, they were active also even on cloudly and fine <b>wet</b> <b>surface</b> ground when T. sexlineatus were not active.

40|$|Life {{stages of}} {{different}} tick species avoid {{walking on a}} <b>wet</b> <b>surface</b> surrounding a dry patch by systematically returning to the dry each time they contact the <b>wet</b> <b>surface</b> beyond the border {{with the tip of}} a first leg tarsus. Sequential analysis of the border behaviors shows that repetitive contact with the water increases the probability of walks astride the border. Ticks accept this unilateral contact with the water for longer intervals and eventually walk on to the <b>wet</b> <b>surface</b> after a combination of a short patch walk followed by a border walk which is longer than the foregoing ones. Staying time on a small circular patch is shorter than on a large one, arising probably from faster adaptation of peripheral receptors following a higher frequency of border contacts. However, an equal number of border reactions on patches of different sizes and shapes suggests that a counter in the CNS may also influence dry patch departure...|$|R
