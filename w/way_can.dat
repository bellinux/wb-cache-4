5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes. In enzyme kinetics, the reaction rate is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's kinetics in this <b>way</b> <b>can</b> reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its activity is controlled, and how a drug or an agonist might inhibit the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{replacement}} – if {{a related}} structure is known, {{it can be}} used as a search model in molecular replacement to determine the orientation and position of the molecules within the unit cell. The phases obtained this <b>way</b> <b>can</b> be used to generate electron density maps.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding that in NASA's {{judgment}} {{the contractor}} later made {{significant progress in}} overcoming the problems, the committee believes {{it should have been}} informed of the situation. The committee does not object to the position of the Administrator of NASA, that all details of Government/contractor relationships should not be put in the public domain. However, that position in no <b>way</b> <b>can</b> be used as an argument for not bringing this or other serious situations {{to the attention of the}} committee.|$|E
40|$|Four isomorphisms linking {{architectural}} {{problems to}} combinatorial mathematics answer four questions: How many <b>ways</b> <b>can</b> a given population be partitioned into a given schedule of groups? What {{is the most}} probable way that a given population will divide into a given number of groups? How many <b>ways</b> <b>can</b> a set of activities be allocated {{to a set of}} spaces?

25|$|Turret 29B (Limestone Bank) {{remains as}} a low earthwork, turf covered with little (if any) visible masonry. The track {{connecting}} the turret to the Military <b>Way</b> <b>can</b> also be discerned. When excavated, roofing slabs (many pierced by nails) were found.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the route has been criticised for various reasons. Some criticism relates to the route, since {{it is not possible}} to bundle different ICE routes over the line. Therefore, as with the existing Franconian Forest Railway, only one long-distance train service per hour and each <b>way</b> <b>can</b> be expected.|$|E

25|$|In this mode, the router {{can perform}} tasks {{similar to a}} spindle moulder. For smaller, lighter jobs, the router used in this <b>way</b> <b>can</b> be more {{convenient}} than the spindle moulder, {{with the task of}} set up being somewhat faster. There is also a much wider range of bit profiles available for the router, although the size is limited.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} studying zonohedra {{is that the}} Voronoi diagram of any lattice forms a convex uniform honeycomb in which the cells are zonohedra. Any zonohedron formed in this <b>way</b> <b>can</b> tessellate 3-dimensional space and is called a primary parallelohedron. Each primary parallelohedron is combinatorially equivalent to one of five types: the rhombohedron (including the cube), hexagonal prism, truncated octahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, and the rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron.|$|E

25|$|The fell is most {{commonly}} climbed via the south east ridge, beginning at Gill Foot where the lane from Grasmere crosses Green Burn. From Steel End {{at the head}} of Thirlmere a <b>way</b> <b>can</b> be found onto the north ridge, or a longer route taken up the Wythburn valley to surmount the ridge to Calf Crag. Direct ascents up the eastern face from the summit of Dunmail Raise are also possible.|$|E
25|$|Grasmere {{village is}} the most {{convenient}} starting point with approaches possible along either Far Easedale or Green Burn. The latter makes a direct assault up a grassy strip between Pike of Carrs and Rough Crag, while the Far Easedale route gains the ridge 'behind' the summit. Beginning {{from the head of}} Thirlmere a <b>way</b> <b>can</b> also be made up Wythburndale, although this will involve a certain amount of bog-hopping.|$|E
25|$|Hemp, {{because of}} its height, dense foliage and its high {{planting}} density as a crop, is a very effective and long used method of killing tough weeds in farming by minimizing the pool of weed seeds of the soil. Using hemp this <b>way</b> <b>can</b> help farmers avoid the use of herbicides, to help gain organic certification and to gain the benefits of crop rotation. Due to its rapid, dense growth characteristics, in some jurisdictions hemp is considered a prohibited noxious weed, much like Scotch Broom.|$|E

25|$|One {{application}} of smart home {{is to provide}} assistance for disabled and elderly individuals. These home systems utilize assistive technology to accommodate an owner's specific disabilities. Voice control can assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems can be connected directly to Cochlear implants worn by hearing impaired users. They can also be equipped with additional safety features. These features can include sensors that monitor for medical emergencies such as falls or seizures. Smart home technology applied in this <b>way</b> <b>can</b> provide users with more freedom and a higher quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Family's world, Eden, is so {{far from}} its sun that it is icebound. Only a small area, which the Family calls Circle Valley, is temperate. Eden's animals each have two hearts, green-black blood, huge and lidless eyes, six legs, and tentacled feelers around their mouths. The animal population, however, is not diverse. Trees tap into the heat just below Eden's surface, {{bringing}} up warmth and providing fruit and other food. Nearly all plant and animal life on Eden is bioluminescent, allowing the humans to see, while overhead the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>can</b> be easily seen at all times.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Mime {{are gifted}} {{with the art}} of miming at a young age, but as they mature, they gain {{the ability to make}} {{invisible}} objects by emitting energy from their fingers and minutely vibrating their fingertips to harden the air around them and form a wall. Barriers generated this <b>way</b> <b>can</b> repel harsh attacks, and its gestures and motions can convince watchers that something unseeable actually exists; once this is achieved, the perceived item will materialize. Mr. Mime are very prideful of their pantomime acts, and will heavily slap anyone that interrupts them while miming. Mr. Mime has a pre-evolution, Mime Jr., which evolves when mimicking other Pokémon.|$|E

25|$|Everything {{that has}} {{happened}} since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this <b>way</b> <b>can</b> they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed Jonah: {{it was only in}} the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as evils, but without them we could never come to know God.|$|E
25|$|Yuuyaraq {{defined the}} correct way of {{thinking}} and speaking about all living things, especially the great sea and land mammals on which the Yup'ik relied for food, clothing, shelter, tools, kayaks, and other essentials. These great creatures were sensitive; they were believed able to understand human conversations, and they demanded and received respect. Yuuyaraq prescribed the correct method of hunting and fishing, and {{the correct way}} of handling all fish and game caught by the hunter in order to honor and appease the spirits and maintain a harmonious relationship with the fish and game. Although unwritten, this <b>way</b> <b>can</b> be compared to Mosaic law because it governed all aspects of a human being's life.|$|E
25|$|From Overbeck Bridge on the Wastwater road a <b>way</b> <b>can</b> {{be found}} up to Low Tarn, gaining the summit via the long western slopes. Alternatively Over Beck can be {{followed}} to its source at Dore Head, before {{making up the}} south ridge. Dore Head can also be reached from Mosedale if starting from Wasdale Head, although a long climb up scree is involved. It is possible instead to ascend Black Comb on easier slopes {{and then return to}} the summit. Red Pike is often the start of the Mosedale Horseshoe, a ridgewalk also visiting Scoat Fell and Pillar. Depending upon the strength of the walker Yewbarrow and Kirk Fell may also be added.|$|E
