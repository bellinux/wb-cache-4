5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
25|$|For these {{preliminary}} experiments, {{as you may}} recollect, a sum not {{to exceed}} $200 or $250 was to be appropriated, and in accordance with this Mr. Lowe has presented me with the in closed statement of items, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> are reasonable, since nothing is charged for labor and time of the aeronautic.|$|E
25|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that the system is}} {{applicable}} with certainty and efficiency to the Cornwall Railway. That a sufficient power may be obtained so as to work the trains, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> your traffic will require, at an average speed of 30 miles an hour for passenger trains, and from 15 to 20 miles an hour for goods, including stoppages in both cases, and that special trains may be despatched at greater speed if necessary.|$|E
60|$|I have news of Mrs. Tenbruggen <b>which</b> will, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> {{surprise}} you.|$|R

6000|$|... "There is one way, Gregory, in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> {{it ought}} to be done," [...] she said. [...] "You assumed Mr. Wyllard's {{obligations}} when you took the farm, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you should keep the two Morans." ...|$|R
25|$|Pennsylvania {{has passed}} a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his {{religious}} faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> no State can constitutionally demand. For me {{this is not something}} that can be swept under the rug and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.|$|E
500|$|... episodes a year. Shonda Rhimes {{has a lot}} of ideas, and she is in a {{position}} where she can take more chances. Sometimes that works, sometimes it does not. Last year we had the singing episode, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> was a big mistake. But you have to try." ...|$|E
500|$|William Godwin's {{theories}} of biographical writing significantly influenced Shelley's style. Her father believed that biography {{could tell the}} history of a culture as well as serve a pedagogical function. Shelley felt that her nonfiction works were better than her fiction, writing in 1843 to publisher Edward Moxon: [...] "I should prefer quieter work, to be gathered from other works—such as my lives for the Cyclopedia—& <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I do much better than romancing." ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{naturally}} {{averse to}} egotism, and hate selflaudation consumedly; but I can't help relating here a circumstance illustrative {{of the point}} in question, in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> must <b>think</b> <b>I</b> acted with considerable prudence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, my dear," [...] Mrs. Dodgson said, [...] "I {{have some}} news {{to give you}} <b>which</b> will, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> please you. Of course you have been {{thinking}} what to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{recollect}} perfectly. Still, as it happens, I {{had just}} finished breakfast, <b>which</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> in some respects fortunate. One is rather apt to proceed summarily before it--in the rainy season." ...|$|R
500|$|I use micro-beats, {{a lot of}} whispery vocals, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> sound amazing when they're {{downloaded}} {{because of}} the secrecy of the medium. The only acoustic instruments I would use would be those that sound good after they've been downloaded, so the harp, the music box, celeste and clavichord. They're plucky sounds. [...] And the strings [...] ended up being more panoramic textures in the background. It's all about being in a little house, on your own. [...] The strings would be like white mountains outside.|$|E
500|$|A mutant {{and former}} member of the X-Men, whom Logan killed at the end of X-Men: The Last Stand. Jackman said, [...] "There’s no doubt that the most {{important}} relationship in his life is — we’ve seen through the movies — is his relationship with Jean Grey. Yes, we saw her die at the end of ‘X-Men: The Last Stand,’ but in this movie, she has a presence, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is vital to the movie, particularly for him confronting the most difficult thing within himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Adding to the {{challenges}} facing the 1997 team, Michigan entered the season with the toughest schedule among the 112 NCAA Division I-A schools based on records from the previous year. [...] Days before the season opener, Lloyd Carr compared the daunting schedule to an expedition to Mount Everest. Carr noted, [...] "It's a little akin to climbing Mount Everest. But Mount Everest has been climbed. And with great preparation and determination, and great attitude, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> our players have, I can assure you we're looking forward to it." ...|$|E
60|$|These things I mention {{upon this}} account, and no other, viz., {{to state the}} {{obligation}} I have been in all along to her majesty personally, and to my first benefactor principally; by <b>which</b> <b>I</b> say, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was at least obliged not to act against them, even in those things <b>which</b> <b>I</b> might not approve. Whether I have acted with them further than I ought, shall be spoken of by itself.|$|R

500|$|In 2005, Pinter {{stated that}} he had stopped writing plays {{and that he would}} be devoting his efforts more to his {{political}} activism and writing poetry: [...] "I think I've written 29 plays. I think it's enough for me... My energies are going in different directions—over the last few years I've made a number of political speeches at various locations and ceremonies... I'm using a lot of energy more specifically about political states of affairs, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> are very, very worrying as things stand." [...] Some of this later poetry included [...] "The 'Special Relationship'", [...] "Laughter", and [...] "The Watcher".|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Kiefer Sutherland {{revealed}} that Redemption {{was inspired by}} the Rwandan Genocide and the U.S. Government's response to it. [...] "The truth is, {{one of the things that}} was said in the prequel, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> has been a massive problem with how the Western world has dealt with Africa, no one can justify going there, because they have no viable reason– meaning oil or money. Here [...] response is a human one. We can stop a genocide. I think that that's something that Bill Clinton apologized for not doing with Rwanda and we centered a show around that." ...|$|E
500|$|Chandler upset many in {{the black}} {{community}} by voting against an anti-lynching bill soon after taking office. The bill levied fines against local governments and individual government officials in counties where illegal lynchings occurred. Of his vote against the bill, Chandler remarked, [...] "I am against lynching by anybody and of anybody, black or white, but the present bill carries penalties on local officials and local subdivisions <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> are too severe." [...] The bill passed in the House of Representatives, but died in the Senate. Later, Chandler joined with senators from other southern states in opposing the repeal of poll taxes, long used as a mechanism to prevent blacks from voting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] said Juanna again. [...] "And what if I {{refuse to}} consent to this scheme, <b>which,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> can have come {{only from a}} woman's brain?" [...] and she pointed to Soa.|$|R
60|$|Yes by {{all manner}} of means to Lady Holland. Will you ask her whether she has Sydney Smith's letters to me, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> placed (at Mrs. Smith's request) either in Mrs. Smith's own hands or in Mrs. Austin's? <b>I</b> cannot {{remember}} <b>which,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the latter.|$|R
6000|$|... "The resemblance," [...] said Long, on this, at a {{distance}} from us and not turning, [...] "the resemblance, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>think</b> would puzzle anyone, is simply to 'poor Briss'!" ...|$|R
500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{challenge}} in making the film, Alfredson mentioned {{the fact that people}} already would have a perception of the characters and the surroundings from the novel. He especially felt that the depiction of Eli was difficult, but stated that he was [...] "very happy about Lina". On another occasion, he again commented positively on Leandersson's appearance, stating that [...] "e hardly used makeup or anything in post-production to make her like this, she is simply damn good. She's also a very special girl, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> shows in the film." [...] He has frequently commended Leandersson for her intelligence, often comparing her to [...] "an 80-year-old woman, very wise and very quiet." ...|$|E
500|$|The Duchess of Marlborough was {{a capable}} {{business}} manager, unusual {{in a period}} when women were excluded from most things outside the management of their household. Her friend Arthur Maynwaring wrote that she was more capable of business than any man. Although she never came to like Blenheim Palace – describing it as [...] "that great heap of stones" [...] – she became more enthusiastic about its construction and wrote to the Duke of Somerset about the new waterworks: [...] "I {{believe it will be}} beautiful. The Canal and Bason (which is already don) look very fine. There is to be a lake & a cascade... <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> will bee a great addition to the place".|$|E
500|$|Commerce Square {{was praised}} for its design of two towers {{surrounding}} a plaza. The Philadelphia Inquirer said [...] "Its most positive aspect {{is that it}} avoids the developers' cliches of atriums and shopping malls and makes a real urban place. It expresses great confidence in Philadelphia, and even more important, in {{the whole idea of}} living in cities." [...] Renowned Philadelphia urban planner Edmund N. Bacon praised Commerce Square and its plaza by saying [...] " [...] sensitivity for urban design is beautifully demonstrated by his design for the lobby level, including the splendid garden, of Commerce Square at 20th and Market streets, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> will prove {{to be one of the}} finest commercial projects to be built in this century." ...|$|E
60|$|We must by {{this time}} be so inured to danger {{in the pursuit of}} our big game, that we will go and hunt an animal <b>which</b> is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> the most {{dangerous}} creature with which man can contend. I mean the Gorilla.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{admire her}} more than any girl in society, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she will be thrown away on the Duke of Brecon. She is clever and she has strong character, and, I am told, is capable of great affections. Her manners are good, finished, and natural; and she is beloved by her young friends, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> a test." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{command the}} Maritzburg Scouts," [...] Captain Brookfield said. [...] "Three of my men, with Mr. King, who {{commands}} the section {{to which they}} belong, have just returned. I wish to hand you Mr. King's report; it contains news <b>which</b> is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> of importance." ...|$|R
500|$|Ward {{was very}} happy with the episode. [...] He complimented {{storyboard}} artists Muto and Sugar, saying that the former [...] "has a hilarious slapstick set-up-the-punchline kind of style of comedy" [...] and the latter [...] "is amazing at executing these super romantic, emotional goosebump-kind of feelings". He was particularly pleased with the ending, noting that [...] "I love that goose-bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising. In that episode you're talking about, there is that rising action toward the end, and then LSP [...] cuts in and says 'drama bomb!' {{in the middle of it}} to sort of, like, cut its legs out. <b>Which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is a lot of fun." [...] The episode was later nominated for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-format Animated Program, although it did not win.|$|E
500|$|By 1957, the Egyptian was {{the last}} {{passenger}} train to travel through the city. Between 1940 and 1960 Harrisburg lost another 20% of its population due to economic standstill. With only 9100 people left {{in the city that}} once had 16,000, then Senator John F. Kennedy made a campaign stop on October 3, 1960. Speaking at the Saline County Court House he said [...] "This district, which is built on the land and which has been nourished by the land, personifies the kind of problems <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the United States is going to face in the 1960s. This district has depended in the main for its resources, its growth, its wealth, upon the minerals underground and upon the food that is grown on the ground. And those are those industries that have faced serious problems in the 1960s." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hunt discussed {{working as an}} independent artist, stating [...] "Creatively it is certainly liberating, {{but the rest of}} it is really not that fun. I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording, marketing and distribution <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is very important to any product you want to bring to market ... but I never had that with the record industry. Now that I'm {{on the other side of}} it trying to be the artist and the industry, I realize what the importance of the system was, but I also realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now." [...] He also said that he intends on recording another album [...] "at least one more time and then go on tour, and then I don't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE. Well, but I have {{something}} to tell you to-day <b>which</b> <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> is rather dashing. (MISS SUSAN gathers her knitting, looks at PHOEBE, and is preparing to go.) You are not going, ma'am, before you know what it is? ...|$|R
6000|$|Ramirez smiled. [...] "Some {{people want}} to meet me and some do not, but I was not bored at all. Your friend is an {{interesting}} man; he told me much about <b>which</b> <b>I</b> must <b>think.</b> You have known him long?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{with the}} painful remembrance {{of the time}} when I was married," [...] said Mrs. Armadale. [...] "She was associated, as a mere child, with a {{circumstance}} <b>which</b> <b>I</b> must <b>think</b> of with shame and sorrow to my dying day." ...|$|R
