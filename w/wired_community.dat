40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies using large-scale data sets have validated the Granovetter hypothesis {{on the structure}} of the society in that there are strongly <b>wired</b> <b>communities</b> connected by weak ties. However, as interaction between individuals takes place in diverse contexts, these communities turn out to be overlapping. This implies that the society has a multilayered structure, where the layers represent the different contexts. To model this structure we begin with a single-layer weighted social network (WSN) model showing the Granovetterian structure. We find that when merging such WSN models, a sufficient amount of interlayer correlation is needed to maintain the relationship between topology and link weights, while these correlations destroy the enhancement in the community overlap due to multiple layers. To resolve this, we devise a geographic multilayer WSN model, where the indirect interlayer correlations due to the geographic constraints of individuals enhance the overlaps between the communities and, at the same time, the Granovetterian structure is preserved.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} data from an {{entrepreneurial}} ‘wired community’ established at Atherton Gardens in Fitzroy, Melbourne. It summarises a four year study of the effects on 800 low-income and multiethnic households of access to free networked computers, training and information resources. The question was whether these low-income households would make use of online health, housing education and employment services, as distinct from using the resources to play games or seek entertainment. Results suggest that, although what people went looking for online varied, tenants could and did seek information on social services and did explore government websites and the resources of community agencies. This finding emerges from a study drawing on focus groups, interviews, surveys and the analysis of tenants’ patterns of network use.

This <b>wired</b> <b>community,</b> which will comprise almost 800 households, {{is the result}} of a complex partnership between a not for profit Internet Service Provider, other charitable organisations, local, state and federal government agencies, and the private sector. It aspires to improve the welfare of residents by creating new community interests, fostering local enterprise, and co-ordinating more effectively social services and support systems. Proponents of the network see computer access and connectivity as an important means of enhancing social and economic participation and self-help among a socially disadvantaged, economically depressed population. While a great deal has been written about the beneficial effects of electronic service delivery, detailed empirical research on the use and consequences of computer networks remains patchy, particularly amongst those who have not previously had access to such services. Much more work is needed to assess the effectiveness of various models for the provision of adequate hardware, software, training and education with which to begin to bridge the digital divide. This paper presents initial findings from a three-year research project looking at the new network at Atherton Gardens and the ways in which it is used, its complex genesis, and its impact on the culturally and linguistically diverse, socially disadvantaged population of the wired high rise. Such impacts might reasonably be expected to become apparent in the educational achievements of school children, in the adult education, training and employment outcomes and in the use which residents make of the intranet and internet as a means of accessing useful, comprehensible and timely information. A second and potentially much more interesting set of outcomes will be in the level of community participation and engagement which resident ownership of the network is expected to engender. Will the provision of online communication facilities increase social capital and connectedness in the ‘real’ world? A third set of outcomes, which is possibly the most interesting of all is that which cannot yet be predicted, as residents take up the opportunities the network makes available to them and then subvert, twist, interpret and use the system for their own purposes. It seems likely that middle class assumptions about what low income communities can, will and should do with technology may have little or nothing to do with the way those communities actually choose to use the system. The paper also examines some of the difficulties encountered in getting the project as far as it has already come, in light of the model of social partnerships under which it was constructed, and the differing expectations of the numerous partners involved...|$|E

40|$|The {{coupling}} {{of virtual}} interfaces and physical places is integral in realizing the full potential of information technologies upon {{the planning of}} communities. To date, the urban model of development most associated with digital networks is single-use, low-density sprawl, as exemplified in California's Silicon Valley. However, this thesis proposes that a more traditional urban form can better complement and parallel the efficiencies afforded by information technologies. Mixed-uses, higher densities, and walkable main streets for synchronous face-to-face interaction coupled with service alleys for asynchronous delivery systems can support the information-based, 24 -hour lifestyles desired by networked communities. While the notion of overlaying network technologies onto neighborhoods is new, the best physical frameworks that can house these <b>wired</b> <b>communities</b> may indeed be based on traditional urban patterns. Traditional urbanism is especially appropriate to sustain the processes of a fully <b>wired</b> and integrated <b>community.</b> First, as information technologies collapse space and time requirements for activities, so does the denser, mixed-use neighborhood. Secondly, mixed-use block configurations more naturally accommodate today's increasingly blurred distinctions between living and working, another phenomena nurtured by the advent of information technologies. At the same time, {{by virtue of its}} finer-grained, more concentrated and livable fabric, mixed-use blocks can foster a more vibrant street life and greater opportunities for the social networking that is so critical to the entrepreneurial, mobile workers of to day's agglomerative dot-com economies. Third, the physical patterns of street fronts and service alley spaces provide a simple but effective framework in which to house coordinated, synchronous interactions and around-the-clock asynchronous activities, a distinction that becomes increasingly significant to users of on-line environments. Recognition of these benefits offered by traditional urbanism can be pointed to in the recent emergence of cyber-districts such as New York's Silicon Alley in New York and San Francisco's South of Market Area. The thesis first considers how services and spaces in the community may be mapped out across virtual and physical dimensions, correlating what gets clustered and what gets dispersed as online services are mapped onto a neighborhood masterplan. The distinction between asynchronous and synchronous modes of services is used to both develop the urban masterplan and to suggest specific ways that conventional architectural models might better adapt to the networked neighborhood plan. The value of these integrated services and spaces is demonstrated in the context of scenario mapping between three different households: an elderly couple in an assisted living complex, a working class family with home business needs, and young telecommuting professionals in more urban mixed use units. The thesis explores these issues in are-design of Massachusetts' Telecom City project. Telecom City is a regional redevelopment initiative co-ventured by the cities of Malden, Everett and Medford. The project planners' goal is to convert 200 acres of underutilized and blighted land along the Malden River into a state-of- the-art telecommunications research and development office park. In contrast, the thesis will propose a more locally integrated neighborhood network, more {{along the lines of the}} new urban cyber-districts, that will ultimately add unique value to and create greater synergies with its surrounding towns. by Benjamin S.

Four principals for guiding digital place planning are then outlined; these principles of "recombinant urban design" include the need to: 1) determine the locational impacts of digital technology (fluid locations), 2) consider the creation of designs that foster sense of place and community (meaningful places), 3) integrate electronic and physical design elements (threshold connections), and 4) involve relevant stakeholders in the design process (democratic designs). Examples of these design principles are provided, along with a general planning process for involving various public (school, city, library) and private (developer, telecommunication provider) stakeholders.
