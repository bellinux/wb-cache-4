25|$|The {{effects of}} the tour hit hard on Gunn in 1902 {{and he was very}} disappointing with both bat and ball apart from a few good bowling performances. The {{following}} year, though, bowling in a slower style, he had his finest season ever and was momentarily second as an all-rounder to Hirst. In the process, on a featherbed wicket at Trent Bridge, he hit 294 against Leicestershire, which <b>was</b> <b>amazingly</b> his first century since his third first-class match! As a bowler, Gunn took 28 wickets in two games against Surrey and Essex during the August Bank Holiday week. He was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden for 1904, but the following three years were not quite up to the standard set in 1903 – though he bowled wonderfully against Essex in 1905 on a perfect pitch. In 1906 Gunn again changed his style, bowling very slowly and tossing the ball up, with barely improved success.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, a {{financial}} scandal involving a controversial slush fund {{led to the}} departure and eventual jailing of long-time president Roger Rocher. Saint-Étienne subsequently suffered a free-fall with the club suffering relegation in the 1983–84 season. The club returned to the first division in 1986 {{under the leadership of}} goalkeeper Jean Castaneda who had remained with the club, despite its current financial state. Saint-Étienne kept its place in the first division for nearly a decade with the club reaching the semi-finals of the Coupe de France in 1990 and 1993 during the stint. In 1996, Saint-Étienne was relegated to the second division and returned to Division 1 in 1999. In the 2000–01 season, the club <b>was,</b> <b>amazingly,</b> supervised by five different managers and had to deal with a scandal that involved two players (Brazilian Alex Dias and Ukrainian goalkeeper Maksym Levytsky) who utilised fake Portuguese and Greek passports. Both players were suspended for four months and, {{at the end of a}} judicial inquiry, which linked some of the club's management staff to the passport forgeries, Saint-Étienne was docked seven league points and were, unsurprisingly, relegated.|$|E
500|$|Bowling {{primarily}} from over the wicket, his accuracy, changes of pace, and movement in both directions, {{coupled with a}} leg stump line to a packed leg-side field, made scoring off him difficult. He achieved his success in a manner not dissimilar to Derek Underwood a generation later. His accuracy and stamina allowed Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, one of Australia's finest fast bowling pairs of all time, to draw breath between short and incisive bursts of pace and swing. Standing , he was particularly effective on sticky wickets, reducing his speed to slow medium pace and using a repertoire of off cutters, inswingers, outswingers and leg breaks. Bowling a leg-stump line from over the wicket with a leg side cordon of two short legs and a silly mid-on, he was described by Bradman as [...] "unique in every way". Bradman further added [...] "I cannot remember another of the same type...He worried and got out the best bats, <b>was</b> <b>amazingly</b> accurate and must have turned in fine figures had not his cartilage given way." [...] He usually bowled with four men on the off side including a slip, and five on the leg. When the pitch was wet, he moved a further man to the on side to field at leg slip.|$|E

2500|$|The patent {{application}} Toulmin drew up gave the Wrights sole {{claim to the}} only system ever devised for the in-air control of a fixed-wing flying machine. [...] By April 1904, the Wrights’ patent had been filed {{not only in the}} United States but in Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, and, Wilbur wrote, [...] "probably Russia." [...] The U.S. patent issued in 1906. Toulmin's fee for filing the multi-country patent <b>was</b> <b>amazingly</b> only $15.00.|$|E
2500|$|George Thompson {{was educated}} at Wellingborough School (1890–93). [...] He first played for Northamptonshire {{when they were}} not {{first-class}} as a teenager. His ability was shown so quickly, however, that the MCC played him occasionally as early as 1897 (when he was not twenty). In 1900, Thompson surprised the critics with an excellent innings of 125 for the Players when called in at the last minute, but in the following three years he <b>was</b> <b>amazingly</b> successful for Northamptonshire in the Minor Counties Championship: in 1904, he averaged 36 with the bat and less than 10 with the ball, - showing him far too good for that level.|$|E
2500|$|There <b>was</b> <b>amazingly</b> little loss of life. The {{engineer}} and fireman were both killed, and 13 passengers injured (but only two severely). Just 30 passengers were aboard, which limited casualties. The couplings between the cars also held, preventing more cars from {{crashing into the}} river. Other factors also helped. When the train left Baltimore, railroad officials warned the engineer to slow down because of conditions created by the hurricane, and the locomotive's steam had been cut off (with the object of allowing the train to coast down the grade into the city). The cost of the disaster was estimated at between $80,000 and $240,000 ($ to $ in [...] dollars). More than 300 workers began clearing the wreck the next day.|$|E

2500|$|Though Stone {{has criticized}} Bush for his administration's 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, the director {{said that he}} was not looking to make an [...] "anti-Bush polemic." [...] Stone compared his goal of the film to that of The Queen, wanting to trace [...] "seminal events in Bush's life." [...] According to the director, [...] "It's a behind-the-scenes approach, similar to Nixon, to give a sense of what it's like to be in his skin. But if Nixon was a symphony, this is more like a chamber piece, and not as dark in tone." [...] He described the structure of W. as a three-act film starting with Bush as a young man [...] "with a missed life", followed by his transformation and [...] "an assertion of will which <b>was</b> <b>amazingly</b> powerful" [...] as he came out from his father's shadow, and finally his invasion of Iraq.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{stirring}} spectacle; stirring {{in more ways}} than one, for it <b>was</b> <b>amazingly</b> funny, {{and at the same time}} deeply pathetic; for they had seen so much, these time-worn veterans, and had suffered so much; and had built so strongly and well, and laid the foundations of their commonwealth so deep, in liberty and tolerance; and had lived to see the structure rise to such state and dignity and hear themselves so praised for their honorable work.|$|E

25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all he {{had to say about the}} present, his language <b>is</b> <b>amazingly</b> clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse <b>are</b> <b>amazingly</b> conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|R

This awful alarm--this terrible drum--is a want of a good hope through faith, which purifieth the heart.--Ed.|$|E
