5|$|As {{far back}} as the Iron Age, Welsh folk were using wild cereals to create a coarse bread. By the time the Romans invaded, Celtic skills with bread had progressed to the point that white or brown breads could be produced. The Roman {{invasion}} led to many Welsh people moving to the less hospitable uplands, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> cereal crops which could be grown were oats, barley and rye. Oat and barley breads were the main breads eaten in Wales up until the 19th century, with rye bread created for medicinal purposes. Oats were used to bulk out meat or meat and vegetable stews, also known as pottage.|$|E

5|$|The feud between John Cena and Umaga {{continued}} on Raw the next night, where Umaga assaulted Cena after his match with The Great Khali and also interfered in Cena's match with Jonathan Coachman two weeks later. Due to the Umaga assault, Cena injured his spleen, which was portrayed as real in their storyline. At Royal Rumble, a Last Man Standing match, a match <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{way to win}} is to beat up your opponent so much they can not get to their feet before the referee counts to ten was scheduled for the WWE Championship between Cena and Umaga.

It uses higher current levels for welding T or corner joints. The third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder—which is typically used with automated equipment.|$|E

5|$|For {{the main}} event, the CMLL ring crew quickly erected a 15-foot tall steel cage {{around the ring}} as the {{participants}} were introduced. The match {{started out with a}} 10-minute period where no one would be allowed to leave the cage, forcing the two Infernales squads to fight each other. When the 10 minutes were up Tarzan Boy was quick to climb up the cage and over the top, escaping while everyone else was fighting. Moments later he was joined by teammate Rey Bucanero. Mephisto was the first to escape the cage for his team, leaving four men in the ring. Moments later both Último Guerrero and Averno climbed out of the cage. This left El Satánico to fight Máscara Mágica <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way to win was to pin their opponent or force them to submit. In the end, the veteran Satánico forced his masked opponent to submit to win the match and the Los Infernales name. Afterwards Máscara Mágica removed his mask per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulations and revealed his birth name, Antonio Gómez Medina, formerly known as Talismán Jr.|$|E
5|$|Sonya gives Rodya a cross {{when he goes}} to turn {{himself in}} and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear. Sonya tells him they will bear the cross {{together}} and is taking part of his burden onto herself, encouraging him to confess. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses, so originally the cross was Lizaveta's—whom Rodya didn't intend to kill, making it an important symbol of redemption. Sonya's face reminds him of Lizaveta's face, another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief. Self-sacrifice, along with poverty, is a larger theme of the novel. The desperation of poverty creates a situation <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way to survive is through self-sacrifice, which Raskolnikov consistently rejects, as part of his philosophical reasoning. For example, he rejects Razumikhin's offer of employment and the idea of his sister's arranged marriage. Raskolnikov originally rejects Sonya's offer to accompany him to the confession but, in a feverish state of mind, sees her following him through the market, and finds power in that idealism.|$|E

5|$|The Choiseul pigeon was {{non-migratory}} and {{is thought}} to have lived on the forest floor in lowland forests, including coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. The Choiseul pigeon is usually considered to have been endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands off the coast of New Guinea, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> specimens were collected. The specimens Meek acquired were likely collected near Choiseul Bay {{in the northern part of}} the island. The last reports of the species from the indigenous population came from the Kolombangara River. It also reportedly lived on the neighboring islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita, and it is suspected that it may once have lived on Bougainville Island. However, these reports were never confirmed and must be considered anecdotal. It would be considered very unusual if the Choiseul pigeon were truly endemic to Choiseul as the island hosts no other endemic species, and the pigeon was never linked ecologically with another species on the island.|$|E
5|$|The System Has Failed is {{the tenth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth. Released on September 14, 2004, {{it was the}} band's second and final studio album {{distributed}} by Sanctuary Records. The System Has Failed was the first album released after Mustaine recovered from his arm injury sustained in 2002 which prevented him from playing guitar. It is also {{the first of three}} Megadeth records not to include original bassist and co-founder David Ellefson. Instead, the album features session players, including former Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland on lead guitar. However, Poland only provided lead guitar parts and solos on a contractual basis and did not rejoin the band. To date, it is the only Megadeth album <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> certified member of the band was the sole Mustaine.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a Last Ride match between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{way to win}} was by throwing one's opponent into a hearse and driving {{it out of the}} arena. During the beginning of the match, The Undertaker tossed Kennedy into steel steps {{on the side of the}} ring and then onto the commentator's announcing table. The Undertaker then threw Kennedy into the ring apron, which is the apron covering the area under the ring. Kennedy and The Undertaker wrestled inconclusively until The Undertaker tossed Kennedy on top of the roof of the hearse. The Undertaker then delivered a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver, both onto the roof of the hearse. As he was still in control of the match, The Undertaker threw Kennedy into the hearse and drove it out of the arena to win the match.|$|E

5|$|The {{top seed}} in the women's event were China with an average rating of 2528. They were led by the Women's World Champion Hou Yifan on board one, along with Zhao Xue, Ju Wenjun, Tan Zhongyi and Guo Qi. The reigning champions Russia have the second highest average rating. They were led by Alexandra Kosteniuk and were playing with the same players as in the {{previous}} Olympiad, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> difference was the induction of Aleksandra Goryachkina instead of the absent Kateryna Lagno. Ukraine and Georgia were the other two teams with average rating higher than 2400. The Ukrainian team consisted of most Grandmasters (four) and Women's World Champions (two), and included both Anna and Mariya Muzychuk playing on the top two boards, Anna Ushenina, Natalia Zhukova and Inna Gaponenko. Georgia were led by the best individual player in the women's event of the Chess Olympiad in Tromsø in 2014 Nana Dzagnidze, and also had Lela Javakhishvili, Nino Batsiashvili, Bela Khotenashvili and Salome Melia on the team.|$|E
5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
