40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that in the}} case of {{heterogenous}} censoring distributions studentized survival tests can be carried out as conditional permutation tests given the order statistics and their censoring status. The result is based on a conditional central limit theorem for permutation statistics. It holds as well for linear test statistics as for supstatistics. The procedure <b>works</b> <b>under</b> <b>one</b> of the following general circumstances for the two-sample problem: the unbalanced sample size case, higly censored data, certain non-convergent weight functions or under alternatives. For instance the two-sample log rank test can be asymptotically carried out as a conditional test if the relative amount of uncensored observations vanishes asymptotically as long as the number of uncensored observations becomes infinite. Similar results hold whenever the sample sizes n 1 and n 2 are unbalanced in the sense that n 1 =n 2 ! 0 and n 1 ! 1 hold.

40|$|Decreased {{performance}} in group settings, labeled social loafing, {{has previously been}} attributed {{to the lack of}} identifiability of individual performance. However, some research indicates that the power of identifiability may depend on motivational orientation. The purpose of this laboratory experiment was to understand the effects of different motivational styles on social loafing. Specifically, motivation was thought to moderate the relationship between identifiability of individual outputs and performance. Participants were subjected to a priming manipulation intended to elicit intrinsic or extrinsic motivational states. They also <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> <b>one</b> of three group settings, which were intended to create a condition conducive to social loafing, and two control conditions. It was expected that extrinsically motivated participants working in a group where their individual efforts would be unidentifiable would show the highest levels of social loafing. Results indicate that the priming manipulation was unsuccessful, which explains why the main hypothesis was not supported. The value of using a motivational analysis in social loafing research is discussed...|$|R
