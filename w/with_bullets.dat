5|$|After the arrest, Nhung and Nghĩa {{sat with}} the {{brothers}} in the APC, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh {{was reported to have}} gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip, where by all accounts the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Đôn determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them <b>with</b> <b>bullets</b> before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife.|$|E
5|$|The {{soldiers}} {{arrived at}} the church and promptly arrested the brothers, tying them with their hands behind their backs. After the arrest, Nhung and Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa sat with Diệm and Nhu inside the APC, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt. They stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip where, by all accounts, the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Đôn later determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them <b>with</b> <b>bullets</b> before repeatedly stabbing their bodies with a knife.|$|E
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like <b>with</b> <b>bullets</b> and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E

5|$|Then, after flying past McCudden in a head-on firing pass, Voss's Fokker was hit <b>with</b> <b>bullets</b> on the {{starboard}} side by Hoidge. Meantime, Rhys Davids had pulled aside to change an ammunition drum; he rejoined combat with a 150meter (500foot) height advantage over Voss's altitude of 450meters (1,500feet), and began a long flat dive onto the tail of Voss' triplane. At point-blank range, he holed the German aircraft end to end with his machine guns before turning. It wandered into his line of flight again, in a gentle westward glide; Rhys Davids again ripped the German plane as its engine quit. The aircraft missed a mid-air collision by inches. The British ace fired again. As the triplane's glide steepened, Rhys Davids overran him at about 300meters (1,000feet) altitude and lost sight of his opponent. From above, Bowman saw the Fokker in {{what could have been}} a landing glide, right up until it stalled. It then flipped inverted and nose down, dropping directly to earth. The resulting smash left only the rudder intact.|$|E
25|$|On 3 January, two Australian {{aircraft}} discovered boats carrying {{corn and}} hay moving from Ghor el Hadit (behind Point Costigan) and Rujm el Bahr {{at the northern}} end of the Dead Sea.

25|$|Later that day, four masked gunmen doused {{the main}} doors of Nablus' Roman and Greek Catholic churches with lighter fluid, then set them afire. They also {{opened fire on}} the buildings, {{striking}} both <b>with</b> <b>bullets.</b> In Gaza City, terrorists opened fire from a car at a Greek Orthodox church, striking the facade. Explosive devices were set off at the same Gaza church on Friday, causing minor damage. There were no claims {{of responsibility for the}} last three attacks.|$|E
25|$|Serna's {{unit was}} ordered to begin an advance towards the Meuse River and Argonne Forest in France. When his unit arrived at St. Mihiel, they {{encountered}} a German machine gunner who killed 12 soldiers. Serna crawled up to the machine gunner's left flank. Even though his helmet was hit twice <b>with</b> <b>bullets,</b> Serna {{was able to get}} close enough to throw four grenades into the nest. Eight Germans surrendered and the rest in the nest were dead.|$|E
25|$|Cutolo had {{previously}} had a son, Roberto, {{from a previous}} marriage who was shot dead in Tradate on December 24, 1990, aged 28, in gang violence. His killers were later found dead themselves, their faces riddled <b>with</b> <b>bullets.</b> The murder had been ordered by Mario Fabbrocino, the boss of the Fabbrocino clan, as revenge for Cutolo ordering the death of his brother, Francesco, in the 1980s. Fabbrocino was eventually convicted of Roberto's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Hearst {{sailed to}} Cuba {{with a small}} army of Journal reporters to cover the Spanish–American War in person, {{bringing}} along portable printing equipment, which was used to print a single edition newspaper in Cuba after the fighting had ended. Two of the Journal's correspondents, James Creelman and Edward Marshall, were wounded in the fighting. A leader of the Cuban rebels, Gen. Calixto García, gave Hearst a Cuban flag that had been riddled <b>with</b> <b>bullets</b> as a gift, in appreciation of Hearst's major role in Cuba's liberation.|$|E
25|$|In July 1936, while {{recovering}} at the Brâncovenesc Hospital, {{where he}} had undergone an appendectomy, Stelescu fell victim to the Guard's revenge. A Decemviri death squad, comprising ten Theology students, had formally received Codreanu's blessing at the Iron Guard Congress in Târgu Mureș that April. Seizing its opportunity, it stormed into the hospital building and shot Stelescu to death. This murder left an enduring mark on public memory because of its ritualistic nature: Stelescu's body was not just riddled <b>with</b> <b>bullets,</b> but also bludgeoned or hacked to pieces.|$|E
25|$|After the arrest, Nhung and Nghĩa {{sat with}} the {{brothers}} in the APC, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt.

25|$|Around 28 {{people were}} killed in the attack which {{included}} twelve Congress leaders and workers, eight police and CRPF jawans and four other villagers. There was crossfire between Mahendra Karma's guards and the Naxalites, but when his defenders ran out of bullets, Karma surrendered along with various other Congress leaders. Naxalites then asked Congress leaders there to identify him. Karma came forward and identified himself. Naxalites then took him away and beat him. They then stabbed him several times and sprayed him <b>with</b> <b>bullets,</b> and then beat him again about the head with the butts of their guns. They also raised the slogans Mahendra Karma Murdabad. Autopsy revealed that 78 stab wounds were found on his body, which were made with a blunt object.|$|E
25|$|Nhung and Nghĩa {{sat with}} the {{brothers}} in the APC as the convoy headed off after the arrest. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh {{was reported to have}} gestured to Nhung, who was a contract killer and Minh's bodyguard, with two right-hand fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. During the journey, the brothers were killed in the APC, with Nhung riddling their bodies with many bullets. An investigation by Đôn later determined that Nghĩa and Nhung sprayed them <b>with</b> <b>bullets</b> before repeatedly stabbing them. When the corpses arrived at military headquarters, the generals were shocked. Đôn ordered another general to tell reporters that the brothers had died in an accident and went to confront Minh in his office.|$|E
25|$|The fortress' sole {{action with}} the German {{invasion}} forces came on 4 June 1940. Since early May German aircraft had overflown the area without incident, but on 4 June a single Luftwaffe bomber made an attack. The bomber missed its intended target, the radio station, but damaged {{the church and}} the commandant's quarters. After expending its bomb load the bomber went low and strafed the area, riddling the radio hut and other buildings <b>with</b> <b>bullets.</b> In response to the attack Corporal Olav Børve returned fire using the 65mm Hotchkiss gun with case-shot, firing 13 rounds. After a while the fortress' machine guns also fired back at the aircraft. With {{at least one of the}} case-shot rounds damaging the German bomber's hull it limped away from the area with a wounded navigator.|$|E

25|$|After the arrest, Nhung and Nghĩa {{sat with}} the Ngô {{brothers}} in the APC. Before dispatching the convoy, Minh {{was reported to have}} gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken as the order to kill the Ngô brothers. As the convoy on the route to the General Headquarters, Xuân ordered the APC to stop over at a National Police station where he brutally tortured Nhu and Diệm, asking them where they had hidden money. When they refused to release the information, Xuân killed them with his pistol. An investigation by Đôn later determined Nghĩa shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them <b>with</b> <b>bullets</b> before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife without realizing that both the brothers had already been killed by Xuân.|$|E
25|$|When a {{fire engine}} drove within range, Huberty {{repeatedly}} pierced the vehicle <b>with</b> <b>bullets,</b> {{but did not}} wound any occupants. Hearing a wounded teenager, 19-year-old Jose Pérez, moaning, Huberty fatally {{shot him in the}} head; the boy slumped dead in the booth. Pérez died alongside his friend and neighbor, 22-year-old Gloria González, and a young woman named Michelle Carncross. At one point, Aurora Peña, who had lain wounded beside her dead aunt, baby cousin and two friends, noted a lull in the firing. Opening her eyes, she saw Huberty nearby and staring at her. He swore and threw a bag of french fries at her, then retrieved his shotgun and shot her in the arm, neck, and chest. She survived, although she would be hospitalized longer than any other survivor. Occasionally, Huberty blurted justifications before murdering his victims as he shot them.|$|E
25|$|Obeying this order, General Farhat {{began the}} journey to his post as {{governor}} of El Kef and the Ounifa tribe on 16 April 1864. As the region around El Kef was now in revolt, he asked for an armed escort, but the Bey had no men to spare. Farhat therefore asked his deputy {{to come out to}} meet him with 150 spahis from the town. Ignoring his deputy's advice not to proceed because of the danger, he continued to make for his post as ordered. When he reached the pass at Khanguet el Gdim, 21km from El Kef, he was surrounded by insurgents. The spahis, who came from the same tribe as them, did not want to fight them, and melted away, leaving him only with eight of his attendants. All were slaughtered. The olive tree, pockmarked <b>with</b> <b>bullets,</b> where he met his end was venerated for many years until it was cut down and burned in around 1950.|$|E
