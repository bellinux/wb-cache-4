5|$|Operation Chronicle, the {{landings}} at Kiriwina and <b>Woodlark</b> Islands, was the VII Amphibious Force's first operation, presented {{no great}} difficulty as the islands {{were known to}} be unoccupied. However half the assault troops experienced seasickness, problems were encountered with clearing the sand bar at the entrance to Guasopa Harbor, and Barbey's decision to land at night and withdraw before dawn in order to avoid encountering Japanese aircraft highlighted the inexperience of his crews and deficiencies in their training. Unloading activities on the coral-fringed Kiriwina dragged on for a fortnight.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting inhabits a range {{along the}} east coast of Australia from Cape York, Queensland, southward along the coast and the Great Barrier Reef to eastern Victoria and {{the east coast of}} Tasmania down to Southport. The species also inhabits a number of islands; Lord Howe Island, New Caledonia, and <b>Woodlark</b> Island, Papua New Guinea. The species is most {{abundant}} in lower Queensland and New South Wales, where studies show it inhabits every estuary sampled throughout the course of a study, while in north Queensland, the species is very patchily distributed along the coast.|$|E

5|$|The geographical, {{engineering}} and logistical difficulties of conducting operations in SWPA were driven home by Alamo Force's first operation, Operation Chronicle, {{the occupation of}} <b>Woodlark</b> and Kiriwina Islands in June 1943. Despite {{the fact that the}} operation was unopposed by the Japanese, it was subject to delays. Krueger visited Kiriwina, where road work and airbase development were held up by heavy rains, on 11 July. He was dissatisfied with the rate of progress and relieved the task force commander. The arrival of additional engineers sped up the base development effort, and No. 79 Squadron RAAF commenced operations from Kiriwina on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|No. 78 Squadron {{was formed}} at Camden, New South Wales, on 20 July 1943. It {{was the fourth}} of the new Kittyhawk squadrons to be established, {{following}} No. 84 Squadron in February, No. 86 Squadron in March and No. 82 Squadron in June; the final unit, No. 80 Squadron, was formed in September. No. 78 Squadron began to receive its P-40N Kittyhawk fighters from 2 August 1943, and conducted training with these aircraft until early October. The squadron began moving from Camden to <b>Woodlark</b> Island in the war zone off New Guinea on 12 October 1943. However, its destination was changed to Kiriwina Island, and the squadron became operational there as part of No. 73 Wing on 27 November. This wing was controlled by No. 10 (Operational) Group, a mobile formation established on 13 November to support the planned Allied advance along the north coast of New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1942, No.6 Squadron {{moved to}} Horn Island in the Torres Strait and {{established}} a detachment of four aircraft at Gurney Field, Milne Bay in New Guinea. The Milne Bay detachment had been formed to provide reconnaissance and bomber support of the Australian garrison there, which {{was expected to be}} attacked. Japanese forces landed at Milne Bay on the night of 25/26 August, sparking the Battle of Milne Bay which ended in an Allied victory in early September. No.6 Squadron flew reconnaissance and anti-shipping patrols from the airfields at Milne Bay throughout the battle. The squadron attacked a convoy of three Japanese destroyers and three patrol boats which were carrying reinforcement troops to Milne Bay on 29 August. While the squadron claimed to have damaged a destroyer in this operation, the Japanese force did not actually incur any damage. Following the Allied victory at Milne Bay, No.6 Squadron Hudsons continued to patrol the region near Milne Bay, and sank a Japanese transport ship near <b>Woodlark</b> Island on 26 September. The Horn Island-based elements of the squadron moved to Wards Strip near the town of Port Moresby in New Guinea on 11 October from where it conducted anti-submarine patrols alongside No.100 Squadron. For much of November the squadron also supported the Australian Army force engaged in the Kokoda Track campaign by dropping supplies and evacuating sick soldiers. From 6 December until near the end of that month, No. 6Squadron conducted night bombing raids of the Japanese beachhead at Buna, Sanananda and Gona; these included an attack on a destroyer off Buna. Towards the end of December the squadron was concentrated at Turnbull Field at Milne Bay from where it undertook reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{planning}} for the seizure of <b>Woodlark</b> and Kiriwina was undertaken in May 1943 at General Walter Krueger's Sixth Army headquarters in Brisbane, Australia. General MacArthur gave command of the landings to Krueger as well as responsibility for the co-ordination of ground, air, and naval planning. <b>Woodlark</b> and Kiriwina were required as future airfield sites to support operations in both New Guinea, New Britain and the Solomon Islands. The invasion was the first amphibious movement undertaken in the South West Pacific Area, with planning thorough and comprehensive which became standing operating procedure for future invasions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>woodlark's</b> {{natural habitat}} is {{heathland}} and open spaces sparsely populated with trees.

25|$|On <b>Woodlark,</b> the {{construction}} of <b>Woodlark</b> Airfield was begun by 20th and 60th US Naval Construction Battalions on 2 July and by 14 July the airfield consisted of single 3,000 feet (910 m) x 150 feet (46 m) runway which could accommodate Douglas C-47 Skytrains. By 21 July the runway was expanded to 5,200 feet (1584 m) of runway and a coral surface with the 67th Fighter Squadron arriving on 23 July. The airfield was ultimately extended to 6,500 feet (2,000 m) x 225 feet (69 m) with a parallel runway of 6,000 feet (1,800 m) x 60 feet (18 m) together with 110 hardstands. The airfield {{was used as a}} stopover point and refuelling point. Defensive positions were set up around <b>Woodlark</b> with antiaircraft and coast artillery pieces of the 12th Defense Battalion being installed, and machine gun and 37mm beach positions established. A PT boat and landing craft repair base was also constructed at Guasopa Bay and the island was also used as a supply base.|$|E

50|$|Tree felling was {{scheduled}} to minimise disruption to nesting birds and to other wild-life and in certain instances, animals such as dormice were removed to similar habitats elsewhere. After the works were completed, 200,000 trees were planted on {{the route of the}} old road. The restoration of the old road to nature removed a barrier that prevented the migration of ground-nesting birds, such as <b>woodlarks</b> and nightjars from one part of the nature reserve to the other.|$|R
40|$|When {{vertebrates}} invaded land {{during the}} Carboniferous period, they were exposed {{not only to}} new ecological opportunities but also to a desiccating environment. To maintain cellular water homeostasis, natural selection modified the integument of pioneering terrestrial animals, enabling them to reduce water loss through the skin. In desert environments, where ambient temperatures (Ta) can reach 50 °C, relative humidities are low and drinking water is scarce, integumentary modifications that reduce cutaneous water loss (CWL) could be fundamental to survival. Previous {{research has shown that}} hoopoe larks (Alaemon alaudipes) from the Arabian desert reduced CWL when acclimated to 35 °C compared with individuals at 15 °C, but skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and <b>woodlarks</b> (Lullula arborea), from The Netherlands, and Dunn’s larks (Eremalauda dunni), also from the Arabian desert, did not.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Working {{toward a}} general {{framework}} {{to understand the}} role of microbiota in animal biology requires the characterisation of animal-associated microbial communities and identification of the evolutionary and ecological factors shaping their variation. In this study, we described the microbiota in the cloaca, brood patch skin and feathers of two species of birds and the microbial communities in their nest environment. We compared patterns of resemblance between these microbial communities {{at different levels of}} biological organisation (species, individual, body part) and investigated the phylogenetic structure to deduce potential microbial community assembly processes. RESULTS: Using 16 S rRNA gene amplicon data of <b>woodlarks</b> (Lullula arborea) and skylarks (Alauda arvensis), we demonstrated that bird- and nest-associated microbiota showed substantial OTU co-occurrences and shared dominant taxonomic groups, despite variation in OTU richness, diversity and composition. Comparing host species, we uncovered that sympatric <b>woodlarks</b> and skylarks harboured similar microbiota, dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria. Yet, compared with the nest microbiota that showed little variation, each species' bird-associated microbiota displayed substantial variation. The latter could be partly (~[*] 20 %) explained by significant inter-individual differences. The various communities of the bird's body (cloaca, brood patch skin and feathers) appeared connected {{with each other and with}} the nest microbiota (nest lining material and surface soil). Communities were more similar when the contact between niches was frequent or intense. Finally, bird microbiota showed significant phylogenetic clustering at the tips, but not at deeper branches of the phylogeny. CONCLUSIONS: Our interspecific comparison suggested that the environment is more important than phylogeny in shaping the bird-associated microbiotas. In addition, variation among individuals and among body parts suggested that intrinsic or behavioural differences among females and spatial heterogeneity among territories contributed to the microbiome variation of larks. Modest but significant phylogenetic clustering of cloacal, skin and feather microbiotas suggested weak habitat filtering in these niches. We propose that lark microbiota may be primarily, but not exclusively, shaped by horizontal acquisition from the regional bacterial pool at the breeding site. More generally, we hypothesise that the extent of ecological niche-sharing by avian (or other vertebrate) hosts may predict the convergence of their microbiota...|$|R
25|$|Reconnaissance parties {{landed on}} <b>Woodlark</b> and Kiriwina in May and {{reported}} {{that there were no}} Japanese troops occupying the islands. Due to a delay in gathering the units assigned to the operation together, as they were spread across the north of Australia and New Guinea D-Day was set for 30 June 1943. A RAAF LW-AW radar unit, No. 305 Radar Station arrived at Kiriwina Island on 17 May and was operational the next day, providing advance warning of airborne threats.|$|E
25|$|In February 1943, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, the {{commander}} of the Sixth United States Army, picked Zundel as his artillery officer. He was soon on his way to Brisbane, Australia. As Sixth Army Artillery Officer participated in a number of operations in the Southwest Pacific Area, including Operation Chronicle, the landings on <b>Woodlark</b> and Kiriwina Islands; Operation Dexterity, the landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester; the Admiralty Islands campaign; and Operation Reckless, the landings at Hollandia.

40|$|We {{investigated}} interindividual {{variation and}} intra-individual phenotypic flexibility in {{basal metabolic rate}} (BMR), total evaporative water loss (TEWL), body temperature (T-b), the minimum dry heat transfer coefficient (h), and organ and muscle size of five species of larks geographically distributed along an aridity gradient. We exposed all species to constant environments of 15 degreesC or 35 degreesC, and examined to what extent interspecific differences in physiology {{can be attributed to}} acclimation. We tested the hypothesis that birds from deserts display larger intra-individual phenotypic flexibility and smaller intern individual variation than species from mesic areas. Larks from arid areas had lower BMR, TEWL, and h, but did not have internal organ, sizes different from birds from mesic habitats. BMR of 15 degreesC-acclimated birds was 18. 0 %, 29. 1 %, 12. 2 %, 25. 3 %, and 4. 7 % higher than of 35 degreesC-acclimated Hoopoe Larks, Dunn's Larks, Spike-heeled Larks, Skylarks, and <b>Woodlarks,</b> respectively. TEWL of 15 degreesC-acclimated Hoopoe Larks exceeded values for 35 degreesC-acclimated individuals by 23 % but did not differ between 15 degreesC- and 35 degreesC-acclimated individuals in the other species. The dry heat transfer coefficient was increased in 15 degreesC-acclimated individuals of Skylarks and Dunn's Larks, but not in the. other species. Body temperature was on average 0. 4 degreesC +/- 0. 15 degreesC (mean +/- 1 SEM) lower in 15 degreesC-acclimated individuals of all species. Increased food intake in 15 degreesC-acclimated birds stimulated enlargement of intestine (26. 9 - 38. 6 %), kidneys (9. 8 - 24. 4 %), liver (16. 5 - 27. 2 %), and. stomach (22. 0 - 31. 6 %). The pectoral muscle increased in 15 degreesC-acclimated Spike-heeled Larks and Skylarks, remained unchanged in Hoopoe Larks, and decreased in 15 degreesC-acclimated <b>Woodlarks</b> and Dunn's Larks. We conclude that the degree of intra-individual flexibility varied between physiological traits and among species, but that acclimation does not account for interspecific differences in BMR, TEWL, and h in larks. We found no general support for the hypothesis that species from desert environments display larger intra-individual phenotypic flexibility than those from mesic areas. The coefficient of variation of larks acclimated to their natural environment was smaller in species from and areas than in species from mesic areas for mass-corrected BMR and surface-specific h, but not for mass-corrected TEWL. The high repeatabilities of BMR, TEWL, and h in several species indicated a within-individual consistency on which natural selection could operate...|$|R
40|$|Birds from deserts {{generally}} have lower total evaporative water loss (TEWL), {{the sum of}} cutaneous (CWL) and respiratory water loss (RWL), than species from mesic areas. We investigated the role of CWL and RWL {{as a function of}} air temperature (T-a) in hoopoe larks (Alaemon alaudipes) and Dunn's larks (Eremalauda dunni) from the Arabian Desert and skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and <b>woodlarks</b> (Lullula arborea) from temperate mesic grasslands. The proportional contribution of CWL to TEWL in all larks at moderate T-a ranged from 50 % to 70 %. At high T-a (40 degrees+/- 45 degreesC), larks enhanced CWL by only 45 %- 78 % and relied on an increase in RWL by 676 %- 2, 733 % for evaporative cooling. Surface-specific CWL at 25 degreesC was 29 % lower in the arid-zone species than in the mesic larks. When acclimated to constant T-a, 15 degreesC-acclimated hoopoe larks increased CWL by 22 % compared with 35 degreesC-acclimated birds, but the other species did not change CWL. This study is consistent with the hypothesis that larks from deserts have a reduced CWL at moderate and low T-a but provided no support for the hypothesis that at high T-a larks from arid regions rely more on CWL than larks from mesic environments. Interspecific differences in CWL cannot be attributed to acclimation to environmental temperature and are possibly the result of genetic differences due to natural selection or of phenotypically plastic responses to divergent environments during ontogeny...|$|R
