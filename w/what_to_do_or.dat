He left Vienna {{for the last time}} on 10 July 1845.|$|E
500|$|... "The general discontent I {{felt with}} woman's portion as wife, housekeeper, physician, and spiritual guide, the chaotic {{conditions}} into which everything fell without her constant supervision, and the wearied, anxious {{look of the}} majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular. My experience at the World Anti-slavery Convention, all I had read of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept across my soul, intensified now by many personal experiences. It seemed as if all the elements had conspired to impel me to some onward step. I could not see <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> where to begin—my only thought was a public meeting for protest and discussion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The general {{principle}} that the President controls the entire executive branch was originally rather innocuous, but extreme forms of the theory have developed. John Dean explains: [...] "In its most extreme form, unitary executive theory can mean that neither Congress nor the federal courts can tell the President <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> how to do it, particularly regarding national security matters." ...|$|E

6000|$|That <b>what</b> <b>to</b> think, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> [...] <b>Or</b> where <b>to</b> {{lay their}} head, [...] They know not: 'tis the damned's woe, [...] To live, and yet be dead.|$|R
60|$|There was {{an awkward}} pause, neither the boys nor the girls knowing exactly <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say <b>or</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Some {{academics}} {{believe that}} scientific colleagues who suspect scientific misconduct should consider taking informal action themselves, or reporting their concerns. This question {{is of great}} importance since much research {{suggests that it is}} very difficult for people to act or come forward when they see unacceptable behavior, unless they have help from their organizations. A [...] "User-friendly Guide," [...] and the existence of a confidential organizational ombudsman may help people who are uncertain about <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>or</b> afraid of bad consequences for their speaking up.|$|E
2500|$|Angry that Met Ed had not {{informed}} them before conducting a steam venting from the plant, and {{convinced that the}} company was downplaying the severity of the accident, state officials turned to the NRC. After receiving word of the accident from Met Ed, the NRC had activated its emergency response headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland and sent staff members to Three Mile Island. NRC chairman Joseph Hendrie and commissioner Victor Gilinsky initially viewed the accident, in the words of NRC historian Samuel Walker, as a [...] "cause for concern but not alarm". Gilinsky briefed reporters and members of Congress on the situation and informed White House staff, and at 10:00a.m. met with two other commissioners. However, the NRC faced the same problems in obtaining accurate information as the state, and was further hampered by being organizationally ill-prepared to deal with emergencies, as it lacked a clear command structure and the authority to tell the utility <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>or</b> to order an evacuation of the local area.|$|E
2500|$|Stanton's {{attempts}} to raise Northern spirits after the defeat were hampered by news that, under Hooker, the Army of the Potomac had become grossly undisciplined. Indeed, Hooker's camps {{were described as}} [...] "combination of barroom and brothel." [...] Stanton petitioned for liquor and women to be forbidden in Hooker's ranks. Meanwhile, Lee was again pushing into the North. Lee's movements were racking nerves in Washington by mid-June, more so when disturbing reports came from Hooker's subordinates, {{such as that of}} Brig. Gen. Marsena Patrick: [...] " [...] acts like a man without a plan, & is entirely at a loss <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>or</b> how to match the enemy, or counteract his movements." [...] Further, like McClellan, Hooker kept overestimating Lee's numbers, and said the Lincoln's administration did not have full confidence in him. Hooker resigned on June 27; Stanton and Lincoln decided that his replacement would be Maj. Gen. George Meade, who was appointed the following day.|$|E
60|$|Captain Clavering {{became very}} {{red in the}} face, and was {{altogether}} at a loss <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say <b>or</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R

60|$|Instead of {{answering}} me, he looked about him {{for half a}} minute in suspense, as if doubtful <b>what</b> next <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>to</b> say. Then he walked across with great deliberation {{to the door of}} the room, and locked and double-locked it with furtive alarm, as I interpreted his action.|$|R
60|$|George {{remained}} {{standing at the}} bedside; but he knew not <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>or</b> what answer to make to this ebullition of anger.|$|E
60|$|But {{when they}} saw the Gigaboo they were afraid, and stood gazing at it in alarm, without knowing <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> how to attack it.|$|E

60|$|Lord Kilcullen's face became thoughtful, and {{his brow}} grew black: {{he stood for}} some time irresolute <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say <b>or</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|Paul Barberry {{appeared}} greatly disconcerted. He had {{not expected}} this sudden turn of affairs, and he knew not <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say <b>or</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{declared}} the woman, [...] "I'm right glad you came. She's {{been like this}} three or four days. I don't know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her, <b>or</b> <b>what's</b> the matter." ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Beniah was horrified. He did {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> say. Happily {{he was one of}} those men whose {{feelings}} are never betrayed by their faces.|$|E

60|$|The whole {{situation}} was so gruesome and grotesque, and I had been swept into it so absurdly, {{that for the}} moment I did not know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> say.|$|E
60|$|Poor Shadow was so {{confused}} he <b>did</b> not know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say <b>or</b> <b>do.</b> He {{sat on the}} edge of the bed the picture of despair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{not sure}} to you; people {{have such a}} notion of what you {{embroider}} on things that they're rather afraid to commit themselves or to lead you on: they're sometimes in, you know," [...] she luminously reminded me, [...] "for more than they bargain for, than they quite know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with, <b>or</b> than they care to have on their hands." ...|$|R
60|$|The native {{women and}} {{children}} were looking in at the doorway curiously, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say <b>or</b> <b>do.</b> Turning swiftly, Dick caught one by the arm.|$|R
60|$|The words {{left her}} mouth, sharp, clear-cut, {{breaking}} the silence like the lash of a whip. The unexpectedness of it, and the savagery, took Corliss aback. He {{did not know}} <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> say.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so glad--for Auntie's sake," [...] said Theodora, with shining eyes. [...] "But, oh, Donald, it's best of {{all just}} to have you back. I'm so {{perfectly}} happy that I don't know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> say." ...|$|E
60|$|Arthur was {{so taken}} aback {{that he did}} not for a moment know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> say, and before any impulse of {{violence}} could seize him he realized the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{never dreamed}} of finding my mother in such a place," [...] she went on. [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> say. She isn't well. I ought to stay and help her, and yet--oh, it is disheartening!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The King did {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>or</b> to say. It went against all his ideas as a knight to do {{anything}} a lady begged him not to do; but, as he hesitated, a voice in his ear said: ...|$|E
