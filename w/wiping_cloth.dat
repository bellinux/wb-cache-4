40|$|The {{relationship}} between visual inspections {{carried out by}} environmental health officers and microbiological examination was studied in 89 restaurants. Using 30 variables a standardized inspection procedure was developed {{and each of the}} premises was assessed in six main areas-structure and design, cleaning and cleanliness, personal hygiene, risk of contamination, temperature control, and training and knowledge about food hygiene. Selected foods and specimens from hands, surfaces, and <b>wiping</b> <b>cloths</b> were examined. There were significant associations between all six areas of the inspections. The structure and design were significantly related to the combined score from all the other areas (P less than 0. 001). There were no highly significant associations between microbiological examination and visual assessments. The microbial contamination of <b>wiping</b> <b>cloths,</b> however, was related to the cleaning and cleanliness (P = 0. 005). Microbial sampling provided additional information to inspections and was a valuable aid. Further development of this risk-assessment approach could provide an effective system for monitoring potential health risks in high-risk food premises...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: evaluate the efficacy of different cleaning cloth types and cloth-disinfectant combinations in reducing food contact surface contamination to acceptable levels; determine the optimum moist heat and moist heat + sanitizer treatments that can significantly reduce the number of Listeria strains on deli slicer components; and investigate if the moist heat treatment used in this study induced the viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state in Listeria cells. The efficacy of <b>wiping</b> <b>cloths</b> was measured using ATP-bioluminescence and total plate count methods using four different <b>wiping</b> <b>cloths</b> and silver dihydrogen citrate sanitizer on food contact surfaces. The lethality study of moist heat and silver dihydrogen citrate disinfectant against Listeria strains was done using deli slicer components and the viable-but-non-culturable state of Listeria strains subjected to sub-lethal moist heat and silver dihydrogen citrate disinfectant stresses was measured using BacLight bacterial viability test kit. In the first study we demonstrated that the cleaning effects of <b>wiping</b> <b>cloths</b> on food contact surfaces can be enhanced when used with the SDC sanitizer and stated that the ATP-B measurements can be used for real-time hygiene monitoring in the public sector with inclusion of microbial contamination testing (total plate count) for more reliable measure of cleanliness. In the moist heat lethality study, the internal moist heat only treatment and both the internal and external moist heat + disinfectant treatments yielded non-detectable levels of Listeria strains on stainless steel and cast aluminum coupons. Moist heat only and moist heat + disinfectant treatments at 150 °F (66 °C) and at least 20 % relative humidity (RH) for 5 h was adequate to attain non-detectable levels of a Listeria strains cocktail on both stainless steel and cast aluminum deli meat slicer components. The BacLight bacterial viability test demonstrated that the moist heat treatment applied in this study was effective in inactivating Listeria strains. However, the absence of growth on nutrient agar plates and detection of live cells by the viability test demonstrated that the sub-lethal temperature used in this study could induce the VBNC state in Listeria strains...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{presence}} of Salmonella and Shigella in freshly squeezed orange juice and related samples was conducted in Guadalajara, Mexico. One hundred samples of freshly squeezed orange juice were collected from 49 street booths and 51 small food service establishments. In addition, 75 fresh orange samples, each consisting of five orange units, and 75 wiping cloths were collected from the same establishments from which juice had been collected. Salmonella was isolated from 14, 20, and 23 % of samples of orange juice, orange surfaces, and wiping cloths collected from street vendors, while Shigella was isolated from 6, 17, and 5 % of these samples. In general, the frequency of isolation of these pathogens in samples from juice serving establishments at public markets was significantly lower than that found among street vendors (P 0. 05). Salmonella enterica serotypes Agona, Typhimurium, and Anatum were found in orange juice, fresh oranges, and <b>wiping</b> <b>cloth</b> samples, while serotype Mexico was found on fresh oranges and in wiping cloths and serotypes Muenchen and Panama were found only in <b>wiping</b> <b>cloth</b> samples. Regarding Shigella species, Shigella sonnei was found in all three types of sample tested; Shigella dysenteriae was found in juice and orange samples, Shigella boydii in orange and <b>wiping</b> <b>cloth</b> samples, and Shigella flexneri on oranges only. Thirty-one percent and 39 % of the juice samples showed aerobic plate counts of 5. 0 log CFU/ml and Escherichia coli counts of 3. 0 log CFU/ml, respectively.

40|$|Three {{groups of}} {{premises}} (butchers' shops, supermarkets and general dealers) which sell raw and cooked meats were compared. Salmonellas were not detected, but Escherichia coli, {{and to a}} lesser degree Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, were widely distributed in all three groups of premises. Contamination of hands, towels and nail brushes was related to poor working practices. The presence of E. coli or Str. faecalis on slicing machines was associated with contamination of meat samples. A number of <b>wiping</b> <b>cloths</b> were heavily contaminated with E. coli, and many also contained Clostridium perfringens. Fewer premises provided written cleaning plans, and in many cases staff did not receive an adequate training in food hygiene.

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of methods used to detect and kill pathogens. The most effective, as expected, is to cook the meat to a high enough {{temperature}} to kill all growth, but meat can be re-contaminated during any step of the food production process, especially if workers handle both raw and cooked products. The risk of disease from a ready-to-eat (RTE) product such as chicken nuggets is significantly higher {{due to the fact that}} many consumers do not re-cook them, believing them to be safe. E. coli, Salmonella and Shigella have all been found in RTE products. A study of working practices in shops selling raw meats (including butcher’s shops, supermarkets and general stores) published in the Journal of Hygiene, found pathogens on slicing machines, <b>wiping</b> <b>cloths,</b> worker’s hands, towels, and nail brushes. This facilitated the contamination of already cooked meats. This example shows the need of a method of detection. The traditional method is based on using cultures examined under a microscope, which is time-consuming. A method tested in 2005 in a study published in Meat Science, is called multiplex PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and is based on the analyzing of nucleic acid and had promising results.|$|R

In addition, they help devotees clamber up onto the Ándas to briefly touch the icon, and wipe the image with cloths tossed at them. The <b>wiping</b> of <b>cloth</b> on the image, which is also done during the Pahalík ("kissing") ritual during the vigil of the Traslación, follows the folk belief that cloth can be imbued with a holy object's miraculous powers (specifically its curative abilities).
