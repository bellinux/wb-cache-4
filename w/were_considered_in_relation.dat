The new commission published the The Greater Shanghai Plan (...) in July 1929. This included the redevelopment of the old Chinese district and a new city centre located in the Jiangwan District, between the site of a proposed new port and the International Settlement. Rail and future extensions of existing port facilities <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> to the new site, as well as a proposed system of broad, rectilinear streets designed to alleviate Shanghai’s growing traffic problems. The plan designated around 15% of the area to parks and open spaces, with the most ambitious element being a civic centre, occupying 333 acre that included a 50 m high pagoda and a Washington style reflecting pool.|$|E

40|$|Australian students' {{attitudes to}} nuclear weapons <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> to sex-role {{identification}} and political orientations. By including {{a measure of}} sex-role orientation, we hoped to clarify earlier confusion surrounding gender {{as a predictor of}} nuclear views. Our hypothesis was that men and women with feminine sex-role orientations would display the strongest antinuclear feelings. Also, we predicted that an authoritarian political stance advocating strict law-and-order on the domestic front would predict support for nuclear weapons in international defense. The subjects were 46 male and 62 female first-year university students. The measure of nuclear attitudes was a 23 -item inventory (NARQ) which had previously been extensively refined and validated for Australian populations (Jennings & Lawrence, 1986). The BSRI (Bem, 1974) measured sex-role orientation. An Australian law-and-order scale was also developed for this research. Latent trait models for rating data were applied to NARQ and law-and-order scales. The results revealed sex differences on approximately one-third of the nuclear opinion items, with men expressing stronger support for nuclear weapons in every case. Authoritarian law-and-order attitudes likewise predicted support for nuclear weapons in both men and women. A stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that BSRI masculinity and law-and order made separate, statistically significant, contributions to overall variation in nuclear views. These results <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> both to previous research and to practical implications for political behavior...|$|E
