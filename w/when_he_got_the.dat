5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell {{was perfect for}} the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was {{not familiar with the}} comic book <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.|$|E

As a result, he viewed this as an advantage as he managed to understand the character beforehand.

Additionally, he saw himself prepared for the role's pressure due to his previous works in popular anime.|$|E

25|$|John F. Rague is {{credited}} with designing the Territorial Capitol Building. He had previously designed the 1837 capitol of Illinois and was supervising its construction <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> commission to design the new Iowa capitol in 1839. He quit the Iowa project after five months, claiming his design was not followed, but the resemblance to the Illinois capitol suggests he strongly influenced the final Iowa design. One surviving 1839 sketch of the proposed capital shows a radically different layout, with two domes and a central tower. The cornerstone of the Old Capitol Building was laid in Iowa City on July 4, 1840. Iowa City served as the third and last territorial capital of Iowa, and the last four territorial legislatures met at the Old Capitol Building until December 28, 1846, when Iowa was admitted into the United States as the 29th state of the union. Iowa City was declared the state capital of Iowa, and the government convened in the Old Capitol Building.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{started their}} {{response}} quickly, but the reintroduction of Broad paid dividends for England <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> wicket of Ronchi {{in the sixth}} over. It was Guptill who England had to watch out for, however, following his performances earlier in the series, but it was another newcomer to the England side, Tredwell, who put paid to the New Zealand opener's plans of going the entire series without getting out, bowling him with his fifth ball of the match for 38. Williamson (19) was next to go, trapped plumb LBW by Root for his first ODI wicket. Bresnan then got Munro for a golden duck, before Tredwell had McCullum caught behind for 6, and Franklin edged Broad to gully for 7. Taylor and Nathan McCullum managed {{to put on a}} 53-run partnership for the seventh wicket before Broad caught McCullum off the bowling of Bresnan. Three overs later, Finn had Southee for 15 and the contest was all but over; Taylor was still in, two runs away from his half-century, but with 92 runs still to get in 12 overs and only two wickets in hand, the task was too much for New Zealand. Taylor gave it his best shot, though, making it to 71 before holing out to Bresnan off the bowling of Tredwell, and Mills added 28 runs of his own, but McClenaghan was unable to hold his own end up for long and New Zealand were bowled out for 253, 35 runs from victory.|$|E

Performing in Las Vegas <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> news of his CBS cancellation, Skelton said, [...] "My heart has been broken." [...] His program {{had been one of}} the top ten highest rated shows for 17 of the 20 years he was on television. Skelton moved to NBC in 1970 in a half-hour Monday night version of his former show.

Despite that controversy, it managed to connect deeply with fans of the band, who wrote letters to the band remarking the track saved their lives during difficult situations.

The first was a North of France versus South match, after which a France team was formed to play against the Rest of France on 22 December at the Stade du Matin in Colombes. Guillemin was selected for the Rest. Ahead of the game, Reichel in Le Figaro gave France the odds of winning, since it had a heavier pack and better halfbacks, and also commented positively on Duval, Bonhomme and Guillemin. The Rest of France won 12–6. The cohesion of the Rest's threequarter line, all coming from Stade Français, was especially apparent, while the forwards, although weaker in the scrum, and lighter, played with more [...] "valour". As a result, many changes were made for the team to play [...] on 1 January 1908: the captain, Marc Giacardy, was dropped altogether, and Guillemin {{was one of several}} who won selection.|$|E
