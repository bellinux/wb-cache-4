5|$|It was alleged by medieval chroniclers that Edward II and Piers Gaveston were lovers, a rumour {{that was}} {{reinforced}} by later portrayals in fiction, such as Christopher Marlowe's late 16th-century play Edward II. This assertion has received the support of some modern historians, while others have questioned it. According to Pierre Chaplais, {{the relationship between the}} two was that of an adoptive brotherhood, and Gaveston served as an unofficial deputy for a reluctant king. Other historians, like J. S. Hamilton, have pointed out that concern over the two men's sexuality <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> core of the nobility's grievances, which rather centred on Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage.|$|E
5|$|Law enforcement's corrupt {{attitude}} generally <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{expense of}} the people. Apart from the economic benefits provided by the Maceos, these bosses provided {{a high degree of}} protection to the island's citizens. When serious crimes were committed the local police would sometimes contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with. However, the island was not completely peaceful; threats at the point of a gun were a common means for the Maceo gang to ensure control. Though the average citizen was relatively safe, gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E

At {{the outbreak of the}} war, Siquijor was a sub-province of Negros Oriental, headed by Lieutenant Governor Nicolas Parami. Refusing to pledge allegiance to the Japanese forces, Lt. Governor Parami was taken by Japanese soldiers from his residence at Poo, Lazi one evening and brought to the military headquarters in Larena. He was never heard from again. On 10 November 1942, Japanese warships started shelling Lazi from Cangabas Point. In Lazi, a garrison was established in the old Home Economics Building of the Central School. Filipino guerrillas engaged in sabotage and the interaction during this time to cause havoc on the Japanese lives and properties.|$|E
