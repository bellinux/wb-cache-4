Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote, [...] "It feels morose and unrelieved, {{despite the efforts of}} ..." [...] Variety wrote, [...] "Belying the lightheartedness of its title, Birdy is a heavy adult drama about best friends and the after-effects of war, but it takes too long {{to live up to its}} ambitious premise." [...] Jack Zink of the Sun-Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "takes a while to hook you into its story. This is one {{occasion}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> the wait; Parker keeps us awake by repeatedly slapping us across the face visually." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, {{director}} Joe Johnston {{indicated that}} he planned to start filming in April 2010. In a separate interview that month, he described the film's pre-production: [...] "Rick Heinrichs is production-designing and we're set up down in Manhattan Beach, California.... We have eight or ten really talented artists, and we all just sit around all day and draw pictures and say, 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could do this?' It's that phase of the production where money doesn't matter: 'Let's put all the greatest stuff up on the wall and [...] see what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford.</b> The film, he said, will begin [...] "in 1942, 1943" [...] during World War II. [...] "The stuff in the '60s and '70s [...] we're sort of avoiding. We're going back to the '40s, and then forward to what they're doing with Captain America now." [...] In February 2010, Johnston stated that the Invaders will appear in [...] "the entire second half" [...] of the film, leading fans to speculate this was the World War II-era Marvel superhero team of that name, and in November Johnston refuted speculation that the Sub-Mariner, an Invaders team-member in the comics, would be included. Johnston later explained that [...] "the Invaders" [...] had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film. Christopher Markus, one of the screenwriters, said the unnamed group was [...] "called the Howling Commandos in the script, but no one says that out loud." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Areva's Southeast Asia and Oceania director, Selena Ng, Japan's Fukushima nuclear {{disaster}} is [...] "a huge {{wake-up call for}} a nuclear industry that hasn't always been sufficiently transparent about safety issues".

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times, he explained that [...] "I don't believe in redistribution of wealth {{for the sake of}} redistributing wealth. But I am concerned about how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to pay for what we as a nation need to do [...] for what we need in order to be safe and productive.

2500|$|Lastly, in {{the late}} 1990s, a new Internet fad began, owing to simplistic {{software}} development kits such as the Japanese RPG Maker series (1988 onwards). Influenced by console RPGs and based mostly on the gameplay and style of the SNES and Sega Genesis games, {{a large group of}} young programmers and aficionados across the world began creating independent console-style computer RPGs and sharing them online. An early successful example was Corpse Party (1996), a survival horror indie game created using the RPG Maker engine. Much like the survival horror adventure games Clock Tower (1995 onwards) and later Haunting Ground (2005), the player characters in Corpse Party lack any means of defending themselves; the game also featured up to 20 possible endings. However, the game would not be released in Western markets until 2011. In an interview with GameDaily in 2007, MTVN's Dave Williams remarked that, [...] "Games like this [...] have been sort of under the radar for something that could be the basis of a business. We have the resources and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to invest more... I think it's {{going to be a great}} thing for the consumer." ...|$|E
2500|$|His criticism, while {{acknowledging}} that morality is historically relative, was thus values-based. [...] "Writers can make men feel, not merely see, {{the values that}} endure." [...] Believing that too many modern writers encouraged {{men and women to}} flee to unreason, decadence and barbarism, he condemned the trahisons des clercs of the twentieth century, and used his lectures and writing to campaign for a responsible use of intellectual freedom. [...] "One may question whether real civilisation is so safely afloat," [...] he wrote in his last published letter (1966), [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to use our pens for boring holes in the bottom of it." [...] The writer or artist serving up [...] "slapdash nightmares out of his Unconscious", [...] "in an age morbidly avid of uncivilised irreticence", not only exhibited his own neuroses, but fed neurosis in others. Literary critics, too, had to take more responsibility. [...] "Much cant gets talked," [...] he noted of the Structuralists, [...] "by critics who care more for the form and organisation of a work than for its spirit, its content, its supreme moments." [...] The serious note in his criticism was counterbalanced by wit and urbanity, by lively anecdote and quotation, and by a gift for startling imagery and epigram.|$|E
