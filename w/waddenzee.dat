5000|$|The region {{now called}} Het Bildt was formed {{out of a}} sea called the Middelsee (or Bordine) and was at one time subject to serious floods. The Middlesee once {{separated}} the western lands {{from the rest of}} the Frisian mainland. The western part was called Westergoa and the city of Franeker was in its center. The eastern part was called Eastergoa. The city Leeuwarden was located along Eastergoa's western coast. The Middelsee stretched all the way from the north to the west of Bolsward. Earlier it extended still further, all the way to the Zuiderzee (now het IJsselmeer) and Westergoa was an Island only accessible by boat. Around 1300 the sea began to become less accessible to boats. Eventually a dike was raised between the villages Beetgumermolen and Britsum to stop the continuous overflooding. As a result, the area south of this dike was no longer subject to the effects of tides and the parts that weren't already dry became solid land. Westergo and Oostergo were connected. The Swette has been kept as a small river between Leeuwarden and Sneek. After the dike was raised, the northern part of the Middelsee also gradually silted. In 1398 the newly reclaimed dry lands were given by the Duke Albert I of Bavaria to Arnold I, Lord of Egmond, Lord of IJsselstein. In 1498, even more land became dry. This trend, caused by the <b>Waddenzee's</b> tide, has continued to the present.|$|R

However, Dutch Caroline failed to secure a high power AM frequency and the cable network service was discontinued {{because of lack of}} funds. The Dutch Radio Caroline then changed its name to Radio <b>Waddenzee</b> for daytime Dutch and German language, and Radio Seagull for nighttime English language broadcasts, and now broadcasts on 1602 kHz every day and on the internet, presenting a progressive rock format.

50|$|The first {{casualties}} were suffered soon after reaching the Dutch coast. Formation No. 2 did not fare well: Munro's aircraft lost its radio to flak {{and turned back}} over the IJsselmeer, while Rice flew too low and struck the sea, losing his bomb in the water; he recovered and returned to base. Barlow and Byers crossed the coast around the island of Texel. Byers was shot down by flak shortly afterwards, crashing into the <b>Waddenzee.</b> Barlow's aircraft hit electricity pylons and crashed 5 km east of Rees, near Haldern. The bomb was thrown clear of the crash and was examined intact by Heinz Schweizer. Only the delayed bomber piloted by McCarthy survived to cross the Netherlands.

50|$|Until recently, {{none of the}} Dornier twin-engined bomber {{variants}} {{were thought}} to have survived. In September 2007, a Dornier Do 215 B was found largely intact in the shallow waters of the <b>Waddenzee,</b> the Netherlands. This aircraft was flown by a Luftwaffe fighter ace Helmut Woltersdorf. On the night of 6/7 July 1941 Woltersdorf shot down a Vickers Wellington but his Dornier was damaged by return fire and crash-landed off the Dutch Coast.The area where the Dornier came down was named as a seal sanctuary and thus it escaped the attentions of scrap merchants and souvenir hunters.

5000|$|Hypoxia {{may also}} {{occur in the}} absence of pollutants. In estuaries, for example, because {{freshwater}} flowing from a river into the sea is less dense than salt water, stratification in the water column can result. Vertical mixing between the water bodies is therefore reduced, restricting the supply of oxygen from the surface waters to the more saline bottom waters. The oxygen concentration in the bottom layer may then become low enough for hypoxia to occur. Areas particularly prone to this include shallow waters of semi-enclosed water bodies such as the <b>Waddenzee</b> or the Gulf of Mexico, where land run-off is substantial. In these areas a so-called [...] "dead zone" [...] can be created. Low dissolved oxygen conditions are often seasonal, {{as is the case in}} Hood Canal and areas of Puget Sound, in Washington State. The World Resources Institute has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones around the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly in Japan.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{attractive}} Dutch targets were however {{also the most}} dangerous. In the south, the port of Rotterdam was too far inland and the naval ports of Flushing and Hellevoetsluis too heavily defended. More to the north, the vast wealth {{of the city of}} Amsterdam could only be reached by recklessly entering the Zuyderzee past most of the still active vessels of the Dutch fleet, lying in wait in the Texel. Because of these dangers, there would be no English attempts on these ports until Napoleonic times. But one lesser target was more exposed. The naval port of the Admiralty of Friesland, Harlingen, lies at the southern edge of the <b>Waddenzee,</b> the vast stretch of mudflats between the Frisian Isles and the continental coast. Harlingen's exit to the North Sea, located 20 mi to the northwest, is the Vlie, the ancient estuary of the IJssel river, between the islands of Vlieland and Terschelling.

Estimation of MPB PP from the exposed intertidal mudflats in the Dutch <b>Waddenzee,</b> Netherlands was done following a two-step procedure. Firstly, supervised and image based classification method were used to map classes of sediment types since sediment properties are important for MPB PP. Secondly, MPB PP in the Dutch <b>Waddenzee</b> was estimated following the model by Platt and Jassby (1976) for the top sediment layer (2 mm depth) using NDVI as a proxy for MPB biomass. Estimated MPB PP varied spatially and the distribution is similarly comparable to that of derived clay and sand sediment classes, with high MPB PP found in clay sediments and limited amounts on sand. Sensitivity analysis results have shown that MPB PP in mudflats is largely controlled by αB, euphotic depth and Kd...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of tidal basins {{includes a}} wide range of features developing along different spatial and temporal scales. Examples are shoals, channels, banks, dunes and ripples. Coastal engineers use their engineering tools to answer questions on the processes governing the short term (centuries). This two-sided approach has left us with limited understanding of processes occurring on intermediate scales (> decades and < centuries), whereas the morphodynamics of these intermediate scales are of special concern to sustainable coastal zone management. This study is part of a collective effort to bridge the aforementioned gap by extending the use of coastal engineering tools (process-based models) to geological time scales to provide more understanding of the physical processes governing the long-term morphodynamic behavior of tidal basins. A fundamental question addressed is whether or not process-based models can reproduce trustworthy long-term developments. To answer this question the Dutch <b>Waddenzee</b> is chosen as a reference case. This study suggests that the question has a positive answer. By comparing model results with measured developments in the <b>Waddenzee,</b> this study shows that a process-based model can reproduce channel-shoal patterns and their long-term development qualitatively well. Modeled parameters such as area, volume and height of the inter-tidal flats obey the databased equilibrium equations. This study also demonstrates the models' ability to qualitatively assess the impact of large scale human intervention in a tidal basin. For example, the model is able to reproduce the change in tidal transport regime and the ensuing morphodynamic changes due to an extreme impact such as the closure of the Zuiderzee. Although the highly schematized simulations produced qualitatively good results, they also revealed the need for a better process description. As the first step to improve model performance a methodology was developed to account for sediment composition and distribution in the bed. In the next step different methodologies to schematize wave action for long-term morphological simulations were investigated. investigated the wave climate. Model results show that the chronology of wave conditions and the wave schematization approach have a limited effect. The outcome of long-term morphodynamic simulations with different wave and tidal conditions are in good agreement with conceptual models. For the reference case, model results revealed that the morphological impact of wind waves is not only important outside the inlet and at the ebb-tidal delta, but also within the tidal basin. A final conclusion is that adding methodologies for bed composition and wave schematization to the model of the <b>Waddenzee</b> area improved the hindcasting simulations qualitatively.
