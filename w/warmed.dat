40|$|Are the Arctic and Antarctic really <b>warming</b> now? This {{review was}} {{performed}} in order to answer this question.

40|$|Climate {{variability}} {{is expected}} to increase in future but there exist very few experimental studies that apply different <b>warming</b> regimes on plant communities over several years. We studied an alpine meadow community under three <b>warming</b> regimes over three years. Treatments consisted of (a) a constant level of <b>warming</b> with open-top chambers (ca. 1. 9 [*]°C above ambient), (b) yearly stepwise increases in <b>warming</b> (increases of ca. 1. 0, 1. 9 and 3. 5 [*]°C), and (c) pulse <b>warming,</b> a single first-year pulse event of <b>warming</b> (increase of ca. 3. 5 [*]°C). Pulse <b>warming</b> and stepwise <b>warming</b> was hypothesised to cause distinct first-year and third-year effects, respectively. We found support for both hypotheses; however, the responses varied among measurement levels (whole community, canopy, bottom layer, and plant functional groups), treatments, and time. Our study revealed complex responses of the alpine plant community to the different experimentally imposed climate <b>warming</b> regimes. Plant cover, height and biomass frequently responded distinctly to the constant level of <b>warming,</b> the stepwise increase in <b>warming</b> and the extreme pulse-warming event. Notably, we found that stepwise <b>warming</b> had an accumulating effect on biomass, the responses to the different <b>warming</b> regimes varied among functional groups, and the short-term perturbations had negative effect on species richness and diversityNFR grant (B-AA/BU 08424) to UM...|$|R

40|$|Global <b>warming</b> and its {{importance}} are controversial. While {{a variety of}} estimates exists about the likelihood of global <b>warming</b> and the economic cost, financial market information can provide an objective assessment of expected losses due to global <b>warming.</b> We consider a Merton-type asset pricing model in which asset prices {{are affected by the}} changes in investment opportunities caused by global <b>warming.</b> In this setting, in theory global <b>warming</b> has a negative risk premium and most assets have negative loadings on the global <b>warming</b> factor. Financial assets in sectors that are more sensitive to global <b>warming</b> have more strongly negative loadings. Empirically, utilizing a variant of Campbell and Diebold‟s (2005) weather forecasting model in conjunction with Vassalou‟s (2003) approach for extracting financial market “news”, we obtain the global <b>warming</b> factor. We find that indeed the risk premium is significantly negative, that loadings for most assets are negative, and that industry portfolios considered to be more vulnerable to global <b>warming</b> (see IPCC (2007) and Quiggin and Horowitz (2003)) have significantly stronger negative loadings on the global <b>warming</b> factor.

5|$|About {{four hours}} after formation, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Bret, upon which it attained a minimum central pressure of 1002mbar.

After crossing the coast, the storm quickly degenerated to tropical depression status, though Bret retained a well-organized cloud pattern with deep convection. The center turned to the north-northwest, and early on June 30 Bret dissipated inland over Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Global <b>warming</b> is diurnally asymmetric, {{leading to}} a less-cold, rather than <b>warmer,</b> climate. We {{investigated}} the effects of asymmetric experimental warmings on plant phenology by testing the hypothesis that daytime <b>warming</b> is more effective in advancing bud break than nighttime <b>warming.</b> Bud break was monitored daily in Picea mariana seedlings belonging to 20 provenances from Eastern Canada and subjected to daytime and nighttime warmings in growth chambers at temperatures varying between 8 and 16 °C. The higher advancements of bud break and shorter times required to complete the phenological phases occurred with daytime <b>warming.</b> Seedlings responded to nighttime <b>warming,</b> but still with less advancement of bud break than under daytime <b>warming.</b> No advancement was observed when nighttime <b>warming</b> was associated to a daytime cooling.
