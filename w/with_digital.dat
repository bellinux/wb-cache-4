5|$|The entire {{movie was}} sketched out via {{hand-drawn}} storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D animatics {{with all of}} the 2D background photographs digitally painted to resemble the 1939 setting. With the animatics as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors move around invisible scenery.|$|E
5|$|Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned {{as part of}} {{a diverse}} family of {{commercial}} aircraft. In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.|$|E

5|$|Before Lucas {{had started}} writing, his {{producing}} partner Rick McCallum {{was preparing for}} the film. McCallum stated that his experience with The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles led to many of his decisions on The Phantom Menace, such as long-term deals with actors and soundstages, the employment of recent graduates with no film experience, {{and the creation of}} sets and landscapes <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> technology. In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) art director Doug Chiang impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a fan-made mod called The Nameless Mod (TNM) was {{released}} by Off Topic Productions. The game's protagonist is a user of an Internet forum, <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> places represented as physical locations. The mod offers roughly {{the same amount of}} gameplay as Deus Ex and adds several new features to the game, with a more open world structure than Deus Ex and new weapons such as the player character's fists. The mod was developed over 7 years and has thousands of lines of recorded dialogue and two different parallel story arcs. Upon its release, TNM earned a 9/10 overall from PCPowerPlay magazine. In ModDB's 2009 Mod of the Year awards, The Nameless Mod won the Editor's Choice award for Best Singleplayer Mod.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. {{was well}} {{received}} in retrospective reviews, with multiple critics calling {{it one of}} the best Virtual Boy games; some thought it was held back by the platform, and that it should be made available on other platforms, such as the Nintendo 3DS. In 2003, the staff at Tips & Tricks stated it to be the most uncommon North American Virtual Boy release, giving it a rarity rating of 6/10 based on a consultation <b>with</b> <b>Digital</b> Press.|$|E

5|$|Laws dealing <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> {{evidence}} {{are concerned}} with two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film in 1972, approaching Howard to direct during the post-production phase of Cocoon in 1985. Bob Dolman was brought in to write the screenplay, coming up with seven drafts before finishing in late 1986. It was then set up at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and principal photography began in April 1987, finishing the following October. The majority of filming took place at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England, as well as Wales and New Zealand. Industrial Light & Magic created the visual effects sequences, which led to a revolutionary breakthrough <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> morphing technology. The film was released in 1988 to mixed reviews from critics, but was a modest financial success, received two Academy Award nominations, and has developed a cult following amongst fantasy fans.|$|E
5|$|Method and Luma {{both worked}} on {{creating}} the various ants {{seen in the}} film, with Method creating the several species of ants, to share among the vendors. Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual effects in The Winter Soldier. Using practical suit pieces built by Legacy Effects, ILM mixed live-action shots <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm, providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on Lucy.|$|E

5|$|Muren {{found both}} stop motion and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E
5|$|Research {{work on the}} Book of the Dead {{has always}} posed {{technical}} difficulties thanks {{to the need to}} copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by hand, with the assistance either of tracing paper or a camera lucida. In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this, combined <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> print technology, means that the costs of publishing a Book of the Dead may be considerably reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material in museums around the world remains unpublished.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added <b>with</b> <b>digital</b> effects. One such scene was on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks deciding what to cut out. One of the scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but that scene was cut in favor of another episode. Manning's scenes were also cut due from the final broadcast to the length, though viewers could still make out {{the top of her head}} in the finished episode.|$|E
