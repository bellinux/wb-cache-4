5|$|Timmons {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{the son of a}} minister. He had a sister, Eleanor. Both of his parents, and several aunts and uncles, played the piano. From an early age Timmons studied music with an uncle, Robert Habershaw, who also taught McCoy Tyner. Timmons first played at the church where his {{grandfather}} was minister; this influenced his later jazz playing. He grew up in the same area as other future musicians, including the Heath brothers, Jimmy, Percy, and Tootie. Timmons' first professional performances <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> local area, often as a trio that included Tootie Heath on drums. After graduating from high school Timmons was awarded a scholarship to study at the Philadelphia Musical Academy.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} panel {{had sought}} Cho's medical records for several weeks, {{but due to}} privacy laws, Virginia Tech was prohibited from releasing them without permission from Cho's family, even after his death. The panel had considered using subpoenas to obtain his records. On June 12, 2007, Cho's family released his medical records to the panel, although the panel said that the records were not enough. The panel obtained additional information by court order. Like the perpetrators of both the Columbine and Jokela school massacres, Cho was prescribed the antidepressant drug Prozac prior to his rampage, a substance suspected by Peter Breggin and David Healy of leading to suicidal behaviors. It is not known if Cho ever complied in filling or taking this prescription; or if he had taken and then discontinued the prescribed medication. The toxicology test from the official autopsy later showed that neither psychiatric nor any kind of illegal drugs <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> system {{during the time of}} the shooting.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the cast of House were not established actors, with many having primarily only worked with Obayashi on his commercials and independent films. During the two-year waiting period to start filming House, Obayashi created several commercials and began casting the seven girls from models who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> commercials. The most experienced members of the main cast were Kimiko Ikegami and Yōko Minamida. Obayashi was friends with Minamida who he filmed in commercials for Calpis. Ikegami was mostly working television and theater {{at the time and}} worried that taking the role of the older woman would {{have a negative effect on}} the roles she would be subsequently offered, but still agreed to play the part. The country music singer Kiyohiko Ozaki, who plays Mr. Togo in the film, was cast because he was friends with Obayashi through their shared hobby of horseback riding. Other roles were filled by members of the crew and their families; for example, Nobuhiko Obayashi's daughter Chigumi plays the little girl, and the film's production designer plays the shoe maker.|$|E

25|$|Other {{allegations}} include Garrity using {{power and}} influence as a founder to threaten XanGo employees into {{turning a blind eye}} to his theft and instituting what he termed a “culture of giving” at XanGo meaning that founders and employees Garrity determined <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> good graces could unlimitedly use XanGo assets for their personal benefit.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, Rome's {{power and}} control {{increased}} even more, but Armenia retained its independence (even if as a vassal state), although from now on, it was Rome's loyal ally against the Sasanian Empire. For instance, when Septimius Severus attacked Ctesiphon, many Armenian soldiers <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> army: later -in the 4th century- they made up two Roman legions, the Legio I Armeniaca and the Legio II Armeniaca.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, Mallory's snow goggles <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pocket {{when the}} body was found, {{indicating}} that he died at night. This implies that he and Irvine had made a push for the summit and were descending very late in the day. Given their known departure time and movements, had they not made the summit, {{it is unlikely that}} they would have still been out by nightfall.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Magellan's expedition, the Portuguese {{rushed to}} seize the {{surviving}} crew and built a fort in Ternate. In 1525, Charles I of Spain sent another expedition westward to colonize the Maluku Islands, claiming that they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> zone of the Treaty of Tordesillas. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by García Jofre de Loaísa and included the most notable Spanish navigators: Juan Sebastián Elcano and Loaísa, {{who lost their lives}} then, and the young Andrés de Urdaneta.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} change of command directly affecting the forts {{took place on}} October 17, 1861, when Brigadier General Thomas F. Drayton {{was assigned to the}} Third Military District of the Department of South Carolina, which meant that the forts <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> jurisdiction. Drayton, {{who was a member of}} a prominent Charleston family and a graduate of the United States Military Academy, remained in command through the actions of November 7. Whether he could have hastened the preparations of the forts for battle is debatable; the fact is that he did not.|$|E
25|$|In 1525, after Fernão de Magalhães's {{expedition}} (1519–1522), Spain under Charles V sent {{an expedition}} to colonize the Moluccas islands, claiming that they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> zone of the Treaty of Tordesillas, since {{there was not a}} set limit to the east. García Jofre de Loaísa expedition reached the Moluccas, docking at Tidore. The conflict with the Portuguese already established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes. An agreement was reached only with the Treaty of Zaragoza (1529), attributing the Moluccas to Portugal and the Philippines to Spain.|$|E

25|$|Paul Nagel {{argues that}} Adams's {{political}} acumen was not any less developed than others <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> day, and instead argues that Adams' political problems {{were the result}} of an unusually hostile Jacksonian faction and Adams' own dislike of the office. Although a product of the political culture of his day, Adams refused to play politics according to the usual rules and was not as aggressive in courting political support as he could have been. The followers of Jackson relentlessly attacked him for his involvement in the supposed bargain with Clay in the election.|$|E
25|$|Regazzoni {{first started}} {{competing}} in car races in 1963, at the comparatively late age of 24. Many {{of his early}} motorsport experiences were {{across the border in}} Italy, Switzerland having banned motor racing following the horrific accident at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race. His first outings <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own Austin-Healey Sprite, with which he took two podium finishes from only his first three races. This instant success encouraged Regazzoni to move up to a Mini Cooper for the 1964 club racing season.|$|E
25|$|In July 1934 {{at the age}} of 14, he sat the exams for the Liceo Classico D'Azeglio, a Lyceum (sixth form or {{senior high}} school) specializing in the classics, and was {{admitted}} that year. The school was noted for its well-known anti-Fascist teachers, among them the philosopher Norberto Bobbio, and Cesare Pavese, who later became one of Italy's best-known novelists. Levi continued to be bullied during his time at the Lyceum, although six other Jews <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> class. Upon reading Concerning the Nature of Things by Sir William Bragg, Levi decided {{that he wanted to be}} a chemist.|$|E

25|$|Next to {{religion}} and theology, Schleiermacher devoted {{himself to the}} moral world, of which the phenomena of religion and theology <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> systems, only constituent elements. In his earlier essays he endeavoured {{to point out the}} defects of ancient and modern ethical thinkers, particularly of Kant and Fichte, with only Plato and Spinoza finding favour in his eyes. He failed to discover in previous moral systems any necessary basis in thought, any completeness as regards the phenomena of moral action, any systematic arrangement of its parts and any clear and distinct treatment of specific moral acts and relations.|$|E
25|$|Aerin helped Morwen in secret, and {{was beaten}} by Brodda for this. He was always afraid of Morwen, {{but when she}} finally {{departed}} from Dor-lómin, he took for himself {{all that remained of}} her household. When Túrin Turambar, son of Húrin, returned to Dor-lómin in Y.S. 495, he learned all this from Aerin, and in his rage he killed Brodda. The beggars of the former Folk of Hador that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> house revolted then, and many were slain on both sides. Survivors fled into hiding, but Aerin's fate was sealed, and she burnt herself alive in Brodda's hall. The remainder of the House of Hador now was persecuted even more cruelly.|$|E
25|$|After his removal, Bradley made {{no attempt}} to defend himself from {{partisan}} attack, but he did make several public communications pointing out what <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> view defective actions by the new administration in regards to postal service. Bradley became for a time secretary of the Franklin Insurance Company. When Abraham Bradley died in his home in Washington, D.C., May 7, 1838, he left eight children, including lawyer Joseph H. Bradley, best known for his successful defense of John Surratt, accused of attempting to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. The younger Bradley inherited the Chevy Chase farm and himself had a namesake son, also a Washington, D.C., attorney who assisted the Surratt defense team.|$|E

60|$|His attributes, though apart {{laid down}} in the word of God, that we, being weak, might the better {{conceive}} of his eternal power and godhead; yet <b>in</b> him they <b>are</b> without division; one glorious and eternal being. Again, though sometimes this, as of wisdom, or that, as of justice and mercy, <b>is</b> most manifest <b>in</b> <b>his</b> works and wonders before men; yet every such work is begun and completed by the joint concurrence of all his attributes. No act of justice is without his will, power, and wisdom; no act of mercy is against his justice, holiness and purity. Besides, no man must conceive of God, as if he consisted of these attributes, as our body doth of its members, one standing here, another there, for the completing personal subsistence. For though by the word we may distinguish, yet may we not divide them, or presume to appoint them their places in the Godhead. Wisdom <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> justice, holiness <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> power, justice <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mercy, holiness <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> love, power <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> goodness (1 John 1:9, Num 14:17,18).|$|R

25|$|Pickford left Biograph in December 1910. The {{following}} year, she {{starred in}} films at Carl Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP). IMP was absorbed into Universal Pictures in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford {{returned to work}} with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> films, such as Friends, The Mender of Nets, Just Like a Woman, and The Female of the Species. That year Pickford also introduced Dorothy and Lillian Gish (both friends from her days in touring melodrama) to Griffith. Both became major silent stars, in comedy and tragedy, respectively. Pickford made her last Biograph picture, The New York Hat, in late 1912.|$|E
25|$|Later, Reese {{made use}} of the growing library of hands from {{international}} competitions to create interesting quiz-type books, where the discussion was usually on the verso of the page which presented the problem. Famous Hands from Famous Matches {{was the first of}} these, followed by Famous Bidding Decisions and Famous Play Decisions, all written with David Bird. In his career as a writer, Reese had a number of co-authors, mostly highly competent players and writers, yet all his books <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> inimitable style. Another of his ideas was to raid the stock of hands in bridge magazine bidding competitions for interesting and instructive hands. What Would You Bid? was the result.|$|E
25|$|Also, the Catalogue of Ships {{mentions}} a {{great variety}} of cities, some of which, including Athens, were inhabited both in the Bronze Age and in Homer's time, and some of which, such as Pylos, were not rebuilt after the Bronze Age. This suggests that the names of no-longer-existing towns were remembered from an older time, because it is unlikely that Homer would have managed to name successfully a diverse list of important Bronze Age cities that <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> time, only a few blocks of rubble on the surface, often without even names. Furthermore, the cities enumerated in the Catalogue are given in geographical clusters, this revealing a sound knowledge of Aegean topography. Some evidence is mixed, though: locating the Bronze Age palace of Sparta, the traditional home of Menelaus, under the modern city has been challenging.|$|E
