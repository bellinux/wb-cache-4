Right after Disney bought the rights to The Muppets in 2004, pre-production on The Muppets' <b>Wizard</b> <b>of</b> <b>Oz</b> took place throughout February 2004, and filming occurred during September 2004. ABC made several changes to the film after the initial script was written, ultimately deciding to adapt plot elements from Baum's original novel rather than the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film, The <b>Wizard</b> <b>of</b> <b>Oz.</b> As with the preceding Muppet films, The Muppets' <b>Wizard</b> <b>of</b> <b>Oz</b> became a musical, and included five new songs written and composed by Michael Giacchino. The production marked the feature film debut of Eric Jacobson as the performer of Sam Eagle, a character originally performed by Frank Oz.|$|E

5|$|Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz is a Broadway musical {{with music}} and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman.

The lack of interest stemmed from the scholars' misgivings about fantasy, {{as well as to}} their belief that lengthy series had little literary merit.|$|R

25|$|The Western Costume Company in Hollywood {{claims to}} have made Garland's {{original}} slippers.
