Two years later, 3GHz G5s were still not available, and rumors continued that IBM's low yields on the POWER4-derived chip were to blame. Further, the heat produced by the chip proved an obstacle to deploying it in a laptop computer, which had become the fastest growing segment of the personal computer industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} infrastructure in New France was almost nonexistent, with few roads and canals. The canals <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> three miles long {{at times and}} boats were thin and simple. Thus people used the waterways, especially the St. Lawrence River, as the main form of transportation, by canoes. In the winter, when the lakes froze, both {{the poor and the}} rich travelled by sleds pulled by dogs or horses. A land transportation system was not developed in the region until the 1830s, when stretches of road were built along the river, and the Rideau Canal project was not completed until 1840.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. EPA's {{proposed}} {{standard for}} greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit. The U.S. EPA proposed a legal limit of {{a maximum of}} 3.5 millisieverts (350 millirem) each annually to local individuals after 10,000 years, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> several percent of the exposure currently received by some populations in the highest natural background regions on Earth, though the U.S. DOE predicted that received dose would be much below that limit. Over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the United States (10 million km2) by ≈ 1 part in 10 million over the cumulative amount of natural radioisotopes in such a volume, but {{the vicinity of the}} site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} strategy used by cicadas of {{the genus}} Magicicada make use of prime numbers. These insects {{spend most of their}} lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.|$|E
