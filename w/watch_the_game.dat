5|$|Now that I am in baseball, just <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> I play. If I catch any crook in baseball, {{the rest}} of his life is going to be a pretty hot one. I'll go to any means and to {{anything}} possible to see that he gets a real penalty for his offense.|$|E
5|$|The {{game against}} Baylor was played in Floyd Casey Stadium in Waco, Texas, {{approximately}} 100miles (161km) north on Interstate 35 from Austin, {{the home of}} the University of Texas. Because home UT games are usually a sell-out, Texas games at Baylor have found numerous Texas fans driving to Waco to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before {{heading out}} to a {{baseball}} game at a nearby ballpark, sports fan Mr. Brown drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives at the ballpark to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E

5|$|The Notre Dame Fighting Irish {{provide much}} of the sports action for the South Bend locale. Football Saturdays have become a major event for the city, {{attracting}} fans who come to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and have tailgate parties. Notre Dame basketball games are also popular, along with other university sports. The College Football Hall of Fame was moved from Kings Mills, Ohio, to downtown South Bend in 1995, though the Hall of Fame relocated to Atlanta, Georgia in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Pros {{would end}} their season in week twelve against the Staleys. Prior to the game, the Staleys' coach, George Halas, moved their home {{field to the}} much larger Cubs Park in Chicago and hired Paddy Driscoll from the Cardinals to play on his team {{in order to help}} defeat the Pros, which was against league rules at the time. Twelve {{thousand}} fans, which was the largest recorded crowd of the season, showed up to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Of the crowd, about 2,000 were from Pollard's hometown.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{football}} is played at a professional level {{all over the}} world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> on television or on the internet. A {{very large number of}} people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. Football has the highest global television audience in sport.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} eighth and final game, each team had three wins and three losses and one tie, but the Soviets were ahead in goal {{differential}} by two goals. In Canada, {{much of the}} country enjoyed an unofficial 'half a day' holiday, with many students in Toronto being sent home the afternoon of the game (which began at 1pm Eastern Time), while many others watched the game at work or school. In Montreal's Central Station, 5,000 fans gathered around ten TV sets to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> which was simulcast in English on CBC Television and CTV, and in French by Radio-Canada. Until the men's hockey gold-medal game of the 2010 Winter Olympics, it was the most-watched sporting event in the history of Canadian television.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, around 6,000 {{police were}} on duty {{to prevent a}} repeat of the 2008 UEFA Cup Final riots a week earlier, but police {{reported}} that none of the 40,000 visiting fans were arrested, due in part to public safety measures such as a ban on public drinking and no large screens being set up for members of the public to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> outdoors. In London, violence escalated outside Fulham Broadway tube station, near Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground; police arrested 12 people on public order offences, while one man was arrested for grievous bodily harm, drink driving and dangerous driving, after he hit a 31-year-old while attempting to drive down Fulham Broadway. Five police were also believed to have been injured in the incident.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February, 20,000 spectators, a huge {{crowd for}} French rugby, {{turned out to}} <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> against Wales. Although the Welsh {{went on to win}} 0–15, with three {{converted}} tries, they were prevented from scoring in the first half. They were clearly the better team, but the French played with greater passion. Once again, while Neumeyer praised the French forwards, he singled out Guillemin for criticism, creating an imbalance in the French scrum. The Chronique de la Jeunesse, however, highlights Guillemin's dribbling with the ball. Nevertheless, for the final international match of the season against Ireland, Guillemin was dropped from the team, with approval from Reichel, although he nevertheless travelled to Cork as a replacement.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} <b>the</b> {{effects of}} <b>watching</b> a professional baseball <b>game</b> on <b>the</b> affect and subjective happiness of elders without a specific team to support. Method: Elderly Japanese (n = 16) {{were instructed to}} watch baseball games at a ballpark. They answered a questionnaire several weeks before (baseline) and, {{on the day of}} <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> before and after <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Participants’ affect and happiness were assessed using the General Affect Scale and Subjective Happiness Scale, respectively. Results: Calmness had a tendency to increase from baseline to before <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> (p =. 052). Furthermore, subjective happiness significantly increased after <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> compared with baseline (p =. 017). Discussion: Visiting a ballpark to watch a professional baseball game increased elders’ subjective happiness after they had finished watching it...|$|R

5|$|By {{the eighth}} game, the {{competition}} {{had become more}} than a battle for hockey supremacy: it was also viewed as a battle between contrasting ways of life, particularly in the Soviet Union, where success in sport was used to promote the superiority of communism over western capitalism. An estimated 50 million Soviets watched the final contest, while in Canada, offices were closed and schools suspended classes to allow students to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> on television in gymnasium assemblies. The two teams ended the first period tied at two goals apiece, but Canada trailed at the second intermission, 5–3, and Soviet officials stated they would claim the overall victory if the game ended in a draw {{as a result of}} scoring more goals throughout the series. Canada rallied in the third period to tie the game with seven minutes remaining.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson again moved on, {{this time}} {{accepting}} the player-manager role {{with the new}} Troy Trojans team who began {{their time in the}} National League in 1879, and would stay in that role until the team folded after the 1882 season. In 1883, he became the first manager {{in the history of the}} Philadelphia Phillies franchise, which was known at the time as the Quakers, but was relieved of command when the team won only four of its first 17games. On August 21 of that season, his Quakers traveled to Providence, Rhode Island to play the Grays. To increase ticket sales, he gave the day's pitching duty to Rhode Island native Art Hagan in hopes that Hagan's appearance would attract more locals to come <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The strategy worked, but Hagen surrendered 28 runs and the Quakers made 20 errors behind him and did not score a run. Financially sound decision as it was, a bad decision for public relations as Ferguson was labeled a sadist for not relieving Hagen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, {{have said that they}} noticed changes in him {{in the days and weeks}} prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan State University men's {{ice hockey}} team started in 1924, {{though it has}} been a varsity sport only since 1950. The team has since won {{national}} titles in 1966, 1986 and 2007. The Spartans came close to repeating the national title in 1987, but lost the championship game to the University of North Dakota. They play at MSU's Munn Ice Arena. Former head coach Ron Mason is college hockey's winningest coach with 924 wins total and 635 at MSU. The current head coach is Tom Anastos. The MSU men's ice hockey team competes in the Big Ten conference. They formerly competed in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Michigan State leads the CCHA in all-time wins, is second in CCHA Conference championships with 7, and is first in CCHA Tournament Championships with 11. Along with the University of Michigan (U-M) and the Ohio State University, it was one of three Big Ten schools in the CCHA. As with other sports, the hockey rivalry between MSU and U-M is a fierce one, and on October 6, 2001, MSU faced U-M in the Cold War, during which a world record crowd of 74,554 packed Spartan Stadium to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> end in a 3–3 tie.|$|E
5|$|Torres made a scoring {{start to}} the 2008–09 Premier League season with a 25-yard shot into the bottom {{right-hand}} corner away at Sunderland, which was the only goal in a 1–0 win on 16 August 2008. He suffered a hamstring tear in a 0–0 draw against Aston Villa, which would keep him out {{for two to three}} weeks. Torres made his return in a 2–1 victory against Marseille in the Champions League and went on to score two goals in the Merseyside derby against Everton on 27 September 2008 to give Liverpool a 2–0 win. He followed this up with another two goals the following weekend against Manchester City in a 3–2 win away at the City of Manchester Stadium as Liverpool came back from a two-goal deficit. The first of these was the thousandth Liverpool goal to be scored in the Premier League. Torres picked up a hamstring injury during a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier, meaning he was likely to miss three games for Liverpool. On 22 October 2008, Liverpool played Torres' former club Atlético in the Champions League at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, but his injury meant he missed out on the game. Atlético president Enrique Cerezo had given him a VIP invitation to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> but he declined this to continue his rehabilitation from injury in Merseyside. He was named in the FIFPro World XI team for the 2007–08 season on 27 October 2008.|$|E
25|$|Gifford and Summerall were intimately {{aware of}} the {{personality}} differences that existed between Landry and Lombardi because they had both played on the New York Giants during Landry's and Lombardi's tenure at the Giants.

25|$|The third {{test was}} far more equal, with Australia being victorious due to a 251 run {{partnership}} between Serjeant and Wood in their second innings.

25|$|It {{is likely}} that the World Series game saved many lives, as Bay Area {{residents}} who would have normally been on the freeways were at home ready to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> when the earthquake hit.
