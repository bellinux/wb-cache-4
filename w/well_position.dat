40|$|Objectives: Telomere length (TL) is {{commonly}} measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Although easier than the southern blot of terminal restriction fragments (TRF) TL measurement method, one drawback of qPCR {{is that it}} introduces greater measurement error and thus reduces the statistical power of analyses. To address a potential source of measurement error, we consider the effect of <b>well</b> <b>position</b> on qPCR TL measurements. Methods: qPCR TL data from 3, 638 people run on a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ are reanalyzed here. To evaluate measurement validity, correspondence with TRF, age and between mother and offspring are examined. Results: First, we present evidence for systematic variation in qPCR TL measurements in relation to thermocycler <b>well</b> <b>position.</b> Controlling for these well-position effects consistently improves measurement validity and yields estimated improvements in statistical power equivalent to increasing sample sizes by 16 %. We additionally evaluated the linearity {{of the relationships between}} telomere and single copy gene control amplicons and between qPCR and TRF measures. We find that, unlike some previous reports, our data exhibit linear relationships. We introduce the standard error in percent, a superior method for quantifying measurement error compared to the commonly used coefficient of variation. Using this measure, we find that excluding samples with high measurement error does not improve measurement validity. Conclusions: Future studies using block-based thermocyclers should consider <b>well</b> <b>position</b> effects. Since additional information can be gleaned from <b>well</b> <b>position</b> corrections, re-running analyses of previous results with <b>well</b> <b>position</b> correction could serve as an independent test of the validity of these results.

40|$|Abstract—A {{correlation}} {{analysis was conducted}} between forest leaf area index (LAI) and two red edge parameters: red edge position (REP) and red <b>well</b> <b>position</b> (RWP), extracted from reflectance image retrieved from Hyperion data. Field spectrometer data and LAI measurements were collected within {{two days after the}} Earth Observing One satellite passed over the study site in the Patagonia region of Argentina. The two red edge parameters were extracted with four approaches: four-point interpolation, polynomial fitting, Lagrangian technique, and inverted-Gaussian (IG) modeling. Experimental results indicate that the four-point approach is the most practical and suitable method for extracting the two red edge parameters from Hyperion data because only four bands and a simple interpolation computation are needed. The polynomial fitting approach is a direct method and has its practical value if hyperspectral data are available. However, it requires more computation time. The Lagrangian method is applicable only if the first derivative spectra are available; thus, it is not suitable to multispectral remote sensing. The IG approach needs further testing and refinement for Hyperion data. Index Terms—Hyperion, leaf area index, red edge position, red <b>well</b> <b>position.</b> I...|$|E

Either pressure-transient analysis or rate-transient analysis may be affected by a linear flow regime.

This paper presents the governing equations used for rate-transient analysis in elongated systems and provides examples using the conventional analysis.

Systematic and proper studies of unknown {{civil engineering structure}} evaluation particularly on tube well depth was rarely being established. Conventionally, camera test or string with weight approach {{has been used to}} evaluate unknown tube well depth thus exposed to several restriction due to its expensive and time consuming. Hence, this study focused on evaluation of unknown tube well depth using indirect test with particular reference to electrical resistivity method (ERM). A single spread line of electrical resistivity survey was performed using ABEM SAS 4000 equipment set based on Wenner and Pole-dipole array in line with the tube <b>well</b> <b>position.</b> Electrical resistivity raw data was processed using RES 2 DINV software producing electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) of the subsurface profile studied. Then, electrical resistivity value (ERV) obtained from RES 2 DINV analyses (ERT) was extracted and analysed using plotted graph (depth versus ERV) specifically at tube <b>well</b> <b>position</b> based on electrical resistivity spread line performed. It was found that both array have shown some good similarity results in term of tube well depth (20 m) thus able to verify the result interpreted. Both array have shown some good similarity of ERV representing groundwater (ERV = 10 – 100 Ωm) and soil with water (ERV > 100 Ωm) at depth of 0 – 20 m and > 20 m respectively. All those interpretation have shown good agreement based on verification thru established ERV of earth materials references, geological map and nearest available boreholes data. Hence, this study has shown that the application of ERM was applicable in evaluation of unknown tube well depth which efficient in term of cost, time and environmental sustainable...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has two aims. First, to {{investigate}} the importance of incorporating the multiphase flow properties of faults into production simulation models.

The differences depend on drive mechanism, <b>well</b> <b>position,</b> and the capillary pressure distribution along the fault as well on the parameters that need to be modelled (e. g. bottom-hole pressures, hydrocarbon production rates, water cuts, etc.).
