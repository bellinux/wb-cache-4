Burton (R-KS) {{following}} his conviction for compensated representation of a party in a proceeding in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States was interested: Burton v. United States, 196 U.S. 283 (1905) and Burton v. United States, 202 U.S. 344 (1906). Burton was convicted of acting as counsel to Rialto Grain and Securities Company in the United States Postmaster General's investigation of Rialto for mail fraud.|$|E
5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, forcing {{a series of}} controversial negotiations, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, American {{historian}} Sahr Conway-Lanz reported {{his discovery}} of a declassified document at the National Archives, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Ambassador to Korea in 1950, John J.

Pressed by the South Korean government, the Pentagon eventually acknowledged that it deliberately omitted the Muccio letter from its 2001 report.|$|E
5|$|In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush {{referred}} to an {{axis of evil}} including Iraq, Iran and North Korea. After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States military and a small international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as {{being part of the}} War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.|$|E

The request was entirely optional, but as the captain was preoccupied with the details of the upcoming sortie to Cuba he gave the letter little attention and instead referred the matter to his operations officer, Commander John R. Millett, who in turn referred the letter to the ship's navigator, Lieutenant Commander Frank G. Morris.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Ricans {{have participated}} {{in many of the}} {{military}} conflicts in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States has been involved. For example, they participated in the American Revolution, when volunteers from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de Gálvez (1746–1786), and have continued to participate up to the present-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Puerto Rico became a U.S. Territory after the 1898 Treaty of Paris which ended the Spanish–American War. The United States appointed a military governor and soon the United States Army established itself in San Juan.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield {{became one}} of the main centres for trade union {{organisation}} and agitation in the UK. By the 1860s, the growing conflict between capital and labour provoked the so-called 'Sheffield Outrages', which culminated in a series of explosions and murders carried out by union militants. The Sheffield Trades Council organised a meeting in Sheffield in 1866 at <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom Alliance of Organised Trades—a forerunner of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)—was founded.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission and}} purpose of the Army and Navy Union are to bind {{together}} in fraternal comradeship all comrades, shipmates, soldiers, sailors and marines, regular and volunteers, veterans of all wars in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States has been or may be engaged in. Besides patriotic, other purposes for the organization are for history and genealogy records. The main goal of the organization is to fraternally join all these veterans in a common semi-military group with similar backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Although other {{contemporary}} vessels {{like the}} American North Carolina-class battleships carried 40.6cm main guns, the Bismarcks used 38-cm naval guns as the Germans had experience with them; a 40.6cm weapon {{would have had}} to have been designed from scratch. Bismarck was also authorized prior to the breakdown of the London Naval Treaty and the invocation of the 45,000-ton, 406mm main gun escalator clause (<b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States did invoke with the North Carolinas); building 40.6cm battleships would doubtless have seemed provocative, especially to the United Kingdom. As it was, the 38cm main battery of the Bismarck class compared well to their contemporaries, out-ranging most of the 38cm and 40.6cm guns of contemporary navies (with the exception of the Italian 38.1cm and French 38cm guns, of which the Italian gun suffered from exceptional bore erosion and the French gun from unusually poor accuracy).|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Europeans began {{settling}} the land {{east of the}} Mississippi River that was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase after negotiations in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States was represented by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return for the right to the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Mississippi state line.|$|E
