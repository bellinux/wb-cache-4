25|$|As {{applause and}} cheering begins, the President slowly <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Speaker's rostrum, {{followed}} {{by members of}} his Congressional escort committee. The President's approach is slowed by pausing to shake hands, hug, kiss, and autograph copies of his speech for Members of Congress. After he takes his place at the House Clerk's desk, he hands two manila envelopes, previously placed {{on the desk and}} containing copies of the speech, to the Speaker and Vice President.|$|E
25|$|Kate and Sawyer {{travel to}} Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, {{to the site}} of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes his eyes as he dies.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> jail.|$|E

500|$|In the Fortress of Regrets, The Nameless One {{encounters}} {{three of}} his past incarnations: one practical, one good, and one paranoid. The Nameless One learns that the [...] "good" [...] incarnation is the original, who was made immortal by Ravel. The Nameless One had committed immeasurably terrible deeds in his lifetime, and when he realized there would be retribution on his soul when he died, he sought to postpone death {{as long as possible}} in order to atone. After meeting his past incarnations, The Nameless One confronts his mortality, which is embodied as a powerful being called The Transcendent One. The Transcendent One reveals that since being separated from The Nameless One, he has enjoyed his freedom and has been attempting to erase clues that might lead The Nameless One to discover the truth. Depending on the player's choice, The Nameless One either slays his mortality or convinces it to rejoin with him; either option finally ends his immortality and allows him to die. In the game's final scene, The Nameless One awakens near a battleground of the eternal Blood War between demons and devils; he picks up a mace and <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> conflict.|$|E
2500|$|In non-muscle cells, to be a {{track for}} cargo {{transport}} myosins (nonconventional myosins) such as myosin V and VI. [...] Nonconventional myosins use ATP hydrolysis to transport cargo, such as vesicles and organelles, in a directed fashion {{much faster than}} diffusion. [...] Myosin V walks towards the barbed end of actin filaments, while myosin VI <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pointed end. [...] Most actin filaments are arranged with the barbed end toward the cellular membrane and the pointed end toward the cellular interior. [...] This arrangement allows myosin V {{to be an effective}} motor for the export of cargos, and myosin VI to be an effective motor for import.|$|E

50|$|Setting down {{close to}} the mother ship, they finds the surface is {{blanketed}} in a dense mist which reduces visibility to mere metres. Here, the true purpose of the abduction is revealedâ€”unable to navigate the terrain outside, it needs Koenig to board the larger ship and retrieve the fuel core. Brian believes it is immortal; its goal is to roam the universe forever. The mother ship carries enough nuclear fuel to last a billion years. Helena will remain aboard Swift to insure Koenig's cooperation. Clad in protective gear, the Commander <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> other craft.|$|E

50|$|The next morning, {{they wake}} to find Magus {{standing}} over them, chastising {{them for their}} disobedience. Koenig demands to be told {{the truth about the}} life-forms seen last night. Magus evades the question, citing their acts of defiance as ingratitude. When Koenig rebuts He has taken away their free will, Magus scoffs that 'free-will' is a narcissistic illusion. Rebelling, Koenig <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> boundaryâ€”but is repelled by a powerful force-field. This is for their protection, Magus proclaims; though He can ill-afford the energy, it will remain up as long as they continue to act like children.|$|E

She wears a bright, yellow sweater, in fact, all of the girls are now wearing colorful sweaters and bright pants, as the setting is now the 1980s with Na-mi (Shim Eun-kyung) as a teenager.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the film's special effects were cheaply and efficiently produced using practical and in-camera effects. Early in the film, for example, de Ravin <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> camera out of a tunnel as a garbage bag floats downstream and engulfs the camera, transitioning to Joseph Gordon-Levitt back in his character's bedroom. To achieve this, the desired effect was filmed in reverse order. The garbage bag began over the camera and was pulled away during filming, as de Ravin walked backwards into the tunnel. This footage was then cut into {{a scene in which}} a garbage bag was simply pulled over Gordon-Levitt's head.|$|E
