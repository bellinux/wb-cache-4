2500|$|Gingrich {{has called}} for a {{stronger}} foreign policy, {{along the lines of the}} [...] "Reagan model" [...] of toughness", having been critical of the [...] "weakness" [...] of recent administrations' policies. In 2006 Gingrich criticized George W. Bush's stance toward North Korea and Iran, stating that it was [...] "a form of appeasement". He said, [...] "We have accepted the lawyer-diplomatic fantasy that talking while North Korea builds bombs and missiles while the Iranians build bombs and missiles is progress." [...] He has also severely criticized the foreign policy of President Obama for being too weak. Gingrich singled out Obama's responses to terrorism, North Korea, and Iran as particularly problematic. On North Korea he said, [...] "There was amazing symbolism in North Korea deciding to launch a missile the very day President Obama was speaking to Europeans about his fantasy of nuclear disarmament. The West has talked with North Korea for over 15 years and they just keep building nuclear weapons and missiles. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with the Iranians for a decade and they continue to build nuclear capability and missiles." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Not this time, my dear. He is coming, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> you over. Ave, {{you have}} a very young doctor, and rather too much interested.' ...|$|E
60|$|While <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking,</b> Minna <b>had</b> {{walked to}} the window, and had {{remained}} there looking out. She suddenly turned round as her mother spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't that Reuben Camp, now, {{over there}} by that house?" [...] she asked, as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> of him; {{that is another}} way some women have.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why I {{mentioned}} Mr. Smethurst," [...] she said, [...] "it <b>was</b> because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> of Ogden. Don't {{you think}} his treatment would be just what Ogden needs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of all {{the strange}} {{incidents}} and feelings that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> over this day,' said Eva, 'there {{seems to me}} but one result; and that is, sadness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dare one suggest," [...] he said, [...] "that some of {{the things}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about are among the old things that turn out not to be old?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still {{it seems}} so odd that Eleanor should not have known of it, seeing that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> of nothing else for the last week," [...] said Mrs. Grantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "These fellows have {{a passion}} for shovelling which they inherit from their father," [...] he added, with a twinkle of the eye that told Mrs. Kate what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about.|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith, I own it, sir!" [...] {{says the}} chaplain. [...] "It was mea culpa, mea maxima--no, mea minima culpa, only the {{rehearsal}} {{of an old}} game at piquet, which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not worth}} ten cents," [...] said Aaron, with {{something}} like a frown on his brow. [...] "But as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about the bridge, I thought Miss Susan would accept it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the {{interest}} of our conversation," [...] she whispered, [...] "we have not given a thought to the place <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> in. Do you think the Minister has heard us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Fore God, I knew it!" [...] {{cried the}} Duke of Orleans {{in a voice}} of fury. [...] "Whilst <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> they have slipped through our fingers. Did I not warn you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR PETER. Now, my good Friend--oblige me I Intreat you--before Charles comes--let me conceal myself somewhere--Then do you tax {{him on the}} Point <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> on--and {{his answers}} may satisfy me at once.-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Pogovarjali smo se, bilo je zelo zanimivo, potem pa je Luka nenadoma rekel [...] - [...] ugane≈° kaj? (<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking,</b> it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> very interesting, {{but then}} Luka {{suddenly}} said [...] - [...] guess what?) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth," [...] she confided, [...] "I am not very fond of being seen upon the streets. You know how marvelously clever dad is; still <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> about once or twice, {{and there are several}} people whom I shouldn't care about meeting." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> reached {{our house}} in Baker Street while <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking.</b> Holmes ascended the stair first, and {{as he opened the}} door of our room he gave a start of surprise. Looking over his shoulder, I was equally astonished. His brother Mycroft was sitting smoking in the arm-chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I pity her for {{her loss}} as well as hate her. Now, let us talk of {{something}} else, or my tell-tale face will betray that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> of him, when we meet Adam." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mara {{turned to}} Miss Roxy, {{and gave her}} a look of {{peculiar}} meaning. [...] "Aunt Roxy," [...] she said, [...] "you must tell them what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about to-day;" [...] and then she went up to her room and shut the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{think we}} are ready," [...] Jeanne said. [...] "Of course <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> it over for weeks, and agreed {{it was better to}} be in {{readiness}} whenever you told us it was time to go. Louise will tell you all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you mean by 'better,'" [...] {{retorted}} Ralph, grinning. [...] "I'm wiser, that's all." [...] (<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about the ethics of business when Perry had switched off to Ham.) [...] "I believe, at least, in restraint of trade. Ham doesn't believe in restraint of any kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but my dear Handel," [...] Herbert went on, as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking,</b> {{instead of}} silent, [...] "its <b>having</b> <b>been</b> so {{strongly}} {{rooted in the}} breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very serious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of what she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may lead to miserable things." ...|$|R
60|$|Before I could reply, babel broke loose. While <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking,</b> White <b>had</b> injudiciously {{turned the}} key of Glossop's {{classroom}} which now disgorged its occupants, headed by my colleague, in a turbulent stream. At the same moment my own classroom began to empty itself. The hall was packed with boys, and the din became deafening. Every one had something to say, and they all said it at once.|$|R
6000|$|... 'G. S. [...] "Bishop, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> {{together}} {{about your}} buying some land here, near your present place, {{where we all}} can live together, where we can let the people see what our mode of life is, what our customs are, which we have learnt from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{have you}} signed that? Thank you, my dear. By Jove! I must be off; I shall be late as it is. I may rely upon your {{discretion}} {{as to what}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about, may I not? but I thought it as well {{to let you know}} how the land lay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think he's all right," [...] the man said, at last. [...] "At {{any rate}} here he is, and he's {{not likely to}} go out again. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> of getting a black fellow, for some time; and as here is one ready to hand, we may as well {{make the best of}} him.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{constantly}} <b>talking</b> of {{the terrible}} Regent's Park accident. I hope and believe that nearly {{the worst of it}} is now known.|$|R
60|$|It {{was close}} on six o'clock when our third visitor {{of the day}} arrived. We {{were sitting on the}} afterdeck in the cool of the evening--old Marshall, Denman Sturgis, Mrs. Vanderley, Stella, George, and I--when he came up. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> of George, and old Marshall was {{suggesting}} the advisability of sending out search-parties. He was worried. So was Stella Vanderley. So, for that matter, were George and I, only not for the same reason.|$|R
6000|$|We talked late {{enough to}} have horrified my mother, but I did not leave him till he was {{sleeping}} like a child, nor did he wake till I was leaving {{the room at the}} sound of the bell. It was alleged that it was the first time in his life that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> late for prayers. [...] Mr. Castleford said he was very glad, and my mother, looking severely at me, said she knew <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> all night, and then went off to satisfy herself whether he ought to be getting up.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was some}} time after this that Mrs. Easterfield was calm enough {{to stop the flow}} of {{exciting}} conversation and to say to Olive, taking both her hands tenderly within her own: [...] "My dear, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> a great deal of sentiment, and now I want seriously to speak to you on a matter of business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sincerely}} trust not, Myra, but I {{own that}} I am afraid of it. She is breathing faster than she did, {{and she has}} moved restlessly several times while <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking,</b> and has a patch of colour on each cheek, which looks like fever. However, we must hope for the best. Anyhow, I shall bring Dinah up here if possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' Owen {{returned}} with assumed carelessness, 'I do know it. I think {{the cause of}} it is that mysterious pain which comes just above my ankle sometimes. You remember the first time I had it? That day we went by steam-packet to Lulstead Cove, when it hindered me from coming back to you, and compelled me to sleep with the gateman <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{long time}} before she spoke again, and then she didn't say {{anything}} about what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> of, but began to ask whether I thought we were sure to find the soldiers still at the fort. In course I couldn't say for sartin, but, to cheer her up, I talked hopeful about it, though I thought it was likely enough they had fallen back on the settlements. I did some long spells of running now, and got more hopeful, for the Injins didn't gain anything to speak of.|$|R
6000|$|... "John, my dear!" [...] said Lady Holmhurst, [...] "I want to {{introduce}} you to Miss Smithers--the Miss Smithers whom <b>we</b> <b>have</b> all <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about, and whose book you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reading. Miss Smithers, my husband!" ...|$|R
60|$|While <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> the cannonading ceased gradually, until by {{the time}} Pierre was done with his efforts to soothe me, {{comparative}} silence prevailed. Straightway we lads forgot all else in the desire to know what <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done; whether our people had retreated, or if the Britishers had fallen back, and I was {{on the point of}} proposing that I go out {{to get an idea of}} the situation when the door suddenly opened, and to our great surprise and delight the Jerseyman flung himself headlong into the room, as if he had run until so exhausted that he could no longer remain on his feet.|$|R
