25|$|From 1940–65, the University of Miami {{baseball}} team played their games at {{a field in}} {{the southwest corner of}} the block where the stadium sat. The diamond and a small covered seating <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> corner, with the center field fence running along the periphery of the football stadium's outer concourse, and the right field fence bordering a driveway leading up the big stadium. There was also a softball field to the east across the driveway—during football season, the baseball and softball fields were both used for parking. The Hurricanes opened a new ballpark in 1973, and Miami Field's small seating area was demolished, with the land occupied by the two fields reconfigured into full-time parking areas.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1830s, the U.S. Navy sought wind and current {{information}} for {{areas of the}} oceans outside the trade routes regularly traveled by merchant ships. The principal mariners who ventured away from the main trade routes were whalers. One of the U.S.'s first oceanographers, Naval Captain Matthew Fontaine Maury, entered into an agreement with deal with the American pelagic whalers. If they provided him with their logbooks, from which he could extract wind and current information, he would in return prepare maps for them showing where whales were most concentrated. Between 1840 and 1843, Maury and his staff processed over 2,000 whaling logbooks and produced not only the famous Wind and Current Charts used by mariners for over a century, but also a series of Whale Charts. The most detailed showed by month and 5° of latitude and longitude: (a) {{the number of days}} on which whaling ships <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> sector; (b) the number of days on which they saw right whales; and (c) the number of days on which the saw sperm whales. In the North Pacific, these charts summarize more than 8,000 days on which the whalers encountered right whales and the searching effort by month and sector. The maps thus provide a crude measure of the relative abundance of right whales by geographic sector and month, controlled for the very non-random searching effort of the whalers.|$|E
25|$|Rosenqvist {{tried again}} at passing Verstappen {{entering}} Lisboa corner but the latter again held his position. Auer upfront was now holding a two-second {{advantage over the}} rest of the field, with the hope that no accidents would occur that would necessitate the safety car's deployment. However this would not happen as on the fourth lap, Verstappen lost control of his vehicle under braking in the Solitude Esses and broke his front-left suspension in an impact with the wall. This caused his wheel to dangle off the car along with him sustaining a rear-left puncture. Verstappen lost all turning room while attempting to get round the Melco hairpin but returned to the pit lane and into retirement. In the group behind Latifi was overtaken by King while Coletti was being caught by Fuoco and Serrallés. The safety car was required on the same lap when MacLeod crashed and blocked half the track at Paiol corner since no recovery cranes <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> area of the track. Confusion was created under the safety car as it did not pick up race leader Auer but Goddard instead. Gelael returned to the pit lane to stop him impeding other drivers and retired. The safety car drove into the pit lane on lap seven and racing resumed with Auer leading Rosenqvist.|$|E

However, bad [...] weather, in the form of thick fog, prevented the ferry from reaching French shores, and it had to be anchored a few miles away to wait for the fog to lift. This location made the vessel an easy target for German bombing (at that time, one vessel out of four had suffered bombing), and the team members remained at full readiness to evacuate the vessel at short notice. The women's group stayed on deck in the open for forty-eight continuous hours.

Two other ships <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> convoy, and the three ships brought 300 new settlers to Jamestown, going first to the Caribbean islands of Dominica and Nevis.

The first draft had a strong story to it, but Yamaguchi felt that because the story needed too much explanation to understand abandoned these plans.

While Yamaguchi was struggling with the song's lyrics, Sakanaction's manager gave them the news that one of their songs would be used for the theme song of the drama Dinner. As he was struggling to find a lyrical theme for the song, Yamaguchi read the screenplays for the first three episodes of the drama; finding professionalism to be an overarching theme to the work. Instead of relating the song to the drama's cooking-focused theme, Yamaguchi decided to write the song about his own professionalism, from his perspective as a musician.|$|E
