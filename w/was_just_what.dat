Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of the old ways. The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

25|$|Several {{years of}} peace {{followed}} as the Ottomans carefully planned their response. But their secret training manoeuvres were observed by Iranian spies. Abbas learnt that the Ottoman {{plan was to}} invade Iran via Azerbaijan, take Tabriz {{then move on to}} Ardabil and Qazvin, which they could use as bargaining chips in exchange for other territories. The shah decided to lay a trap. He would allow the Ottomans to enter the country, then destroy them. He had Tabriz evacuated of its inhabitants while he waited at Ardabil with his army. In 1618, an Ottoman army of 100,000 led by the grand vizier, invaded and easily seized Tabriz. The vizier sent an ambassador to the shah demanding he make peace and return the lands taken since 1602. Abbas refused and pretended he was ready to set fire to Ardabil and retreat further inland rather than face the Ottoman army. When the Turkish vizier heard the news, he decided to march on Ardabil right away. This <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> Abbas wanted.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 February 1952, Ian Fleming started writing what would become his first book, Casino Royale, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica.

500|$|The Postman Always Rings Twice {{became a}} major box office success, which {{prompted}} the studio to take more risks on Turner, casting her outside of the glamorous sex symbol roles {{she had come to}} be known for. In August 1946, it was announced Turner was set to replace Katharine Hepburn in the big-budgeted historical drama Green Dolphin Street (1947), a role for which she darkened her hair and lost 15 pounds. It was Carey Wilson who insisted on casting Turner based on her performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice. Turner later recalled she was surprised about replacing Hepburn, saying: [...] "I'm about the most un-Hepburnish actress on the lot. But it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> I wanted to do." [...] It was her first starring role that did not center on her looks. In an interview, Turner said: [...] "I even go running around in the jungles of New Zealand in a dress that's filthy and ragged.

500|$|The album's opening track, the Al Green-styled [...] "Thinking of You", was {{one that}} the group {{conceived}} and recorded together at 3 a.m. in Saadiq's Pookie Labs studio.

Music, [...] "they didn't want anybody playing favorites, so one of my songs had to come off." [...] The recording was a moody blues piece with surrealistic lyrics about lust, longing, and a fictitious blind man's secret powers. Saadiq wanted to show [...] "a darker side... some depth" [...] to listeners with the song. [...] "To me songs like 'Blind Man,' make the whole sound, the House of Music", he remarked.
