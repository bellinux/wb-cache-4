5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E

According to her counsel, Bokhary failed to find peace or satisfaction in her personal and professional life after returning to Hong Kong from Britain, and in 2007 was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, for which she <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> with strong psychotropic drugs and was reportedly undergoing intensive counselling. Her increasing alcohol consumption, combined with her medication, was said to have contributed to her violent outburst in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Goebel lost a close {{election}} to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, {{the election results}} were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant {{as he entered the}} state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.|$|E
5|$|Olivia and Peter learn Greg <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> for a sleep disorder, {{and that}} his dreams had {{involved}} demons until they stopped several months ago. Another hallucinating victim turns up in Seattle and dies. The Fringe team discover that both victims had a brain–computer interface chip attached to their thalamus, {{the part of the}} brain controlling dreams. Broyles (Lance Reddick) and Nina (Blair Brown) reveal new information leading to the sleep researcher Dr. Nayak (Ravi Kapoor) who implanted the chips. Another victim named Diana (Jovanna Huguet) hallucinates at a restaurant and kills a coworker before similarly dying of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the crash, Onassis's father and {{stepmother}} arrived from New York at the hospital where Onassis <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated.</b> The couple were accompanied by an American neurosurgeon. Onassis's mother arrived from Switzerland with her husband, Stavros Niarchos. Aristotle had also flown the English neurosurgeon Alan Richardson from London to Athens, but Richardson later told Onassis that Alexander had no chance of surviving his injuries. Aristotle Onassis considered having his son's body cryogenically frozen with the Life Extension Society, but was persuaded against it, and it was embalmed by Desmond Henley. Alexander Onassis was buried next to the chapel on his father's private Ionian island of Skorpios.|$|E

5|$|The summer {{transfer}} {{window at}} Real Sociedad saw {{the arrival of}} Alonso's childhood friend Mikel Arteta. Arteta was ecstatic {{at the prospect of}} partnering Alonso in midfield but his excitement was short lived. Alonso was not picked for Real Sociedad's pre-season friendlies, signalling that an offer by Liverpool <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> seriously. The Basque side announced on 20 August 2004 that they had made a deal worth £10.7million with Liverpool and Alonso had agreed terms with the Merseyside team. Alonso did not lament the fact that a move to Real Madrid had not materialised. Instead, he concentrated on integrating with the new Spanish contingent at Liverpool under the guidance of former Valencia manager Rafael Benítez.|$|E
5|$|At the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in Kazan, Brazil {{finished}} 4th in the Men's 4 × 100 metre freestyle, in a relay {{composed by}} Bruno Fratus, Marcelo Chierighini, Matheus Santana and João de Lucca. César Cielo didn't {{swim in the}} final – despite being {{a participant in the}} championship, he was suffering with shoulder pain. According to the doctor of the Brazilian Aquatic Sports Confederation (CBDA), Gustavo Magliocca, Cielo had an inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon. The injury is considered common in the athletes, and it <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> with physiotherapy. Due to the problem, in the Men's 50 metre butterfly, Cielo struggled though the heats and the semifinals, but slumped to 6th in the final. On August 5, Cielo left the competition due to the increase of his injury.|$|E
5|$|By late April, {{the war was}} {{effectively}} over. On 1 May 1945, Galland attempted {{to make contact with}} United States Army forces to negotiate the surrender of his unit. The act itself was dangerous. SS forces roamed the countryside and towns executing anyone who was considering capitulation. The Americans requested that Galland fly his unit and Me 262s to a USAAF controlled airfield. Galland declined citing poor weather and technical problems. In reality, Galland was not going to hand over Me 262 jets to the Americans. Galland had harboured the belief that the Western Alliance would soon be at war with the Soviet Union, and he wanted to join American forces and to use his unit in the coming war to free Germany from Communist occupation. Galland replied, making his whereabouts known to the Americans, and offering his surrender once they arrived at the Tegernsee hospital where he <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated.</b> Galland then ordered his unit, which had then moved to Salzburg and Innsbruck, to destroy their Me 262s. At the time of his surrender, Galland had filed claims for 104 Allied aircraft shot down. His claims included seven with the Me 262.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people in}} Halifax at first {{believed}} the explosion {{to be the}} result of a German attack. The Halifax Herald continued to propagate this belief for some time, for example reporting that Germans had mocked victims of the explosion. While John Johansen, the Norwegian helmsman of Imo, <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> for serious injuries sustained during the explosion, it was reported to the military police that he had been behaving suspiciously. Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person, supposedly written in German. It turned out that the letter was actually written in Norwegian. Immediately following the explosion, most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned. Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause of the explosion became known, although rumours of German involvement persisted.|$|E
5|$|The onslaught {{prompted}} Yardley to {{take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his pacemen. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Cranston's bowling, but sliced {{it in the air}} to point. Yardley dived forward and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202halfway to the required totalwith 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. England began to become demoralised and their fielding continued to deteriorate. Bradman hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken while Bradman <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated,</b> and Morris had to shield his captain from the strike until the pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated.</b> Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E
