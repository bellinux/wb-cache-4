5|$|In late antiquity, {{historic}} accounts {{become much}} more diffuse, and the Iazyges generally cease to be mentioned as a tribe. In the late 4thcentury, two Sarmatian peoples were mentioned, the Argaragantes and the Limigantes, who lived {{on opposite sides of}} the Tisza river. One theory is that these two tribes were formed when the Iazyges were conquered by the Roxolani, with the Iazyges becoming the Limigantes, and the Roxolani becoming the Argaragantes. Another theory is that a group of Slavic tribesmen gradually migrated into the area, subservient to the Iazyges, and the Iazyges became known as the Argaragantes, and the Slavs were the Limigantes. Regardless of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> in the 5th century both of them were conquered by the Goths, and, by the time of Attila, they were absorbed into the Huns.|$|E

However, Newton extends his theorem to an arbitrary central forces F(r) by restricting his attention to orbits that are nearly circular, such as ellipses with low orbital eccentricity (ε ≤ 0.1), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> of seven of the eight planetary orbits in the solar system. Newton also applied his theorem to the planet Mercury, which has an eccentricity ε of roughly 0.21, and suggested that it may pertain to Halley's comet, whose orbit has an eccentricity of roughly 0.97.|$|E

Thredson believes Kit could not function in society while secretly being married to a black woman. The killer skinned all of his victims, even Alma, so all would look the same in death.

Erika acts boldly and actively pursues her career as a writer. Hilde believes the only reason Erika wishes to come home is to get information for her book, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> Hilde is angry at her daughter for forcing her to relive her past experiences; her childhood was full of poverty, loneliness, and shame.

25|$|The {{promotion}} {{rules of}} dai shogi {{may have changed}} significantly over time. The promotion rules in the earlier Heian shogi and Heian dai shogi provide for all weak stepping pieces to promote to the gold general, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for sho shogi and modern shogi. However, in chu shogi many of these pieces have changed promotions to ranging pieces in the initial setup. Dai shogi has a mixture of these rules: the weak steppers or limited rangers unique to dai shogi all promote to the gold general, but those present in chu shogi keep their promotion from the latter game. It is likely that these differing promotions in chu shogi are a later historical innovation, that was later copied back into dai shogi when chu shogi became more popular than dai shogi.|$|E

40|$|Cantor’s {{theory of}} {{cardinality}} violates common sense. It says, for example, that all infinite sets of integers {{are the same}} size. This thesis criticizes the arguments for Cantor’s theory and presents an alternative. The alternative {{is based on a}} general theory, CS (for Class Size). CS consists of all sentences in the first order language with a subset predicate and a less-than predicate <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>true</b> in all interpretations of that language whose domain is a finite power set. Thus, CS says that less than is a linear ordering with highest and lowest members and that every set is larger than any of its proper subsets. Because the language of CS is so restricted, CS will have infinite interpretations. In particular, the notion of one-one correspondence cannot be expressed in this language, so Cantor’s definition of similarity will not be in CS, even though it <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for all finite sets. We show that CS is decidable but not finitely axiomatizable by characterizing the complete extensions of CS. CS has finite completions, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>true</b> only in finite models and infinite completions, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>true</b> only in infinite models...|$|R
