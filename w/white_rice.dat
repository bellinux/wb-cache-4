5|$|Waraq Dawali (stuffed grape leaves), is a mahshi meal {{reserved}} for large gatherings. The grape leaves are normally wrapped around minced meat, <b>white</b> <b>rice</b> and diced tomatoes, however meat {{is not always}} used. Dawali is an excellent representation of the attention to detail commonly found in Palestinian and Levant cuisine, with each piece being tightly wrapped {{to the size of}} cigarette morsels (some families differ in their structure).It is then cooked and served as dozens of rolls on a large plate usually accompanied by boiled potato slices, carrots and lamb pieces. Kousa mahshi are zucchinis stuffed with the same ingredients as waraq al-'ainib and usually served alongside it heavy meals. If made with a large number of zucchinis as well as dawali it is known as waraq al-'ainib wa kousa.|$|E
25|$|Either by hand or in a rice polisher, <b>white</b> <b>rice</b> may be buffed with glucose or talc powder (often called {{polished}} rice, {{though this}} term may also refer to <b>white</b> <b>rice</b> in general), parboiled, or processed into flour. <b>White</b> <b>rice</b> {{may also be}} enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.|$|E
25|$|The {{seeds of}} the rice plant are first milled using a rice huller to remove the chaff (the outer husks of the grain). At {{this point in the}} process, the product is called brown rice. The milling may be continued, {{removing}} the bran, i.e., the rest of the husk and the germ, thereby creating <b>white</b> <b>rice.</b> <b>White</b> <b>rice,</b> which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the disease beriberi.|$|E

25|$|Rice {{is used to}} make {{a number}} of items, outside of the {{traditional}} bowl of plain <b>white</b> <b>rice.</b> It is commonly ground into a flour and used to make rice cakes called tteok in over two hundred varieties. It is also cooked down into a congee (juk), or gruel (mieum) and mixed with other grains, meat, or seafood. Koreans also produce a number of rice wines, both in filtered and unfiltered versions.|$|E
25|$|At times, Don Eleuterio {{has been}} accused of mistreating his son, {{particularly}} because he never changes the family diet; since the only decent cooking recipe Eleuterio knows was the one he learned as attendant of a mess hall while in the Army (and since cooking anything more extravagant would be, in his view, effeminate), he feeds his son steamed <b>white</b> <b>rice,</b> mashed potatoes and canned corn every single day (and sometimes for both lunch and dinner).|$|E
25|$|Pho {{is served}} in a bowl with a {{specific}} cut of <b>white</b> <b>rice</b> noodles in clear beef broth, with thin cuts of beef (steak, fatty flank, lean flank, brisket). Variations feature tendon, tripe, or meatballs in southern Vietnam. Chicken pho is made using the same spices as beef, but the broth is made using only chicken bones and meat, {{as well as some}} internal organs of the chicken, such as the heart, the undeveloped eggs and the gizzard.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{now known}} that {{flavonoid}} and anthocyanin compounds {{are closely related to}} the antioxidation properties of black rice (Zhanget al[...], 2005). Oki et al. (2005) found that the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity is higher in red rices than in black and <b>white</b> <b>rices,</b> and that this activity is correlated with polyphenols and proanthocyanidin content. Considering that the highest scavenging activity due to the presence of polyphenols is in red rices than in black and <b>white</b> <b>rices</b> (Oki et al[...], 2005), red rices could once again find favour with health-conscious consumers. It is high time that people in India took a fresh look at similar properties in the vast pool of indigenous red rices. There is also a dire need for clinical validation of the medicinal value of red rices reported in ancient literature, and for research on food preparations such as poha (flake rice), noodles, and sewai (vermicelli) from red rices.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Kanehiro Takaki {{observed}} that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted {{almost entirely of}} <b>white</b> <b>rice)</b> developed beriberi (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease, (not because of the increased protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts per million of thiamine to the diet, later understood as a cure).|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Eugen Baumann {{observed}} iodine in thyroid glands. In 1897, Christiaan Eijkman {{worked with}} natives of Java, who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of <b>white</b> <b>rice</b> developed {{the symptoms of}} beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, discovering that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B1, also known as thiamine.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{sulbutiamine}} is {{closely tied to}} the study of thiamine in Japan. A deficiency of thiamine causes a nervous system disorder called beriberi. Until the twentieth century, beriberi was prevalent in Japan and other Asian countries due to the widespread dependence on <b>white</b> <b>rice</b> as a staple food. The relationship between beriberi and diet was first noted by a navy surgeon named Takaki Kanehiro. Additional work resulted in the discovery of thiamine, which was isolated in 1926 and synthesized in 1936. The establishment of a Vitamin B Research Committee in Japan led to additional scientific investigation into the properties of thiamine and its derivatives.|$|E

25|$|Arsenic is a Group 1 carcinogen. The {{amount of}} arsenic in rice varies widely with the {{greatest}} concentration in brown rice and rice grown on land formerly used to grow cotton, such as in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. <b>White</b> <b>rice</b> grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas, which account collectively for 76 percent of American-produced rice, had higher levels of arsenic than {{other regions of the}} world studied, possibly because of past use of arsenic-based pesticides to control cotton weevils. Jasmine rice from Thailand and Basmati rice from Pakistan and India contain the least arsenic among rice varieties in one study. China has set a limit of 150 ppb for arsenic in rice.|$|E
25|$|Meals {{during the}} Japanese {{occupation}} were quite varied. Koreans usually ate two {{meals a day}} during the cold seasons, and three during the warm seasons. For the lower classes, satiety, rather than quality, was most important. Those in even lower economic levels were likely to enjoy only a single bowl of <b>white</b> <b>rice</b> each year, while {{the remainder of the}} year was filled with cheaper grains, such as millet and barley. For the Korean middle and upper classes during the occupation, things were quite different. Western foods began emerging in the Korean diet, such as white bread and commercially produced staples such as precooked noodles. The Japanese occupational period ended after the defeat of Japan during World War II.|$|E
25|$|In Mexico and Central America, {{avocados}} {{are served}} mixed with <b>white</b> <b>rice,</b> in soups, salads, {{or on the}} side of chicken and meat. In Peru, they are consumed with tequeños as mayonnaise, served as a side dish with parrillas, used in salads and sandwiches, or as a whole dish when filled with tuna, shrimp, or chicken. In Chile, it is used as a puree-like sauce with chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs; and in slices for celery or lettuce salads. The Chilean version of Caesar salad contains large slices of mature avocado. In Kenya and Nigeria, the avocado is often eaten as a fruit eaten alone or mixed with other fruits in a fruit salad, or as part of a vegetable salad.|$|E

25|$|Five meals were {{generally}} {{served in the}} royal palace each day during the Joseon period, and records suggest this pattern had existed from antiquity. Three of these meals would be full meals, while the afternoon and after dinner meals would be lighter. The first meal, mieumsang (미음상), was served at sunrise and was served only on days when {{the king and queen}} were not taking herbal medicines. The meal consisted of rice porridge (juk, 죽) made with ingredients such as abalone (jeonbokjuk), <b>white</b> <b>rice</b> (huinjuk), mushrooms (beoseotjuk), pine nuts (jatjuk), and sesame (kkaejuk). The side dishes could consist of kimchi, nabak kimchi, oysters, soy sauce, and other items. The porridge was thought to give vitality to the king and queen throughout the day.|$|E
25|$|In the Goa, Udupi and Mangalore districts, {{people usually}} eat rice ganji in a variant manner made by Kannada-speaking, Tulu-speaking or Konkani {{people in and}} around Udupi and Mangalore (Karnataka, South India). There, {{parboiled}} rice (kocheel akki in Kannada, oorpel aari for black rice, bolenta aari for <b>white</b> <b>rice</b> in Tulu or ukde tandool in Konkani) is steamed with {{a large amount of}} water. Jain ganji matt are famous in these districts. Usually, simple ganji with pickle and milk are served, in jain matts. Fresh coconut is grated, and the resulting milk skimmed and added to the ganji (called paez or pyaaz in Konkani), which is served hot with fish curry, coconut chutney, or Indian pickles. In Goa, it is normally served with dried or fresh cooked fish, papad or vegetables.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{a popular}} form, {{parboiled}} rice (also known as converted rice) {{is subjected to}} a steaming or parboiling process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, {{and the color of}} the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially thiamine) to move into the endosperm, so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular <b>white</b> <b>rice.</b> This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.|$|E
