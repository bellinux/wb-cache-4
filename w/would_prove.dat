5|$|Following {{the winter}} 2014 Sochi Olympics the Russian Federation annexed Crimea. The West responded with {{sanctions}} targeted at Putin's immediate entourage, and Bukovsky expressed {{the hope that}} this <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> {{the end of his}} regime.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon I {{embarked}} on an invasion of Russia in 1812. This war <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be the turning point in his fortunes, as the expedition failed miserably and Napoleon was forced to retreat with an army in tatters.|$|E
5|$|As the Union army retreated towards Washington, it {{paused to}} re-group at Centreville, Virginia. On August 31, 1862, Gen. Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Jackson to flank the Union right and {{to cut the}} Union army off from Washington. This {{flanking}} effort resulted in the Battle of Chantilly which <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> {{to be the most}} disastrous engagement of the entire war for the 21st Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|His {{five years}} {{coaching}} stint with the Bolts <b>would</b> <b>proved</b> to be dismal {{as he was}} unsuccessful to lead Meralco beyond the quarterfinals. Assortment of injuries to key players, and trades that hurt the team's chemistry contributed to the Bolts downfall.|$|R

5|$|Federer's {{success in}} 2008 was {{severely}} hampered by a lingering bout of mononucleosis, which {{he suffered from}} {{during the first half}} of the year. At the end of the year, he would suffer a back injury that <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be recurring throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|He {{ruptured}} his Achilles {{midway through}} the 1987–88 season and missed almost a year of first team action. Whiteside's goal in a 2–1 win over Derby County in a league match at the Baseball Ground on 10 February 1988 <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be his last for Manchester United. He was limited to just six goalless appearances in 1988–89.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, Achebe's publishers, Penguin Books, {{released}} There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra. Publication immediately {{caused a}} stir and re-opened the discussion about the Nigerian Civil War. It <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> {{to be the last}} publication during his lifetime.|$|E
50|$|Concerning Þorir's {{accusation}} of the stolen eye, Hrói {{suggested that the}} stolen eye be removed from his head, and the last eye from Þorir's head. Then the eyes would be weighed and if they weighed equally it <b>would</b> be <b>proven</b> that {{they came from the}} same head, and that Hrói had stolen Þorir's eye. If Þorir would not agree to this, he <b>would</b> be <b>proven</b> a liar in this case and in others.|$|R

50|$|As such, a proof or disproof {{of either}} of Fermat's Last Theorem or the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil {{conjecture}} <b>would</b> simultaneously <b>prove</b> or disprove the other.|$|R
5|$|In {{the decades}} that followed, the Ministerium became less {{concerned}} with {{its relationship with the}} Reformed church and saw a significant increase in Lutheran identity and the importance of the Lutheran Confessions. Thus, in 1853, the Ministerium rejoined other Lutherans in the General Synod. However, this renewed relationship <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be short-lived.|$|E
5|$|King Ottokar's Sceptre {{was first}} serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from 4 August 1938 to 10 August 1939 {{under the title}} Tintin En Syldavie ("Tintin in Syldavia"). It <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> {{to be the last}} Tintin {{adventure}} to be published in its entirety in Le Petit Vingtième. From 14 May 1939, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, Cœurs Vaillants.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} The Morning Chronicle on his supposed indecency, poor taste {{and lack of}} creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> his detractors wrong. The result was The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the war, these words <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> prophetic. No Confederate forces would bring Fort Greble under fire during its entire {{four-year}} active military career, and its garrison units, rotated regularly, served quietly behind its earthen walls.|$|E
5|$|The E-1s {{came off}} the {{production}} line in February 1938, {{in time for a}} number of these aircraft to serve in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938. The RLM thought that because the E variant could outrun enemy fighters in Spain, {{there was no need to}} upgrade the defensive weaponry, which <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be a mistake in later years.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the late}} 70s and 80s, {{many of the}} series between the West Indies and England had been {{dominated}} by the West Indies who had won fourteen of the fifteen Tests, often by large margins. The next two series in 1989–90 season and 1991 <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be closer contests.|$|E

5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place. Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered public records, that the photos are necessary to complete the journalistic record, and that the photos <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> bin Laden's death and therefore prevent conspiracy theories that bin Laden is still alive. Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, {{during which}} Bizet {{served in the}} National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera Djamileh, though an orchestral suite derived from his {{incidental}} music to Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne was instantly popular. The production of Bizet's final opera, Carmen, was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet {{was convinced that the}} work was a failure; he {{died of a heart attack}} three months later, unaware that it <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> a spectacular and enduring success.|$|E
5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean voyage without {{fresh water}} or food <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> {{difficult for a}} large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which allows them to lower their metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage and could have been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, and could have evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Hamilton's lead in the Drivers' Championship was cut down to 41 points, with Rosberg still in second place. Sebastian Vettel moved closer as well, now being 49 points behind Hamilton. Felipe Massa's {{retirement}} saw him drop from fourth to sixth in the standings, being overtaken by both Räikkönen and Bottas. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari closed the gap to leaders Mercedes, now trailing 310 to 463 points. This race <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be the only one that Lewis Hamilton did not finish in the season.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} King Poniatowski decided {{to sue for}} peace, the Polish army was still in good {{fighting}} condition, not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies. King Poniatowski thought that due to Russian numerical superiority defeat was nonetheless imminent, and more could be gained through negotiations with the Russians, with whom he hoped a new alliance could be formed. Although subsequent events <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> him wrong, {{the question of whether}} this could have been foreseen, and prevented through continued military resistance, has been subject to much debate among historians.|$|E
5|$|By November 1998, UBS's {{losses from}} its {{exposure}} to LTCM were estimated {{at the level}} of approximately CHF 790million. UBS <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF 950million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to the bailout effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E
