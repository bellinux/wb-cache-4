5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer <b>would</b> <b>no</b> longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It <b>would</b> <b>no</b> longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E

40|$|This paper entertains {{the notion}} that without their {{opposite}}s, things, and by extension, human thought would not exist. Without its opposite aspect, each thing or thought loses the condition for its existence. Without life, there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> death; without death, there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> life. Without "above", there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> "below " without "below", there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> "above". Without misfortune, there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> fortune; without fortune, there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> misfortune. Without facility, there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> difficulty, without difficulty, there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> facility. Without landlords, there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> tenants; without tenants, there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> landlords. A definition of a thing, entity or a concept necessarily implies its opposite. Reflected alongside this contradiction, education in which its definition bears transmission of knowledge cannot exclude ignorance, which implies the absence of knowledge. Without ignorance, there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> knowledge, without knowledge, there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> ignorance. It {{is the object of}} this paper to qualify ignorance as a dimension of education, hence its inclusion in the definition of education...|$|R

5|$|According to the Euro Plus Monitor Report 2013, the {{collective}} current account of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain is improving rapidly {{and is expected}} to balance by mid 2013. Thereafter these countries as a group <b>would</b> <b>no</b> longer need to import capital. In 2014, the current account surplus of the eurozone as a whole almost doubled compared to the previous year, reaching a new record high of 227.9bn Euros.|$|E
5|$|Following {{two years}} of fierce {{competition}} with British Caledonian, the second-largest airline in the United Kingdom at the time, the Government changed its aviation policy in 1976 so that the two carriers <b>would</b> <b>no</b> longer compete on long-haul routes.|$|E

5|$|His {{subsequent}} {{involvement in}} a conference promoting adolescent sexuality caused the party to announce that it <b>would</b> <b>no</b> longer publish his material. In March 1933 Freud {{told him that his}} contract with the International Psychoanalytic Publishers to publish Character Analysis had been cancelled. Sharaf writes that this was almost certainly because of Reich's stance on teenage sex.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Green {{joined with}} a group of Republican ward leaders who broke off from the main party, which was led by Sheriff Austin Meehan, to support Governor William Scranton.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to modern stage races, a cyclist {{who gave up}} during a stage was allowed to start again the next stage, although he <b>would</b> <b>no</b> longer be in contention for the general classification. Thus Hippolyte Aucouturier, who gave up during the first stage, was able to return, and won {{the second and third}} stages. Charles Laeser, winner of the fourth stage, had not completed the third stage.|$|E

"Without the Communist Party, There <b>Would</b> Be <b>No</b> New China" [...] (...) is {{a popular}} Communist {{propaganda}} song in the People's Republic of China, which originated in 1943 {{in response to the}} phrase [...] "Without Kuomintang there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> China".|$|R
60|$|His grand idea, he {{proceeded}} to say, was to write a story--the first of a series--that <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> story {{at all in the}} ordinary sense, since it <b>would</b> have <b>no</b> plot or plan or purpose of any kind. Nor would there be analysis and description--nothing to skip, in fact. The people of his brain would do nothing and say nothing--at all events there <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> dialogue. The characters would be mere faint pencil-marks--something less than shadows.|$|R

60|$|He {{drew his}} hanger; {{and for that}} instant his sun was at noon. The others held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once that they <b>would</b> get <b>no</b> support from him. He <b>would</b> keep <b>no</b> girl in the Neverland against her will.|$|R
60|$|Imagine a {{world of}} {{reasonable}} beings! The Ten Commandments <b>would</b> be unnecessary: <b>no</b> reasoning being sins, no reasoning creature makes mistakes. There <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> rich men, for what reasonable man cares for luxury and ostentation? There <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> poor: that I should eat enough for two while my brother in the next street, as good a man as I, starves, is not reasonable. There <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> difference of opinion on any two points: {{there is only one}} reason. You, dear Reader, would find, that on all subjects you were of the same opinion as I. <b>No</b> novels <b>would</b> be written, <b>no</b> plays performed; the lives of reasonable creatures do not afford drama.

5000|$|The CBO {{estimated}} that implementing other {{provisions of the}} bill <b>would</b> have <b>no</b> {{significant impact on the}} federal budget.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there <b>would</b> <b>no</b> longer be visible.|$|E
