25|$|At 7:15p.m. on September12, 1952, two brothers, Edward and Fred May, {{and their}} friend Tommy Hyer (ages 13, 12, and 10 respectively) {{witnessed}} a bright object cross the sky, {{coming to rest}} on land belonging to local farmer G. Bailey Fisher. Upon witnessing the object, the boys went {{to the home of}} the May brothers' mother, Kathleen May, where they told the story of having seen a UFO crash land in the hills. From there, Mrs. May, accompanied by the three boys, local children Neil Nunley (14) and Ronnie Shaver (10), and 17-year-old West Virginia National Guardsman Eugene Lemon, traveled to the Fisher farm in an effort to locate <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the boys had seen.|$|E
2500|$|Atkinson {{pretty much}} agreed with Hall about the {{entertainment}} value of gangsters and found little in Johnny 2X4 [...] to recommend. He {{said that the}} gangsters and illegal booze of the mid-Twenties were no longer of interest. [...] His artistry was lost on Broadway. The small details that spoke volumes in film were not noticeable on the crowded stage. The crafted bits of conversation didn't {{add up to a}} plot, and <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Brown was attempting to say was lost—as was the audience.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding then-presidential-candidate Barack Obama in an April 2, 2008, column, she {{characterized}} {{his book}} Dreams from My Father as a [...] "dimestore Mein Kampf." [...] Coulter writes, [...] "He says the reason black people keep to themselves is that it's 'easier than spending all your time mad {{or trying to}} guess <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> white folks were thinking about you.' Here's a little inside scoop about white people: We're not thinking about you. Especially WASPs. We think everybody is inferior, and we are perfectly charming about it." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{these three}} phases are complete, the {{decision-makers}} decide to either approve, deny, or approve with conditions <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> being proposed. The decision {{can either be}} made at the final hearing or a later public meeting.|$|R

2500|$|Company K, {{published}} in 1933, {{was hailed as}} a masterpiece by critics and writers alike and has often been compared to Erich Maria Remarque's classic anti-war novel All Quiet on the Western Front for its hopeless view of war. University of Alabama professor of American literature and author Philip Beidler wrote, {{in his introduction to}} a republication of the book in 1989, that March's [...] "act of writing Company K, in effect reliving his very painful memories, was itself an act of tremendous courage, equal to or greater than <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross and French Croix de Guerre." [...] Contemporary critics praised the powerful effect of March's novel technique of multiple points of view; already in 1935 (in an essay on new techniques in the novel), John Frederick wrote in The English Journal, [...] "The cumulative effect... {{is one of the most}} powerful and memorable to be found in the whole range of writing about the war." [...] In 2004, Alabama filmmaker Robert Clem made a feature adaptation of the novel; the movie attracted local interest. The novel has garnered attention as a World War I classic in other languages also: in 1967 it was translated into Italian for editor Longanesi as [...] "Fuoco!" [...] ("Fire!") and in 2008, it was translated into Dutch and {{published in}} a series called [...] "The Library of the First World War." ...|$|E

5000|$|In November 2010, Palin {{ruled out}} ever {{granting}} Couric another interview.

Why waste my time? No. ... So a journalist, a reporter who is so biased and will, no doubt, spin and gin up <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I have to say to create controversy, I swear to you, I will not my waste my time with her.

60|$|Ramiro {{looked at}} him, {{and by his}} glance it was plain {{to see that the}} words had jarred his temper. <b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Vitelli wrote to Ramiro, this gentleman was not minded to divulge it.|$|E
6000|$|It {{could only}} be so extraordinary, her meaning, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> the need in him that would--whatever it was again!--meet it most {{absolutely}} formed the syllables on his lips as: [...] "Will you be very, very kind to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just as you say, Clem," [...] {{her father}} assented. [...] "Why not Brother Osson, he'a?"

60|$|He {{stopped in}} his stride. The girl {{glanced up at}} him {{in a kind of}} dull, {{questioning}} way.

60|$|<b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{he found}} {{on the other side}} of the path it grew under the ground, and he stuck his head down as far as he could get it, and bent up his back, as if he were about to try to turn a somersault, or to stand on his head.|$|E
6000|$|First comes Easter, pagan {{goddess of}} spring. Here his fancy may have free play. A {{beautiful}} maiden with decorative {{hair and the}} proper number of toes will fill the bill.

6000|$|... "How {{round and}} soft he is!" [...] thought Kate. [...] "How I {{should like to}} pat him. I wonder when he'll find <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he's looking for! What a cunning little tail!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Contrary {{to some of}} the lyrics, {{the song}} talks about {{influencing}} people to do <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> keeps them going and makes them feel alive, indicating that the word [...] "drug" [...] is a metaphor for the same.|$|R

60|$|There came a gap. He {{remained}} downcast, {{trying to}} find a way towards <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> was in his mind to say.

50|$|The American Sable {{enjoys the}} company of other rabbits. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} docile, spending {{most of the day}} sleeping.

6000|$|... "Another thing," [...] went on Kirk. [...] "If {{this man}} Milbank--I still can't place him--is such a thug, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{he happens to}} be, how did he come to be at your house the night you say I met him?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Our heroine thought, recollected {{there was}} something, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> she knew after all {{much more of}} than Mrs. Jordan.

60|$|And, with a {{characteristic}} shrug, he dismissed <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> was worrying {{him from his}} mind.

60|$|This {{attitude}} so far {{won their}} confidence that before we parted at our last meeting, after most solemn vows {{of faith and}} secrecy, they took me into the secret.
