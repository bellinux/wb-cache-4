5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm <b>will</b> <b>realize</b> a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E

25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody <b>will</b> <b>realize</b> this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E
