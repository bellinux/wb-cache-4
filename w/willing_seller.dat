It was adjacent to three large, underused , {{and at the}} potential nexus of a light rail line then being planned (ultimately the Metro Transit Blue Line), and a commuter rail line also under consideration (the eventual Northstar Line). It was also controlled by a single owner who would be a <b>willing</b> <b>seller.</b> This fact alone would significantly simplify the process of acquisition by a governmental entity for a large scale project. Owing largely to these logistical advantages, {{as well as an}} expansive view of the Minneapolis skyline, and the persistence of Lambrecht and Pogin's group, this site would eventually come to house Target Field.|$|E

5000|$|A further {{provision}} {{is the creation}} of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 and extended by the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015, the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a <b>willing</b> <b>seller</b> but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows crofting communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a <b>willing</b> <b>seller.</b> Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis.|$|E
