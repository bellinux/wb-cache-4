5|$|As well as Groening, Simon {{was often}} {{at odds with}} Brooks and {{production}} company Gracie Films. While working on The Simpsons, he and Brooks had co-created the series Sibs (1991) and Phenom (1993) {{as part of a}} multi-series deal for ABC. Simon did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on either series, both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled, which put a strain on the pair's relationship.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Records {{executive}} Tommy Mottola {{had approached}} Anthony {{to sign a}} contract with the company to record an album in English during the peak period of Latin artists crossing over the Anglophone market. Nonetheless, his contract with RMM denied Anthony the right to perform in Spanish for Colombia Records. This resulted in a lawsuit against Mercado because Anthony did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> under him anymore. As part of the settlement, RMM Records retained the rights to his earlier albums and to release a greatest hits collection from them while Anthony no longer had any obligations to RMM.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs {{attempts}} to interest Pearl in {{working at the}} Krusty Krab—their family business—but she does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> there until she graduates from high school, believing it would negatively affect her social life. Despite this, she manages the Krusty Krab when Mr. Krabs cannot, and fills in for other employees when needed. She will inherit the restaurant and her father's fortune when she grows older. Being a sperm whale, Pearl has the largest brain of any Bikini Bottom resident and is gifted in math. Mr. Krabs has tried to use this to his own advantage and wants Pearl to eventually become a bookkeeper for his restaurant.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Soma Bringer was {{composed}} and arranged by Yasunori Mitsuda, whose previous notable work included titles such as Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, Chrono Cross, and Xenosaga Episode I. Mitsuda was involved {{from the very}} beginning of development, as Takahashi did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on a game without Mitsuda's music. Mitsuda accepted due to their past work on Xenogears and Xenosaga, considering it a kind of reunion. Mitsuda's music formed a key part in compensating for the lack of proper cutscenes, as the music made up for any lack in dramatic character movement during story sequences.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} arose after Earp {{learned that}} one of his prize horses, stolen more than a year before, was in the possession of Ike Clanton and his brother Billy. Earp and Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Behan, who was riding in a wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton. Accounts differ as to what happened next. Earp later testified that {{when he arrived at the}} Clanton ranch, Billy Clanton gave up the horse even before being presented with ownership papers. According to Behan's testimony, however, Earp had told the Clantons that Behan was on his way to arrest them for horse theft. After the incident, which embarrassed both the Clantons and Behan, Behan testified that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Earp and chose Woods instead.|$|E

25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E
25|$|A {{decade after}} the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, {{contacted}} him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project, and eventually the two settled on a sequel to The Way We Were. In it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed {{they did not want}} Pollack {{to be part of the}} equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script but, aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never heard from him again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written, and decided she wanted to produce and direct it as well as co-star with Redford, but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as good as he remembered it being, and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he was interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring Kathie Lee Gifford. Laurents declined, and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo ever since.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This study {{examined}} the relationship between two types of mismatch (i. e. non-correspondence between preferred and actual number of hours), and affective commitment. It was argued that specific groups of employees, i. e. women and part-time working employees, attach more importance to their working hours and, therefore, are less likely to show affective commitment when they experience a mismatch. Design/methodology/approach – Using data from 222 employees of a Dutch Ministry, hypotheses were tested using regression analyses. Findings – It was shown that a mismatch of working more hours was differentially related to the affective commitment of employees who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> more and who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> fewer hours. Moreover, gender and full-time status were found to moderate the negative relationship between a mismatch and the affective commitment of employees who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> less. Research limitations/implications – The focus is on affective commitment; however, it is possible that other types of commitment are also associated with perceptions of psychological contract breach. Practical implications – Tailored HRM is needed: assisting employees with a mismatch <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> fewer hours can be achieved by allowing them more flexibility in their working schedules. Employees with a mismatch of <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> more hours can be assisted with additional support, e. g. shopping services. Originality/value – HRM practices can be tailored to different preferences: the value of this paper is the examination of different types of mismatch for different group of employees. ...|$|R
25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{provides}} {{a way for the}} clients and therapist to work together to create subjective truth and meaning for the client. Where other therapies such as Cognitive-behavioral therapy, Rational-emotive behavioral therapy, Dialectical-behavioral therapy, and other eclectic approaches frequently create a conflict between freedom and commitment for the client. For example, a client seeing a counselor may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on becoming more of an individual by exploring his or her self-concept by finding personal meaning, breaking away from social trends and peer pressure, and discovering his or her own interests. Therapists utilizing traditional theories, like cognitive behavioral therapy, rational emotive behavioral therapy, or even eclectic approaches, will guide the client in this process according to how the therapist's chosen therapy would say about how an individual ought to go about this process. In other words, the client will have to commit to exploring his or her self-concept based on how cognitive behavioral therapy, or another therapy, says the client should learn about who they are, therefore limiting the amount of freedom afforded to the client to creatively develop his or her own ways of self-exploration. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that hermeneutic psychotherapy strives to provide freedom to the client by affording his or her voice a privileged position in therapy to develop their own options.|$|E
