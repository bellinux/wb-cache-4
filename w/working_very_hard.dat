Nakazawa and Uchikoshi were appointed to their respective positions as they had worked on the previous game in the Infinity series, , which had been well received.

500|$|The nordic {{combined}} events used both venues listed for cross country skiing and ski jumping. The test event for Nordic combined {{occurred during the}} weekend of 15–17 February 2008. Because {{of the lack of}} snow and warm weather prior to the test event, the schedule for the test event was adjusted to the sprint event on 15 February, the Gundersen event on 16 February, and the sprint qualification event on 17 February. The sprint event on 15 February was cancelled to changing winds. Meanwhile, the Gundersen event on 16 February was changed to a mass start event won by Norway's Petter Tande. Two unsuccessful attempts at the ski jumping part of the sprint qualification event to high winds on the 17th resulted in the event's cancellation. A World Cup event leading up to the championships was to have taken place 13–14 December 2008 in the 10km individual large hill event as a test event, but was cancelled on 6 December 2008 to warm weather and lack of snow. Neumannová stated that they had a second plan in getting snow from the Jizerske mountains higher elevations where there were better conditions for snowing. [...] of snow at Bedřichov and Albrechtice were prepared for two nights. The third plan proposed two large parking places in the Krkonoše Mountains with natural snow collected for use in the Vesec area. Neumannová assured everyone [...] "that the entire team is <b>working</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> in order to deliver a successful FIS Nordic World Ski Championships."

2500|$|Summers then {{concluded}} {{his discussion}} of the three hypotheses by saying: [...] So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination. I would like nothing better than to be proved wrong, because I would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are, and <b>working</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to address them.

2500|$|During that busy year, Remington became further {{immersed}} in military matters, inventing {{a new type}} of ammunition carrier; but his patented invention was not accepted for use by the War Department. His favorite subject for magazine illustration was now military scenes, though he admitted, [...] "Cowboys are cash with me". Sensing the political mood of that time, he was looking forward to a military conflict which would provide the opportunity to be a heroic war correspondent, giving him both new subject matter and the excitement of battle. [...] He was growing bored with routine illustration, and he wrote to Howard Pyle, the dean of American illustrators, that he had [...] "done nothing but potboil of late".

40|$|Abstract—In {{this article}} we show the usage of soft-computing methods to solve the real problem of {{computation}} of tension in facilities <b>working</b> under <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> conditions in industrial environment. Because the classical mathematical approaches such as Finite Element Method (FEM) are very time consuming, the more progressive soft-computing methods are on the place. We have proposed two step algorithm based on Flexible Neural Tree (FNT) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is more efficient then typical approach (FEM). Flexible neural tree is hierarchical neural network like structure, which is automatically created and optimized using evolutionary like algorithms to solve the given problem. This is very important, {{because it is not}} necessary to set the structure and the weights of neural networks prior the problem is solved. The accuracy of proposed technique is good enough to be used in real environments. Keywords-Real industry environment, Soft-computing, Flexible Neural Tree, Particle Swarm Optimizatio...|$|R

We settled in to enjoy our time alone together. Though Jim was expecting company the next day, avoiding confrontation he never told me that we were to be joined by an entire film crew! The next morning, 15 people from Acorn Productions descended upon our house to record a promotional film of Jim Croce at Home on the Farm."I prepared breakfast, lunch and dinner for the whole film crew and after the group left, I questioned Jim about our finances.

2500|$|In May 2008, Rush Hour {{director}} Brett Ratner {{was officially}} named director, who promised the film would return under the series' standard [...] "R" [...] rating, {{rather than as}} a rumored watered down PG-13. Michael Brandt and Derek Haas were hired as screenwriters to improve on the existing script in July 2008 and completed a new script, under the working title Beverly Hills Cop 2009, which would see Foley return to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of his friend Billy Rosewood. The script was eventually rejected, leaving Ratner to work on a new idea. In an interview with Empire magazine, Ratner stated [...] "I'm <b>working</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> on the fourth. It's very difficult, especially since there were three before. We're trying to figure out some important things, like where do we start? Is Axel retired? Is he in Beverly Hills? Is he on vacation?

[...] Although Murphy himself committed to the project, it was unconfirmed whether the series' other principal actors, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox or Bronson Pinchot would also return, though Ratner stated in late 2009 {{that he was trying to}} convince Reinhold and Ashton to reprise their roles. Harold Faltermeyer's [...] "Axel F", however, would definitely be returning for the proposed fourth installment, with Ratner quoted as saying [...] "It'll be back but it'll be a whole new interpretation."

50|$|Rock crystal {{artefacts}} flourished {{during the}} Fatimid period in Egypt (969-1171). Because {{of the difficulty}} of <b>working</b> with the <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> medium, only the caliph and his immediate court could afford these objets d'art, which varied in size from small animal forms to large vessels. In 1068, however, the large collection of treasures in the Caliph's palace in al-Qahira (now part of modern-day Cairo) was dispersed throughout the medieval world {{as the result of a}} revolt by the unpaid army. Very few items from the reportedly large collection survive. Several of these rare sculpted rock crystals came to form parts of reliquaries in Medieval church treasuries, in mountings made for gold and precious stones. De Unger acquired several rock crystal pieces from this period for his collection including a fine vessel decorated with palmettes, set in an elaborate gold casing with handles formed of foliage and winged dragons. Other smaller items in the collection include several bottles, possibly intended for dispensing scent, and a bead in the form of a crouching hare, possibly intended as a charm.|$|R

2500|$|Although, the {{economic}} liberalisation {{process in the}} country took off with great ground success, but in the 1990s, the targets were not successfully achieved because of the certain monetary obstacles and financial anomalies, despite the great expectation of Prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Ironically, {{the economic}} liberalisation had a reversed effect on Pakistan's economic development unlike neighboring India who started the economic liberalisation later than a year in Pakistan. In 1980–89, the economic reforms gained momentum and hard efforts were put to liberalise the economy before the Fall of communism in the Soviet Union, as country had realized long ago. Pakistan's economic liberalisation reforms and policies were followed by India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal, however, {{in all of these}} countries, the index of imports and economical GDP growth rates increased, except Pakistan where its economic rates were either stagnated and stagflated. As compared to Indian economic liberalisation where growth rate of employment increased, on the other hand, Pakistan's growth rate dramatically fell, though it did reached the level of negative percentage. Traditionally and in the universal terminology, the economic liberalisation reforms are viewed as to grow and promote the GDP growth (such as India's GDP), the economic liberalisation had halted Pakistan's GDP growth. The liberalisation reforms in 1990s entered Pakistan's economy into the [...] "Era of Stagflation" [...] where the unemployment and inflation took sharp rise but other hand, the productivity and the quality assurance of products increased.
