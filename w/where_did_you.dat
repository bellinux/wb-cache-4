2500|$|During {{his work}} in the FSB Litvinenko {{discovered}} numerous connections between top brass of Russian law enforcement agencies and Russian mafia groups, such as Solntsevo gang. He wrote a memorandum about that to Boris Yeltsin. Berezovsky arranged a meeting for him with FSB director Mikhail Barsukov and Deputy Director of Internal affairs Ovchinnikov to discuss the corruption problems; however, this had no effect. Litvinenko gradually realized that the entire system was corrupted from the top to the bottom. He explained: [...] "If your partner bilked you, or a creditor did not pay, or a supplier did not deliver - <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> turn to complain? ...When force became a commodity, there was always demand for it. [...] "Roofs" [...] appeared, people who sheltered and protected your business. First it was provided by the mob, then by police, and soon even our own guys realized what was what, and then the rivalry began among gangsters, cops, and the Agency for market share. As the police and the FSB became more competitive, they squeezed the gangs out of the market. But in many cases competition gave way to cooperation, and the services became gangsters themselves." [...] According to US diplomats, Litvinenko coined the phrase Mafia state.|$|E
2500|$|I was {{returning}} {{from high school}} one day and a runaway horse with a bridle on sped past {{a group of us}} into a farmer's yard looking for a drink of water. The horse was perspiring heavily. And the farmer didn't recognize it so we cornered it. I hopped on the horse's back. Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, [...] "Giddy-up." [...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> find him?" [...] I said, [...] "About four miles from here." [...] "How did you know you should come here?" [...] I said, [...] "I didn't know. The horse knew. All I did was keep his attention on the road." ...|$|E
