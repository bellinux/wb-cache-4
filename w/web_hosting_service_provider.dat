40|$|FLEX {{is a new}} {{scalable}} "locality aware" {{solution for}} achieving both load balancing and efficient memory usage on a cluster of machines <b>hosting</b> several <b>web</b> sites. FLEX allocates the sites to different machines in the cluster based on their traffic characteristics. This aims to avoid the unnecessary document replication to improve the overall performance of the system. The desirable routing {{can be done by}} submitting the corresponding configuration files to the DNS server, since each <b>hosted</b> <b>web</b> site has a unique domain name. FLEX can be easily implemented on top of the current infrastructure used by <b>Web</b> <b>hosting</b> <b>service</b> <b>providers.</b> Using a simulation model and a synthetic trace generator, we compare the Round-Robin based solutions and FLEX over the range of different workloads. For generated traces, FLEX outperforms Round-Robin based solutions 2 - 5 times. 1 Introduction <b>Web</b> content <b>hosting</b> is an increasingly common practice.

40|$|A web {{content hosting}} service {{provider}} needs to dynamically allocate servers in a server farm to its customers ’ web sites. Ideally, the allocation to a site should always suffice to handle its load. However, due to {{a limited number of}} servers and the overhead incurred in changing the allocation of a server from one site to another, the system may become overloaded. The problem faced by the <b>web</b> <b>hosting</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> is how to allocate the available servers in the most profitable way. Adding to the complexity of this problem is the fact that future loads of the sites are either unknown or known only for the very near future. In this paper we model this server allocation problem, and consider both its offline and online versions. We give a polynomial time algorithm for computing the optimal offline allocation. In the online setting, we show almost optimal algorithms (both deterministic and randomized) for any positive lookahead. The quality of the solution improves as the lookahead increases. We also consider several special cases of practical interest. Finally, we present some experimental results using actual trace data that show that one of our online algorithm performs very close to optimal. Interestingly, the online server allocation problem can be cast as a more general benefit task system that we define. Our results extend to this task system, which captures also the benefit maximization variants of the k-server problem and the metrical task system problem. It follows that the benefit maximization variants of these problems are more tractable than their cost minimization variants...|$|E

40|$|Introduction As the Web {{increasingly}} {{becomes a}} core element of business strategy, {{the task of}} <b>hosting</b> <b>web</b> content has become mission critical. Few companies, however, have the resources, money and expertise to build their web site entirely in-house. For this reason, many businesses choose to outsource their <b>Web</b> <b>hosting</b> to Internet <b>Service</b> <b>Providers</b> and some equipment vendors which, according to Forrester Research Inc., can slash costs by 80 %. Although the recent survey revealed over 1 million web servers on the Internet, the number of web sites exceeds this number by several times. The illusion of more web sites existing than actual web servers is created {{through the use of}} virtual servers (<b>hosts).</b> The shared <b>Web</b> <b>hosting</b> <b>service</b> is based on this technique. The shared <b>Web</b> <b>hosting</b> market targets small and medium size businesses. The most common purpose of a shared <b>hosting</b> <b>web</b> site is marketing (in other words, it means that most of the documents are static). I...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} Web 2. 0 has enabled a <b>host</b> of new <b>services</b> and {{possibilities}} on the Internet. Among many new possibilities, users can easily upload online content {{that can be}} accessed, viewed and downloaded by other users around the globe. This has resulted in an explosive growth of User-Generated Content (UGC) which although creating exciting opportunities for users, presents many challenges, especially related to law and regulation. This paper discusses Web 2. 0, UGC and the legal /regulatory challenges that have arisen in this new ‘frontier’ characterised by having a liberating democratic ethos (on one hand) but also sometimes tainted with illegal activity and disregard for accepted norms. Citing various researched case studies and legal cases, the paper highlights possible ‘dangers’ where traditional legal rules may be inadequate to address certain types of online activity, and discusses many of the legal challenges which this new frontier brings. These challenges are widespread and relate to intellectual property, liability, defamation, pornography, hate speech, privacy, confidentiality and jurisdiction among others. The paper also discusses the role of intermediaries (<b>web</b> <b>hosts</b> and <b>service</b> <b>providers)</b> and whether they can aid in effectively policing the new Web 2. 0 frontier. Finally the paper attempts to discuss possible solutions for the way forward...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of {{subscribers}} of the social network services such as Facebook and Twitter has increased rapidly. In accordance with the increasing popularity of social network services, concerns about user privacy are also growing.

The information collected typically useful for commercial purposes, but may lead to a serious user privacy violation.

In this paper, we remove a centralized structure to prevent the <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> from collecting all usersâ€™ information indiscriminately, and present a decentralized structure using the <b>web</b> <b>hosting</b> server. The <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> provides only the <b>service</b> applications to <b>web</b> <b>hosting</b> companies, and the user should select a <b>web</b> <b>hosting</b> company that he trusts.

40|$|The term "Internet {{industry}} " {{encompasses a}} broad spectrum of economic activity. A relatively simple action like downloading a web page might involve, among other parties, one or more backbone providers, one or more ISPs, various <b>web</b> <b>hosting</b> companies, application <b>service</b> <b>providers,</b> content delivery networks, content providers, and advertising agencies. Assessing the relationships among the various providers without a guide can be tricky. This paper presents a framework for studying the economic architecture of the Internet industry. Its purpose is to map how dollars flow on the net. The Internet dollar flows map provides a tool and a context for discussing industry economics and policy. For example, where does the consumer's ISP dollar go? Given the cost structures of Internet service, are pure-play ISPs likely to capture enough value to compete with vertically integrated providers? What are the prospects for unaffiliated ISPs providing access over cable television networks, or for CLECs providing access over ILEC facilities? How much of the consumer's access dollar trickles down to the core of the network? Or, working backwards, how might enhanced services in the core of the network (like QoSguarantee...|$|R
