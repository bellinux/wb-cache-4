6000|$|... "Hiram, if it so chanced <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Boston {{town that}} there was {{the shadow of a}} hope of getting Archie out of prison, would you lend a hand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Dave, what a head you've got for things!" [...] {{cried the}} former bully, admiringly. [...] "I suppose you'll say you simply overheard the talk <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Oakdale." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Whistle twice <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the woods, {{and wait}} for an answer before coming out of cover. That was the signal agreed upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Shall {{you call}} upon me <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> town, Mr. Maddison?" [...] he asked, {{in a tone}} from which all {{invitation}} was curiously lacking.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Boutelle {{uncovered}} {{enough of}} her face to glance at him curiously. [...] "Hardly! You know the children came here from the No'th after your mother's death, <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> California." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, Princess!' {{said the}} Queen, 'don't keep this poor Percinet in {{suspense}} any longer. You little guess the anxiety he has suffered <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{the power of}} that miserable Queen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're awake," [...] {{answered}} Snap, {{and then}} he continued hurriedly: [...] "Shep, {{do you think you}} heard somebody take the boat <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a doze and so imagined you dreamed it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It might <b>be</b> well, <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> {{the society}} of Mary Louise and Colonel Hathaway, to notice their method of speech and try to imitate it." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Henry {{bent his}} head, saying, 'Noble lady, I cannot interfere; but <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> my house, nothing can <b>be</b> done with <b>you</b> against your will.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps it's {{better to}} be pretty. Cleverness is open to any one {{who is willing to}} study. But did you see any girl as nice-looking as I am <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Canada?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, false as hell! What, sit by at his hearth-stone {{and see you}} {{leaning on}} his bosom! Sleep under his roof <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> his arms! No, Lady Clara, {{that would not be}} possible. That virtue, if it be virtue, I cannot possess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, yes, mother," [...] said Rollo. [...] "The road is as smooth, and level, {{and hard}} as a floor. Besides, {{you said that you}} meant to make a {{pedestrian}} excursion somewhere <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Switzerland, and there could not be a better place than this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, then, {{you must}} go and fetch your luggage here at once. It would be strange indeed if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to be staying at any house but mine <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> London.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, the {{conditions}} are now different," [...] remarked Uncle John, carelessly; [...] "and <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> my employ <b>you</b> shall have your wages regularly. Will ten dollars a week be satisfactory?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I gave Mr. Lacy my {{word that}} I would lock you up, and I'll {{have to do}} it. I'll see to it, however, that you suffer no discomforts <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the guardroom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, never mind; {{people never}} turn poets, I fancy, {{with their eyes}} open. But, what is this I hear of your having saved a {{beautiful}} young lady from the jaws of a lion, <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> town; and why was I left to learn all the particulars from Mr. Newcome?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you live}} on terms of mutual {{confidence}} and mutual esteem with me when I have committed this fraud, and when I stand toward you in this position? It was {{possible for you to}} live with me happily <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> ignorance of the truth. It is not possible, now you know all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I'll {{tell you}} who I am later on. I found out about this just in time, it seems. You came from Hartford, but {{you have been in}} Albany lately. <b>While</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Albany you swindled a man named Dodsworth Sadler out of a large sum of money--at least twelve or fifteen hundred dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm willing if {{you want}} us to, Songbird; but you'll have to promise to stay here until the doctor comes. We don't want you to attempt to do {{anything}} <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> your present condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why--no, sir; but--however, {{the young}} gentleman {{has had a}} lesson, and I do not care if I do loose his hands. Here, {{unfasten}} him. But I cannot permit him to <b>be</b> at large <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if your Majesty's commands, and the {{circumstances}} of the time, have made me for a moment seem to forget that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> my sovereign, surely I may be permitted to render my homage as such <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> your own royal palace of Woodstock?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} the like! Where am I to get my things? And you will have no house taken or anything. If you think I'm going into lodgings like Sarah Jane, you're mistook. I don't marry unless I have things {{comfortable}} about me,--furniture, and all that. <b>While</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> your tantrums, George, I once went to see William Brisket's house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I saw how miserable {{you were}} at Trafford I {{did my best to}} bring you away. But I could only bring you here on an express {{stipulation}} that you should not meet George Roden <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> my house. If you can get my father's consent to your meeting him, then that part of the contract will be over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never a belt seed I, sir; leastwise <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> my hands. I had you {{round the}} waist {{all the way}} up, so {{no one could have}} took it off. Why should they? And I undressed you myself; and nothing, save your presence, was there to get off, but jersey and trousers, and a lump of backy against your skin that looked the right sort." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Once a taxicab driver, {{always a}} taxicab driver," [...] Sarah propounded. [...] "Did {{you know that}} that was my profession, Mr. Wingate? If you do need {{anything}} {{in the shape of}} a comfortable conveyance <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> town, will <b>you</b> remember me? I'll send you a card, if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{not worth}} all this bother," [...] said Mr. Merrick to the humbled Wampus, {{when the final}} {{settlement}} had been made, [...] "but chauffeurs <b>are</b> scarce <b>in</b> Albuquerque and I can't be delayed. Never, sir, <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> my employ, must you allow yourself to be guilty of such an act again!" ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{he reached}} the house a sleigh was {{standing}} on the roadway. Anna met him at the door. [...] "John," [...] she said, [...] "there was a stranger came <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the barn, and wanted a lodging for the night; a city man, I reckon, by his clothes. I hated to refuse him, and I put him in Willie's room. We'll never want it again, and he's gone to sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} not," [...] she replied. [...] "It {{is for you}} to tell her. I rang up the prince's house <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> your bathroom. They say that he has a broken rib and some bad cuts, {{sustained}} in a motor accident last night, but that he is in no danger. There was nothing about the affair in the newspapers, and the prince's servants have evidently been instructed to give this account to inquirers." ...|$|E
6000|$|To make up {{for lost}} time, Percy drove very rapidly. [...] "I came mighty near having a fight <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the house," [...] said he. [...] "It was that boy at the inn. He's a queer sort of a fellow, and awfully impertinent. He was talking about you, and he wanted to know if the bear had hurt you. He said he {{believed}} you were really afraid of the beast, and only wanted to show off before the women.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{more talk}} {{there has been}} of fixing the day the more unhappy she has looked," [...] said Marian. [...] "You know she has begged the Faulkners to let it be put off a little longer, because she could not bear that it should <b>be</b> <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> this {{doubtful}} state." ...|$|R
