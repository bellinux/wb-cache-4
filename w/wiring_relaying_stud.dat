50|$|Reed relays {{are smaller}} and cheaper, thus {{better suited to}} data storage. They were used in {{conjunction}} with <b>wire</b> spring <b>relays,</b> for example to store digits for sending to other crossbar switching offices. In a multi-frequency sender (the part of a switch which sends routing information about outgoing calls over trunk lines), for example, <b>wire</b> spring <b>relays</b> direct the dialed digits one at a time from reed relay packs to frequency generators, under sequential control of logic implemented with <b>wire</b> spring <b>relays.</b> At the other end, similar relays steered the incoming digits from the tone decoder to a reed relay memory. In such uses two-out-of-five codes and similar schemes checked for errors at both ends.|$|R

The business {{gave rise to a}} number of other companies, including Associated-Rediffusion, later known as Rediffusion London, one of the first companies to win a terrestrial ITV (commercial television) franchise in the UK. Rediffusion also spawned a record label, Rediffusion International Music, in 1968. Redifon was the name used until 1981 for companies in the capital goods businesses of Rediffusion, viz. Redifon Computers, Redifon Flight Simulation and Redifon Telecommunications.|$|R
50|$|Memory {{circuits}} in {{the form}} of latches can also be created by having a relay contact complete the circuit of its own coil when operated. The relay will then latch and store the state to which it was driven. With this capability, relays were used to create special purpose computers for telephone switches in the 1930s. These designs were converted, starting in the 1950s, to <b>wire</b> spring <b>relays,</b> making them faster and more reliable. The majority of <b>wire</b> spring <b>relays</b> were used in 5XB switches.|$|R

50|$|A <b>wire</b> spring <b>relay</b> {{typically}} {{has many}} individual contacts. Each contact {{is either a}} fixed contact, which does not move, or is a moving contact, and is made from a short piece of wire. The contact points are made from small blocks of precious metals, such as palladium, which are spot-welded to the wire springs. The majority of the <b>wire</b> spring <b>relays</b> manufactured in the 1960s had twelve fixed contacts. A normally open (make) contact, a normally closed (break) contact, or both can be provided for each fixed contact. A moving contact consists of two wires projecting out of {{the base of the}} relay, bent slightly inwards in order to exert pressure against the armature.|$|R

50|$|Markers {{were built}} from <b>relays</b> (<b>wire</b> spring <b>relays</b> and other kinds). Different types of markers {{performed}} various specialized hard-wired operations. For example, 1XB switches had separate markers for incoming and outgoing calls. 5XB switches had dial tone markers to select {{one of a}} number of shared digit receivers (termed originating registers) and connect it to a subscriber who wished to make a telephone call. The digit receiver would collect the digits of the call and make them available to other markers which would use them for routing purposes. In this case the Completing Marker would mark a proper path of idle links for the call to make through the mechanical voice switching matrix.|$|R
50|$|Some early {{computers}} used ordinary relays {{as a kind}} of latchâ€”they store bits {{in ordinary}} <b>wire</b> spring <b>relays</b> or reed relays by feeding an output wire back as an input, resulting in a feedback loop or sequential circuit. Such an electrically latching relay requires continuous power to maintain state, unlike magnetically latching relays or mechanically racheting relays.|$|R

40|$|Quantum dot {{cellular}} automata (QCA) computing schemes use {{arrays of}} quantum dots as computational devices. Typically, these operate ideally by maintaining arrays in their ground state to ensure correct computational output. For large QCA circuits, thermal fluctuations make this impossible, so adiabatic clocking {{has been proposed}} {{as a means of}} dividing large circuit computations into subcircuit computations that are more reliable. In this report, it is shown that wires and inverters can transmit information correctly via their excited states just as well as their ground states. A characteristic example of a 4 cell wire is simulated, and a theoretical derivation of this result is given. When, non-nearest neighbor interactions are included in the Hamiltonian, this result still holds true. On the other hand, QCA majority gates and more complex circuits give incorrect results when operated in excited states. These results suggest that gates of reliable QCA circuits should be contained in smaller clocking zones, while <b>wires</b> <b>relaying</b> information can be contained in larger clocking zones.

50|$|Supervision and trunk {{signalling}} {{were the}} responsibility of trunk circuits. The most common kinds (reverse battery one-way trunks) were in plug-in trunk packs, two trunks per pack, 128 packs per Trunk Frame (originally) on 16 shelves. Each trunk pack was originally about 3x5x8 inches (8x12x20 cm) with edge connector in the back. The later 1AESS were made with shorter <b>wire</b> spring <b>relays,</b> making them less than half as wide, with more complex leaf spring connector. Trunk Frames were in pairs, the even numbered one having the Signal Distributor to control the relays in both. Most trunks had three <b>wire</b> spring <b>relays</b> and two scan points. They could supply regular battery or reverse battery to a line, and on-hook or off-hook supervision to the distant end, or be put into a bypass state allowing all functions (usually sending and receiving address signals) to be performed by common control circuits such as digit transmitters and receivers. Slightly more complex trunks, for example those going to TSPS offices for operator control, were packaged as only one per plugin unit.|$|R

40|$|Two-tier networks, {{comprising}} {{a conventional}} cellular network overlaid with shorter range hotspots (e. g. femtocells, distributed antennas, or <b>wired</b> <b>relays),</b> offer an economically viable {{way to improve}} cellular system capacity. The capacity-limiting factor in such networks is interference. The cross-tier interference between macrocells and femtocells can suffocate the capacity due to the near-far problem, so in practice hotspots should use a different frequency channel than the potentially nearby high-power macrocell users. Centralized or coordinated frequency planning, which is difficult and inefficient even in conventional cellular networks, is all but impossible in a two-tier network. This paper proposes and analyzes an optimum decentralized spectrum allocation policy for two-tier networks that employ frequency division multiple access (including OFDMA). The proposed allocation is optimal in terms of Area Spectral Efficiency (ASE), and is subjected to a sensible Quality of Service (QoS) requirement, which guarantees that both macrocell and femtocell users attain at least a prescribed data rate. Results show the dependence of this allocation on the QoS requirement, hotspot density and the co-channel interference from the macrocell and surrounding femtocells. Design interpretations of this result are provided. Comment: 25 pages, Revised and submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communication...|$|R
