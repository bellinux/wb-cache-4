5|$|Different {{branches}} of Taoism often have differing pantheons of lesser deities, <b>where</b> <b>these</b> deities reflect different notions of cosmology.

While State Highway470 and E-470 are not officially branches of I-70, they are remnants of plans for an I-470 outer beltway around Denver that were cancelled when the allocated funds were spent elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Insects {{form part}} of the human diet in some cultures, and in Thailand, crickets are farmed for this purpose in the north of the country and palm weevil larvae in the south. The crickets are kept in pens, boxes or drawers and fed on {{commercial}} pelleted poultry food, while the palm weevil larvae live on cabbage palm and sago palm trees, which limits their production to areas <b>where</b> <b>these</b> trees grow. Another delicacy of this region is the bamboo caterpillar, and the best rearing and harvesting techniques in semi-natural habitats are being studied.|$|E

5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread {{out around the}} base of the plant for varying distances, close to the surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems <b>where</b> <b>these</b> come into contact with a rooting medium.|$|E

Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Sea silk is a {{fine fabric}} woven from the byssus threads of bivalves, {{particularly}} the pen shell (Pinna nobilis). It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region <b>where</b> <b>these</b> shells are endemic. It was an expensive fabric and overfishing has much reduced populations of the pen shell. There is mention in the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone (196 BCE) of this cloth being used to pay taxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of element 108 was first attempted in 1978 by a Russian research {{team led by}} Yuri Oganessian and Vladimir Utyonkov at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, using reactions that would generate the isotopes hassium-270 and hassium-264. The data was uncertain and they carried out new experiments on hassium five years later, <b>where</b> <b>these</b> two isotopes as well as hassium-263 were produced; the hassium-264 experiment was conducted again and confirmed in 1984.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and <b>where</b> <b>these</b> deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is in the}} apatite {{group of}} phosphates, and forms a {{chemical}} series with the minerals pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), with both of which it may form solid solutions. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and vanadate (VO4). Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus, arsenic and calcium, <b>where</b> <b>these</b> may act as an isomorphic substitute for vanadium. Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, Songpol Somsri, a Thai {{government}} scientist, had crossbred {{more than}} ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No.1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour. Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour {{about three days}} after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent odour. On 22 May 2012, two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual odour, Long Laplae and Lin Laplae, were presented to the public by Yothin Samutkhiri, governor of Uttaradit Province from <b>where</b> <b>these</b> cultivars were developed locally, while he announced the dates for the yearly durian fair of Laplae District, and the name giver to both cultivars.|$|E
