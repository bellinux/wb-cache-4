50|$|In healthy individuals, basal rate is {{monitored}} by the pancreas, which provides a regular amount of insulin at all times. The body requires this flow of insulin to enable the body to utilize glucose in the blood stream, so the energy in glucose {{can be used to}} carry out bodily functions. Basal rate requirements can differ for individuals depending on the activities they <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> that particular day. For example, if one is not highly active on a certain day, they will have a decreased basal rate because they are not using a lot of energy. On the other hand, basal rate increases dramatically when an individual is highly active.|$|E

Power is a {{fascinating}} phenomenon. While this is something different than money, somehow I always {{had the feeling that}} economic sciences could provide useful tools to facilitate its understanding. In what follows, I tried to provide some - necessarily modest - contributions to its analysis, focusing mainly on how the delegation of decision-making often required by the complexity of our societies can make the true distribution of power differ from the apparent one. In the first chapter I try to understand why public institutions or government agencies often end up being given large room of maneuver regarding the definition of the missions that they <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> behalf of their constituencies / something we can realize by noticing how many institutions are typically doing things which have nothing to do anymore with the reasons for which they were initially set up. The second chapter, the result of a collaboration with José-Maria Alonso-Meijide, is focused on a similar kind of delegation problem, but restricted to cases where the delegation has to comply with some voting scheme, like in a democratic assemble. The third chapter, also the result of a collaboration, this time with Agnès Benassy-Quéré, investigates what kind of delegation could best serve the power of the European Union within the International Monetary Fund. The issue there is not anymore theoretical, as it has been under intense discussions within and outside the EU over many years...|$|E

40|$|Skype {{is one of}} the {{well-known}} applications that has guided the evolution of real-time video streaming and {{has become one of the}} most used software in everyday life. It provides VoIP audio/video calls as well as messaging chat and file transfer. Many versions are available covering all the principal operating systems like Windows, Macintosh and Linux but also mobile systems. Voice quality decreed Skype success since its birth in 2003 and peer-to-peer architecture has allowed worldwide diffusion. After video call introduction in 2006 Skype became a complete solution to communicate between two or more people. As a primarily video conferencing application, Skype assumes certain characteristics of the delivered video to optimize its perceived quality. However in the last years, and with the recent release of SkypeKit 1, many new Skype video-enabled devices came out especially in the mobile world. This forced a change to the traditional recording, streaming and receiving settings allowing for a wide range of network and content dynamics. Video calls are not anymore based on static ‘chatting’ but mobile devices have opened new possibilities and can be used in several scenarios. For instance, lecture streaming or one-to-one mobile video conferences exhibit more dynamics as both caller and callee might be on move. Most of these cases are different from “head&shoulder” only content. Therefore, Skype needs to optimize its video streaming engine to cover more video types. Heterogeneous connections require different behaviors and solutions and Skype must face with this variety to maintain a certain quality independently from connection used. Part of the present work will be focused on analyzing Skype behavior depending on video content. Since Skype protocol is proprietary most of the studies so far have tried to characterize its traffic and to reverse engineer its protocol. However, questions related to the behavior of Skype, especially on quality as perceived by users, remain unanswered. We will study Skype video codecs capabilities and video quality assessment. Another motivation of our work is the design of a mechanism that estimates the perceived cost of network conditions on Skype video delivery. To this extent we will try to assess in an objective way the impact of network impairments on the perceived quality of a Skype video call. Traditional video streaming schemes lack the necessary flexibility and adaptivity that Skype tries to achieve at the edge of a network. Our contribution will lye on a testbed and consequent objective video quality analysis that we <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> input videos. We will stream raw video files with Skype via an impaired channel and then we will record it at the receiver side to analyze with objective quality of experience metrics...|$|E
