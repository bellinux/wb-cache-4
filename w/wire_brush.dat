5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
60|$|On a dark November morning, when a blustering wind {{drove the}} rain against the windows, Thomas Foster sat {{stripping}} the lock of a favorite {{gun in the}} room he called his study, at Hazlehurst, in Shropshire. The shelves on the handsome paneled walls contained a few works on agriculture, horse-breeding, and British natural history, but two racks were filled with guns and fishing-rods and the table at which Foster was seated had a vise clamped to its edge. He had once had a commodious gun-room, but had given it up, under pressure from his wife, as Hazlehurst was small and she had numerous guests, but the study was his private retreat.

40|$|An {{ultrafine}} grain {{surface layer}} with average crystallite size of 28 nm was produced on annealed mild steel through a <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> process. The effects of {{grain size reduction}} on the inhibition performance of sodium phosphate were investigated using polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The crystal grain size of <b>wire</b> <b>brushed</b> surface was analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The electrochemical tests were conducted in artificial sea water (ASW) in the presence and absence of 250 mg/lit sodium phosphate (SP). The <b>wire</b> <b>brushed</b> surface indicated considerable deformed plastic flows and high surface roughness. Due to the accumulated strains, a deformed layer with thickness of 20 ± 5 μm was produced and the crystal grain size of severe deformed zone was about 28 nm. <b>Wire</b> <b>brushed</b> surface increased uniform corrosion rate of mild steel due to enhanced surface roughness and preferential sites to adsorption of corrosive ions. However, the <b>wire</b> <b>brushed</b> surface showed {{a positive effect on}} inhibition performance of sodium phosphate. The electrochemical results revealed that average inhibition efficiency increased from 65 to about 80 percent in ASW solution containing 1. 5 mM Na 3 PO 4 for coarse grained samples in comparison to that of ultra-fined grain samples respectively. The <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> process encouraged passivity on the surface in SP-containing solution due to a high density of nucleation sites which increased the adsorption of phosphate ions leading to a high fraction of passive layers and low corrosion rates...|$|R

50|$|A <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> {{is a tool}} {{consisting}} of a brush whose bristles are made of wire, most often steel wire. The steel used is generally a medium- to high-carbon variety and very hard and springy. Other wire brushes feature bristles made from brass or stainless steel, depending on application. Wires in a <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> can be held together by epoxy, staples, or other binding. Wire brushes usually either have a handle of wood or plastic (for handheld use) or are formed into a wheel for use on angle grinders, bench grinders, pistol-grip drill motors, or other power tools.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{finishing}} treatments such as {{shot blasting}} and <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> can be beneficial {{in improving the}} integrity of machined surfaces of austenitic stainless steels. These operations optimize in-service properties such as resistance to pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking (SCC).

The surfaces were then characterized by their hardness, surface residual stress state, and resistance to stress corrosion and pitting corrosion. Some samples were selected for depth profiling of residual stress.

Some of {{the main}} failure modes are related to installation issues, such as: insufficient cleaning (<b>wire</b> <b>brushing)</b> of the conductor to eliminate the aluminium oxide layer (which has a high resistance {a poor electrical conductor}), improper application of conducting grease, improper compression force, improper compression locations or number of compressions.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> is {{primarily}} an abrasive implement, used for cleaning rust and removing paint. It {{is also used}} to clean surfaces and to create a better conductive area for attaching electrical connections, such as those between car battery posts and their connectors, should they accumulate a build-up of grime and dirt. When cleaning stainless steel, it is advisable to use a stainless steel bristle <b>wire</b> <b>brush,</b> as a plain carbon steel brush can contaminate the stainless steel and cause rust spots to appear. Brass bristle brushes are used on softer surfaces or in potentially flammable environments where non-sparking tools are required. Wire brushes are also used to clean the teeth of large animals, such as crocodiles and pigs. They are also used widely in surface engineering to clean the castings to paint the castings.|$|E
