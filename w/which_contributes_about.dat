50|$|Algeria’s {{agricultural}} sector, <b>which</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>about</b> 8 {{percent of}} gross domestic product (GDP) but employs 14 percent of the workforce, is unable to meet the food needs of the country’s population. As a result, some 45 percent of food is imported. The primary crops are wheat, barley, and potatoes. Farmers also have had success growing dates for export. Cultivation is concentrated in the fertile coastal plain of the Tell region, which represents just a slice of Algeria’s total territory. Altogether, only about 3 percent of Algerian territory is arable. Even in the Tell, rainfall variability has a significant impact on production. Government efforts to stimulate farming in the less arable steppe and desert regions have met with limited success. However, herdsmen maintain livestock, specifically cow and sheep in the High Plateaus region. Algeria’s climate and periodic fires are not conducive to a thriving forestry industry. However, Algeria is a producer of cork and Aleppo pine. In 2005 roundwood removals totaled 7.8 million cubic meters, while sawnwood production amounted to only 13 million cubic meters per year. Algeria’s fishing industry does not take full advantage of the Mediterranean coast, in part because fishing is generally done from small family-owned boats instead of large commercial fishing trawlers. However, the government is attempting to boost the relatively small catch—slightly more than 125,000 metric tons in 2005—by modernizing fishing ports, permitting foreigners to fish in Algerian waters, and subsidizing fishing-related projects.|$|E

40|$|Studies of recurrentstone formers indicatedthat {{they have}} significantlyincreasedurinaryoxalate and decreasedascor-bate excretions. Resultsof oral and intravenousadministra-tionof {{ascorbate}} indicate an enhanced production of oxalate from ascorbate in recurrentcalcium stone formersas com-pared with normal persons {{and that most}} of this oxalate is generated in the gut. In most western civilizations, calcium oxalate-containing stones comprise about 80 % of all renal calculi (. 1). Calcium oxalate is extremely insoluble and its daily output in the urine {{is perhaps the most}} critical factor to renal stone formation (2). Urinary ozalate is derived essentially from three major sources: ascorbate, <b>which</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>about</b> 40 % of urine oxalate output (3, 4); 2 -carbon metabolites (glyoxylate, glycolate), which also contribute about 40 % (5, 6), and dietary oxalate itself; <b>which</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>about</b> 5 to 10 % (7). The route from ascorbate to oxalate does not involve generation of 2 -carbon metabolites such as glyoxylate (4), but is thought to involve the following sequence: Asoorbate- dehydroascorbate- diketogulonic acid-oxalate + L-threonate This pathway is both enzymic and non-enzymic in that alkaline pH conditions will result in production of oxalate from ascorbate (8). Most of the data linking ascorbate to increased urinary oxalate excretion are confusing and contradictory in that some (9, 10) but not all (11, 12) workers find that ascorbate may increase urinary oxalate output. In an attempt to clarify this confusion, we undertook a detailed study of the role of ascorbate in oxalate excretion in patients with renal stone disease. The result of this investigation is presented here, and ascorbate is discussed as a possible etiological factor in the pathogenesis of this disease state...|$|E
