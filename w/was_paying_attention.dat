2500|$|In {{designing}} the final 'encounter' with GLaDOS in Portal, {{one of the}} important aspects to it was giving the players a predisposition to the Weighted Companion Cube, an object that GLaDOS gives to the player-character and tells her to protect. This was accomplished by forcing the player to incinerate it, therein providing a tutorial for how to defeat the boss and a revenge angle. GLaDOS was originally designed to be a devious boss, citing one form where she would use a series of lasers, like those seen in James Bond films. However, it was determined that this twitch gameplay distracted players from GLaDOS, and was too different from the game's puzzle-solving gameplay. Additionally, it was difficult for players to detect when they were hit, so the developers switched the gameplay to feature rockets. This incarnation of the final boss was dubbed [...] "Portal Kombat", which Swift describes as a [...] "high intensity rocket battle". However, Wolpaw disliked it because no one <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> to what GLaDOS was saying. While it went over well with hardcore shooter fans, the people who liked the puzzle-focused gameplay were turned off by it. The third boss was a chase scene, with players pursuing GLaDOS down a corridor. Wolpaw sharply criticized the pacing, which caused the players to wander around until they found the corridor, at which point a series of pistons would spring out of the walls.|$|E

If it is the 2, the lead for the last trick will be in dummy and East must keep the Ace. If it is anything else, declarer will overtake and win the trick, so East must keep the Ace. Declarer is playing for East to have forgotten and guess wrong.|$|R

5000|$|In 1997, Deadpool {{was given}} his own ongoing title, {{initially}} written by Joe Kelly, with then-newcomer Ed McGuinness as an artist.

The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother Blind Al and his best friend Weasel. The ongoing series gained cult popularity for its unorthodox main character and its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained. The writer Joe Kelly noted, [...] "With Deadpool, we could do anything we wanted because everybody just expected the book to be cancelled every five seconds, so nobody <b>was</b> <b>paying</b> <b>attention.</b> And we {{could get away with}} it."
