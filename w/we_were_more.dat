One former Viet Cong leader is quoted as saying; [...] "Worse than the Americans were the Australians. The Americans style was to hit us, then call for planes and artillery.

He played Little League baseball and was the goalie on the Chaminade varsity hockey team. During his high school years, he met future pop-singer Billy Joel, whom O'Reilly described as a [...] "hoodlum". O'Reilly recollected {{in an interview with}} Michael Kay on the YES Network show CenterStage that Joel [...] "was in the Hicksville section—the same age as me—and he was a hood.

We were just {{trying to figure out how}} blue rhymes with you. When I was writing them, they didn't have anything to do with who I was." [...] The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio.

2500|$|... "Scotland {{had lost}} both Tests against the All Blacks {{earlier in the}} season but the second, in Auckland, had been close: the Blacks just sneaked home by 21-18. Perhaps that persuaded people that, in the light of our Test series win over the French, we were favourites. Whoever made public that {{sentiment}} did us scant favour. We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, we were also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and wait for them to come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it. That day <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> afraid of making a mistake, worrying about who we were playing against, rather than getting on with our own game. And when we did run it we were totally predictable. The Blacks knew the ball would head out to me when it was shifted, and so whenever I got it they hammed me." ...|$|E

[...] Third-place finisher di Grassi praised the track and the race weekend but acknowledged his team did not have the pace to stay with both Mahindra cars. However, he spoke of his enjoyment with his battle against Vergne and claimed his car was quicker in the second race: [...] "Yesterday we found some pace, which meant we could keep up a little bit with these guys, but we need to improve.
