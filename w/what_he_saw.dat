5|$|Theobald {{called a}} church council at London in June 1160, which dealt partly {{with the issues}} of the papal schism; his health was poor and he had to be taken to the council in a litter. A further cause of {{distress}} to Theobald was <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.|$|E
5|$|A nearby {{mountain}} {{was named}} Jabal ad-Dik ("Mount of the Rooster") {{because of a}} traditional story. According to the tradition, a Jew that lived in Jifna had visited Jerusalem during the Passion. Seeing Jesus rise from the dead, the man immediately converted and told his wife <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> His wife refused to believe him unless the rooster she had just killed {{would come back to}} life. Instantly, the rooster flew away towards the mountain. The story was recited in some monasteries on Holy Thursday together with other biblical readings.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{came from}} a privileged Anglo-Irish background, Synge's {{writings}} are mainly concerned with the world of the Roman Catholic peasants of rural Ireland and with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the essential paganism of their world view. Synge developed Hodgkin's disease, a metastatic cancer that was then untreatable. He died several weeks short of his 38th birthday as he was trying to complete his last play, Deirdre of the Sorrows.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila. He sent messages reporting <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{was a lack}} of drive among the troops, and even moved his theater headquarters forward of Krueger's. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{successful}} defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking against <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as violations of constitutional rights. In 1864, he condemned General Order No. 11, an edict of Ulysses S. Grant that barred Jews from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky. In the same speech, he rebuked federal military {{interference with the}} elections in Kentucky. In 1864, he opposed a constitutional amendment aimed at freeing the slaves.|$|E

5|$|From the Goebbels Diaries, {{researchers}} {{learned that}} Riefenstahl had been friendly with Joseph Goebbels {{and his wife}} Magda, attending the opera with them and going to his parties. Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat. She therefore insisted his diary entries could not be trusted. By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Boris Nemtsov, former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia who {{was then}} an elected member of the State Duma {{and leader of the}} Union of Rightist Forces, paid a visit to Bukovsky in Cambridge. He wanted to discuss the {{strategy}} of the Russian opposition. It was imperative, Bukovsky told Nemtsov, that Russian liberals adopt an uncompromising stand toward <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the authoritarian government of President Vladimir Putin.|$|E
5|$|In a {{book titled}} Militarism U.S.A. (1970), Shoup and Donovan {{elaborated}} their criticisms. Shoup said the country was seeking military solutions to issues that could be resolved politically. He accused military leaders of propagating the war for their own career advancement, and accused the veterans group Veterans of Foreign Wars of propagandizing for the armed forces establishment. Shoup blamed the American education system for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as discouraging independent thought and stressing obedience.|$|E

5|$|In his {{writings}} Aflaq had been stridently {{in favor of}} free speech and other human rights and aid for the lower classes. During the Military Committee's gradual take over of power in Syria, Aflaq rallied against <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as {{the establishment of a}} military dictatorship, instead of the democracy for which Aflaq had planned. These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government in Syria and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq to have only employed Aflaq's ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|In the end, King {{was forced}} to impose {{overseas}} conscription after {{the failure of the}} voluntary recruitment campaign, but the war ended soon after and his government survived unscathed. The conscription crisis however, hardened the animosity between King and his naval minister. Macdonald, disillusioned by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the chicanery and ruthlessness of national politics, longed to return to Nova Scotia. After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> He is torn between {{the need to}} tell the truth and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E

2500|$|On October 24, 2001, USAMRIID {{scientist}} Peter Jahrling {{was summoned}} to the White House after he reported signs that silicon had been added to anthrax recovered from the letter addressed to Daschle.

She claims that the aliens {{are in a state}} of upheaval and that she will be abducted by them again. Mulder tells Cassandra there is nothing he can do for her and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{was furious}} over <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as {{potentially}} precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially {{refused to allow}} Murdac into England. When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went to consult with the Pope on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the King refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates. Stephen also cut his links to the Cistercian order, and turned instead to the Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Stillman's run was {{a turning}} point. Prior to this battle, Black Hawk had not been {{committed}} to war. Now he determined to avenge <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the treacherous killing of his warriors under a flag of truce. After Stillman's defeat, American leaders like President Jackson and Secretary of War Lewis Cass would not consider a diplomatic solution; they wanted a resounding victory over Black Hawk {{to serve as an}} example to other Native Americans who might consider similar uprisings.|$|E

5|$|The {{theology}} of Huldrych Zwingli {{was based on}} the Bible, taking scripture as the inspired word of God and placing its authority higher than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as human sources such as the ecumenical councils and the church fathers. He also recognised the human element within the inspiration noting the differences in the canonical gospels. Zwinglianism is the Reformed confession based on the Second Helvetic Confession promulgated by Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger in the 1560s.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} Antioch College in {{the early}} 1960s, Gould {{was active in the}} civil rights movement and often campaigned for social justice. When he attended the University of Leeds as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations outside a Bradford dance hall which refused to admit black people. Gould continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked. Throughout his career and writings, he spoke out against cultural oppression in all its forms, especially <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as the pseudoscience used in the service of racism and sexism.|$|E
5|$|After Fan {{was forced}} to step down from his office, Wang Anshi (1021–1086) became Chancellor of the {{imperial}} court. With the backing of Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, {{and the creation of}} higher standards for the Imperial examination to make it more practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.|$|E
60|$|Once, {{while he}} was {{revolving}} these thoughts, he happened to glance into the house, and deep {{in the shadow of}} a corner he caught a pale gleam of Jennie's face with great, staring eyes on him. She had been watching him, listening to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> from her expression that she had realized what had been so hard for her to believe. Watching his chance, he flashed a look at her; and then it seemed to him the change in her face was wonderful.|$|R
