The warp threads interact with the brass bobbin threads to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse warp threads (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp threads against the bobbin threads. The warp threads are tensioned by a spring.|$|R

50|$|Beams are the {{vertical}} threads from a beam roller {{that contributes to}} the pattern. Lace is made up of motif that is repeated vertically and horizontally. If a design has 48 horizontal repeats, there will be 48 threads on each beam roller. Every beam roller has its own guidebar, made of thin watch-spring steel. Each front <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> has its own guidebar. The back <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> share 4 stump bars between them. The guide bars are controlled by the Jacquards so can be reposition for each motion, indeed they are also known as Jacquard bars; they are held in a bar box above the sley but below the carriages.|$|R

5000|$|Originally the Jacquard {{machines}} were mechanical, and the fabric design was {{stored in a}} series of punched cards which were joined to form a continuous chain. The Jacquards often were small and only independently controlled a relatively few <b>warp</b> <b>ends.</b> This required a number of repeats across the loom width. Larger capacity machines, or the use of multiple machines, allowed greater control, with fewer repeats, and hence larger designs could be woven across the loom width.|$|R

50|$|Bonas Machine Company Ltd. {{launched}} {{the first successful}} electronic Jacquard at ITMA, Milan in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed Jacquard machine capacity to increase significantly, and single <b>end</b> <b>warp</b> control can extend to more than 10,000 <b>warp</b> <b>ends.</b> This avoids the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and allows almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punched paper designs, thus allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly {{and may not be}} required in a factory weaving large batch sizes, and smaller designs. The larger machines allowing single <b>end</b> <b>warp</b> control are very expensive, and can only be justified where great versatility is required, or very specialized design requirements need to be met. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and stretch the versatility of the niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most of the large batch commodity weaving has moved to low cost areas.|$|R
50|$|In weaving, the weft (sometimes woof) is {{the thread}} or yarn which is drawn through, {{inserted}} over-and-under, the lengthwise warp yarns that {{are held in}} tension on a frame or loom to create cloth. Warp is the lengthwise or longitudinal thread in a roll, while weft is the transverse thread. A single thread of the weft, crossing the warp, is called a pick. Terms do vary (for instance, in North America, the weft is {{sometimes referred to as}} the fill or the filling yarn). Each individual warp thread in a fabric is called a <b>warp</b> <b>end</b> or end.|$|R
50|$|Pile weave {{is a form}} of textile {{created by}} weaving. Pile fabrics used to be made on {{traditional}} hand weaving machines. The <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> that are used for the formation of the pile are woven over metal rods or wires that are inserted in the shed (gap caused by raising alternate threads) during weaving. The pile ends lie in loops over the inserted rods. When a rod is extracted the pile ends remain as loops on top of the base fabric. The pile ends lying over the rod may be left as 'loop pile', or cut to form 'cut pile' or velvet.|$|R

50|$|While he {{was working}} as a tuna and sardine {{fisherman}} from San Pedro, California, Puratić started thinking about the difficulty of hauling seine nets. The original power block he designed was essentially a simple winch which used a V-shaped roller coated with hard rubber. It was suspended from a davit, and powered from the <b>warp</b> <b>end</b> of the winch by a looping rope. In 1954, the power block was trialled by American purse seiners in the Pacific. They have evolved since then, and nowadays power blocks are powered by hydraulic pumps. Their speed, torque and direction can be remotely controlled from the bridge during operations. As a result, retrieving the net is safer and requires less manual work.|$|R
5000|$|Rugs {{from the}} Quba region {{are made from}} wool, though cotton is also used on rare occasion. The wool is always {{composed}} of two strands, making it 2-ply. Warp will vary according to region, but ply consistently remains 2-ply. Kuba rugs in general are woven using a single-warp method: the warp threads lie along the same level, as opposed to depressed warp where the warp threads alternate between are sunken and raised. Often the depressed threads are lowered as much as 75%.7 The threads are symmetrically knotted and the sides of Kuba rugs are finished with a blue or white selvage of wool or cotton.8 [...] The <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> are tied together in several rows of knots.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{position}} in the card corresponds to a [...] "Bolus" [...] hook, which can either be raised or stopped dependent on whether the hole is punched out of the card or the card is solid. The hook raises or lowers the harness, which carries and guides the warp thread so that the weft will either lie above or below it. The sequence of raised and lowered threads is what creates the pattern. Each hook can be connected {{to a number of}} threads, allowing more than one repeat of a pattern. A loom with a 400 hook head might have four threads connected to each hook, resulting in a fabric that is 1600 <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> wide with four repeats of the weave going across.|$|R

To have different backrest oscillations, springs with different stiffness were used. For each spring, fabrics with various weft densities were woven, and the warp tensions were measured and saved during the weaving process. The empirical {{data were analyzed}} by using linear multiple and quadratic multiple regression, and an artificial neural network model. Osthus et al. (1995) reported that the <b>warp</b> <b>end</b> tensions are influenced by changing {{the height of the}} backrest roller. They evaluated the fabric appearance using an image processing system. The results for different backrest heights show that in the higher position of the backrest, the colour of the fabric become darker; and the fabric density is greater with an increasing backrest height.|$|R
50|$|On {{mechanical}} looms {{the technology}} of 'wire weaving' still exists, using modern technology and electronics. This weaving technique allows users to obtain both loop pile and cut pile in the same fabric. Other techniques involve the weaving of two layers of fabric {{on top of each}} other, whereby the <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> used for the pile are inserted {{in such a way that}} they form a vertical connection between the two layers of fabric. By cutting the pile ends in between the two layers one obtains two separate pile fabrics. With this technique only the cut pile effect can be obtained. This is known as 'face-to-face weaving'. Both 'wire weaving' and 'face-to-face' weaving are used for the manufacturing of upholstery and furnishing fabrics as well as in rug making (knotted-pile carpet).|$|R

5000|$|In textile terminology, threads {{that run}} {{the length of}} the fabric (longitudinally) are <b>warp</b> <b>ends.</b> Threads running {{laterally}} from edge to edge, that is from left side to right side of the fabric as it emerges from the loom, are weft picks. Selvages form the extreme lateral edges of the fabric and are formed during the weaving process. The weave used to construct the selvage may be the same or different from the weave of the body of the fabric cloth. Most selvages are narrow, but some may be as wide as [...]75 in. Descriptions woven into the selvage using special jacquards, colored or fancy threads may be incorporated for identification purposes. For many end-uses the selvage is discarded. Selvages are 'finished' and will not fray because the weft threads double back on themselves and are looped under and over the warp.|$|R

The main feature of this loom is the dobby (located top right of the loom with the hand wheel) which is known as the Knowles, American or positive wheel dobby. This device lifts and lowers the wooden shafts through which the <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> are threaded, separating the warp threads to produce the shed.

50|$|Kersey yarns were spun {{in large}} gauges (thicknesses) from {{inferior}} carded wool, and made thick and sturdy cloth. Kersey was a warp-backed, twill-weave cloth woven on a four-treadle loom. As a rule, half the relatively small, numerous and closely set <b>warp</b> <b>ends</b> threads were struck {{with a big}} kersey weft in a two-and-two, unbalanced and highly prominent twill. The rest of the ends were simultaneously struck in a one-and-three twill, so they appeared mainly {{on the back of}} the cloth, while the back-warp stitches on the face of the cloth were concealed among the face-warp threads. One of the secrets of weaving a good kersey lay in combining the adequate stitching of the weft by the back warp with the concealment of the back-warp stitches.The back of the cloth was napped and shorn after fulling, producing a dense, warm fabric with a smooth back.|$|R

40|$|A weaving {{drawdown}} is {{a rectangular}} grid {{of black and}} white squares with at least one black and one white square in each row and column. A pattern results from vertical and horizontal translations of the defining grid. Any such grid defines a tiling pattern. However, from a weaving point of view, some of these grids define actual fabrics while others correspond to collections of threads that fall apart. This article addresses that issue, along with a discussion of binary representations of fabric structures. The article also catalogs all weaving (or tiling) patterns defined by grids having three distinct columns and three to six distinct rows, and groups these patterns into design families based on weaving symmetries. 1 Introduction.
