40|$|Paper {{describes}} {{methods of}} rectified DC pulsation reduction adding a compensation node {{to a single}} phase rectifier. Device is related to converters of electrical energy {{and it can be}} used in power electronics. Purpose of single phase compensated rectifier is to reduce <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> pulsations. Several methods of compensation are observed, load characteristics are compared to a simple rectifier. <b>Load</b> <b>voltage</b> is compensated using compensation switch. It is operated so that rectifier output voltage pulsation is minimal. This current pulsation reduction effect is achieved so that the elevated voltage node is operating as an additional power source for load. Operation of compensation switch is controlled by comparing of two voltages, comparing reference voltage with <b>voltage</b> on <b>load.</b> While these <b>voltages</b> are equal or <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> is greater than reference <b>voltage,</b> <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> is not compensated. As soon as <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> less than reference voltage, the compensation current is increased in proportion of difference of compared <b>voltages.</b> <b>Load</b> <b>voltage</b> compensation process goes on continuous...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This work {{presents}} the extreme-pressure behavior of 600 N base oil dispersed with MoS 2 Nano particles with 1 volume percent of polyisobutylenesuccinamide as dispersant. MoS 2 Nano particles were dispersed in 0. 05, 1. 0 wt. % and tested for Extreme pressure behavior on a 4 ball wear tester using the test method ASTM D 2783. The <b>weld</b> <b>load</b> and load wear index of base oil and oil dispersed with Nano particles are evaluated and compared for improvement. Prior to dispersion, the MoS 2 Nano particles are suitably surface modified {{to make them}} uniformly disperse in oils. The seizure <b>load,</b> <b>weld</b> <b>load</b> and load wear index of Nano particles dispersed oils have improved remarkably compared to Base oil. Metallographic studies done on the wear balls show that Nano particles get deposited on the worn area preventing the welding of the surfaces and hence higher <b>weld</b> <b>load.</b> The wear scar of bottom there balls are also found to be less for Nano dispersed oils compared to base oil and hence lower load-wear index...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Current-source-inverter-based {{uninterruptible}} {{power supplies}} and V=f-controlled induction motor drives require sensing {{of two or}} more <b>load</b> <b>voltages</b> in addition to the dc voltage sensors used for protection purposes. This paper proposes a digital-signal-processor (DSP) -based <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> control scheme that requires only information provided by the dc-bus <b>voltage</b> sensor. <b>Load</b> <b>voltage</b> estimation is based on ac line voltage reconstruction by means of a recursive least-square error algorithm that uses the information available on the dc bus and knowledge of the pulsewidth modulation gating pattern. Thus, the system minimizes the transducer count and, therefore, enhances reliability and ruggedness. Experimental results show that the <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> can be reconstructed and its rms value controlled {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions with errors of at most 4 %. Moreover, the use of the space-vector modulation technique ensures a reduced <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> harmonic distortion, which remains within the 5 % range at nominal voltage and for all load conditions. The paper presents the DSP algorithms required for the operation of the system and key experimental results obtained on a three-phase 208 -V 60 -Hz 2 -kVA prototype unit.

40|$|Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is used {{to provide}} <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> support and protect {{sensitive}} <b>load</b> during <b>voltage</b> sags situation. However, voltage sags do not appear frequently and hence the utilization of the DVR is low. In order to increase the utilization of the DVR, the DVR should operate to compensate any <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> instability especially the <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> harmonics and source voltage variations in steady-state operation. A boundary controller using a second-order switching surface is proposed for DVR application for both voltage sags and power quality control under steady-state condition. The switching surface is derived to estimate the state trajectory movement of the DVR after a hypothesized switching action. It results in a high state trajectory velocity along the switching surface. This phenomenon accelerates the trajectory moving towards the target operating point. The dynamic performance of the DVR is verified experimentally with distorted supply <b>voltages,</b> non-linear <b>loads</b> and distorted <b>voltage</b> sag situation. Experimental results confirm that the proposed boundary control scheme can achieve better harmonic compensation performance than some other control methods. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} an active voltage conditioner. This voltage conditioner is useful for power distribution systems in which power quality issue is of primary concern. The voltage conditioner consists a static var compensator (SVC) and a series active voltage conditioner (AVC). The SVC type is a thyristor-controlled reactor (TCR). When using the SVC configuration individually, {{it is found that}} the rms value of <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> is kept close to a desired/pre-set rms value, but unfortunately a considerate amount of harmonics is noted in the <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> waveform.

Thus, an AVC is introduced in series with the SVC to take care of harmonics cancellation. The AVC is made of a single phase full wave bridge rectifier, a bridge inverter, and a series transformer. The bridge inverter is controlled by a simple hysterisis control circuit. When using the AVC in conjunction with the SVC, it showed the <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> is kept near the desired rms value and no more than 0. 98 % total harmonic distortion factor (THD) is found its waveform.

40|$|The {{balancing}} of <b>weld</b> work <b>load</b> between executing {{stations and}} its robots {{has a significant}} influence on achievable production rate and equipment utilization. However, no automatic simulation based method for line balancing has been formulated up to this point. In practice, it is still manually conducted. Therefore in this work we propose two novel methods for <b>load</b> balancing of <b>welds</b> in multi station sheet metal assembly lines to minimize line cycle time. The methods are based on superimposition of the scenes/geometries of all line stations, with maintained robot positioning relative to the work piece, creating a "multi station". The <b>weld</b> <b>load</b> is balanced between all multi station robots, whereupon the individual robots are combined into stations and coordinated station wise for simultaneous operation. Furthermore one of the proposed methods reduces the subsequent need for robot coordination, by introducing some restrictions on the load balancing: Firstly, for each robo t, the <b>weld</b> <b>load</b> is balanced over the other station robots such that the working envelopes are maximally separated. Secondly, for each robot, the <b>weld</b> <b>load</b> is balanced over equivalently positioned robots in other line stations, based on previous station load balancing techniques. The proposed line balancing methods are applied on two industrial case studies which each involves the balancing of about 200 automotive stud welds between 3 stations, each of 4 robots. One of the proposed methods produces line cycle times close {{to that of the}} slowest uncoordinated robot, which can be considered a theoretical optimum of the line cycle time.

40|$|Abstract—A series {{active power}} filter {{working as a}} {{sinusoidal}} current source, in phase with the mains voltage, has been devel-oped and tested. The amplitude of the fundamental current in the series filter is controlled through the error signal generated between the <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> and a preestablished reference. The control allows an effective correction of power factor, harmonic distortion, and <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> regulation. Compared with previous methods of control developed for series active filters, this method is simpler to implement, because it is only required to generate a sinusoidal current, in phase with the mains voltage, the amplitude of which is controlled through the error in the <b>load</b> <b>voltage.</b> The proposed system has been studied analytically and tested using computer simulations and experiments. In the experiments, it has been verified that the filter keeps the line current almost sinusoidal and in phase with the line voltage supply.
