Wings for My Flight {{documents}} Houle's {{observations of}} a pair of the then-endangered peregrine falcons at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in Colorado, while employed by the Colorado Division of Wildlife in the summer of 1975. To protect the falcons, Houle had to halt a million-dollar project to turn ancient Anasazi ruins in the area into a tourist attraction and faced opposition and harassment by the Chimney Rock community as a result. The community eventually showed concern for Houle, however, after her trailer was broken into and vandalized.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{holistic}} planned grazing {{began in}} the 1960s when Allan Savory, a <b>wildlife</b> <b>biologist</b> in his native Southern Rhodesia, set out to understand desertification. This {{can be seen in}} the context of the larger environmental movement. Heavily influenced by the work of André Voisin and the ineffectiveness of mainstream rangeland science of the time, Savory concluded that the spread of deserts, the loss of wildlife, and the human impoverishment that always resulted were related to the reduction of the natural herds of large grazers and even more, the change in behavior of those few remaining herds. Livestock could be substituted to provide important ecosystem services like nutrient cycling when mimicking those uniquely coevolved grasses and grazers. But managers had found that while rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management purposes, scientific experiments had demonstrated that they do not necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. An adaptive management plan was needed for the integration of the experiential with the experimental, as well as the social with the biophysical, to provide a more comprehensive framework for the management of rangeland systems. None of these sources of knowledge could be understood except in the context of the whole. Holistic management was developed to meet that need.|$|E
25|$|Kodiak bear {{research}} and habitat protection is done cooperatively by the ADF and Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. Bear hunting is {{managed by the}} ADF, and hunting regulations are established by the Alaska Board of Game. Currently, a finely tuned management system distributes hunters in 32 different areas during two seasons (spring: April 1 – May 15, and fall: October 25 – November 30). Each year, about 4,500 people apply for the 496 permits offered for Kodiak bear hunts (two-thirds to Alaska residents, one-third to nonresidents). Nonresidents are required to hire a registered guide who is authorized to hunt in a particular area, and this can cost from $10,000–$22,000. All hunters must come into the Alaska Department of Fish and Game office in Kodiak prior to going into the field for a brief orientation and must check out before they leave the island. Every bear that is legally killed on the archipelago must be inspected by an ADF <b>wildlife</b> <b>biologist</b> {{before it can be}} taken from the islands. Pelts receive a stamp from an ADF officer if the hunter and guide provide proper documentation to prove licensing. Pelts cannot be transported or legally preserved or sold without the official stamp. Hunting laws are strictly enforced by the ADF officers who often have the full support of the local community. Illegal hunting and fishing is frowned upon by the community which maintains a healthy respect for the island's environmental laws, as well. Stiff penalties accompany illegal hunting and fishing. The island's remote location makes trafficking in illegal pelts difficult for would-be poachers.|$|E

[...] David M. Schwartz, in the May 1992 edition of Smithsonian, praised Houle's prose in Wings for My Flight, and wrote that the story is [...] "told with a charming simplicity in fewer than 200 pages". Schwartz also praised Houle for including her notational system for documenting field observations, stating that it [...] "opens a window on field biology". Writing in the Library Journal, Henry T. Armistead referred to the book as [...] "well crafted and compelling, a dramatization of the classic conflict between the legitimate interests of conservationists and developers", and, [...] "highly recommended on several levels, as science, sociology, or a story". Andrew Gulliford, a professor of history and environmental studies at Fort Lewis College, noted in The Durango Herald the significance of Houle's efforts to prevent [...] "inappropriate development" [...] at Chimney Rock, which was proclaimed a U.S. National Monument by President Barack Obama in 2012. [...] "Wings for My Flight is a personal story", wrote Gulliford, [...] "but also a chronicle of environmental success. Without a doubt, peregrines saved Chimney Rock for the rest of us." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{events of}} Wings for My Flight take place {{throughout}} 1975. Marcy Cottrell Houle (then [...] "Marcy Cottrell"), a 21-year-old <b>wildlife</b> <b>biologist,</b> is sent by her supervisor, Barry Layne, to the U.S. Forest Service office near Chimney Rock in Colorado, where {{a pair of}} peregrine falcons reside. The pair {{is one of only}} seven pairs remaining in the Rocky Mountains region. Mr. Preston Fitch, an administrator involved with the peregrine falcon project, criticizes Houle for her lack of experience in the field upon meeting her. Nevertheless, Mr. Fitch introduces Houle to Chimney Rock. He explains that the Forest Service spent {{more than half a million}} dollars building a road which led to Chimney Rock; work on the road had to be discontinued upon discovery of the falcons. Further, the Chimney Rock area is home to 250 Anasazi ruins dated between 900 and 1100. The Chimney Rock community had been planning a million-dollar development to build a tourist attraction for the ruins. Houle spends several weeks with the peregrine falcons, recording her observations in her notebook. In spite of her initial attempt at maintaining an impersonal relationship with the falcons, Houle names the female peregrine [...] "Jenny" [...] and the male [...] "King Arthur". In the middle of June, after Houle had spent several days of making field observations alone and with limited equipment, Mr. Fitch introduces Houle to her teammate, Alex Porter. He also provides them with a garbage truck for transportation.|$|E
500|$|According to Bowen, she was [...] "not a wolf person" [...] before penning Wolf: The Journey Home. [...] A {{language}} arts teacher at Flathead High School in northwest Montana {{and a former}} op-ed columnist for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, she stated that she read news reports about the Pleasant Valley wolf pack in the Daily Inter Lake, {{but it was the}} death of one of the Ninemile pups that spurred her to write the novel. In her words, it was [...] "one death too many" [...] from the many non-accidental deaths of the wolves, and she felt the [...] "story needed to be told". She spent four years studying wolves in preparation for writing the novel, particularly the lives of a pack of wolves that were part of the federal wolf relocation program and who were documented in records kept by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The pack formed in the spring of 1989 in Pleasant Valley, Montana. As in the novel, the alpha male was killed, mistaken for a dog by a rancher, {{and the rest of the}} pack was trapped, except the one pup that escaped. They were held in Kalispell until they could be transferred to Glacier Park. Using radio collars, biologists were able to track the pack members from their release to their eventual fates, as depicted in the novel. The pups born to Marta and Greatfoot were born in Spring 1990 in Ninemile Valley, an area near Missoula. When they stopped receiving a signal for Marta, authorities searched for her body for weeks until her broken radio collar was found in a creek. Mike Jimenez, then a <b>wildlife</b> <b>biologist</b> and the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader, was the man in the blue truck who tracked and monitored the pack in the novel and fed the pups after the death of Greatfoot.|$|E
