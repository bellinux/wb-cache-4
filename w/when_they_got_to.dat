25|$|Jobs {{traveled}} to India in mid-1974 to visit Neem Karoli Baba at his Kainchi ashram with his Reed friend (and eventual Apple employee) Daniel Kottke, {{in search of}} spiritual enlightenment. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the Neem Karoli ashram, it was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973. Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji. In India, they {{spent a lot of}} time on bus rides from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.|$|E
25|$|The Melbourne Games {{also saw}} {{the high point of}} Australian female sprinting with Betty Cuthbert winning three gold medals at the MCG. She won the 100m and 200m and {{anchored}} the winning 4 x 100m team. Born in Merrylands in Sydney’s west she was a champion schoolgirl athlete and had already broken the world record for the 200m just before the 1956 Games. She was to be overshadowed by her Western Suburbs club member, the Marlene Matthews. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the Games, Matthews was the overwhelming favourite especially for the 100m a distance over which Cuthbert had beaten her just once.|$|E
25|$|The gangsters drove Kilroy {{through the}} back {{streets of the city}} and past an {{industrial}} area. The number of bars and vendor stands in the street began to thin out as they drove Kilroy through a highway in the city's outskirts. The gangsters then turned to a dirt road that stretched between two corn fields. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the private ranch known as Santa Elena, they left Kilroy inside the car overnight. Shortly after dawn, the ranch's caretaker went to see Kilroy and fed him bread, eggs, and water. About twelve hours after Kilroy was kidnapped, Contanzo and his men came to see him. They wrapped his face and mouth with duct tape and walked him through a field to a storage cabin with his hands still tied around his back.|$|E

25|$|That night, Matamoros {{was flooded}} with 15,000 spring {{tourists}} from the U.S. on the city's main tourist street, Álvaro Obregón. The sidewalks, street, and night clubs were packed with foreign tourists looking to enjoy cheap alcohol and enjoy Mexico's lax drinking laws. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Matamoros, Kilroy and his friends {{decided to go to}} the bar with the shortest waiting line. They ended up at Los Sombreros, a bar with rock music and bright neon. After a few drinks, Kilroy and his friends left Los Sombreros and wandered to London Pub, which rebranded itself as Hardrock Café for spring break. This bar was louder and wilder than Los Sombreros, and Kilroy and his friends stood at the bar while other tourists threw beer from the balcony. Kilroy met with a few girls at the bar and was not seen by his friends for a while. Around 2:00a.m. CT, Bill suggested the group head back to South Padre Island. As his friends stepped out of London Pub, they saw Kilroy leaning against a car and talking to a girl from Miss Tanline. Across Álvaro Obregón street, thousands of tourists were leaving the bars and heading to Brownsville, but others moved in different directions. The large crowd of people made it difficult for Kilroy and his friends to walk across the border uninterrupted and in a group.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the party made camp, very little food {{remained}} from the supplies that Stanton had brought back from Sutter's Fort. [...] The oxen began to die and their carcasses were frozen and stacked. Truckee Lake was not yet frozen, but the pioneers were unfamiliar with catching lake trout. Eddy, the most experienced hunter, killed a bear, but had little luck after that. The Reed and Eddy families had lost almost everything and Margret Reed promised to pay double <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> California {{for the use of}} three oxen from the Graves and Breen families. Graves charged Eddy $25—normally the cost of two healthy oxen—for the carcass of an ox that had starved to death.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there {{was likely to be}} a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut. I wanted to go back to get my money back but John said: 'No, we'd better not. Might cause trouble.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{negotiations}} that followed were called the Naples Conference, with Tito, Velebit and Olga {{on one side}} of the table and Churchill and Maclean on the other. Churchill was happy to give this matter his personal attention, and, Maclean says, he did it very well. One day the two leaders were taking a rest, having handed things over to a committee of experts, when a matter arose required Churchill's immediate attention. Maclean was sent to find him; he was believed to be bathing in the Bay of Naples. [...] <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the shore, they saw the huge flotilla of troopships setting off for the south of France (Operation Dragoon), and a small bright blue [...] dodging around them. Maclean was assigned a little torpedo boat, complete with a cautious captain and an attractive stenographer. It zoomed after the barge, eventually catching up with the prime minister, who found Maclean and his crew's arrival a source of much hilarity.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2006 {{six members}} of an Ashland, Oregon, family were {{stranded}} in their snowbound motor home for two weeks. In addition to the two Stivers, the group included Stivers's parents, the Higginbothams; and the Stivers' two children. The RV was stranded on the spur road to Calvert Airstrip near its intersection with the BLM Glendale-to-Powers Bike Route after that road passes Marial Junction, about [...] west of Glendale. Unlike the route of James Kim and his family who turned west up BLM 34-8-36 toward Bear Camp Road and Gold Beach, the Stivers-Higginbotham group took a different road, having missed the turnoff that the Kims took toward Bear Camp {{at the start of}} BLM 34-8-36. Stivers-Higginbotham's route went north through Galice and on to Grave Creek, there crossing the bridge over the Rogue River, and next, heading north up Mount Reuben Road. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the Glendale-to-Powers bike route, they turned west where they later became stuck in snow on the BLM airstrip spur, while trying to head back down it after turning around at the airstrip. Their RV had become stuck north of the Rogue River in March, about [...] north-northeast, geographically, from where the Kims' car was stranded in late November 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} late 1994, and proceeded midway through 1995 in RZA's basement studio in Staten Island, the same studio {{that many of}} the group's earlier albums were recorded in. In regard to Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's original recording intentions, RZA recounted [...] "They had wanted to go to Barbados. But <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Barbados, the racism was so crazy. It was on some slave mentality. The Blacks was being treated like shit. They stopped back, and everything was recorded in my basement. No engineer, no assistant engineer. I did everything on that shit. The only two albums I did with nobody fucking with me was Linx and Liquid Swords. I was on a mission. To make all those early albums took {{three and a half years}} of my life. I didn't come outside, didn't have too many girl relations, didn't even enjoy the shit. I just stayed in the basement. Hours and hours and days and days. Turkey burgers and blunts. I didn't know if it was working. But nobody could hear or say nothing, no comments, no touching the board when I leave. Everything was just how I wanted it." [...] Regarding the recording atmosphere, Raekwon stated [...] "The way RZA had it poppin' back then, we would come into his spot. It was like dudes would come in on their own time and create stuff. I remember I just came in, and the beats was just pumpin'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once he had recovered, Stirling {{involved}} him in {{preparations for}} a larger SAS attack on Benghazi. They attended a dinner with Churchill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Alan Brooke, and General Harold Alexander, {{who was about to}} assume control of Middle East Command, the post responsible for the overall conduct of the campaign in the North African desert. Four operations were designed to create a diversion from Rommel's attempt on El Alamein: attacks on Benghazi (Operation Bigamy), Tobruk, Barce, and the Jalo oasis. [...] These all started out from Kufra, an oasis 800 miles inland. [...] Maclean's convoy drove to the Gebel across the Sand Sea at its narrowest point, Zighen, and made it there undetected, although [...] "bazaar gossip" [...] from an Arab spy indicated that the enemy expected an imminent attack. When Maclean's group reached the outskirts of Benghazi, they were ambushed and had to retreat. [...] Axis planes repeatedly bombed them, destroying many of the vehicles and most of their supplies. Thus began a painful limp of days and nights over the desert towards Jalo, without even knowing whether that oasis was in Allied hands. They existed on rations of [...] "a cup of water and a tablespoon of bully beef a day.... We found ourselves looking forward to the evening meal with painful fixity". <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> that oasis, they found a battle going on between the Italian defenders and the Sudan Defence Force, and despite their offers to help, they received orders from GHQ to abandon the assault. [...] Some days later they made it back to Kufra.|$|E
2500|$|While touring Australia, {{the group}} {{received}} word that EMI UK were {{pleased with the}} new album, and in February the label released [...] "I'm Your Satisfier" [...] as the first UK single. In April Choice Cuts was released in Australia to widespread acclaim, reaching #11 on the Go-Set Top 20 Album Charts. They made numerous TV appearances, including a three-song live set for the ABC's GTK which included a live-in-the-studio performance of [...] "Future of Our Nation". In Melbourne they played a concert at the Town Hall, supported by Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs. When Choice Cuts was released in the UK it was well received by critics, but the band were still in Australia and short of money, they could do little to exploit their opportunities. As the tour dragged on, they began to falter, and endured ripoffs by unscrupulous promoters. They had reached another low ebb, with the chances of returning to UK now reduced, the band reluctantly decided to split up. On the verge of the break-up, EMI's John Halsall called from London to inform them that Choice Cuts was receiving glowing notices in the English music press, including a rave review in Melody Maker. He told them it was selling well in UK and starting to make an impression in Europe—the track [...] "I'm Your Satisfier" [...] had been released in France and {{had gone into the}} Top 10 there. Halsall urged them to return to London as soon as possible and that {{they would be able to}} record a new album there, so they hastily organised their return. They decided to take the boat rather than fly (to save money) so Wheatley again approached the Sitmar Line. To their delight, Sitmar offered them another complimentary trip and EMI agreed to finance another LP <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> London.|$|E
