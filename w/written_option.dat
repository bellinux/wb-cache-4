40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} {{self-financing}} trading strategy that minimizes the expected shortfall locally when hedging a European contingent claim. A positive shortfall occurs if the hedger {{is not willing}} to follow a perfect hedging or a superhedging strategy. In contrast to the classical variance criterion, the expected shortfall criterion depends only on undesirable outcomes where the terminal value of the <b>written</b> <b>option</b> exceeds the terminal value of the hedge portfolio. Searching a strategy which minimizes the expected shortfall is equivalent to the iterative solution of linear programs whose number increases exponentially with respect to the number of trading dates. Therefore, we partition this complex overall problem into several one-period problems and minimize the expected shortfall only locally, i. e., only over the next trading period. This approximation is quite accurate and the number of linear programs to be solved increases only linearly with respect to the number of trading dates...|$|E

40|$|<b>Writing</b> an <b>option</b> is a taxable {{event for}} Australian investors.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that trading frictions have an economically important impact on the execution and the profitability of option strategies that involve writing out-of-the money put options.

The economic effect of frictions is stronger when the investor seeks to <b>write</b> <b>options</b> more aggressively.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the pattern of}} stock option time value decay {{and the implications of}} the time value decay pattern for <b>option</b> <b>writing</b> strategies. I also consider the returns to various <b>options</b> <b>writing</b> strategies. The central question is whether option writers can utilize a writing strategy that captures the time value of options as revenue to cover their risks and provides return on their investments. 	 Using transaction data, I find that the time value of options that are near-the-money decays at a decreasing rate. The implications of this result are that {{a significant portion of the}} time value of near-the-money options decays in the early days of <b>writing</b> an <b>option</b> and the decay slows down as time to expiry approaches. This motivates us to compare over the same holding periods the <b>writing</b> returns of <b>options</b> with long times to expiry with the returns of options with short times to expiry. Overall, the results suggest that trading of options face significant transaction costs and it is mainly motivated by hedging or speculation as I did not find a systematic way to profit from <b>option</b> <b>writing</b> strategies. In addition, I examine the impact of market sentiment on the time value of options. The period of the study includes a sub-period when the general trend in the stock market was positive and another sub-period when the trend was negative. In particular, I study the price of puts relative to the price of calls during these two distinct market periods. I find that during bear markets both call and put options are more expensive than call and put options during bull markets. Yet, the ratio of put premiums to call premiums during rising markets is generally higher than the same ratio during bear markets. This observation suggests that speculators may be the dominant traders in options markets. Overall, I find that <b>option</b> <b>writing</b> strategies are not profitable. One of the reasons for this observation is transaction costs, which are significant in all the strategies that I examine. The bid-ask spread in the options market is large in comparison to the bid-ask spread in the underlying stock market...|$|R

40|$|Margin {{requirements}} {{are designed to}} control the default risk inherent to commitments undertaken by traders <b>writing</b> <b>options.</b> Much like similar institutions, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange first adopted a system based on the Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN), which sets required levels of options margin {{according to the most}} pessimistic of 16 possible outcomes. Seeking to lower the probability of default without adversely affecting liquidity, the Exchange switched in 2001 to a more detailed margin system based on the most pessimistic of 44 scenarios. This unique change provides an ideal laboratory for testing the impact of increased margining precision on the efficiency of option trading. Based on a sample of over 3 million transactions, this study demonstrates that the more accurate pricing of default risk over the studied range increases efficiency by a number of measures, including a smaller implied standard deviation and deviations from put-call parity.
