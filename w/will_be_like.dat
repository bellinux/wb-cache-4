5|$|The Square Enix staff {{decided to}} develop Dream Drop Distance after being {{impressed}} {{by the quality of}} the Nintendo 3DS. Taking advantage of the console's functions, they increased the action elements from the series based on the system previously seen in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. Additionally, both the gameplay and the plot are meant to give a glimpse about what the following title in the series, Kingdom Hearts III, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> The game has been well received in Japan and in the US, selling over 250,000 and 180,000 units on its debuts respectively.|$|E

25|$|A {{planet that}} is too small cannot hold much of an atmosphere. Hence the surface {{temperature}} becomes more variable and the average temperature drops. Substantial and long-lasting oceans become impossible. A small planet will also {{tend to have a}} rough surface, with large mountains and deep canyons. The core will cool faster, and plate tectonics will either not last as long as they would on a larger planet or may not occur at all. A planet {{that is too}} large will retain too much of its atmosphere and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Venus. Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, but has a surface atmosphere pressure that is 92 times that of Earth's. Venus mean surface temperature is 735 K (462°C; 863°F) making Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System. Earth had a similar early atmosphere to Venus, but lost it in the giant impact event.|$|E

25|$|If Plato's {{important}} dialogues do {{not refer}} to Socrates' execution explicitly, they allude to it, or use characters or themes that {{play a part in}} it. Five dialogues foreshadow the trial: In the Theaetetus (210d) and the Euthyphro (2a–b) Socrates tells people that he is about to face corruption charges. In the Meno (94e–95a), {{one of the men who}} brings legal charges against Socrates, Anytus, warns him about the trouble he may get into if he does not stop criticizing important people. In the Gorgias, Socrates says that his trial <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a doctor prosecuted by a cook who asks a jury of children to choose between the doctor's bitter medicine and the cook's tasty treats (521e–522a). In the Republic (7.517e), Socrates explains why an enlightened man (presumably himself) will stumble in a courtroom situation. The Apology is Socrates' defense speech, and the Crito and Phaedo take place in prison after the conviction. In the Protagoras, Socrates is a guest at the home of Callias, son of Hipponicus, a man whom Socrates disparages in the Apology as having wasted a great amount of money on sophists' fees.|$|E

Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> saying I played with Babe Ruth." [...] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, [...] "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody...

500|$|Beatrice's {{life was}} {{overturned}} {{by the death}} of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901.

I, who had hardly ever been separated from my dear mother, can hardly realise what life <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> without her, who was the centre of everything." [...] Beatrice's public appearances continued, but her position at court was diminished. She, unlike her sister Louise, was not close to her brother, now King Edward VII, and {{was not included in the}} King's inner circle. Although their relationship did not break down completely, it was occasionally strained, for example when she accidentally (but noisily) dropped her service book from the royal gallery onto a table of gold plate during his coronation.|$|E

500|$|Friedrich said, [...] "The artist should paint {{not only}} what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him. If, however, he sees nothing within him, then he should also refrain from {{painting}} that which he sees before him. Otherwise, his pictures <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> those folding screens behind which one expects to find only the sick or the dead." [...] Expansive skies, storms, mist, forests, ruins and crosses bearing witness {{to the presence of}} God are frequent elements in Friedrich's landscapes. Though death finds symbolic expression in boats that move away from shore—a Charon-like motif—and in the poplar tree, it is referenced more directly in paintings like The Abbey in the Oakwood (1808–10), in which monks carry a coffin past an open grave, toward a cross, and through the portal of a church in ruins.|$|E
500|$|The album's first song, [...] "I Worship You" [...] was {{described}} as [...] "falling somewhere between adult contemporary and rock", and utilizes acoustic guitars and synthesizers. [...] "Here Am I" [...] relates the story {{of people who are}} not being reached by Christians, and [...] "challenges the listener {{to go out into the}} world and stand up for their King". [...] "On My Way to You" [...] is a worship song, requesting [...] "wisdom, purity, and humility in our pursuit of holiness". [...] "How Great is Your Love" [...] incorporates both string and electronic instruments; Millard's vocals in the song utilize [...] "effect–laden delays". [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] is a ballad, opening with just piano before building to include drums and guitar. Lyrically, it asks what it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> in Heaven, standing before God.|$|E
500|$|In this series, the {{character}} of the Black Adder is somewhat different from later incarnations, being largely unintelligent, naive, and snivelling. The character does evolve through the series, however, and he begins showing signs of what his descendants <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> by the final episode, where he begins insulting everyone around him and making his own plans. This evolution follows naturally from {{the character}}'s situation. [...] "The Black Adder" [...] is the title that Edmund adopts during the first episode (after first considering [...] "The Black Vegetable"). Presumably one of his descendants adopted it as a surname before Blackadder II, in which the title character becomes [...] "Edmund Blackadder". [...] Furthermore, Baldrick is shown in more favourable and intelligent light here - his 'cunning plans' are typiclly superior and more workable than Edmund's own. [...] Starting from the second series, the character's relative intelligence and naivety clearly switch.|$|E

[...] Milo does not accept the word of the demon of insincerity that he is a threat and is rewarded by learning he is not. Just for a moment, Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to do the same. According to Liston, Milo [...] "transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities".|$|E
500|$|Enough Said was {{the fifth}} film written and {{directed}} by Nicole Holofcener. After the release of her fourth film, Please Give (2010), she was approached by Matthew Greenfield and Claudia Lewis from Fox Searchlight, who offered to produce Holofcener's next project on the condition that it was more mainstream than her previous films. She wrote three drafts of the screenplay over six months. The premise was partly inspired by Holofcener's own life as a divorced mother of two teenagers and her [...] "feelings and fears about what [...] life <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> when [...] kids go away". While writing the film, she said, [...] "I was having thoughts about my ex-husband and my new boyfriend and thinking about being married and how I'm trying to have a relationship that's happier the second time." [...] Small details of the plot were also drawn from her life; Albert's guacamole-eating habit was inspired by a story that her boyfriend told her about his ex-wife.|$|E
500|$|This {{idea was}} not new, since William H. Seward, the former Secretary of State under the administrations of various presidents, among them Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant, had {{stressed}} that a canal be built either in Honduras, Nicaragua or Panama {{and that the}} United States annex the Dominican Republic and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba. The idea of annexing the Dominican Republic failed to receive {{the approval of the}} U.S. Senate and Spain did not accept the 160 million dollars which the U.S. offered for Puerto Rico and Cuba. Mahan made the following statement to the War Department: [...] "Having therefore no foreign establishments either colonial or military, the ships of war of the United States, in war <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> land birds, unable to fly far from their own shores. To provide resting places for them where they can coal and repair, {{would be one of the}} first duties of a government proposing to itself the development of the power of the nation at sea." ...|$|E

500|$|Rowan Kaiser, of The A.V. Club, gave a mixed {{review of}} the episode, commenting on the show's {{increasing}} focus on rape. He wrote that [...] "There are things that I appreciate about the focus on rape. [...] It's fairly rare for a show to treat rape from the victim's perspective." [...] However, {{he went on to}} state that he had [...] "pretty significant issues" [...] with the subject matter as well. He also disapproved of the killer's choice of victims, setting, and new characters, especially Piz. Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B". Reviewer Alan Sepinwall was fairly positive towards the episode. He was mixed towards the inclusion of the Kendall-Keith-Cormac storyline in the premiere, but he also praised the new cast members: [...] "Piz and Parker both add new colors to the gang, though it's hard to say what Parker <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> post-rape." [...] He eventually called the episode a [...] "pretty good start".|$|E
500|$|The album's songs also feature offbeat sounds, improvisational elements, and {{conversational}} vocals {{derived from}} rap. The Revival {{begins with a}} directive from a grave voice: [...] "Play this record as frequently as possible, Then, as it becomes easier for you, play the record once a day, or as needed." [...] The album also features dialogue between an old lady who asks the group whether it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> their last album, on which she was also featured; they respond to her question [...] "No, ma'am". [...] "All the Way" [...] has a scrambling beat, whistle sounds, and the rhythmic call and response [...] "What are we, what are we, what are we? ... Just a bunch of brothers having a party". The end of [...] "Feels Good" [...] features witty jazz keyboard playing behind a lively voice saying [...] "it feels good ... in the hands, feet, bones, heart, and soul". Ed Hogan of Allmusic writes that [...] "the last part sounds like a Sunday morning testimonial." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Daddy" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé as well as Mark Batson. It is the final song on Dangerously in Love, and is a hidden track on some copies. Beyoncé {{initially}} {{was not going to}} include the song on the album, however after undergoing multiple push-backs, she was able to work on extra material for the album which included [...] "Daddy". Over forty-three songs were recorded for Dangerously in Love, all of which were overseen by father Mathew, however Beyoncé secretly planted the song on the album as a hidden track which left Mathew speechless out of shock and appreciation. He later revealed during an interview with Billboard magazine in 2009: [...] "My favorite songs is... 'Daddy'... It basically says 'Thank you for all you've given me and when I marry a man, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> my daddy'". Preceding the album's release, the song was released to iTunes Store exclusively in the United States on June 23, 2003, through Columbia Records.
