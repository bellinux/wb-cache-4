50|$|Cross-linking is the {{chemical}} process to produce textiles with <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance.</b> <b>Wrinkle</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is achieved by}} the crosslinking of cellulose chains to stop the molecules from moving when in contact with water or other environmental stress. Cotton cellulose polymer comprises three different regions: the crystalline region, the amorphous region, and an intermediate region between them. Although in the crystalline region the cellulose chains are closely arranged, limiting their mobility, chains in the amorphous and intermediate regions are bonded together by weaker bonds making them more susceptible to breaking. There {{are two types of}} crosslinkers, which are {{the chemical}}s that bond together cellulose chains, the fist ones only bond cellulose chains, while the second self-polymerize resins as well.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Burkholderia thailandensis is a non-pathogenic {{environmental}} saprophyte {{closely related}} to Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of the often fatal animal and human disease melioidosis. To study B. thailandensis genomic variation, we profiled 50 isolates using a pan-genome microarray comprising genomic elements from 28 Burkholderia strains and species. Results Of 39 genomic regions variably present across the B. thailandensis strains, 13 regions corresponded to known genomic islands, while 26 regions were novel. Variant B. thailandensis isolates exhibited isolated acquisition of a capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster (B. pseudomallei-like capsular polysaccharide) closely resembling a similar cluster in B. pseudomallei that is essential for virulence in mammals; presence of this cluster was confirmed by whole genome sequencing of a representative variant strain (B. thailandensis E 555). Both whole-genome microarray and multi-locus sequence typing analysis revealed that the variant strains formed part of a phylogenetic subgroup distinct from the ancestral B. thailandensis population and were associated with atypical isolation sources {{when compared to the}} majority of previously described B. thailandensis strains. In functional assays, B. thailandensis E 555 exhibited several B. pseudomallei-like phenotypes, including colony <b>wrinkling,</b> <b>resistance</b> to human complement binding, and intracellular macrophage survival. However, in murine infection assays, B. thailandensis E 555 did not exhibit enhanced virulence relative to other B. thailandensis strains, suggesting that additional factors are required to successfully colonize and infect mammals. Conclusions The discovery of such novel variant strains demonstrates how unbiased genomic surveys of non-pathogenic isolates can reveal insights into the development and emergence of new pathogenic species...|$|R

40|$|Synthetic fibers, mainly {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET), polyamide (PA), polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and polypropylene (PP), {{are the most}} widely used polymers in the textile industry. These fibers surpass the production of natural fibers with a market share of 54. 4 %. The advantages of these fibers are their high modulus and strength, stiffness, stretch or elasticity, <b>wrinkle</b> and abrasion <b>resistances,</b> relatively low cost, convenient processing, tailorable performance and easy recycling. The downside to synthetic fibers use are reduced wearing comfort, build-up of electrostatic charge, the tendency to pill, difficulties in finishing, poor soil release properties and low dyeability. These disadvantages are largely associated with their hydrophobic nature. To render their surfaces hydrophilic, various physical, chemical and bulk modification methods are employed to mimic the advantageous properties of their natural counterparts. This review is focused on the application of recent methods for the modification of synthetic textiles using physical methods (corona discharge, plasma, laser, electron beam and neutron irradiations), chemical methods (ozone-gas treatment, supercritical carbon dioxide technique, vapor deposition, surface grafting, enzymatic modification, sol-gel technique, layer-by-layer deposition of nano-materials, micro-encapsulation method and treatment with different reagents) and bulk modification methods by blending polymers with different compounds in extrusion to absorb different colorants. Nowadays, the bulk and surface functionalization of synthetic fibers for various applications is considered {{as one of the best}} methods for modern textile finishing processes (Tomasino, 1992). This last stage of textile processing has employed new routes to demonstrate the great potential of nano-science and technology for this industry (Lewin, 2007). Combination of physical technologies and nano-science enhances the durability of textile materials against washing, ultraviolet radiation, friction, abrasion, tension and fading (Kirk–Othmer, 1998). European methods for application of new functional finishing materials must meet high ethical demands for environmental-friendly processing (Fourne, 1999). For this purpose the process of textile finishing is optimized by different researchers in new findings (Elices & Llorca, 2002). Application of inorganic and organic nano-particles have enhanced synthetic fibers attributes, such as softness, durability, breathability, water repellency, fire retardancy and antimicrobial properties (Franz, 2003; McIntyre, 2005; Xanthos, 2005). This review article gives an application overview of various physical and chemical methods of inorganic and organic structured material as potential modifying agents of textiles with emphasis on dyeability enhancements. The composition of synthetic fibers includes polypropylene (PP), {{polyethylene terephthalate}} (PET), polyamides (PA) or polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Synthetic fibers already hold a 54 % market share in the fiber market. Of this market share, PET alone accounts for almost 50 % of all fiber materials in 2008 (Gubitz & Cavaco-Paulo, 2008). Polypropylene, a major component for the nonwovens market accounts for 10 % of the market share of both natural and synthetic fibers worldwide (INDA, 2008 and Aizenshtein, 2008). It is apparent that synthetic polymers have unique properties, such as high uniformity, mechanical strength and resistance to chemicals or abrasion. However, high hydrophobicity, the build-up of static charges, poor breathability, and resistant to finishing are undesirable properties of synthetic materials (Gubitz & Cavaco-Paulo, 2008). Synthetic textile fibers typically undergo a variety of pre-treatments before dyeing and printing is feasible. Compared to their cotton counterparts, fabrics made from synthetic fibers undergo mild scouring before dyeing. Nonetheless, these treatments still create undesirable process conditions which can result in increased waste production, unpleasant working conditions and higher energy consumption. Therefore reducing pollution in textile production is becoming of utmost importance for manufacturers worldwide. In coming years, the textile industry must implement sustainable technologies and develop environmentally safer methods for textiles processing to remain competitive (Agrawal et. al., 2008).

50|$|Heat {{setting is}} a term used in the textile {{industry}} to describe a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a dry heat environment. The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher volume, <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance</b> or temperature resistance. Very often, heat setting {{is also used to}} improve attributes for subsequent processes. Yarns tend to have increased torquing just after spinning, cabling or twisting. Heat setting can influence or even eliminate this tendency to undesirable torquing. At the winding, twisting, weaving, tufting and knitting processes, an increased tendency to torquing can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using heat setting for carpet yarns, desirable results include not only the diminishing of torquing but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber thread. Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results of the heat setting process. Heat setting benefits staple yarns as well as bulked continuous filament (BCF) yarns. Heat setting often causes synthetic fibers to gain volume as well. This volume growth is commonly described as “bulk development”. All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as heat setting. The term “thermal fixation” is used less frequently. In the carpet industry, the process is exclusively called “heat setting”.|$|E

40|$|To date, {{the demand}} for wrinkle-resistant cotton fabric has increased.

40|$|Graphene-based {{electronics}} show much promise due to {{the potential}} high charge-carrier mobility of the material {{as well as its}} flexibility in preparation on different substrates. Recently there has been much evidence suggesting that the wrinkle structures found in pristine graphene inhibit electron transport, reducing device performance. In this study the inhibiting role of standing wrinkles within chemically derived graphene are studied quantitatively using Kelvin force microscopy. Samples were evaluated before and after annealing at 250 C to observe changes in the channel’s surface potential dependence on the state of reduction. Annealed samples were found to have inter-flake and intra-flake contribution to the potential drop and that for the latter a correlation between the potential drop magnitude and wrinkle density is found, although there is no correlation with wrinkle height. Statistical averaging across many images demonstrated that the average lower limit of <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance</b> in these devices is approximately 4. 5 kΩ. Such high resistance demonstrate definitively that elimination of wrinkles within graphene oxide based devices is essential in order to obtain optimum performance...|$|E
40|$|There {{are five}} low-stress {{mechanical}} properties (tensile, shearing, bending, surface, and compression) {{that affect the}} fabric handle. Dimethyloldihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU) is a conventional agent for imparting wrinkle-resistant properties to cotton fabric. DMDHEU-crosslinked fabrics provide excellent wrinkle recovery properties but may affect the fabric hand. In this study, fabrics treated for <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance</b> were assessed by the Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabric (KES-F), which objectively evaluates low-stress mechanical properties of textiles.

40|$|Durable press {{finishing}} {{processes are}} generally {{used in the}} textile industry to produce wrinkle-free fabrics and garments. A durable press finishing agent forms covalent bonds with cellulosic hydroxyl groups, thus crosslinking the cellulose molecules. The cross linking of cellulose increase creases resistance of treated fabrics, {{and in the case}} of cotton, reduces its strength. Crease recovery angle (CRA) and tensile strength are the two most important parameters which are used to evaluate the performance of the crosslinked cellulosic fabrics and garments. In this study, we investigated the effect of DMDHEU resin on the crosslinking of cotton, bamboo, tencel and viscose fabrics. Three levels of resin concentration and four levels of curing temperature were employed for crosslinking treatments. The curing time was kept at 4 min in all the cases. The results show that the crease recovery angle has improved in all the cases and the improvement was found to be excellent for viscose, With the exception of cotton, in all the other cases, the tensile strength was unchanged. Thus resin treatment is strongly recommended for bamboo, viscose and tencel fabrics as it is found to improve <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance</b> without causing any deterioration in strength...|$|E
40|$|The <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance</b> {{treatment}} {{together with}} plasma pretreatment is especially {{very important to}} cotton fabrics because of their high wrinkling tendency. However, the processes improved the wrinkle recovery property of cotton fabrics, but, at the same time, may worsen the fabric handle, which {{is an important factor}} when designing the end-uses of fabric because handling of fabric also a critical factor for purchasing decision. The Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabrics (KES-F) measures the scale of "basic hand" and "total hand" values determined by the combined results of sensory tests conducted by the instrumental measurements. In the present article, the effects of plasma treatment and catalyzed 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) treatment on the fabric yellowing are also studied. The results found that the wrinkle-resistant treatment had a negative effect on the tensile properties, shearing properties, bending properties, and surface friction and variation, whereas the compressional properties are improved by the treatment. In addition, the plasma treatment improves the tensile properties and bending properties but not the compressional properties, shearing properties, and surface friction and variation. Besides, it is concluded that these treatments can influence not only the fabric handle but also the yellowness of fabrics. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
30|$|Polycarboxylic acids form ester cross-links through {{esterification}} reaction with hydroxyl {{groups of}} cellulose, {{in the presence}} of selective weak catalysts such as alkali metal salts of phosphorous containing inorganic acids, e.g. sodium hypophosphite providing high level of resiliency when cured, imparting <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance</b> and smooth drying properties without producing any bad odour and stiff handle. Citric acid is the most extensively studied polycarboxylic acid having advantage of being inexpensive, wide availability, non-toxic and environmentally acceptable. It shows only moderate effectiveness as durable press finishing agent due to the presence of an α-hydroxyl group in its molecule which hinders its esterification with cellulose (Andrews 1990; Andrews et al. 1993; Bhattacharyya et al. 1999; Kittinaovarut 2003; Schramm and Rinderer 2000; Welch and Peters 1997; Yatagai and Takahashi 2005, 2006). Yellowing of fabric occurs at high curing temperatures (> 175  °C) causing dehydration of the citric acid through formation of unsaturated polycarboxylic acids, such as aconitic acid, citraconic acid and itaconic acid; but exposing in open atmospheric moisture reverses the heat induced yellowing process to original whiteness (Choi 1993; Murray 1995; Schramm and Rinderer 1999; Welch and Peters 1999, 2000, 2002). During curing in presence of a catalyst, citric acid forms ester linkage (Welch and Peters 1997; Bhattacharyya et al. 1999); cross-links between two cellulose chains firstly by formatting a 5 -membered cyclic anhydride as reactive intermediate and then the reaction between cellulose and anhydride intermediate, which is pH dependent (Yang et al. 2000).|$|E
40|$|Seamless {{garments}} {{are popular}} knitted products nowadays. They {{are widely used}} as power stretchable underwear, outerwear and sportswear for which the use of high elastic yarns is indispensable. For seamless garments knitted with circular seamless machines, polyurethane (PU) /polyamide (PA) core-spun yarn is commonly used as the base yarn in a plating fabric to enhance the elasticity of the garment. However, the use of PU/PA core-spun yarn has encountered some problems, such as the difficulty in size control and the ageing of PU elastic yarn. In this study, the polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) /polyester (PET) bi-component filament was used to replace the PU/PA core-spun yarn {{for the development of}} seamless garments due to its excellent extensibility and elastic recovery property. The manufacturing processes, including knitting, pre-treatment, dyeing and finishing, were developed, and the end-use performance of the fabrics, which were respectively produced with the PTT/PET bi-component filament and PU/PA core-spun yarn as the base yarn and PA fiber as the face yarn for seamless garments, was compared based on the five different mechanical and physical properties. The results show that the fabric made of the PTT/PET bi-component filament has much better dimensional stability, much better elastic recovery property and much better <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance</b> than those of the fabric made of PU/PA core-spun yarn. It is expected that this study could help us to further exploit the use of the PTT/PET bi-component filament in the development of seamless garments in the future.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the mechanical and durable press properties of cotton woven apparels by applying nano-technology. Cotton fiber is an important material in the textile industry. However, its poor smoothness performance after laundering has caused {{a major problem in}} its application. Durable press finishing process can increase <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance</b> but also induce deleterious loss in mechanical strength in treated fabric due to the rigid cross-linking formed on the other hand. Nano-sized polymeric particles have been synthesized and characterized to solve this problem. A core-shell structure has been observed in the particles with functional polymer on the surface. Nano-particles exhibit functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic groups will react with hydroxyl groups present in the cellulosic fiber. After curing, those particles will form a film on the fabric surface which then will help to impart the mechanical strengths. The fabric treatment process is optimized by varying different parameters such as the proportion of cross-linking reagent and catalyst as well as the curing temperature and duration time. Results indicated that application of nano-particles will improve the tensile, tearing strength as well as the abrasion resistance of the treated fabric. Both tensile and tearing strength retentions are increased by at least 20 % when compared with native fabric. Rheological studies provided useful information for the particles under shear. Shearing thickening effect indicated the formation of clusters for the particles under shear. Optical rheological result suggested that fabric treatment with nano-particles should be not done under vigorous stirring in order to prevent agglomeration of particles...|$|E

30|$|Different {{types of}} {{finishes}} {{can be applied}} to fabrics used in chef’s clothing, mostly to offer resistance to soiling and make care of the clothing easier (e.g., stain repellency, <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance,</b> soil release finishes) (Chefwear 2012). Repellent finishes applied to a fabric, opposed to a waterproof membrane or coating, are particularly important when an important characteristic of the fabric is that it remains permeable to air, and hence allows water vapor to easily permeate (Gibson 2006; Holme 1993). Therefore, finishes which impart repellency to water and other liquids could also offer protection against scald injuries as hot water and other hot liquids may bead and run off the fabric rather than being absorbed into the fabric. Soil-release finishes, intended to make laundering more effective may be applied to fabrics with polyester fibers or wrinkle-resistant treated cotton fabrics. Since most soils are hydrophobic, the soil-release finishes tend to make the fiber surface more hydrophilic and thereby allow the diffusion of water and detergent into the soil-fiber interface and decreases the adhesion of the soil to the fibers (Holme 1993; Kissa 1981). Fluorochemicals are the most interesting class of chemical for textile finishing as they provide combined water and oil repellency to fabrics (Holme 1993). Teflon® is the best known polytetrafluoroethylene which is used for its water-repellent properties and labeled ‘superhydrophobic’. Its low coefficient of friction with many materials makes it ‘non-stick’ and is commonly used in cookware (Nilsson et al. 2010). For textiles to be used in scald protection, they should possess high water contact angles and low sliding angles so that the surface of the fabrics are slippery causing the water droplets to roll off {{from the surface of the}} fabric. These superhydrophobic fabrics are known to exhibit high repellency to cool water (25  °C), but with increasing water temperature, the surface tension decreases and hence repellency can be significantly lowered particularly to pressurized hot liquid (Liu et al. 2009). This was evident in the research by Lu et al. (2014), who found that liquid penetration (distilled water, canola oil, drilling fluid) through selected industrial fabrics increased as temperature increased (27, 55, 85  °C).|$|E

Durable press (DP) natural textiles are important consumer products usually achieved by crosslinking the molecules in the textiles to achieve long-term <b>wrinkle</b> <b>resistance,</b> which, however, also leads to the simultaneous significant drop of mechanical properties. Herein, a series of polymeric nanoparticles were investigated, the application of as little as ~ 0. 14 wt% addition of the nanoparticles improved the mechanical property of the DP cotton fabric by 56 % in tearing resistance and 100 % in abrasion resistance; the loss in recovery angle is negligible. The author also studied the enzyme-triggered DP treatments of silk fabrics, as a green process method. After the treatment of enzymes, excellent DP property was achieved with improved strain property. Injectable calcium phosphate powder containing acrylic bone cements are widely used in orthopedic surgery to fix artificial prostheses. However, the bending strength is still unsatisfactory. The author modified the surface of the strontium (Sr) containing hydroxyapatite (HA) filler powders with acrylolpamidronate in order to improve the overall mechanical performance of the bone cement composites. By adding 0. 25 wt% of acrylolpamidronate to the Sr-HA nanopowders, more than 19 % of the bending strength and more than 23 % compression strength of the Sr-HA bone cement were improved. Biological evaluations revealed that these bone cement composites were biocompatible and bioactive in cell culture. The results obtained in this thesis work show an effective method to significantly enhance the mechanical properties of composite materials. Different from other available methods, by developing a new series of chemical compounds and nanoparticles, we successfully bound them to the surface or to the constitutional components of the materials through covalent bond. The treatment can enhance and modulate the interface-bonding of the filler materials and enhances the mechanical property of the surface through grafting a thin nano-layer. Since only surface reaction is involved, very small amount of the new material is needed, and the treatment can be readily integrated to the existing processes.
