They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E

500|$|Such a {{comeback}} {{could not be}} {{under the auspices of}} the Whig Party, with its remnants divided by the Kansas-Nebraska legislation (which passed with the support of Pierce). Many northern foes of slavery, such as Seward, gravitated towards a new party, the Republicans, but Fillmore saw no home for himself there. There was in the early 1850s considerable hostility towards immigrants, especially Catholics, who had recently arrived in the United States in large numbers, and several nativist organizations, including the Order of the Star Spangled Banner, sprang up in response. By 1854, the Order had morphed into the American Party, which became known as the Know Nothings, for in its early days, members were sworn to hold private its internal deliberations, and if asked <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they knew nothing about them. Many from Fillmore's [...] "National Whig" [...] faction had joined the Know Nothings by 1854, and influenced the organization to take up causes besides nativism. The success of the Know Nothings in the 1854 midterm elections, in which they won in several Northeastern states and showed strength in the South encouraged Fillmore, and on January 1, 1855, he sent a letter for publication, warning against immigrant influence in American elections, and soon thereafter joined the Order of the Star Spangled Banner.|$|E
500|$|This {{follows from}} the causal theory of reference. Words always refer {{to the kinds of}} things they were coined to refer to, thus the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her linguistic community have never seen such a thing. Rather, she saw something that looked like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to the studio in Spain in late January, Björk decided that producer Nellee Hooper, who had produced both Debut and Post, would not return, as Björk stated that they had [...] "both stopped surprising each other". Björk had intended to produce the album alone, but she abandoned the idea and [...] sought out a group of close collaborators including Dravs, Howie B, Guy Sigsworth and LFO's Mark Bell. Howie B had worked with Björk previously on Debut and Post and Sigsworth had played harpsichord on Post. The American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan almost contributed {{to the production of}} Homogenic, but were unable due to their production on the album Wu-Tang Forever, which had taken longer than planned. Most of the melodies on the album were created by Björk, who then composed string sections on a Casio keyboard and brought them to programmers who would add suitable rhythmic patterns. Björk desired to have Mark Bell contribute to her albums Debut and Post, only finding him available for Homogenic. Mark Bell was credited {{for the majority of the}} album's production, including the songs [...] "Pluto", [...] "Alarm Call", and the bass line in [...] "Jóga". Björk stated about her collaboration with Bell that she [...] "trusts and respects what [...] does for me. If I <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> who has influenced me most it would be Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and Mark Bell". Other unorthodox methods of recording were used during the production, including Björk wanting to record outside on the porch and using non-professionals to help with production, such as Rebecca Storey, who was hired as a babysitter but added to the production staff after showing interest in the equipment.|$|E
500|$|In the 1934 season, Verity took 150wickets at {{an average}} of 17.63, placing him third in the {{national}} averages. That year, the Australians toured England and Verity was selected for all five Test matches. Australia won the first game—Verity took two wickets. At Lord's, in the second match, England scored 440 in their first innings but after the second day's play, Australia were well positioned, having reached 192 for two wickets. Verity was the only bowler to trouble the batsmen and caught and bowled Bradman, who had scored a quick 36runs. After rain fell overnight, the pitch changed to become helpful to spin; Wisden reported that: [...] "although the wicket certainly helped [...] considerably it could scarcely be described as genuinely sticky except for one period after lunch." [...] On the third day, Australia lost their last eight wickets while scoring 92runs. Verity took six of the wickets to achieve bowling figures of seven for 61. The tourists just failed to score enough runs to make England bat again and were forced to follow on: Cardus wrote: [...] "Verity settled the issue like a great bowler". England wicket-keeper Les Ames believed this was crucial to an England victory, or the home team would have batted in very difficult conditions. When Australia batted again, Verity took eight for 43, dismissing Bradman a second time, to give him match figures of 15 for 104; 14 of the wickets came on the third day. Cardus believed the Australian batsmen played very badly against Verity's spin, while the Wisden correspondent wrote: [...] "This amazing achievement would probably have been only possible to a man possessed of such length and finger-spin as Verity... Verity's length was impeccable and he made the ball come back and lift so abruptly that most of the Australians were helpless. The majority of them had had no experience in England of such a pitch, and they showed no ability or skill in dealing with bowling like that of Verity under these conditions; their efforts at playing back <b>were,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the least, immature." [...] Afterwards, this game became known in cricket circles as [...] "Verity's match"; it was the only occasion in the 20th century when England beat Australia at Lord's, and their last such win for 75years.|$|E

The superior temporal sulcus is vital for speech comprehension because the region is highly involved with the lexical interface.

Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order belief—a belief about the belief—which he argues requires language: [...] "If someone <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences." ...|$|E
