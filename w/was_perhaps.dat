5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp (formally {{designated}} C/1995O1) is a comet that <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{the most}} widely observed of the 20th century, {{and one of the}} brightest seen for many decades.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{literary}} and theatrical {{activities of the}} Round Table members, it <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> inevitable that they would write and stage their own revue. No Sirree!, staged for one night only in April 1922, was a take-off of a then-popular European touring revue called La Chauve-Souris, directed by Nikita Balieff.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have often}} {{referred}} to Conroy as someone with strong ambition, {{with varying degrees of}} positive or negative opinion. Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria was shocked to hear this, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented it.|$|E

5|$|India ink: Although {{named after}} {{carbonaceous}} pigment materials originating from India, Indian ink {{first appeared in}} China; some scholars say it was made {{as far back as}} the 3rd millennium BC, while others state it <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> not invented until the Wei Dynasty (220–265 AD).|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of criminal {{appeals to the}} Supreme Court by means of writs of error from the circuit courts <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> an open question prior to More. In England, the writ of error was available as of right in misdemeanor cases, but, in felony cases, required the express consent of the prosecutor.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} John V. A. Fine, Shishman {{may have}} established his {{authority over the}} Vidin region {{as early as the}} 1270s, after the death of the previous lord of that area, Jacob Svetoslav. He <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, George Terter I (r. 1280–1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was likely a close relative, perhaps even a brother, of George Terter I.|$|E

5|$|According to many observers, {{including}} Ray Ferraro {{and teammates}} Brendan Gallagher and Connor McDavid, Tanev <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> the best defenceman {{in the tournament}} {{in terms of his}} defensive play - he and his defence partner, Morgan Rielly, were not on the ice for a single goal against at even-strength. Tanev also played a major role on Canada’s tournament-best penalty kill that allowed just two goals against in 29 opportunities. He registered one assist during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Arafat's {{ability to}} adapt to new {{tactical}} and political situations <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> tested {{by the rise of}} the Hamas and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel. These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties. In the 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood.|$|E
5|$|Chinmoy (1931–2007) {{joined the}} ashram in 1944. Later, {{he wrote the}} play about Sri Aurobindo's life – Sri Aurobindo: Descent of the Blue – and a book, Infinite: Sri Aurobindo. An author, composer, artist and athlete, he <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> best known for holding public events {{on the theme of}} inner peace and world harmony (such as concerts, meditations, and races).|$|E

5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch {{government and the}} mandate {{he had been given}} to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary. In this he <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> motivated by a desire to engage the opposing German troops for as long as possible, to assist the Allied war effort. In the early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm was evident in the Dutch Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Grissom's {{spacecraft}} {{was recovered}} in 1999, but no further evidence was found which could conclusively {{explain how the}} explosive hatch release had occurred. Later, Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the early American manned space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or splashdown, and the T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> damaged by the heat of re-entry and, after cooling upon splashdown, contracted and fired.|$|E
5|$|He later {{received}} an appointment {{as a professor}} of psychology and philosophy at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky. He <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> best known for his work on psychology in advertising. While there, Tigert also served as the athletic director from 1913 to 1917, the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball coach in 1913, 1916 and 1917, the Wildcats women's basketball coach from 1911 to 1915 and again from 1916 to 1917, and the Wildcats football coach in 1915 and 1916.|$|E

5|$|His health failing, Hancock {{spent his}} final few years as {{essentially}} a figurehead governor. With {{his wife at}} his side, he died in bed on October 8, 1793, at 56 years of age. By order of acting governor Samuel Adams, the day of Hancock's burial was a state holiday; the lavish funeral <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> the grandest given to an American up to that time.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} on catfish, electric fish (Torpedo) and angler fish are detailed, {{as is his}} writing on cephalopods including the octopus, cuttlefish and the paper nautilus. His claim that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm which <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved, until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays {{were part of the}} group he called Selachē (roughly, the modern zoologist's selachians).|$|E
5|$|Historian James Gunn's {{assessment}} of Amazing in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who between them edited Amazing for a decade, {{were unable to}} sustain the standards established by Ted White in the 1970s. Brian Stableford, by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that the packaging, from 1991 onwards, <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> the best presented of any science fiction magazine.|$|E

5|$|Jarre {{was raised}} in Lyon by his mother and grandparents, and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was {{introduced}} {{to a variety of}} art forms, including those of street performers, jazz musicians, and the artist Pierre Soulages. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> most heavily influenced by Pierre Schaeffer, a pioneer of musique concrète at the Groupe de Recherches Musicales.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring's {{evacuation}} of Sicily, which began {{a week earlier}} on 10 August, <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> the most brilliant action of the campaign. In spite of the Allies' superiority on land, at sea, and in the air, Kesselring was able to evacuate not only 40,000 men, but also 96,605 vehicles, 94 guns, 47 tanks, 1,100 tons of ammunition, 970 tons of fuel, and 15,000 tons of stores. He was able to achieve near-perfect coordination among the three services under his command while his opponent, Eisenhower, could not.|$|E
5|$|Orchestras {{continued}} to use noise {{in the form of}} a percussion section, which expanded though the 19th century: Berlioz <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> the first composer to thoroughly investigate the effects of different mallets on the tone color of timpani. However, before the 20th century, percussion instruments played a very small role in orchestral music and mostly served for punctuation, to highlight passages, or for novelty. But by the 1940s, some composers were influenced by non-Western music as well as jazz and popular music, and began incorporating marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones, bells, gongs, cymbals, and drums.|$|E
