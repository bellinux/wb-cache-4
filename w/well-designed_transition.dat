40|$|An {{unplanned}} readmission to {{the hospital}} within 30 days of discharge {{is seen as a}} failure by the healthcare team to appropriately plan for a safe and effective discharge to the next level of care. According to The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the national average readmission rate in 2012 was 18. 4 %. As CMS shifts to a pay for performance strategy, a readmission rate higher than the national average for specific disease processes will result in a financial penalty. Many organizations have identified the need to improve the current discharge planning processes and to provide patients with a safer transition to the next level of care to prevent readmissions. Evidence demonstrates that there is value in reconfiguring the current discharge processes toward interventions that demonstrate a reduction in readmission rates. The discharge process should incorporate a multidisciplinary, multicomponent transition of care intervention that starts while the patient is in the hospital and continues with some type of home-care follow-up. Transition of care is a relatively new term that is used to describe a set of interventions designed to coordinate a patientâ€™s care during the movement between healthcare settings. Implementing a <b>well-designed</b> <b>transition</b> of care program allows hospitals to provide a safe Environment of Care to patients during their care transitions. Environment of Care is a term coined by The Joint Commission that is used to describe the environment in which the patient is being cared for.

40|$|Tremendous {{research}} is {{being carried out}} in the development of electrochemical energy technologies such as fuel cells and water splitting for conversion and storage of renewable energy resources. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial to the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) which are promising devices due to their high energy density, high conversion efficiency and low environmental impact. Electrochemical water splitting has also the capability to store the electricity obtained from renewable energy resources in the form of hydrogen as an energy carrier. However, the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode electrode in water splitting remain the major challenges of this technology. Catalysts can {{play a key role in}} increasing the ORR, OER, and HER kinetics and thus improving the overall performance of the system. However, the most efficient electrocatalysts are based on noble metals which their scarcity and exorbitant costs hinder the large-scale application of such electrochemical energy devices. Therefore, development of nanostructured non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts is highly required. This thesis aims to design, synthesise, and develop economical, efficient, and stable catalysts for ORR, OER, and HER. To this end, electrochemistry techniques are used as the main method for synthesising the catalysts. Specifically, i) electrodeposited Pd thin films from ionic liquids show better ORR catalysis performance than Pd electrodeposited from aqueous solution, ii) Pd nanoparticles are achieved by electrodeposition at high negative potentials thanks to the evolution of hydrogen bubbles during the electrodeposition from protic ionic liquids, iii) oxygen vacancy-rich Ni-Fe composite was fabricated via a facile and straightforward method. The electrode showed an excellent OER activity, iv) a Ni-Fe electrode is made by one-step electrochemically roughening of nickel foam and simultaneously Fe electrodeposition to produce an active OER electrode, v) 3 D porous NiCu is electrodeposited through hydrogen dynamic templates following a phosphorous doping process to obtain a stable HER electrode in wide range of pH. All synthesised catalysts are characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The results highlight that <b>well-designed</b> <b>transition</b> metal-based materials with suitable structure and porosity are highly promising for electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies...|$|E
40|$|A <b>well-designed</b> {{nanostructure}} of <b>transition</b> {{metal oxides}} has {{been regarded as}} a key to solve their problems of large volume changes during lithium insertion-desertion processes which are associated with pulverization of the electrodes and rapid capacity decay. Here we report an effective approach for the fabrication of porous iron oxide ribbons by controlling the nucleation and growth of iron precursor onto the graphene surface and followed by an annealing treatment. The resultant iron oxide ribbons possess large aspect ratio, porous structure, thin feature and enhanced open-edges. These characteristics are favorable for the fast diffusion of lithium ions and electrons, and meanwhile can effectively accommodate the volume change of iron oxides during the cycling processes. As a consequence, the graphene-induced porous iron oxide ribbons exhibit a high reversible capacity and excellent cycle stability for lithium storage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{identifies}} and critiques {{literature on}} the experience of transition between primary and secondary school; how and why it is seen as critical and in what ways it can be supported. The aim of this literature review is to remind readers of this important period on the lives of young people and the diverse range of issues which they face. There is general consensus in the literature that <b>well-designed</b> and implemented <b>transition</b> approaches can assist in the process of supporting students, their families and school staff. Teachers are crucial in supporting children and young people moving in, between and out of school and making these transitions positive experiences. Therefore, pre-service teacher education needs to include awareness and understanding of the main issues in relation to transition. Teacher educators need to consider how they can incorporate transition programs and strategies in their courses to ensure that graduate teachers have the skills and knowledge to mediate some of the pressures that their students are facing when dealing with transitions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the cooperation between municipalities and other parties {{in the construction of}} 60 km/h zones. For various reasons it is advisable that municipalities cooperate with for example other road authorities and road users like citizens, companies, emergency services, public transport companies et cetera. In the study we examine the effect of this cooperation for the road's safety. The study presents the following question: To which extent did the organization of the cooperation between the parties involved contribute to the policy's effectiveness in the first phase of Sustainable Safety (more concretely the construction of 60 km/h zones by municipalities) and, based on the findings, what can be said about the second phase of Sustainable Safety in a prescriptive sense? In the study cooperation is defined as joining the forces that are aimed at a common target. Effective policy has to meet a number of specific demands of 60 km/h roads. These demands are discussed below. Prior to the study we formulated some presuppositions and expectations. These involve three topics in which municipalities should cooperate with other parties: 1. Transitions between municipal 60 km/h roads and the 60 km/h roads of adjoining municipalities. It is not desirable to have discontinuities in the infrastructure within one speed regime. We expect cooperation with neighbouring municipalities to result in transitions without discontinuities. 2. Speed reduction measures that can be inconvenient for emergency services and public transport. From the Sustainable Safety point of view 60 km/h zones should have low speeds, especially on intersections. We expect that consultations with public transport companies and emergency services will stimulate municipalities to take more speed reduction measures that are not only sustainably safe, but will also cause less hinder for public transport companies and emergency services. 3. Measures that affect citizens, companies and interest groups. The input of citizens, companies and interest groups is expected to have varying road safety effects. Citizens can indicate trouble spots that the municipality overlooked, or urge for stricter safety measures. Alternatively, they can also block measures because of expected hinder due to vibrations, noise, or comfort. The study has been carried out in fourteen municipalities. To enable accurate comparison, they were selected on the number of inhabitants and the road length in the 60 km/h zones. Two things were measured. The first is the cooperation between the different parties in the decision-making process for the construction of the 60 km/h zones. We took stock of who was in contact with whom and how often this contact took place. To do this we used interviews with the civil servants that were involved and we carried out a survey among the parties that were contacted or that we expected to have been contacted. Secondly we measured the effectiveness of the policy. We operationalized the decision-making's result as the Sustainable Safety level of the 60 km/h roads. All 60 km/h roads and intersections were inspected visually and rated with the Sustainable Safety Indicator. This instrument was used to measure certain road features such as edge markings, centre line markings, and direction separators for road sections, and priority arrangements and physical speed reduction measures for intersections. Based on these measurings the Sustainable Safety rating for the 60 km/h zone was determined. Next the roads were assessed on specific characteristics that are connected with the parties that were involved in the consultations. This approach was used to rate the transitions of municipal roads to neighbouring municipalities and the number of number of measures that are 'friendly' for emergency services and transport companies. A positive, however not significant, relation seems to exist between the cooperation with neighbouring municipalities and a <b>well-designed</b> <b>transition.</b> The qualitative data indicates that a regional approach has positive effect on well-designed transitions. A positive and significant relation exists between consultation with emergency services and transport companies and the number of emergency service-friendly measures. The qualitative data supports this relation. Finally, the qualitative data shows that citizens, companies and interest groups have a large influence on policy. There seems to be a negative relation between the moment these parties give their input and the Sustainable Safety score: the earlier the input, the lower the Sustainable Safety scores for road sections and intersections, and vice versa. This relation is not significant either, and is only supported by qualitative data. The different parties generally are positive about the cooperation with the municipality in their case. In addition to the factors discussed above, local custom-made constructions and a limited budget are of importance for the effectiveness of the 60 km/h policy. For the future construction of 60 km/h zones, for instance in the Second Phase of Sustainable Safety, we make the following recommendations: - More regional cooperation between municipalities and their neighbouring municipalities can result in a better layout of the transitions. Provinces and city regions can perform a stimulating role. - Municipalities can give a higher priority to consultations with emergency services and transport companies. They can realize more measures that are friendly for emergency services and transport companies by actively involving these services in the decision process. - Municipalities can involve a wide group of interested parties {{in the early stages of}} the decision-making process. However, it is important to establish minimum demands for the safety level, for example using the CROW guidelines...|$|E
