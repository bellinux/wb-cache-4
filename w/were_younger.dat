5|$|On June 23 at AT Park {{against the}} San Diego Padres, Bumgarner struck out a career-high {{fourteen}} batters, tying Atlee Hammaker's franchise {{record for most}} strikeouts in a single game by a left-handed pitcher. On June 28, in a 6–3 win over the Colorado Rockies at AT Park, Bumgarner had two hits, one a solo home run, scored twice, and struck out Brandon Barnes for his one-thousandth career strikeout.

5|$|The Senghenydd {{explosion}} {{remains the}} worst mining disaster in Britain. The deaths of 440 men {{on a small}} community had a devastating effect; 60 victims <b>were</b> <b>younger</b> than 20, of whom 8 were 14 years old; 542 children had lost their fathers and 205 women were widowed. The impact on individual households was great: 12 homes lost both a father and son, 10 homes lost two sons each, while {{the death of one}} father and son left an 18-year-old daughter to raise her 6 siblings alone; another woman lost her husband, 2 sons, a brother and her lodger.|$|E
5|$|The {{average age}} of the Politburo's members was 58 years in 1961, and 71 in 1981. A similar greying also took place in the Central Committee, the median age rising from 53 in 1961 to 62 in 1981, with the {{proportion}} of members older than 65 increasing from 3 percent in 1961 to 39 percent in 1981. The difference in the median age between Politburo and Central Committee members {{can be explained by the}} fact that the Central Committee was consistently enlarged during Brezhnev's leadership; this made it possible to appoint new and younger members to the Central Committee without retiring some of its oldest members. Of the 319-member Central Committee in 1981, 130 <b>were</b> <b>younger</b> than 30 when Stalin died in 1953.|$|E

5|$|By the show's tenth {{anniversary in}} 1979, 9 million American {{children}} under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as <b>were</b> <b>younger</b> children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to {{the diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who <b>were</b> <b>younger.</b> Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.|$|E

5|$|On July 9, 2011, Jeter {{recorded}} his 3,000th career hit, {{a home run}} off of David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeter finished the day with five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have five hits {{on the day he}} achieved his 3,000th hit (the first was Craig Biggio). He also became the second player to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit, Wade Boggs having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter's five hits proved to be the game-winning hit. He is {{the only member of the}} 3,000 hit club to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees, and the only player to join the club as a Yankee. Jeter became the second player to reach 3,000 career hits while still a regular shortstop (the first was Honus Wagner). Only Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount <b>were</b> <b>younger</b> than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th hit.

5|$|When Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, visited Athens in March 1918, {{to confer}} the Order of the Bath upon the king, Alexander feared that a {{marriage}} {{between him and}} Princess Mary of the United Kingdom would be discussed {{as part of an}} attempt to consolidate the relationship between Greece and Britain. To Alexander's relief, Arthur asked to meet Aspasia, and declared that, if he <b>were</b> <b>younger,</b> he would have sought to marry her himself. For the foreign powers, and particularly the British ambassador, the marriage was seen as positive. The British authorities feared that Alexander would abdicate in order to marry Aspasia if the wedding was blocked, and they wanted to avoid Greece becoming a republic in case it led to instability or an increase in French influence at their expense.|$|E
