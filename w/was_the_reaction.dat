During the 2015 GaymerX in San Jose, California, the video game was demoed. About {{three years after the}} release of the original prototype, the full game, which was developed and published by Sassybot, a three-man indie game studio in the Netherlands, {{was released on}} 3 May 2016 for Microsoft Windows and 1 June 2016 for Xbox One, with the PlayStation 4 version released 26 September 2017. The developers tested and demoed the game during the 2016 Game Developers Conference and said that they experienced people crying while playing the game at their booth and that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> for which they had hoped.|$|E

25|$|In the New Deal {{era of the}} 1930s, Jefferson's memory became contested ground. Franklin D. Roosevelt greatly admired Jefferson and had the Jefferson Memorial {{built to}} honor his hero. Even more dramatic, however, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> of the {{conservative}}s, as typified by the American Liberty League (comprising mostly conservative Democrats who resembled the Bourbon Democrats of the 1870–1900 era), and the Republican Party. Conservative Republicans abandoned their Hamiltonian views because they led to enlarged national government. Their opposition to Roosevelt's New Deal was cast in explicitly Jeffersonian small-government terms, and Jefferson became a hero of the Right.|$|E

500|$|Mercury {{released}} the demo in 1989 as The Kentucky Headhunters' debut album, Pickin' on Nashville. The album produced four singles, {{all of which}} reached top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. The first of these, the [...] "Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine" [...] cover, peaked at number 25 in December 1989. After it came [...] "Dumas Walker," [...] about a then-74-year-old marbles player who owned a liquor store that the band frequented. According to Doug, Mercury Records was initially reluctant to release the song as a single: [...] " [...] thought it was too regional, {{and that no one}} outside the area would get it, but what they didn't see, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> we got to it every night that we played it in front of a crowd, and it didn't matter where we were playing either." [...] The single peaked at number 15 on the Billboard chart.|$|E
500|$|The {{constitution}} {{remained in}} effect for {{little over a year}} before being overthrown by Russian armies allied with conservative Polish nobility in the Polish–Russian War of 1792, also known as the War in Defense of the Constitution. With the wars between Turkey and Russia and Sweden and Russia having ended, Empress Catherine was furious over the adoption of the document, which she believed threatened Russian influence in Poland. Russia had viewed Poland as a de facto protectorate. [...] "The worst possible news have arrived from Warsaw: the Polish king has become almost sovereign" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> of one of Russia's chief foreign policy authors, Alexander Bezborodko, when he learned of the new constitution. The contacts of Polish reformers with the Revolutionary French National Assembly were seen by Poland's neighbors as evidence of a revolutionary conspiracy and a threat to the absolute monarchies. The Prussian statesman Ewald von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives: [...] "The Poles have given the coup de grâce to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution", elaborating that a strong Commonwealth would likely demand the return of the lands Prussia acquired in the First Partition.|$|E
500|$|When {{the open}} housing {{proposal}} became public, local reaction was often hostile. [...] Such <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While {{it had no}} formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, {{many of whom were}} ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. [...] HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. [...] Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town. [...] Now the secretary said, [...] "The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not going to wait for 'nature to take its course.' What is really at issue here is responsibility– moral responsibility." ...|$|E

[...] "The worst possible news have arrived from Warsaw: the Polish king has become almost sovereign" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> of one of Russia's chief foreign policy authors, Alexander Bezborodko, when he learned of the new constitution. The Kingdom of Prussia was also strongly opposed to the new Polish constitution, and Polish diplomats received a note that the new constitution changed the Polish state so much that Prussia did not consider its obligations binding. Just like Russia, Prussia was concerned that the newly strengthened Polish state could become a threat and the Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, clearly and with rare candor told Poles that Prussia did not support the constitution and refused to help the Commonwealth in any form, even as a mediator, as it was not in Prussia's interest to see the Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in some future. The Prussian statesman Ewald von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives: [...] "The Poles have given the coup de grâce to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution", elaborating that a strong Commonwealth would likely demand the return of the lands Prussia acquired in the First Partition.|$|E

2500|$|The Great Disappointment in the Millerite {{movement}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> {{that followed}} Baptist preacher William Miller's proclamations that Jesus Christ {{would return to}} the Earth in 1844, what he called the Advent. His study of the Daniel 8 prophecy during the Second Great Awakening led him to the conclusion that Daniel's [...] "cleansing of the sanctuary" [...] was cleansing of the world from sin when Christ would come, and he and many others prepared, but October 22, 1844 came and they were disappointed.|$|E

[...] Soon, he and his band were getting noticed by clubs. [...] "Before I knew it, people would line up on the street for our performances," [...] Benise said. [...] "It's been seven years since I started with the Spanish guitar. We started playing for tourists, then we began renting out theaters and building on that momentum." [...] Benise began promoting his own concerts at 2,000-seat theaters throughout the area. He subtitled his all-instrumental show, Love, Music, and Life!.|$|E

P. Morgan war." [...] Eleanor Roosevelt, a fan of folk music, reportedly found the album [...] "in bad taste," [...] though President Roosevelt, when the album was shown to him, merely observed, correctly as it turned out, that few people would ever hear it. More alarmist <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> of eminent German-born Harvard Professor of Government Carl Joachim Friedrich, an adviser on domestic propaganda to the United States military. In a review in the June 1941 Atlantic Monthly, entitled [...] "The Poison in Our System," [...] he pronounced Songs for John Doe [...] "...strictly subversive and illegal," [...] "...whether Communist or Nazi financed," [...] and [...] "a matter for the attorney general," [...] observing further that [...] "mere" [...] legal [...] "suppression" [...] would {{not be sufficient to}} counteract this type of populist poison, the poison being folk music and the ease with which it could be spread.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> of the long restraint she had been exercising on herself, and the silence she had been maintaining.

This did not trouble them, as they trod what was to them classic ground, tried in vain the {{impossible}} feat of 'seeing Melrose aright,' but revelled in what they did see, stood with bated breath at Dryburgh by the Minstrel's tomb, and tracked his magic spells from the Tweed even to Staffa, feeling the full delight for the first time of mountain, sea, and loch.
