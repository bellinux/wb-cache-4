2500|$|Both Milgram and Zimbardo's {{experiment}} tested situational {{forces on}} an individual. Both results concluded that irrational behavior compared to one's character is plausible for any human because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>both</b> tendencies in our nature. Both studies are frequently cited {{as examples of}} psychological experiments that were conducted in the mid-20th century that have serious ethical problems involving the treatment of human experimental participants and not clearly explained informed consent. [...] Both studies probably could not receive approval today from any university board of ethics.|$|E

2500|$|On February 22, 2010, it was {{announced}} that Lopez had parted ways with Epic Records, leaving the fate of the album in jeopardy. The initial press release from Lopez's manager Benny Medina said: [...] "Jennifer had a wonderful relationship with the Sony Music Group, and they have shared many successes together, but the time was right to make a change that best serves the direction of her career as an actress and recording artist, she is grateful and appreciative to everyone at Sony for all that they accomplished together". That same day, Lopez's representative confirmed the news to Entertainment Weekly and revealed that Lopez was negotiating a deal with several other labels. Lopez herself confirmed the split and announced that she had found a new label and that the album would be released in the summer of 2010, [...] "I have fulfilled my contractual responsibilities with Sony/Epic up to this point, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>both</b> reached friendly terms about my departure from the label. I'm also happy to say that we've found a new home for my album, 'Love,' and that it is slated for release in the summer of 2010." [...] Billboard magazine would later go on to confirm that Lopez had signed to Def Jam Records and that the album was now due in Summer 2011. According to Rap-Up magazine, the album was to be released on March 29, 2011. Just several weeks after the first announcement, Rap-Up announced that the album had been pushed back to April 19, 2011. No reason was given for the new date. This conflicted with comments made by Lopez during an online chat with her fans. On March 13, 2011, Lopez said that the album was most likely to come {{out at the end of}} May 2011 after at least one more single had been released. A final release date of May 3, 2011 in the United States was later confirmed.|$|E
