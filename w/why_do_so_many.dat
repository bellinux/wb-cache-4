Better, for us if it broke it down altogether, for then the warlike way out of our {{difficulties}} would be barred to us, and we should take greater care not to get into them. In truth, it is, as Byron said, [...] "not difficult to die," [...] and enormously difficult to live: that explains why, at bottom, peace is not only better than war, but infinitely more arduous. Did any hero of the war face the glorious risk of death more bravely than the traitor Bolo faced the ignominious certainty of it? Bolo taught us all how to die: can we say that he taught us all how to live?

6000|$|Oh! my friends, {{why do so}} few love Christ?

Why? Because they do not know Christ. And how can they know Him, unless they read their Bibles with simple, childlike hearts, determined to let the Bible tell its own story: believing that those who walked with Christ on earth, must know best what He was like? Why? Because they will not ask Christ to come and show Himself to them, and make them see Him, and love Him, and admire Him, whether they will or not. Oh! remember, if Christ be the Son of God, the Lord of heaven and earth, we cannot go to Him, poor, weak, ignorant creatures as we are. We cannot ascend up into heaven to bring Christ down. He must come down out of His own great love and condescension, and dwell in our hearts as He has promised to do, if we do but love Him. He must come down and show Himself to us. Oh! read your Bibles--read the story of Christ, and if that does not stir up in you some love for Him, you must have hearts of stone, not flesh and blood. And then go to Him; pray to Him, whether you believe in Him altogether or not, upon the mere chance of His being able to hear you and help you. You would not throw away a chance on earth; will you throw away such a chance in heaven as having the Son of God to help you? Oh, cry to Him; say out of the depths of your heart: [...] "Thou most blessed and glorious Being who ever walked this earth, who hast gone blameless through all sorrow and temptation that man can feel; if Thou dost love anyone, if Thou canst hear anyone, hear me! If thou canst not help me, no one can. I have a hundred puzzling questions which I cannot answer for myself, a hundred temptations which I cannot conquer for myself, a hundred bad habits which I cannot shake off of myself; and they tell me that Thou canst teach me, Thou canst guide me, Thou canst strengthen me, Thou canst take out of my heart this shame and gnawing of an evil conscience. If Thou be the Son of God, make me clean! If it be true that Thou lovest all men, show Thy love to me! If it be true that Thou canst teach all men, teach me! If it be true that Thou canst help all men, help my unbelief, for if Thou dost not, there is no help for me in heaven or earth!" [...] You, who are sinful, distracted, puzzled, broken-hearted, cry to Christ in that way, if you have no better way, and see if He does not hear you. He is not one to break the bruised reed, or quench the smoking flax. He will hear you, for He has heard all who have ever called on Him. Cry to Him from the bottom of your hearts. Tell Him that you do NOT love Him, and that yet you LONG to love Him. And see if you do not find it true that those who come to Christ, He will in no wise cast out. He may not seem to answer you the first time, or the tenth time, or for years; for Christ has His own deep, loving, wise ways of teaching each man, and for each man a different way. But try to learn all you can of Him. Try to know Him. Pray to know, and understand Him, and love Him. And sooner or later you will find His words come true, [...] "If a man love me, I and my Father will come to him, and take up our abode with him." [...] And then you will feel arise in you a hungering and a thirsting after righteousness, a spirit of love, and a desire of doing good, which will carry you up and on, above all that man can say or do against you--above all the laziness, and wilfulness, and selfishness, and cowardice which dwells in the heart of everyone. You will be able to trample it all under foot for the sake of being good and doing good, in the strength of that one glorious thought, [...] "Christ lived and died for me, and, so help me God, I will live and die for Christ." ...|$|E

Much scientific inquiry in the Soviet Union depended on the national budget and was managed by the government. The national budget, however, shrank dramatically after the old government’s demise. Many research institutes in Russia faced sharp reductions in research funds in the 1990 s, making it difficult for many researchers to continue their work. Plunging salaries rendered many academic scientists destitute, triggering a spate of Russian scientist movement away from research and cutting the number of researchers to less than half that in the Soviet era[1]. The emigration of scientific minds reached about 2, 000 a year from 1991 to 1996. Soviet era scientists rarely stayed longer than one year to work in Japan. By 1992, a year after Soviet collapse, nearly 100 had visited Japan for longer stays, with 399 arriving in 2002. An average of nearly 250 Russian researchers left home yearly for Japan to stay one year or more in the ensuing decade. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> Russian researchers seek Japan?
