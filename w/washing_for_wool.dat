The first part was the miller's living quarters, and the other contained seven mills arranged at regular intervals.

Founded in 1909 by Clarence, Roy and Chauncey Bishop, the company built upon earlier businesses related to the many sheep ranches in the region. A wool-scouring plant [...] opened in Pendleton in 1893 to <b>wash</b> raw <b>wool</b> <b>for</b> shipping. In 1895, the scouring mill was converted into a mill that made wool blankets and robes for Native Americans. Both businesses failed to survive, but the Bishops, {{with the help of a}} local bond issue, enlarged the mill and improved its efficiency. They developed a successful line of garments and blankets with [...] "vivid colors and intricate patterns." ...|$|R
40|$|The wool fibers {{that are}} {{obtained}} in the Republic of Serbs have not been systematically analyzed. Also, they are only used in domestic crafts production, not for industrial means. This study {{is the beginning of}} a project with the aim of determining how to replace a quantity of imported wool by domestic wool in the process of industrial manufacturing. The washing of two types of domestic wool was investigated, namely pramen-ka and polumerino. The parameters used to wash this wool were varied, such as materials <b>for</b> <b>washing</b> (from clean water to surfactants and additives), as well as the temperature and length of the washing process. The effects of washing the wool were tested with respect to the content of clean wool, the content of organic materials soluble in ethanol, the content of herbal components insoluble in sodium-hydroxide solutions and mineral substances represented as ash quantities. The optimal conditions <b>for</b> <b>washing</b> <b>wool</b> were defined, as well as recommendations for the more economic usage of materials used in washing...|$|R
5000|$|... {{unless the}} lanolin {{is to be}} left in the cloth as a water repellent. When washing a skein it works well to let the wool soak in soapy water overnight, and rinse the soap out in the morning. Dishwashing {{detergents}} are commonly used, and a special laundry detergent designed <b>for</b> <b>washing</b> <b>wool</b> is not required. The dishwashing detergent works and does not harm the wool. After washing, let the wool dry (air drying works best). Once it is dry, or just a bit damp, one can stretch it out a bit on a niddy-noddy. Putting the wool back on the niddy-noddy makes for a nicer looking finished skein. Before taking a skein and washing it, the skein must be tied up loosely in about six places. If the skein is not tied up, it will be very hard to unravel when done washing.|$|R
40|$|China is {{the largest}} {{importer}} of Australian <b>wool.</b> China’s demand <b>for</b> <b>wool</b> has significant implications <b>for</b> <b>wool</b> producers in Australia. In this paper, an AIDS model is used to analyse the responsiveness of China’s demand <b>for</b> <b>wool</b> imports and preferred sources of imports of wool. The results indicate that, in general, China’s demand <b>for</b> <b>wool</b> imports is not very responsive to changes in prices and expenditures. When demand <b>for</b> <b>wool</b> imports increases, China {{has a tendency to}} initially obtain imports from countries other than Australia. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that China’s demand <b>for</b> <b>wool</b> imports will experience significant increase. The wool trade between China and Australia may change, depending on global demand for woollen products, demand for woollen apparel by Chinese consumers, and changes in China’s regulations to protect the environment...|$|R
