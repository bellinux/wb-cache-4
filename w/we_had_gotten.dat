500|$|In {{order to}} ship the game, Bungie began paring back their ambitions for the single- and {{multiplayer}} {{parts of the}} game. Chris Butcher commented, [...] "For Halo 2 we had our sights set very high on networking. ... Going from having no Internet multiplayer to developing a completely new online model was a big challenge to tackle all at once, {{and as a result}} we had to leave a lot of things undone {{in order to meet the}} ship date commitment that we made to our fans." [...] With only a year to go until release, Bungie went into the [...] "mother of all crunches" [...] in order to finish the game; in a 2007 interview, Jamie Griesemer, one of Halos design leads, said that this lack of a [...] "polish" [...] period near the end of the development cycle was the main reason for Halo 2s shortcomings. Butcher retrospectively described Halo 2s multiplayer mode as [...] "a pale shadow of what it could and should have been if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> the timing of our schedule right"; the campaign mode's abrupt cliffhanger ending also resulted from the frenzy to ship on time.|$|E
2500|$|... "I’ve written some {{of these}} novels myself, and I know and {{appreciate}} the need for them, but I {{thought it was a}} pity that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> so far away from the bush and country novels that were popular in earlier generations, and I quite consciously set out to revive that genre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked {{directly}} if Michael Mukasey was a liar {{because he}} claimed that enhanced interrogation produced useful intelligence, Sen. John McCain stated unequivocally, [...] "Yes, I know that he is. Even if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> useful information, the propaganda and the image and {{the behavior of the}} greatest nation on earth from torturing people is not what we want and it helps the enemy." ...|$|E
30|$|So, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> a {{worst-case}} O(1 /t) convergence {{rate of the}} proposed algorithm in the ergodic sense.|$|R
50|$|Already, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> {{a massive}} {{donation}} from WITHHELD, a kind and WITHHELD person who only wants to WITHHELD.|$|R
5000|$|At this point, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> the {{concentration}} of [...] complex {{in terms of the}} initial concentration of host molecules, ...|$|R
2500|$|In post-game analysis, both coaches {{told the}} press they {{believed}} they had the better team. [...] Dixie Howell said of his Bulldogs he believed [...] "we would have won if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> a break at the right time." [...] Bergman called the game a [...] "flop," [...] saying the his team [...] "didn't play our top game by any means. [...] I think we are capable of beating Tempe six days out of the week." ...|$|E
2500|$|At first , we {{were called}} Force. I think <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> that name from a UFO album, {{but there was}} also a band called Rising Force with Yngwie Malmsteen. And then I thought, 'We should move up. We should do {{something}} else.' That night, I was so nervous telling them I thought it should be Europe. They got so quiet after I told them. But as the night progressed, they started liking it more and more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sontag {{became aware}} of her {{bisexuality}} during her early teens and at 15 wrote in her diary, [...] "I feel I have lesbian tendencies (how reluctantly I write this)". At 16, she had a sexual encounter with a woman: [...] "Perhaps I was drunk, after all, {{because it was so}} beautiful when H began making love to me...It had been 4:00 before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> to bed...I became fully conscious that I desired her, she knew it, too".|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a big {{satisfaction}} to {{know they}} have left," [...] Fred added, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> rid of them cheaply. Do you know where they went?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{the answer}} from the fort!" [...] said Joe, as two rockets flared up in the dim distance. [...] "Anyway, Will knows <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> this far." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{about the}} size of it, Joe," [...] Bob added, approvingly. [...] "If there's any {{fairness}} in law <b>we</b> <b>oughter</b> <b>get</b> a right tidy lot of money outer the old hooker." ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{honestly}} thought after Ligonier that we {{were beginning}} {{a new era of}} cooperation and Orthodox unity on this continent. For {{the first time since the}} early years of our presence in the Americas, it seemed there was a common vision, or at least a common goal of working together, not just for the sake of working together, but toward a canonically proper end of a unified Church. For me, the chance to sit down with brother bishops, many of whom I had never met, was a great and awesome experience. What made this experience great and awesome, besides just getting [...] together, was that [...] there was a purpose. Often <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> together in the past, but just for social purposes or anniversaries, celebrations, etc. This time it was for the good of the Church. Unfortunately, [...] what happened in the aftermath of Ligonier left us further apart and more disunited than we were in the years that led up to that historic gathering.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you don't}} {{want to make}} any more {{mistakes}} like that," [...] returned Dick. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> a little closer somebody might have been killed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] said Mary Louise musingly, [...] "that is why {{the poor}} woman is glad to rent this house. I wish, however, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> it for a more {{pleasant}} reason." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "As {{the season}} <b>has</b> progressed, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> {{stronger}} and stronger. Worlds is {{the culmination of}} the full season and all of our hard work. Our goal is to have the best two performances <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had all season and carry that momentum into the Olympic year", Bates noted.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, Tad Sobber, {{let us have}} an {{understand}}ing," [...] said Dick, calmly. [...] "I {{understand that}} {{you are trying to}} bully everybody in this school. Now, this cannot be. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> had several bullies here and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> rid of them all. We want no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How now," [...] quoth Robin, [...] "dost thou {{not like}} our new silver service? <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> {{a bag of}} it this day." [...] So saying, {{he held up the}} sack of silver that Little John and the Cook had brought with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} a case of using my legs," [...] he cried grimly. [...] "When a fellow knows that he is being chased by bullets {{he is able to}} move right fast. If you had skipped that last visit, {{thinking}} more of duty to those who sent me than to your comrades in the company of Minute Boys, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> off without turning a hair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Up {{there on}} the rocks," [...] replied Files. [...] "Look, my dear; you may see him from here. He said he would take a little nap while we were mixing up with Ruggedo, and he added that after <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> into trouble he would wake up and conquer the Nome King in a jiffy, as his master the Jinjin has ordered him to do." ...|$|E
60|$|We kept {{ourselves}} here incognito {{for a great}} while, {{passing for}} two Armenian merchants still, as we had done before; and by this time <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> {{so much of the}} Persian and Armenian jargon, which they talked at Bassorah and Bagdad, and everywhere that we came in the country, as was sufficient to make us able to talk to one another, {{so as not to be}} understood by anybody, though sometimes hardly by ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> so far, let us {{finish the}} trip," [...] urged Laura. [...] "I think I {{would rather be}} at the {{bungalows}} than at this hotel," [...] she added, with a look around that hostelry--a place that was not particularly inviting.|$|R

40|$|Using Mössbauer {{spectroscopy}} and X-ray powder diffraction, {{the structure}} of Co 2 +[Fe(CN) 6] 3 - and its stability have been investigated around room temperature. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> a result that the stability of ferrocyanide formed by heating cobalt ferricyanide depends on whether the sample is heated under vacuum or in air...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{the rudder}} to Noah's Ark, I {{think you are}} right!" [...] burst out Tom. [...] "Why, it's as plain as the nose on your face! Don't you {{remember}} how worried Barton Pelter looked when we told him the bonds were missing, and how he asked us at the moving picture show if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> them back yet? More than likely he knew how this safe was fixed-- he used to come here, you know, to see his uncle----" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was willing}} {{enough to have}} gone thither, because of the Treasure I had left there under Ground; but still I {{concluded}} we were (as I have said) too rich to go on Shore any where to separate, for every Man of us had too much Wealth to carry about us; and if we separated, the first Number of Men any of us should meet with, that were strong enough to do it, would take it from us, and so we should but just expose ourselves to be murder'd for that Money <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> at so much Hazard.|$|E
60|$|When, soon after, {{we started}} down the canyon, the fog was lifting and the forest growing lighter. Everything was as white with frost {{as if it had}} snowed. A thin, brittle frost {{crackled}} under our feet. When <b>we,</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> below the rocky confines of the canyon we climbed the slope to the level ridge. Here it was impossible not to believe it had snowed. The forest was as still as night, and looked very strange with the white aisles lined by black tree trunks and the gray fog shrouding the tree-tops. Soon we were climbing again, and I saw that Hiram meant to head the canyon where I had left Dick.|$|E

6000|$|... ‘Well, well,’ she said, ‘here comes your devoted {{friend the}} drover. I’m {{thinking}} {{he will be}} eager for the road; and I {{will not be easy}} myself till I see you well off the premises, and the dishes washed, before my servant-woman wakes. Praise God, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> one that is a treasure at the sleeping!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Puts me {{in mind of}} {{the time}} I {{went out to the}} trading-post with you," [...] said Dave to Sam Barringford, as the two rode along side by side, [...] "Don't you {{remember}} what a time <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>getting</b> through, and how I fell into the river and was afraid of being captured by the Indians?" ...|$|R
60|$|Before I {{was aware}} of it <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> out of the narrow canyon into a valley with well-timbered bottom, and open, slow rising slopes. We were getting down into Penetier. Cubby swerved from the trail {{and started up the}} left slope. I did not want to go, but I had to keep with him, and that was the only way. The hunter strode behind without speaking, and so I {{gathered}} that the direction suited him. By leaning back on the rope I walked up the slope as easily {{as if it were a}} moving stairway. Cubby pulled me up; I had only to move my feet. When we reached a level once more I discovered that the cub was growing stronger and wanted to go faster. We zigzagged across the ridge to the next canyon, which at a glance I saw was deep and steep.|$|E
60|$|His caution was so seasonable, and {{his advice}} so good, that I could not but be very well {{pleased with his}} proposal, as well as I was {{satisfied}} with his fidelity. So we fell to digging, all four of us, {{as well as the}} wooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and in about a month's time, by the end of which it was seed time, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the six months that we had to expect our crop, that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country.|$|E
60|$|The country here {{appeared}} {{to be on a}} vast scale. But that was only because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> out where we could see all around. Arizona is all on a grand, vast scale. Mountain ranges stood up to the south and east. North loomed up the lofty, steep rim of the Mogollon Mesa, with its cliffs of yellow and red, and its black line of timber. Westward lay fold on fold of low cedar-covered hills. The valley appeared a kind of magnificent bowl, rough and wild, with the distance lost in blue haze. The vegetation was dense and rather low. I saw both prickly-pear and mescal cactus, cedars, manzanita brush, scrub oak, and juniper trees. These last named were very beautiful, especially the smaller ones, with their gray-green foliage, and purple berries, and black and white checkered bark. There were no pine trees. Since we had left the rim above the character of plant life had changed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> {{a set of}} very decent players {{here just}} now. I have seen them an evening or two. David Campbell, in Ayr, wrote {{to me by the}} manager of the company, a Mr. Sutherland, who is a man of {{apparent}} worth. On New-year-day evening I gave him the following prologue, which he spouted to his audience with applause:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|O'FLAHERTY [sweetly]. Sure you <b>had</b> to <b>get</b> {{what you}} could out of us; and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to <b>get</b> what <b>we</b> could out of you. God forgive us both! ...|$|R
40|$|We {{need help}} {{identifying}} the Indiana range of this pest. • With earworm populations so low this year, mis-identification risk is lessened. • Small “worms ” around wound sites are likely sap beetle larvae – not economically important. Pest managers {{continue to monitor}} for the presence and density of western bean cutworm (WBC) larvae/ear damage. So far <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> reports of this pest’s damage in Lake...|$|R
