This type of fastener is very popular in flat-pack furniture, which is typified by items such as book cases and <b>wall</b> <b>units</b> that come in a package of pre-cut and pre-drilled components ready to assemble by a novice. They are also very common in modern modular kitchens.|$|E
500|$|Because of the film's low budget, none of {{the sets}} could be {{constructed}} [...] "from scratch." [...] After Haller made sketches and floor plans for the sets, he searched the backlots and property lofts of the major studios in search of available set units that could be inexpensively rented and then put together to form the sets he had conceived. At Universal Studios, he located numerous discarded pieces from old productions, including massive archways, fireplaces, windows and doorways, and several torture machine props. [...] At other studios, he found gigantic stairways and stone <b>wall</b> <b>units.</b> Haller selected and rented numerous pieces from these various depositories and had them delivered to California Studios, where the sets for the film were constructed, following his floor plans as closely as possible. [...] To further set the atmosphere, about 20 gallons of cobwebbing was sprayed throughout the castle's sets.|$|E

40|$|Foundation {{construction}} {{process has been}} an important key point in a successful construction engineering. The frequency of using diaphragm wall construction method among many deep excavation construction methods in Taiwan is the highest in the world. The traditional view of managing diaphragm <b>wall</b> <b>unit</b> in the sequencing of construction activities is to establish each phase of the sequencing of construction activities by heuristics. However, it conflicts final phase of engineering construction with unit construction and effects planning construction time. In order to avoid this kind of situation, we use management of science in the study of diaphragm <b>wall</b> <b>unit</b> construction to formulate multi-objective combinational optimization problem. Because the characteristic (belong to NP-Complete problem) of problem mathematic model is multi-objective and combining explosive, it is advised that using the 2 -type Self-Learning Neural Network (SLNN) to solve the N= 12, 24, 36 of diaphragm <b>wall</b> <b>unit</b> in the sequencing of construction activities program problem. In order to compare the liability of the results, this study will use random researching method in comparison with the SLNN.

5000|$|Inmates {{scheduled}} for execution are brought from death row to the <b>Walls</b> <b>Unit</b> {{early in the}} afternoon of their scheduled execution. Unlike other states, Texas prohibits inmates from special meals (since 2011), because of abuse of the privilege by past prisoners and the rationale {{that they did not}} offer a meal to their victims and therefore should not be allowed a special recognition. Inmates can, but are not required to, make a last statement prior to their execution. By law executions are scheduled to begin after 6:00 p.m. Huntsville (Central) time. [...] The inmates are housed until that time about 30 ft from the door of the execution chamber; the Texas Death House is located at the northeast corner of the <b>Walls</b> <b>Unit,</b> just below the #1 picket.

5000|$|The tagmatic {{units were}} all {{organized}} along similar lines. They were commanded by a domestikos, {{except for the}} Vigla, which was commanded by a droungarios. He was assisted by one or two officers called topotērētēs (Gr. τοποτηρητής, lit. [...] "placeholder", [...] "lieutenant"), each of whom commanded {{one half of the}} unit. Unlike the thematic units, there were no permanent intermediate command levels (tourmarchai, chiliarchoi or pentakosiarchai) until Leo VI introduced the droungarios ca. after 902.

40|$|Building and {{enclosure}} walls and/or <b>wall</b> construction <b>units</b> contain openings for ventilation and exhaust. In {{some cases}} the admission of fresh air or heat dissipation requires a conditioning of air and additional fans for sufficient transportation rates. With demands for noise control the openings reduce the sound-insulating effect of the <b>wall</b> construction <b>units</b> substantially. In order to prevent the direct acoustic break out and to create areas for damping means in the sound transmission path at the same time, the openings are connected with labyrinth systems in shape of consecutive bends and changes in cross-section, for example. The labyrinth distance reached by this is usually clearly larger than the actual wall thickness. Since also aerodynamic requirements are to be fulfilled and hidden cavities in <b>wall</b> construction <b>units</b> represent ideal dirt and dust catcher, these aspects must be treated together with the acoustic optimization. One shortcoming of all these passive means is their poor performance at low frequencies. This {{gives rise to the}} employment of active resonator systems which can add substantial attenuation especially at the low frequencies and require only short installation distances. Experimental data, acoustic computation possibilities for labyrinth systems and their linkage with the respective <b>wall</b> construction <b>unit</b> are presented...|$|R
