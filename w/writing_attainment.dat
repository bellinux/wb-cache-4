40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{personal}} epistemologies {{of teachers in}} relation to the place of linguistic and literary metalanguage in the teaching of poetry writing. The data draw on 93 interviews with 31 secondary English teachers in the UK, following lesson observations, and the data are a subset of a larger study investigating the impact of contextualised grammar teaching on <b>writing</b> <b>attainment.</b> The analysis indicates that teachers 2 ̆ 7 personal epistemologies relating to metalanguage are ambivalent and, at times, contradictory. Teachers tend to view literary metalanguage as linked to the creative freedom of writing poetry, whereas linguistic metalanguage is constructed as associated with rules and restrictions. At the same time, teachers reveal a lack of confidence with subject knowledge in both literary and linguistic metalanguage, which may be shaping their epistemological beliefs. Teachers 2 ̆ 7 comments on the place of literary and linguistic metalanguage in poetry writing are paradoxical, but do appear to be strongly connected with their personal epistemologies. They subscribe to a literate epistemology which values literary metalanguage as part of the knowledge base of a creative, expressive subject, but linguistic metalanguage is not included within this literate epistemology. 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{the correlation between}} self-assessment and the attainment of children’s creative writing throughout the primary school. It explored whether self-assessment {{was happening in the}} classroom, and whether such assessment resonated with constructivist approaches addressed in educational research. It also examined whether children’s self-assessment was in line with teacher-assessment, focusing particularly on the accuracy of children’s evaluations. Lastly, it investigated whether children’s writing had improved, with an emphasis on the quality of linguistic and structural features. Both a policy scrutiny and unstructured observation were obtained, followed by 6 participant observations and interviews with a focus group. All participants undertook a hot and cold task, which provided a comparison of writing before and after the action research was carried out. The study concluded that if children are taught how to self-assess effectively, they are able to do so with confidence. Thus, a perceived correlation between self-assessment and improved <b>writing</b> <b>attainment</b> was established. However, there seemed to be an apparent link between the design of the success criteria and the previous teaching regime involving levels, which tended to remain embedded in this teaching and learning process. Consequently, there were some discrepancies concerning children’s ability to self assess against criteria accurately, and whether such criteria benefits or hinders children of different abilities...|$|E
40|$|Literature review: This {{systematic}} review explored the existing research literature concerning {{the effectiveness of}} expressive writing interventions for children and young people. The review found that the expressive writing intervention {{was associated with a}} range of psychological and health benefits for studies that involved participants of secondary-or college-age. However, the research regarding the effectiveness of expressive writing interventions with primary-aged participants was less consistent. Analysis of the key features of the studies included in the review revealed that the discrepancy in findings could be due to the age differences of participants and the ability of the child to create the type of narrative associated with the well-being outcomes (i. e. a coherent, cohesive and emotionally disclosing narrative; Reynolds, Brewin & Saxton, 2000). It was therefore suggested that younger children may be better supported through more guided expressive writing interventions, such as therapeutic story writing (Waters, 2004), in which the child receives support from an adult to create more causal-explanatory and emotionally disclosing narratives (Fivush & Sales, 2006). Empirical paper: Researchers have suggested that anxious children may underperform at school because their worrisome thoughts reduce the capacity of their verbal working memory (Eysenck et al., 2007; Hadwin et al., 2005; Ng & Lee, 2010). It was therefore hypothesised that anxious children may benefit from interventions, such as therapeutic story writing (Waters, 2008), that provide the child with the opportunity to discuss their worries in a manner that reduces anxiety. A total of 26 participants, all experiencing anxious affect that was above the average range (T score > 50), took part in the study (7 females and 19 males, M= 10 years 2 months). A mixed measures design was conducted and the results suggested that the therapeutic story writing intervention was associated with a significant reduction in child-rated anxiety and a trend for an increase in verbal working memory capacity, but not an increase in reading or <b>writing</b> <b>attainment</b> when compared to the control group...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{reports on}} a study that explores the views of students, teachers and parents about the Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) approach in learning English {{as a second language}} in Bangladesh. This study focuses on the improvement of English language outcomes in Bangladesh. Though compulsory for fifteen years of schooling, public examination results indicate that students perform poorly in English. This research is conducted at the secondary schools in Bangladesh where English is compulsory because of its global nature as the second or foreign language. Mainstream students learning English using the Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) approach are facing many challenges. The study employs a mixed methods approach which includes qualitative interviews, semi-structured focus group interviews and observations; and quantitative data involved achievement tests to find gaps between oral and <b>written</b> <b>attainment,</b> {{in order to determine the}} effectiveness of CLT developing language skills to communicate in and outside the classrooms. ESL learners in Bangladesh have been using CLT for nearly two decades, but the attainments are not satisfactory particularly in oral language (listening and speaking) compared to written language (reading and writing). Four schools (two high and two low achievement) were selected from two divisional cities according to the public examination results. Five students, all English subject teachers and five parents from each school were invited randomly to participate. Findings indicated a confirmation of the gap between oral and written language achievements and highlighted that CLT is not working effectively to develop communicative competence to the learners. The participants identified several factors causing this. Among these were large class sizes (number of students), an extensive curriculum, insufficient class time (duration), an inappropriate examination system, excessive teacher workload, lack of parent awareness of CLT, and negative relationships between home and school. All of these factors impact on the effectiveness of CLT in Bangladesh. All participants agreed that CLT as an approach is better than other approaches used in Bangladesh to develop English language learning, but the varied interpretation and implementation (practice) makes it less effective. Therefore, they suggested some issues for local and national level policy makers that could enhance the CLT practice in Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{developed}} {{out of a}} classroom practitioner’s desire {{to find out what}} works when trying to improve both the quality of the <b>writing</b> and the <b>attainment</b> of GCSE Business Studies students. It investigates the body of literature on writing approaches and {{in the context of the}} current educational framework in UK secondary schools considers how suggested writing interventions can be used. It describes the use of an exploratory randomised controlled trial conducted with 14 - 15 year-old students in English state schools who were studying business start-ups as part of a course in ‘Business Studies’. Students participating in the trial were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group within each class in each participating school. The intervention uses a ‘Story Grammar’ strategy to improve students’ reasoning by increasing the frequency and complexity of their use of ‘connectives’ such as ‘when’, ‘if’ and ‘because’. The analysis reports positive effects of the intervention on students’ understanding as judged by the use of a standard examination style mark scheme, and the number and complexity of connectives used by students in their extended writing. The design of the experiment and its practicability as a model for investigating effects of classroom interventions are discussed...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand if readiness for advocacy is associated with attainment of participation and advocacy goals for youth with developmental disabilities transitioning into adulthood. The transtheoretical model is used to conceptualize youth’s readiness to act when new knowledge and advocacy skills are gained through Project TEAM (Teens making Environmental and Activity Modification). Project TEAM is a 12 -week group curriculum that teaches a problem-solving approach to identify and resolve environmental barriers to participation. Parents (n= 17) and youth (n= 12) ages 14 - 20 with developmental disabilities each rated the youth’s readiness for advocacy at initial, outcome and six week follow-up. Initial responses were grouped into preaction (precontemplation, contemplation and preparation) and action (action and maintenance). Each youth set a participation goal prior to Project TEAM for which the primary interventionist and principal investigator <b>wrote</b> goal <b>attainment</b> scaling (GAS) levels. Attainment of this participation goal and the application of three advocacy knowledge goals were evaluated at outcome. At outcome, GAS T-scores were calculated based on the attainment of the four goals. No significant difference was found in the GAS T-score between youth who began Project TEAM at the preaction versus the action stage. Youth with varying levels of readiness for advocacy at initial achieved their goals at outcome. Parents reported a significant increase in the youth’s readiness for advocacy between initial and outcome, and youth showed a similar, statistically non- significant trend. There appeared to be no relationship between attainment of a participation goal and change in readiness for advocacy; some youth who have no change in readiness for advocacy still achieved a participation goal, and youth who do not attain a participation goal still had changes in their readiness for advocacy. Results point to the potential benefits of Project TEAM to support changes in readiness for advocacy and attainment of a participation goal for youth with varying levels of readiness for change. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Childhood {{obesity is}} {{associated}} with increased physical and psychosocial co-morbidities, and with lower cognitive function and educational attainment. Clinical guidelines recommend lifestyle interventions (healthy diet, increased physical activity and decreased sedentary behaviour) {{for the treatment of}} childhood obesity. Lifestyle interventions are known to benefit cognitive function and educational attainment in normal weight children. However, it is not known whether the same benefits occur when lifestyle interventions are used to treat overweight and obese children. AIM & OBJECTIVES: The aim of this thesis was to assess the effect of lifestyle interventions on educational attainment in overweight and obese children in three studies: Objective 1 : Assess the efficacy of lifestyle interventions for improving educational attainment. Objective 2 : Establish the feasibility of assessing the effectiveness of a childhood primary care weight management programme on educational attainment. Objective 3 : Investigate the potential mechanisms for how lifestyle interventions for weight management might benefit educational attainment of overweight children. METHODS: Study 1 : Systematic (Cochrane) review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of single or multicomponent lifestyle interventions in children aged 3 - 18 years. Study 2 : Quasi-experimental study linking childhood weight management data of children 5 - 15 years with education data from local education authorities in Scotland. Study 3 : Qualitative study designed to gain insight into overweight and obese children’s and their parents’ perceptions and experiences in school and weight management programme obtained from focus groups and interviews. RESULTS: Study 1 : The systematic review included six studies of 674 overweight and obese children and adolescents. Findings indicated that school-based healthy lifestyle education combined with nutrition interventions can produce small improvements in overall school attainment. Single component physical activity interventions produced small improvements in mathematics attainment and associated cognitive skills (executive function, and working memory). There was no evidence of an effect of any lifestyle intervention on reading, vocabulary and language attainment, attention, inhibitory control, and simultaneous processing. Study 2 : Cross-sectorial administrative data-linkage was shown to be feasible. This pilot study showed no evidence of a beneficial effect of a primary care child weight management programme on reading, <b>writing</b> and mathematics <b>attainment</b> in overweight and obese children. However, a definitive study to properly assess the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions outside the research environment is clearly feasible in Scotland. Study 3 : The themes emerging from focus groups and interviews were body weight related school experiences, attitudes towards school, obesity and school performance, and influence of weight management. Participants perceived that being overweight can benefit educational attainment because a lack of friends means they are less distracted from learning. Low psychosocial well-being experienced by the participants was improved after taking part in a weight management programme. Parents understood this benefit could potentially impact positively on school experiences and attainment in the long-term. CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of childhood obesity, educational and cognitive outcomes could be improved, to some extent, in {{a very large number of}} school-aged children through increased physical activity and nutrition education intended for weight management. Health policy makers should be aware of these potential additional benefits when promoting physical activity and healthy eating in schools. Childhood weight management programmes exist widely and thus provide an opportunity to evaluate their impact on educational outcomes in the community. Implemented child weight management programmes may benefit from improved recording of routine data and from obtaining participants’ administrative education data to ensure adequate support and supervision of this vulnerable population. In addition, weight management programmes could consider promoting psychosocial well-being of participants to potentially benefit both health and educational outcome. Lifestyle interventions for obese children and adolescents are under-investigated particularly with regard to a) efficacy in clinical and community settings, b) short and long-term effectiveness for improving educational attainment and c) mechanisms of benefit on educational attainment and cognitive function...|$|R
