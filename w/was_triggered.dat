5|$|Travis Kvapil, who had {{the pole}} position, held the lead until he was passed by Carl Edwards on lap nine. The race was first stopped 63 laps later when a multi-car {{collision}} <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> by Brian Vickers, and was restarted 17 minutes later, with Dale Earnhardt Jr. leading the field. A second red-flag period <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> after Edwards ran into teammate Greg Biffle starting a chain-reaction accident involving a further ten drivers. Stewart led {{the field for the}} remainder of the race, until Regan Smith passed him below the yellow line (out of bounds line) on the final lap. Stewart was therefore handed the victory, and Smith was demoted from second to 18th. The race had a total of ten cautions, and 64 lead changes among 28 different drivers, setting a new Sprint Cup Series record.|$|E
5|$|A global {{financial}} crisis <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> in 2008, {{beginning in the}} United States. The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had {{a major impact on}} the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E
5|$|By lap 105, Kyle Busch held a 3.1-second {{lead over}} Kenseth. Three laps later, the third caution <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> when Stewart's car made heavy {{contact with the}} turn-two wall after his right-front tire burst. Stewart grazed his foot and climbed out of his car; {{emergency}} workers helped take him to a waiting car that {{took him to the}} infield medical center for further examination. All of the race leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments under caution. NASCAR required Edwards to fall back {{to the end of the}} longest line because one of his crew members had allowed one of his tires to roll away from his pit box during his stop. Kyle Busch maintained the lead at the restart on lap 114; he was followed by Kenseth and Gordon. Kenseth passed Kyle Busch to take the lead on lap 117. On the same lap, Gordon passed Busch. By lap 135, Kenseth had opened up a 2.2-second lead over Gordon. Biffle moved in front of Burton for fourth place on the 139th lap. On lap 144, Robby Gordon's right-front tire blew, causing him to hit the turn-two wall, and the fourth caution <b>was</b> <b>triggered.</b> All of the race leaders made pit stops during the caution.|$|E

5|$|Following the election, Mat Herben {{was chosen}} as LPF party leader as Fortuyn's successor. Together with the CDA and the VVD, the party formed part of the {{governing}} coalition, and supplied several members for the Balkenende cabinet. The party was granted four of fourteen cabinet seats, for immigration, economics, health and sports. But without its original leader and lack of a clearly defined organisational structure, the LPF soon succumbed to highly public internal squabbles. By October2002, the break-up of the government coalition <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> by the bickering of LPF Ministers Eduard Bomhoff and Herman Heinsbroek.|$|E
5|$|The Cologne War, 1583–1589, <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> by the 1582 {{conversion}} of the Archbishop-Prince Elector of Cologne, Gebhard, Truchsess of Waldburg, to Calvinism, and his subsequent marriage to Agnes of Mansfeld-Eisleben in 1583. When he refused to relinquish the Electorate, a faction of clerics in the Cologne Cathedral chapter elected another archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria, of the House of Wittelsbach.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> by allegations that, in February 1903, William Bayliss of the Department of Physiology at University College London {{performed an}} illegal vivisection, {{before an audience}} of 60 medical students, on a brown terrier dog—adequately anaesthetized, according to Bayliss and his team; conscious and struggling, according to the Swedish activists. The procedure was condemned as cruel and unlawful by the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Bayliss, whose research on dogs led {{to the discovery of}} hormones, was outraged by the assault on his reputation. He sued for libel and won.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I, which <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> by {{the assassination of}} Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo, ended Strachwitz's Olympic ambitions. The Russian Empire ordered a partial mobilization one day later and the German Empire mobilized on 30 July 1914. Strachwitz received his mobilization order while on vacation in Silesia, {{and returned to his}} unit in Berlin immediately. His regiment was subordinated to the Guards Cavalry Division and scheduled for deployment in the west.|$|E
5|$|The strike <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> by the {{decision}} of the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC), made under prolonged pressure from the federal government in view of significant labor shortages, to allow black employees of the PTC to hold non-menial jobs, such as motormen and conductors, that were previously reserved for white workers only. On August 1, 1944 the eight black employees being trained as streetcar motormen were to make their first trial run; that fact was used by the white PTC workers to start a massive sickout strike.|$|E
5|$|Tom Hooper {{was born}} in 1972 in London, England, the son of Meredith Jean (Rooney) and Richard Hooper. Meredith was an Australian author and {{academic}} and Richard was an English media businessman. Hooper was educated at Highgate School and Westminster School.

5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was a {{reaction}} to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even {{go so far as to}} be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.|$|E

5|$|Askin then named Morton as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways, being {{sworn in}} by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Eric Woodward at Government House, Sydney on 13 May 1965. As Minister, Morton was {{involved}} in the first dismissal of Warringah Shire Council in April 1967 which <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> by the gaoling of two councillors for bribery. The Councillors involved, Dennis Thomas and George Knight, were prosecuted under the Secret Commissions Prohibition Act 1919 (NSW) for receiving bribes from a development company to influence planning and development decisions, and both received gaol sentences. From 1967 to 1968 he appointed several public servants as Administrators to serve until a new council could be elected.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
5|$|Earnhardt {{moved back}} into the lead on lap 68, when Vickers' right-front tire blew in the tri-oval on the same lap, {{starting}} a multi-car accident involving Gilliland, Truex, Kahne, Skinner, McMurray, Terry Labonte, Raines and Almirola. A fourth caution <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> initially because of the accident before a red-flag was shown shortly afterward to stop the race to allow officials to clear the track of debris. The race resumed seventeen minutes later as the field elected to make pit stops. Earnhardt led on the lap-72 restart, followed by Menard, Burton, Harvick and Montoya. By lap 74, Montoya had the lead before Hamlin passed him at the start-finish line to lead the lap. Johnson moved {{to the front of}} the field two laps later, before losing the lead to teammate Earnhardt on lap 78 as the pack ran three abreast at the start-finish line.|$|E

Angered by this insult to God and to the Jewish religion, a crowd of Jews confronted Cumanus at Caesarea Maritima, demanding that the guilty party should be punished. This time the governor acted decisively and ordered that the soldier responsible should be beheaded in front of his accusers, temporarily restoring the calm.|$|E
5|$|Life is {{a memoir}} {{covering}} Keith Richards's life, starting with {{his childhood in}} Dartford, Kent, through to his success with the Rolling Stones and his current life in Connecticut. His interest in music <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> by his mother, Doris, who played records by Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine and Louis Armstrong, and his maternal grandfather, Augustus Theodore Dupree, a former big band player, who encouraged him {{to take up the}} guitar. In his teens he met up with Mick Jagger, who he had known in primary school, and discovered that they both shared a love of blues music. In the early 1960s Richards moved into a London flat, shared with Jagger and Brian Jones. Together with Bill Wyman, Ian Stewart and Charlie Watts, the Rolling Stones were founded in 1962, playing gigs at Ealing Jazz Club and the Crawdaddy Club.|$|E
5|$|The PHEBUS {{experiment}} {{was designed by}} CESR (Toulouse) to record high energy transient events in the range 100keV to 100MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated electronics. Each detector consisted of a bismuth germanate (BGO) crystal 78mm in diameter by 120mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4π steradians. The burst mode <b>was</b> <b>triggered</b> when the count rate in the 0.1 to 1.5MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 sigma in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds.
