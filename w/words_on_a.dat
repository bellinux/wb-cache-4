5|$|The course {{focuses on}} the {{strategic}} and political aspects of war and educationally prepares students for assignments as strategic leaders. The academic year runs from late June through late May. The ASLSP curriculum provides a comprehensive, multifaceted focus at the theater-strategic level across the spectrum of Joint and land force operations during peace, crisis, and war. The program includes classroom studies of strategy, regional studies, joint operations, strategic leadership, and twentieth-century conflict. Students also research and write a publishable-quality monograph of 10,000- 12,000 <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> suitable subject. ASLSP includes an extensive field studies program, with approximately eight weeks of TDY, to reinforce and expand classroom studies and meet with senior leaders across JIIM organizations. Field Studies include interactions with several agencies in the National Capital Region, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and CONUS-based combatant commands, and visits to various military and civilian governmental agencies. Normally, six US Army officers and the USMC, Canadian, and German officers remain for a second year to serve as seminar leaders as seminar leaders in the AMSP course, while one US Army officer joins {{the faculty of the}} ASLSP as the military faculty member. Graduates typically serve in a follow-on command assignment or work for a three- or four-star general officer as a member of his or her staff.|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the episode was pitched by The Simpsons writer Max Pross, and is a {{reference}} to Stanley Kubrick's 1999 drama film Eyes Wide Shut. According to Jean, the writers chose the title because [...] " [...] thought {{it would have been}} more well-remembered." [...] When Homer's jaw is wired shut, he writes <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> portable chalkboard to communicate with people. This is a reference to Anthony Hopkins' character in Legends of the Fall, who, after having a stroke, also communicates with people using a chalkboard. The song used in the ballet scene is [...] "The Blue Danube Waltz", which was also used in , another film by Kubrick.|$|E
500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the published script of Viet Rock, Richard Schechner says, [...] "performance, action, and event are the key terms of our theatre – and these terms are not literary." [...] In the 1950s, Off-off Broadway theaters began experimenting with non-traditional theater roles, blurring the lines between playwright, director, and actor. [...] The playwright's job was not just to put <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> page, but to create a theatrical experience based on a central idea. [...] By 1967, theaters such as The Living Theatre, La MaMa E.T.C. and The Open Theatre were actively devising plays from improvisational scenes crafted in the rehearsal space, rather than following a traditional script.|$|E

As he prepares to fix her lunch, he goes to his freezer and pulls out a bag containing a human tongue, intending to surreptitiously feeding it to her, as he has many times before. Reyes performs a background check on Lukesh, and becomes convinced that he is in fact responsible for the shooting. Reyes goes to Doggett, and through a computer setup that enables him to tap out <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> screen, Doggett tells her that Lukesh shot him but that Doggett also saw her with her throat cut.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{identified}} dead, Isaac E. Avery, died in action on July 2, 1863, at the Battle of Gettysburg. On that evening, his brigade stormed Cemetery Hill, trying to dislodge the Union forces. Halfway up the hill, {{he was hit}} in the throat by a musket ball. Mortally wounded, he fell from his horse. He scrawled his final <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> piece of paper: [...] "Tell my father I died with my face to the enemy." [...] Avery's body was carried as far as Williamsport, Maryland and buried there, but moved to the Washington Confederate Cemetery. A plaque was placed in the cemetery for him in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Yuliya Stepanova, a Russian runner who was key in {{unveiling}} the doping issue {{through her}} whistleblowing, attempted to gain {{permission from the}} international Olympic Committee to compete at the Games as an independent athlete, but was unsuccessful {{on the basis of}} her having previously failed a doping test. Her husband and coach Vitaly Stepanov, who also acted as whistleblower, said that the decision sent [...] "a message that the World Anti-Doping Code and the values of Olympism are merely <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> page". The couple's actions were widely denounced in Russia, with the president's spokesman labelling the couple as [...] "Judas". Stepanova received strong support from Travis Tygart, the head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, who approved of her application to compete.|$|E
2500|$|There are 61 [...] "words", 31 on side A and 30 on side B (numbered A1 to A31 and B1 to B30, {{outside to}} inside), here read outside-to-inside (putting the [...] "plumed head" [...] signs word-initially and the strokes word-finally). The {{shortest}} words are two symbols in length, the longest seven symbols. The strokes are here transcribed as diagonal strokes (/).

[...] He copied Hemingway's <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> piece of paper. [...] "He got that right," [...] Hathcock said. [...] "It was the hunt, not the killing." [...] Hathcock said in a book written about his career as a sniper: [...] "I like shooting, and I love hunting. But I never did enjoy killing anybody. It's my job.

2500|$|The Big Sister was, {{according}} to animation supervisor Jeff Weir, {{the first thing}} Jordan Thomas talked about to the animators {{when they arrived at}} 2K Marin. The character challenged the team to convey her backstory and personality through the design. Fix started with descriptive <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> page, moving to thumbnails and silhouette concepts. Early inspiration for the character's design included racing dogs, and the idea of a character that carries itself in a restrained way until it explodes in action. [...] " [...] of her as graceful and yet awkward at the same time, and that’s really the hard challenge that we had with her. Actually in terms of design, there were lots of fun things, like at one point she had a sort of 'Fallen Angel' feel to her, like broken wings," [...] Weir recalled. Motion capture sessions were used for inspiration for the alternatingly awkward and fluid motion of the character, though none of it was used in the final product. In developing her visual design, the team tried to balance the design influence of the Big Daddies with a unique look. Soft design elements influenced by the story, like Little Sisters that would ride around in the Big Sister's cage and draw on her armor, were added to complement the harsh metal {{of the rest of the}} character.|$|E
2500|$|Tennison {{had written}} many rough drafts {{with a pencil}} and then {{completed}} type-written copies. He had even created his own newspaper headlines mentioning his body being found. One read, [...] "UA Student Found Dead", another, [...] "UA Student Commits Suicide". Printed <b>words</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sign read: [...] "Do not disturb, death in the making". He also wrote his own epitaph, which read: [...] "Here lies H. B. Tennison. Born Feb. 12, 1930. Died Oct. 2, 1948. He committed suicide for the happiness of his family. May He rest in peace. Amen." [...] The officers found several more notes. Sheriff Crider had no idea in which order the many notes were written because they were all undated. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis and Bowie County Sheriff Bill Presley were surprised by the news. They said that the youth was never {{a suspect in the}} killings and that a detailed investigation would be made. Max Tackett left El Dorado, Arkansas to investigate the incident in Fayetteville. Texas Ranger Stewart Stanley was sent to investigate the suicide by [...] "Lone Wolf" [...] Gonzaullas. Fingerprints were taken from Tennison to see if any match could be made on the still-unclassified prints taken {{at the scene of the}} Booker/Martin murders. Mrs. Bessie Brown, Booker's mother, visited Tennison's mother to offer sympathy and told her that she felt that Tennison had nothing to do with her daughter's death.|$|E
2500|$|After Oscar Wao, Diaz {{began work}} on a second novel, a science-fiction epic with the working title Monstro. Diaz had {{previously}} attempted to write a science fiction novel twice prior to Oscar Wao, with earlier efforts in the genre [...] "Shadow of the Adept, a far-future novel in the vein of Gene Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer, and Dark America, an Akira-inspired post-apocalyptic nightmare" [...] remaining incomplete and unpublished. Part {{of the appeal of}} science fiction to Diaz, he explained in an interview with Wired, is that science fiction grapples with the idea of power in a manner other genres do not: [...] "I didn't see mainstream, literary, realistic fiction talking about power, talking about dictatorship, talking about the consequences of breeding people, which of course is something that in the Caribbean is never far away." [...] In an interview with New York Magazine prior to the release of This Is How You Lose Her, Diaz revealed that the work-in-progress novel concerns [...] "a 14-year-old 'Dominican York' girl who saves the planet from a full-blown apocalypse". but he also warned that the novel may never be completed: [...] "I'm only at {{the first part of the}} novel, so I haven't really gotten down to the eating," [...] he says, [...] "and I've got to eat a couple cities before I think the thing will really get going." [...] As of June 2015, the novel-in-progress appears to be abandoned– in a June 2015 interview for <b>Words</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Wire, when asked about his progress on Monstro, Diaz said [...] "Yeah, I'm not writing that book anymore..." [...] Diaz's next book, Islandborn, is to be a children's book, due for publication in March 2018.|$|E
