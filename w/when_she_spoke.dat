5|$|Goldman {{found it}} {{difficult}} to acclimate to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her outspokenness about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist Rebecca West arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher Bertrand Russell, novelist H. G. Wells, and more than 200 other guests. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> of her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government, the audience was shocked. Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment. Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke,</b> everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, it was {{announced}} that broadcast performers must organize themselves into a union, and that this union would be the only one permitted to operate in Argentina. Shortly after the union formed, Eva Duarte was elected its president. Fraser and Navarro speculate that Juan Perón made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect his mistress. Shortly after her election as president of the union, Eva Duarte began a daily program called Toward a Better Future, which dramatized in soap opera form the accomplishments of Juan Perón. Often, Perón's own speeches were played during the program. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke,</b> Eva Duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners to believe what she herself believed about Juan Perón.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{children}} of other high-ranking Nazis, such as Gudrun Himmler and Albert Speer, Jr., Göring did not publicly comment on her father's role but was interviewed for Swedish TV in 1986 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> lovingly of her parents.|$|E
25|$|On 29 September 1824, off the Cape Verde Islands, Cumberland {{was on her}} way to Rio de Janeiro <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> with , {{which was}} bound for Bombay. Cumberland arrived at Rio de Janeiro 20 October, but Barkworth was never heard from again.|$|E

60|$|A faint, wraith-like {{change of}} {{expression}} drifted over Emily's beautiful face {{and was gone}} in a moment. What was it--relief? Regret? It {{would have been impossible}} to say. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> next <b>spoke</b> her vibrant voice was as perfectly melodious as usual.|$|R

25|$|The Church of Scientology's {{legal team}} {{proceeded}} to sue Joan Wood {{to gain access}} to Wood's files; including tissue, organ and blood samples from McPherson's body. The lawsuit argued that Wood waived any right to keep her records on the case closed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> openly about the case with news reporters. The Church alleged that the records were needed to start their legal defense. These records were previously denied to the Church because they were part of an ongoing criminal investigation.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken aback by the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Stoltenberg's drug {{addiction}} became {{known to the}} Norwegian public in October 2001, one week after her brother had resigned from his first cabinet. The revelation came <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> {{about it in the}} current affairs television program, Rikets Tilstand, which broke previous records for number of viewers. Following the program in which she appeared together with her father, Thorvald Stoltenberg, she received more than 2,000 letters of support from viewers who {{in one way or another}} had experienced the problems associated with illegal drug abuse. Thorvald Stoltenberg has described his experiences with having a child who was an intravenous drug user in his 2001 memoirs, Det handler om mennesker ("It's about people")–one day being immersed in peace negotiations in the Balkans, the next wandering the streets of Oslo trying to find Nini.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} poetic {{in the nature}} of Mrs. Quiverful. She was neither a Medea nor a Constance. <b>When</b> angry, <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> out her anger in plain words, and in a tone which might have been {{modulated}} with advantage; but she did so, at any rate, without affectation. Now, without knowing it, she rose to a tragic vein.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> at last <b>she</b> <b>spoke,</b> Christopher North says 'she {{astonished}} the world.' Calm, clear, courageous, exact as to time, date, and circumstance, {{was that}} first testimony, {{backed by the}} equally clear testimony of Dr. Lushington.|$|R
60|$|A doubt, a tormenting doubt beset him. <b>When</b> {{presently}} <b>she</b> <b>spoke,</b> he saw {{how true}} had been the instinct of which that doubt was born, for her words revealed the fact that of all that he had said {{the only thing that}} had touched her consciousness and absorbed it from all other considerations was Blood's conduct as it regarded herself.|$|R
25|$|Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott met in 1840 while {{en route}} to London where they were shunned as women by the male {{leadership}} of the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention. In 1848, Mott and Stanton held a woman's rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York, where a declaration of independence for women was drafted. Lucy Stone helped to organize the first National Women's Rights Convention in 1850, a much larger event at which Sojourner Truth, Abby Kelley Foster, and others spoke sparked Susan B. Anthony {{to take up the}} cause of women's rights. In December 1851, Sojourner Truth contributed to the feminist movement <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> at the Women’s Convention in Akron, Ohio. She delivered her powerful “Ain’t I a Woman” speech in an effort to promote women’s rights by demonstrating their ability to accomplish tasks that have been traditionally associated with men. Barbara Leigh Smith met with Mott in 1858, strengthening the link between the transatlantic feminist movements.|$|E
500|$|When Cosby {{originally}} pitched The Cosby Show to NBC, it {{revolved around}} {{the life of a}} blue-collar couple; Clair was intended to be a plumber while the character's husband Cliff, portrayed by Cosby himself, was a limousine driver. Eventually, the idea of Clair working as a plumber was discarded and the character briefly became a Dominican housewife instead. Inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, of whom Cosby was a fan, much of the show's humor would have been directly derived from Clair's tendency to revert back to her native language Spanish when upset or agitated. Describing this concept as [...] "the reverse of [...] Lucy," [...] Cosby explained that the husband [...] "would be the person that didn’t understand <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> Spanish" [...] as opposed to the wife.|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. (Mathangi [...] "Maya" [...] Arulpragasam) had {{released}} her debut album Arular in 2005, which achieved critical acclaim and sold 130,000 copies. Plans {{for a second}} album were first revealed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> later that year of her intention to work with American producer Timbaland. At one point it was anticipated that he would produce {{the bulk of the}} album. However, she was unable to gain a long-term work visa to enter the US, reportedly due to her family's connections with guerrillas in Sri Lanka. This led to conflicts between the two artists' schedules and meant that Timbaland's involvement was restricted to a poorly received guest verse on the track [...] "Come Around". M.I.A. instead opted to record the album at a variety of locations around the world, beginning by travelling to India following the last date of her Arular Tour in Japan in February 2006.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Prime at {{the moment}} said nothing; but <b>when</b> next <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> her words showed her {{intention}} of having her things {{brought back to the}} cottage on the next day. I think it must be felt that Rachel had won the victory. She felt it so herself, and was conscious that no further attempt would be made to carry her off to Dorcas meetings against her own will.|$|R
500|$|Kids Can Say No! is a twenty-minute British short {{educational}} film intended {{to teach children}} about sexual abuse. Harris said he was naive about the subject and was motivated to make the film by a female teacher who told him that, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> to her students about abuse, a traumatised girl {{ran out of the}} room; the girl later disclosed that she was being abused by a family member. According to Harris, he {{came up with the idea}} for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre production of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. He was also inspired by a similar Australian production and a Swedish film about two children befriended by a large man on a farm. In an interview, Harris said that, when he saw the Swedish film, he thought the man was going to abuse the children, but that his expectations were incorrect and that [...] "the film was completely innocent; I was not".|$|E
500|$|In July 1917 Hornung's poem, [...] "Wooden Crosses", was {{published}} in The Times, and in September, [...] "Bond and Free" [...] appeared. Towards {{the end of the}} year, he was accepted as a volunteer in a YMCA canteen and library [...] "a short distance behind the Front Line". During his service in Arras, in February 1918 he borrowed a staff car from a friend and visited his son's grave near Ypres, before returning to the library in Arras. Hornung was concerned about support for pacifism among troops, and wrote to his wife about it. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> to Doyle about the matter, rather than discussing it with Hornung he informed the military authorities. Hornung was angered by Doyle's action, and [...] "told him {{there was no need for}} him to 'butt in' except for his own 'satisfaction'." [...] Relations between the two men were strained as a result. Hornung continued to work at the library until the German Spring Offensive in March overran the British positions and he was forced to retreat, firstly to Amiens and then, in April, back to England. He stayed in England until November 1918, when he again took up his YMCA duties, establishing a rest hut and library in Cologne. In 1919 Hornung's account of his time spent in France, Notes of a Camp-Follower on the Western Front, {{was published}}. Doyle later wrote of the book that [...] "there are parts of it which are brilliant in their vivid portrayal", while Hornung's biographer, Alison Cox, described the book as [...] "one of the best records of the war as experienced on the front lines". That year Hornung also published his third and final volume of poetry, The Young Guard.|$|E
2500|$|Wherever she went, she was {{received}} enthusiastically, especially {{by the young}} people of America. [...] They loved this white-haired lady with {{the eyes of a}} seer that appeared to be lighted from within. [...] She spoke with a melodious voice; <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> everyone listened. [...] She had a thin, wispy quality that made her appear as the apparition of the very spirits she described. [...] Indeed, her skin had an almost translucent quality.|$|E

60|$|She {{looked at}} him very keenly, through narrowed lids {{scanning}} his face and trying to read his intent. But there was obviously no look of sarcasm in his eyes, nor {{the hint of a}} sneer in the even placidity of his voice. Once more that unaccountable feeling of irritation seemed to overmaster her, the same sense of wrath and of injustice which had assailed her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>spoke</b> to him.|$|R
2500|$|Genie {{had very}} little control of her voice during this time, so it was [...] {{completely}} monotonic, abnormally high-pitched, and very soft, with many of her early utterances completely silent and others so quiet that they sounded like whispers. Throughout 1971 her voice was extremely glottalized, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> she frequently pronounced only a few sounds; for instance, the word [...] "doctor" [...] sounded more like [...] "dert". Despite knowing how to ask questions, she could only indicate them through facial expressions. Despite the lack of variability in her own voice, she clearly understood different tones of voice in other peoples' speech.|$|E
2500|$|Speier is {{concerned}} {{for the protection}} of the environment and wants to preserve the health of this planet. She lists as evidence the decline of salmon on the West Coast as proof of global warming. Speier believes global warming poses a growing danger and negatively affects the environment. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>spoke</b> to the House on the subject of global warming and the environment, she expressed a desire [...] "to craft a bipartisan and commonsense energy plan that makes polluters pay, provides for middle-class energy tax credits, and creates a new industry and lots of good, clean, green jobs". Jackie Speier is working to improve energy legislation with the Clean Air Rebate Act of 2009, the Home Star Act and the American Clean Energy and Security Act.|$|E
