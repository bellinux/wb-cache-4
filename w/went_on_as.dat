The dispute {{threatened}} to derail {{the participation of the}} United States in the 1964 Summer Olympics. His presence helped to broker a deal, and participation in the games <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> planned.|$|E
5|$|The TSO board sent {{other musicians}} {{in place of}} the six who had been denied visas, and the concert <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> planned.

5|$|A {{total of}} 35 power crews, along with outside contractors, worked to restore power. By {{two days after}} the storm, 2,000 {{remained}} without power in scattered areas. Various locations in the city of Dover were without power for about 30hours. There, the removal of debris exceeded the capacity of the local landfall, resulting in officials temporarily storing it elsewhere. Over 200volunteers donated time, food and money to provide hot meals for individuals and families affected by the storm. Support teams provided by county officials transported over 300 tons of ruined accessories from the storm, such as appliances, carpets, and drywall, to local landfills. Qualifying for two NASCAR races in Dover were cancelled due to the hurricane, although the races <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> scheduled.|$|E

5|$|Lesnar's {{rapid rise}} to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with The Undertaker, which {{involved}} a match at Unforgiven on September 22. The match ended in a double disqualification and Lesnar retained the title. Lesnar faced The Undertaker again at No Mercy, this time in a Hell in a Cell match. Leading up to the match, in the storyline, Lesnar broke The Undertaker's hand with a propane tank. Despite Heyman begging McMahon not to let The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon, the request was denied and the match <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> planned. At No Mercy on October 20, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to retain the title. After his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker, Lesnar successfully retained the WWE Championship in a handicap match with Heyman against Edge at Rebellion on October 26.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the show, the {{producers}} from WCW/Turner Broadcasting System made several changes to the format, including reducing the overall time by 40 minutes. This forced AAA to change the first three matches from the traditional best-of-three falls to a single fall. The producers also cut back on the elaborate entrances that AAA usually had for their major shows and did not allow AAA to have a dark match before the broadcast started to rev up the crowd. The producers also pushed to change the semi-main event to a singles match between El Hijo del Santo and Eddie Guerrero, but in the end, the match <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> originally planned and advertised.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} the February 1922 Washington Naval Treaty forced the class' cancellation, but the two closest to {{completion}} (Amagi and Akagi) were saved from the scrappers by a provision that allowed two capital ships to be converted to aircraft carriers. However, the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake caused significant stress damage to the hull of Amagi. The structure was too heavily damaged to be usable, and conversion work was abandoned. Amagi was struck from the navy list and sold for scrapping, which began on 14 April 1924. The other two ships, Atago and Takao, were officially cancelled two years later (31 July 1924) and were broken up for scrap in their slipways. Akagi <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> an aircraft carrier {{to fight in the}} Second World War, where it was sunk after air attack during the Battle of Midway.|$|E

25|$|Considerable {{research}} has been conducted about regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica.

Due to this, the show did not take its usual format; there were no lights and neither O'Leary nor the three other judges made an entrance. Instead, the show {{commenced}} with O'Leary already on stage and the judges already sitting at their desk. Both O'Leary and Cowell addressed the viewers and audience regarding Gately's death and Walsh's absence. Following this, the show <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> normal with Minogue, Cowell and Cole present as judges.|$|E

25|$|Tennessee seceded {{from the}} Union in June 1861, and Memphis briefly became a Confederate stronghold. Union ironclad gunboats {{captured}} {{the city in}} the naval Battle of Memphis on June 6, 1862, and the city and state were occupied by the Union Army {{for the duration of the}} war. The Union Army commanders allowed the city to maintain its civil government during most of this period but excluded Confederate veterans from office, which shifted political dynamics in the city as the war <b>went</b> <b>on.</b> <b>As</b> Memphis was used as a Union supply base, associated with nearby Fort Pickering, it continued to prosper economically throughout the war. Meanwhile, Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest harassed Union forces in the area.|$|E
25|$|Kent State/Cambodia Incursion Protest, Washington, D.C.: A {{week after}} the Kent State {{shooting}}s, on May 4, 100,000 anti-war demonstrators converged on Washington, D.C. to protest the shooting {{of the students in}} Ohio and the Nixon administration's incursion into Cambodia. Even though the demonstration was quickly put together, protesters were still able to bring out thousands to march in the Capital. It was an almost spontaneous response to the events of the previous week. Police ringed the White House with buses to block the demonstrators from getting too close to the executive mansion. Early in the morning before the march, Nixon met with protesters briefly at the Lincoln Memorial but nothing was resolved and the protest <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> planned.|$|E
