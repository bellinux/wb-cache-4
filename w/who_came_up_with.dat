5|$|Special prizes may {{be awarded}} for {{solutions}} of outstanding elegance or involving good generalisations of a problem. This last happened in 1995 (Nikolay Nikolov, Bulgaria) and 2005 (Iurie Boreico), but was more frequent {{up to the}} early 1980s. The special prize in 2005 was awarded to Iurie Boreico, a student from Moldova, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a brilliant solution to question 3, which was an inequality involving three variables.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{developed}} {{over a period}} of 10 years by Atchison, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the initial concept after seeing the 1994 Scripps National Spelling Bee and noting {{that a majority of the}} competitors came from good socioeconomic backgrounds. After completing the script in 1999, Atchison won one of the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting in 2000, which attracted producers Sid Ganis and Nancy Hult Ganis. After an initial inability to secure funding, the project got a second wind as a result of the success of the 2002 documentary film Spellbound. Lionsgate Films undertook the production in 2004 and in the following year it was filmed in South Los Angeles on a budget of over $6 million.|$|E

5|$|The BBC's Sports Personality of the Year {{was created}} by Paul Fox, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the idea while he was editor of the {{magazine}} show Sportsview. The first award ceremony took place in 1954 as part of Sportsview, and was presented by Peter Dimmock. Held at the Savoy Hotel on 30 December 1954, the show lasted 45minutes. It consisted of one award for the sportsperson judged by the public to have achieved the most that year. Voting was by postcard, and rules presented in a Radio Times article stipulated that nominations were restricted to athletes who had featured on the Sportsview programme since April. For the inaugural BBC Sportsperson of the Year award, 14,517 votes were cast and Christopher Chataway beat fellow athlete Roger Bannister. The following year the show was renamed Sports Review of the Year and given a longer duration of 75 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two {{were talking about how}} girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E
5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E

5|$|Hawks's first all {{sound film}} was The Dawn Patrol, {{based on an}} {{original}} story by John Monk Saunders and (unofficially) Hawks. Saunders was a flight instructor during World War I and had written Wings. He {{was considered one of}} the most talented writers in Hollywood and was often compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Accounts vary on <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the idea of the film, but Hawks and Saunders developed the story together and tried to sell it to several studios before First National agreed to produce it. Saunders received solo screen credit for the original story and won an Academy Award for Best Story in 1930. The screenplay was written by Hawks, Seton Miller and Dan Totheroh and starred Richard Barthelmess and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Shooting began in late February 1930, about the same time that Howard Hughes was finally finishing his epic World War I aviation epic Hell's Angels, which had been in production since September 1927. Shrewdly, Hawks began to hire many of the aviation experts and cameramen that had been employed by Hughes, including Elmer Dyer, Harry Reynolds and Ira Reed. When Hughes found out about the rival film, he did everything he could to sabotage The Dawn Patrol. He harassed Hawks and other studio personal, hired a spy that was quickly caught and finally sued First National for copyright infringement. Hughes eventually dropped the lawsuit in late 1930—he and Hawks had become good friends during the legal battle. In the film, Barthelmess and Fairbanks play two Royal Flying Corps pilots during World War I who deal with the pressure of wartime combat and constant death by drinking and fighting with their commanding officer. Filming was finished in late May 1930 and it premiered in July, setting a first-week box office record at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. The film became one of the biggest hits of 1930.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, a {{group of}} senior {{government}} civil servants was put together in the Awards Co-ordination Committee (ACC). The ACC primarily dealt with questions in regards to British awards being presented to Canadians. Working {{in the same period}} of time was a Parliamentary committee, the Special Committee on Honours and Awards, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a recommendation to create a Canadian order. Though ultimately rejected, the name Order of Canada was brought up and subsequently stuck, until its establishment later.|$|E
25|$|The Henri Delaunay Trophy, {{which is}} {{awarded to the}} winner of the European Championship, is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the idea of a European {{championship}} but died five years prior to the first tournament in 1960.

25|$|Although Zao Zhi {{was the one}} <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{the idea}} of the tuntian system, Cao Cao thought that Ren Jun {{deserved}} the highest credit for the success of the system because {{he was the one who}} supervised its implementation. He thus proposed to the Han imperial court to commend Ren Jun for his achievement by enfeoffing him as a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯) with a marquisate of 300 taxable households. Later, he promoted Ren Jun to the position of a Changshui Colonel (長水校尉).|$|E
25|$|The Milpitas Town Seal was {{the idea}} of member Betty McDermott’s husband John, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the idea for a seal of the Minuteman from one of his son’s history books. He {{designed}} the seal and took it to Arnie’s Signs and had 4,000 decals made. The city's seal shows Daniel Chester French's Minuteman statue, musket in hand, standing in the Santa Clara Valley, with the golden hills of Milpitas rising to the east. He faces defiantly south toward San Jose because early residents of Milpitas considered themselves as minutemen when they defeated efforts by San Jose to annex newly incorporated Milpitas.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Rachmaninoff {{approached}} by {{the makers of}} the British film Dangerous Moonlight to write a short concerto-like piece {{for use in the}} film, but he declined. The job went to Richard Addinsell and the orchestrator Roy Douglas, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Warsaw Concerto. In May 1940, Rachmaninoff underwent minor surgery which was followed by a summer's break at Orchard's Point, an estate near Huntington, New York on Long Island, which was met with a period of anxiety and stress over the concern of his daughter Tatiana following the German takeover in the Battle of France. Rachmaninoff's last completed work, Symphonic Dances, was the only piece he composed in its entirety while living in the U.S. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra premiered the piece at the Academy of Music on 7 January 1941.|$|E
25|$|The All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award is {{presented}} annually {{to the most}} outstanding player of each season's All-Star Game. Presented each year beginning in 1962 (two games were held in 1962 and an award was presented for each game), the MVP award was originally called the Arch Ward Memorial Award, after the man <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{the concept of the}} All-Star Game in 1933. In 1970, the name was changed to the Commissioner's Trophy (two NL players were presented the award in 1975); however, the name change was reversed in 1985, so that the World Series Trophy (first awarded in 1967) could be renamed the Commissioner's Trophy. In 2002, the trophy itself retained its eponym, while the award itself was dedicated as The Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award, in honor of former Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams, who had died earlier that year.|$|E
25|$|Insects {{that had}} evolved their proto-wings {{in a world}} without flying predators could afford to be exposed openly without risk, but this changed when {{carnivorous}} flying insects evolved. It is unknown when they first evolved, but once these predators had emerged they put a strong selection pressure on their victims and themselves. Those of the prey <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a good solution about how to fold their wings over their backs {{in a way that}} made it possible for them to live in narrow spaces would not only be able to hide from flying predators (and terrestrial predators if they were on the ground) but also to exploit a wide variety of niches that were closed to those who couldn't fold their wings in this way. And today the neopterous insects (those that can fold their wings back over the abdomen) are by far the most dominant group of insects.|$|E
