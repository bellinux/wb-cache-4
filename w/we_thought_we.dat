Her husband, {{property}} developer Rod Weston, was quoted as saying, [...] "It's almost our silver anniversary so <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> had better get on with it".|$|E
500|$|Mr. Arakawa and I {{decided that}} we would go down and simply tell him [...] that we've come {{to tell you to}} your face that we would pay you if <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were liable, but we had done our {{homework}} and we were not prepared to pay anything because we hadn't done anything wrong. We just wanted to essentially look him in the face and tell him that. It seemed the honorable thing to do.|$|E
500|$|President of the Cambridge University Boat Club, Max Justicz, {{said of the}} {{previous}} year's race: [...] "We were burned on that day. Badly burned. It was worse than other defeats because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could win ... Oxford just rowed through us; with every stroke they took they destroyed our belief in ourselves." [...] His crew mate, Nick Clarry, focused on the approach to this year's race: [...] "This year it's heads down {{and get on with}} the job. [...] We know that if we don't cross the line first on the day, nobody could care less who we are." ...|$|E

500|$|Many years later, co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney recalled, [...] "To be frank, I {{was really}} surprised, because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were {{creating}} the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, {{and it turns}} out they're the most international characters ever created". Mike Dann, a former CBS executive whom Cooney had hired as a CTW vice-president and her assistant, was assigned to field offers from other countries to produce their own versions of Sesame Street. Dann's appointment led to television critic Marvin Kitman stating, [...] "After he [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".|$|E
500|$|... "We {{decided to}} go in and film her doing her thing [...] so even though she wasn't at the show, she could still {{be a part of the}} show. As big as that song is getting for us right now, it was {{definitely}} a song that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> had to have in the show. She cut a thing for us to use, and I cut a thing for her to use in her show if she wants to do that. It's a cool way to have her be a part of the show even though she's not going to be there every night." ...|$|E
500|$|Matheos {{originally}} intended the first OSI album as a [...] "project" [...] which would never produce a second album. For Free, Matheos and Moore {{wanted to use}} a different musician lineup to focus OSI on primarily being Matheos and Moore. They {{did not want to}} give the impression that the guests on the first album were part of the band. Matheos stated that the music on Free was [...] "focused less on the progressive elements or the metal elements that were on the first record. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could do something just a little more groove oriented." [...] Matheos and Moore had both worked with bassist Joey Vera in the past and considered him [...] "perfect" [...] for the album. Moore was pleased with Vera's bass parts: Vera sent them to Moore in a state such that they required very little editing or enhancement for the final mix of the album.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles asked {{producer}} Martin {{to come to}} the rescue, so {{he borrowed}} two four-track recorders from EMI, and long-time Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick was given the task of building and setting up a studio with portable equipment. After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least £300,000 (£4.5 million in 2015 pounds). Starr once approved of one of Mardas’ ideas: [...] "He [...] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio – you’d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren’t interested at all".|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Mercedes apologised to Hamilton for the pit call, which {{commentators}} such as F1Fanatic's Keith Collantine, Formula One {{correspondent for}} The Guardian Paul Weaver, and former Formula One driver David Coulthard felt cost him the victory. Team boss Toto Wolff told the press: [...] "We got our numbers wrong. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> had the gap for Lewis to take fresh tyres {{and come back}} out in the lead behind the safety car, ahead of Nico and covering off any risk of another competitor taking fresh tyres. But the calculation was incorrect and he came out in third place." [...] Indeed, {{more than half of}} the teams made a pit stop at least one car when the safety car was deployed, just as Hamilton did. However, he as race leader caught up with the safety car quicker and lost a considerably larger amount of time on his way into the pit lane, leading to him coming out behind Rosberg and Vettel.|$|E
500|$|The {{initial set}} release date was late 2004, {{and the band}} had to delay the album to January 2005. But as the new target date was approaching, the band again {{discarded}} songs, which they deemed [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "passionless". Sixty songs were written during these sessions, fifty-two of which were ditched. The band started rehearsing the songs for a planned tour, but felt the songs sounded better live compared to their recorded versions: [...] "We realized that we didn't really have the right songs {{and some of them}} were starting to sound better because we were playing them than they did on record, so <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> better go back and record them again." [...] Guitarist Jonny Buckland has said that the band had pushed themselves [...] "forward in every direction" [...] in making the album, but they felt it sounded like they were going backwards compared to their earlier works.|$|E

500|$|The title {{sequence}} of SpongeBob {{for the special}} was made exclusively for the series' tenth anniversary. It was animated in stop motion animation, with Cee Lo Green performing the theme. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan of Screen Novelties animated its opening titles. Finnegan claimed that the crew were [...] "thrill" [...] to do the title sequence because [...] "the original title sequence is so recognizable and everyone seen {{it over and over}} and it's so great in its own way." [...] Executive producer and the episode's writer Paul Tibbitt said [...] "We don't just want to redraw it , {{we want it to be}} something special and different So <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> would do it in three dimensions" [...] Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson lauded the new title sequence and said it is [...] "SO great!" [...] Some traditional animation on scraps of brown paper are intermixed into the stop motion.|$|E
500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity because {{the whole idea of}} Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what they set out to achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental and then trying to bring it into something that was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we should have said, 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'" [...] Mullen refers to the album as [...] "No Craic on the Horizon" [...] and said, [...] "It was pretty fucking miserable. It turns out that we're not as good as <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were and things got in the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] {{and that it}} would be wrong to record new {{material}} under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were just going through the motions... I think that has a lot to do with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way he would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|According to {{director}} Michael Fischa, [...] "the health craze had blossomed in LA. clubs came up like mushrooms. So {{quickly that}} they went out of business.

500|$|Soon after Sesame Street {{debuted in}} the USA, the CTW was asked {{independently}} by producers from several countries to produce {{versions of the}} series in their countries. Cooney remarked, [...] "To be frank, I was really surprised, because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, {{and it turns out}} they're the most international characters ever created". She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who quit commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries. In response to Dann's appointment, television critic Marvin Kitman said, [...] "After [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV". This was a reference to the May 1970 Mississippi state commission decision to ban the series. [...] By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term [...] "co-productions".|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from several countries all around the world approached the Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop, or [...] "the Workshop"), the organization responsible for the show's production, to create and produce versions of Sesame Street in their countries. [...] Co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney was approached by German public television officials about a year after the US version debuted. Many years later, Cooney recalled, [...] "To be frank, I was really surprised, because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created". [...] She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who left commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president.

500|$|Modeled {{after the}} Puss Gets the Boot {{characters}} with slight differences, the series followed Jerry, the pesky rodent who continuously outwitted his feline foe, Tom. Hanna said they {{settled on the}} cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because [...] "we knew we needed two characters. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought." [...] The revamped characters first appeared in 1941's The Midnight Snack. Over the next 17 years, Barbera and Hanna worked exclusively on Tom and Jerry, directing more than 114 popular cartoon shorts. During World War II, they also made animated training films. Tom and Jerry relied mostly on motion instead of dialog. [...] Despite its popularity, Tom and Jerry has often been criticized as excessively violent. [...] Nonetheless, the series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short, The Yankee Doodle Mouse (1943)—a war-time adventure. Tom and Jerry was ultimately nominated for 14 Academy Awards, winning 7. No other character-based theatrical animated series has won more awards, nor has any other series featuring the same characters. Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of [...] MGM's live-action films, including Anchors Aweigh (1945) and Invitation to the Dance (1956) with Gene Kelly, and Dangerous When Wet (1953) with Esther Williams.|$|E
