25|$|Panagoulis, Alexandros (1974), Vi scrivo da un carcere in Grecia (I <b>write</b> <b>you</b> from {{a prison}} in Greece), Milan, Rizzoli.|$|E
25|$|Alexandros Panagoulis {{was brutally}} {{tortured}} during his incarceration by the junta. Many {{believe that he}} maintained his faculties thanks to his will, determination to defend his beliefs, {{as well as his}} keen sense of humour. While imprisoned at Bogiati, Panagoulis is said to have written his poetry on the walls of his cell or on small papers, often using his own blood as ink (as told in the poem 'The Paint'). Many of his poems have not survived. However, he managed to smuggle some to friends while in prison, or to recall and rewrite them later. While in prison his first collection in Italian titled Altri seguiranno: poesie e documenti dal carcere di Boyati (Others will Follow: Poetry and Documents of the Prison of Boyati) was published in Palermo in 1972 with an introduction of the Italian politician Ferruccio Parri and the Italian film director and intellectual Pier Paolo Pasolini. For this collection Panagoulis was awarded the Viareggio International Prize of Poetry (Premio Viareggio Internazionale) the following year. After his liberation he published his second collection in Milan under the title Vi scrivo da un carcere in Grecia (I <b>write</b> <b>you</b> from a prison in Greece) with an introduction by Pasolini. He had previously published several collections in Greek, including The Paint (I Bogia).|$|E
25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to <b>write</b> <b>you</b> all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and <b>write.</b> <b>You</b> said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

500|$|Pratchett {{said that}} to <b>write,</b> <b>you</b> must read extensively, {{both inside and outside}} your chosen genre and to the point of [...] "overflow".

[...] However, Pratchett enjoyed writing, regarding its monetary rewards as [...] "an unavoidable consequence", rather than the reason for writing.|$|E

500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "In the Presence of Enemies" [...] was {{inspired}} by a Korean manhwa named Priest, as Petrucci explains that not being a manga fan, precisely, [...] " [...] I like it though. This one, I just stumbled upon and I really liked the content. It inspired me to take a different approach lyrically. You have to keep things interesting for yourself when writing new material so I just took this and ran with it. [...] Those types of lyrics are fun to <b>write,</b> <b>you</b> know? The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master. And the story ends up really being the darkness within and goes through the different phases where he has to fight demons and things like that.|$|E
500|$|The band {{recorded}} demos at DML Studios, a small practice {{studio in}} Escondido, California, where the band had written Dude Ranch and Enema of the State. The group {{had written a}} dozen songs after three weeks and invited their manager, Rick DeVoe, {{to be the first}} person outside Blink-182 to hear the new material, which the band found [...] "catchy [...] a definitive edge". DeVoe sat in the control room and quietly listened to the recordings, and pressed the band at the end on why there was no [...] "Blink-182 good-time summer anthem [...] ". DeLonge and Hoppus were furious, remarking, [...] "You want a fucking single? I'll <b>write</b> <b>you</b> the cheesiest, catchiest, throwaway fucking summertime single you've ever heard!" [...] Hoppus went home and wrote lead single [...] "The Rock Show" [...] in ten minutes, and DeLonge similarly wrote [...] "First Date", which became the most successful singles from the record and future live staples.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street {{has used}} many writers in its long history. As Dave Connell, one of Sesame Streets {{original}} producers, has stated, {{it was difficult}} to find adults who could identify a preschooler's interest level. Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. Norman Stiles, head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would [...] "burn out" [...] after writing about a dozen scripts. According to Gikow, Sesame Street went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that {{it would be easier to}} teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy. As Stone stated, [...] "Writing for children is not so easy". Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, [...] "It's not an easy show to <b>write.</b> <b>You</b> have to know the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt".|$|E

500|$|The first issue, dated August 1938, {{appeared}} on newsstands in May of that year. It contained [...] "Survival" [...] by Arthur J. Burks {{as the lead}} novel; this was well received by the readers, and did not contain any sexual content. The first couple of issues contained several stories that did little to offend readers, but they also contained two stories by Henry Kuttner, who was selling regularly to the Goodmans' other publications. Erisman and the Goodmans had asked Kuttner to spice up his submissions to Marvel Science Stories. He obliged with [...] "Avengers of Space" [...] in the first issue, which included [...] "scenes of aliens lusting after unclothed Earth women", {{in the words of}} sf historian Mike Ashley, and [...] "The Time Trap" [...] in the second issue. Reader reaction was strongly negative: a typical letter, from William Hamling, later to become a publisher and editor of science fiction magazines in his own right, commented, [...] "I was just about to <b>write</b> <b>you</b> a letter of complete congratulations when my eyes fell upon Kuttner's [...] "The Time Trap". All I can say is: PLEASE, in the future, dislodge such trash from your magazine". In addition to these two stories published under Kuttner's name, there were two more stories in the same two issues by him under pseudonyms which were equally offensive to readers such as Hamling.|$|E
500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't <b>write</b> <b>you</b> a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E

[...] As your friend, Spotted Tail, I urge you to send your children with me to this Carlisle School and I will do everything I can to advance them in intelligence and industry in order that they may come back and help you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the months}} before the Spanish Civil War, she joined the strikers of Cadavio mine in Asturias and stood beside poor tenants evicted {{in a suburb of}} Madrid.

During a match against Andorra in March 2007, McClaren and the England team received abuse from supporters during a poor performance in a 3–0 win. McClaren {{walked out of the}} post-match press conference after only two minutes of questions, saying, [...] "Gentlemen, if you want to write whatever you want to <b>write,</b> <b>you</b> can write it because that is all I am going to say.

2500|$|The {{eye-witness}} Richard Clough, a Welsh Protestant merchant then in Antwerp, saw: [...] "all the churches, chapels {{and houses}} of religion utterly defaced, and {{no kind of}} thing left whole within them, but broken and utterly destroyed, being done after such order and by so few folks that {{it is to be}} marvelled at." [...] The Church of Our Lady in Antwerp, later made the cathedral (illustrated at top): [...] "looked like a hell, with above 10,000 torches burning, and such a noise as if heaven and earth had got together, with falling of images and beating down of costly works, such sort that the spoil was so great that a man could not well pass through the church. So that in fine , I cannot <b>write</b> <b>you</b> in x sheets of paper the strange sight I saw there, organs and all destroyed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes {{to produce}} manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg {{developed}} an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but {{also had a}} high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating. Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: [...] "if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see {{this is a very}} shiny surface. When you <b>write</b> <b>you</b> use a water based ink, [...] you put your pen into it and it runs off. [...] Now [...] if you print that's exactly what you don't want. One of Gutenberg's inventions was an ink which wasn't ink, it's a varnish. So what we call printer's ink is actually a varnish, and that means it sticks to its surface." ...|$|E
