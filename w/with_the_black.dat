5|$|In {{his first}} season <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hawks, 1934–35, Morenz played in all 48 games for the team, scoring 8 goals and 34 points, an {{improvement}} over the previous season. The Black Hawks reached the playoffs, though Morenz was held pointless in the two games played. The following season was not as good for Morenz. He did not feel comfortable in Chicago, and was being benched, playing fewer minutes than he was used to. After 23 games <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hawks, in which he scored 15 points, Morenz was traded {{for the second time}} in his career; he was sent to the New York Rangers on January 26, 1936, for forward Glen Brydson. Playing 19 games for the Rangers, Morenz scored 2 goals and had another 4 assists for 6 points, giving him 21 points over the season.|$|E

The Black Hand quickly incapacitates him with a spell that also restores the last of Celebrimbor's memories.

However, Celebrimbor is able to briefly paralyze Sauron from within, allowing Talion to destroy Sauron's physical form. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hand dead, Celebrimbor wishes to depart for Valinor. Talion instead convinces him to stay and attempt to overthrow Sauron. Gazing at Mount Doom, Talion declares his intention to forge a new Ring of Power.|$|E

5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate with the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E

The family moved back to Canada when Bobby signed with the original Winnipeg Jets in 1972. Brett moved to Vancouver with his mother and two youngest siblings shortly before his parents' acrimonious divorce in 1979.

5|$|Doug Wickenheiser was {{selected}} by Montreal with the first pick at the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. The decision was highly controversial as the fans in Montreal had hoped the team would take francophone star Denis Savard.

He {{was traded to the}} Blues midway through the 1983–84 season.|$|E

The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies.

5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood {{was quick to}} exploit the {{possibilities}} of deadly disease, mass infection and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, sleeps in unhallowed ground contaminated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Death, which he brings with him wherever he goes. Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E
