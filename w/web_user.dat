This could enable Google to determine a user's route through the Internet by tracking the IP address being used through successive sites (cross-domain web tracking). Linked to other information made available through Google APIs, which are widely used, Google {{might be able to}} provide a quite complete <b>web</b> <b>user</b> profile linked to an IP address or user. This kind of data is invaluable for marketing agencies, and for Google itself to increase the efficiency of its own marketing and advertising activities.|$|E

2500|$|This attack, {{discovered}} in mid-2016, exploits {{weaknesses in the}} Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD) to expose the URL that a <b>web</b> <b>user</b> is attempting to reach via a TLS-enabled web link. [...] Disclosure of a URL can violate a user's privacy, {{not only because of}} the web site accessed, but also because URLs are sometimes used to authenticate users. Document sharing services, such as those offered by Google and Dropbox, also work by sending a user a security token that's included in the URL. An attacker who obtains such URLs may be able to gain full access to a victim's account or data.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to identify opinion of <b>web</b> <b>users</b> from an opinionated text and to classify <b>web</b> <b>user’s</b> opinion into positive or negative. <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> document their opinion at opinionated sites, shopping sites, personal pages etc., to express and share their opinion with other <b>web</b> <b>users.</b> The opinion expressed by <b>web</b> <b>users</b> may be on diverse topics such as politics, sports, products, movies etc. These opinions will be very useful to others such as leaders of political parties, selection committees of various sports, business analysts and other stakeholders of products, directors and producers of movies {{as well as to}} the other concerned <b>web</b> <b>users.</b> Today <b>web</b> <b>users</b> express their opinion using opinion elements such as opinion phrases, emoticons, short words etc. These form of opinion expressions are very popular and are used by a large number of <b>web</b> <b>users</b> to document their opinion. In this paper we use semantic based approach to find users opinion from opinionated phrases and emoticons. Our approach detects opinionated phrases and emoticons and uses them to obtain semantic orientation scores. These scores are later used to identify users opinion from opinionated texts. Our approach is effective and provides better results on different data sets...|$|R
40|$|The World Wide Web (Web) {{has become}} a key {{technology}} {{to provide access to}} on-line information. The Mobile <b>Web</b> <b>users,</b> who access the Web using small devices such as mobile phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), make errors on entering text and controlling cursors. These errors are caused by both the characteristics of a device and the environment in which it is used, and are called situational impairments. Disabled <b>Web</b> <b>users,</b> on the other hand, have difficulties in accessing the Web due to their impairments in visual, hearing or motor abilities. We assert that errors experienced by the Mobile <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> share similarity in scope with those hindering motor-impaired <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> with dexterity issues, and existing solutions from the motor-impaired users domain can be migrated to the Mobile Web domain to address the common errors. Results of a systematic literature survey have revealed 12 error types that affect both the Mobile <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> and disabled <b>Web</b> <b>users.</b> These errors range from unable to locate a key to unable to pin-point a cursor. User experiments have confirmed that the Mobile <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> and motor-impaired <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> share errors in scope: they both miss key presses, press additional keys, unintentionally press a key more than once or press a key too long. In addition, both small device users and motor-impaired desktop users have difficulties in performing clicking, multiple clicking and drag selecting. Furthermore, when small device users are moving, both the scope and the magnitude of the errors are shared. In order to address these errors, we have migrated existing solutions from the disabled <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> domain into the Mobile <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> domain. We have developed a typing error correction system for the Mobile <b>Web</b> <b>users.</b> Results of the user evaluation have indicated that the proposed system can significantly reduce the error rates of the Mobile <b>Web</b> <b>users.</b> This work has an important contribution to both the Web accessibility field and the Mobile Web field. By leveraging research from the Web accessibility field into the Mobile Web field, we have linked two disjoint domains together. We have migrated solutions from one domain to another, and thus have improved the usability and accessibility of the Mobile Web. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

2500|$|Web 1.0 is a retronym {{referring}} to {{the first stage of}} the World Wide Web's evolution. According to Cormode, G. and, Krishnamurthy, B. (2008): [...] "content creators were few in Web 1.0 with the vast majority of users simply acting as consumers of content." [...] Personal web pages were common, consisting mainly of static pages hosted on ISP-run web servers, or on free web hosting services such as GeoCities. With the advent of Web 2.0, it was more common for the average <b>web</b> <b>user</b> to have social networking profiles on sites such as Myspace and Facebook, as well as personal blogs on one of the new low-cost web hosting services or a dedicated blog host like Blogger or LiveJournal. The content for both was generated dynamically from stored content, allowing for readers to comment directly on pages {{in a way that was}} not previously common.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, lack of {{software}} support of diacritics caused an unofficial style of orthography, often called translits, to emerge {{for use in}} situations when the user is unable to access Latvian diacritic marks (e-mail, newsgroups, <b>web</b> <b>user</b> forums, chat, SMS etc.). It uses the basic Modern Latin alphabet only, and letters that are not used in standard orthography are usually omitted. In this style, diacritics are replaced by digraphs– a doubled letter indicates a long vowel (as in Finnish and Estonian); a following j indicates palatalisation of consonants, i.e., a cedilla; and the postalveolars Š, Č and Ž are written with h replacing the háček, as in English. Sometimes the second letter, the one used instead of a diacritic, is changed {{to one of two}} other diacritic letters (e.g. š is written as ss or sj, not sh), and since many people may find it difficult to use these unusual methods, they write without any indication of missing diacritic marks, or they use digraphing only if the diacritic mark in question would make a semantic difference. Sometimes an apostrophe is used before or after the character that would properly need to be diacriticised. [...] Also, digraph diacritics are often used and sometimes even mixed with diacritical letters of standard orthography. Although today there is software support available, diacritic-less writing is still sometimes used for financial and social reasons. As š and ž are part of the Windows-1252 coding, it is possible to input those two letters using a numerical keypad.|$|E

Due to the natural ageing process, this group are subject to a decline in their visual, motor and cognitive abilities. These age-related impairments form the major barriers that adversely affect both Web accessibility and Web usability for the disabled community. As a result, the effect has been to exclude the older <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> from fully benefiting from the e-commerce revolution. This paper investigates the extent to which e-Commerce websites, in Scotland, comply with a subset of WAI guidelines which are considered to be relevant to the accessibility issues for older <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> who have a visual and/or motor disability. An exploratory review, using the websites of 4 major companies in each of the 3 e-Commerce sectors (Banking, Retail and Supermarket), was conducted to evaluate the accessibility of the websites from the perspective of an older customer. In addition, older <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> evaluated the usability of these e-Commerce websites. The results indicate that whilst some companies have taken steps to ensure that their websites are accessible to older <b>Web</b> <b>users,</b> the majority of websites reviewed failed to address most of the crucial accessibility issues that prevent the inclusion of older <b>Web</b> <b>users</b> into the e-Commerce revolution.
