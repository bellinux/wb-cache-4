25|$|Today, the Senate sent {{a strong}} {{signal to the}} terrorists that we will {{continue}} using every element of national power to pursue our enemies and to prevent attacks on America. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 will allow the continuation of a CIA program that {{has been one of}} America's most potent tools in fighting the War on Terror. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats against our country. Information <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> from the program has helped save lives at home and abroad. By authorizing the creation of military commissions, the Act will also allow us to prosecute suspected terrorists for war crimes.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{considered}} a free spirit {{to be the}} embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Prior to Nietzsche's time, he claimed, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt. Our present modesty compels us to recognize man's derivation from animals, not divinities. Also, we know that man is not superior to other animals. By reducing man to a mere machine, devoid of free will, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> much about his physiology. Will is now {{known to be a}} necessary reaction to a stimulus. Consciousness and spirit derive from instinct.|$|E

In a 2010 letter to The New York Post, he asserted that his draft bore {{little resemblance to the}} final script; the result, he said, was embarrassing: [...] "The only time I saw the movie was at the premiere, which was one too many times." [...] In Better Living Through Bad Movies, Scott Clevenger and Sheri Zollinger wrote, [...] "So what new truths have we gleaned from Battlefield Earth?

Perhaps this induction will inspire fans who themselves started new lives outside the borough to reconsider their thoughts about Walter O’Malley", said John Mooney, curator of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. [...] "He privately built one of baseball's more beautiful ballparks, Dodger Stadium, and set attendance records annually. While New York is the home of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame, it seeks to honor inductees whose impact was and is national." ...|$|E
500|$|The American sitcom All in the Family has {{provided}} much influence for the comedy in The Simpsons, as John Alberti {{writes in his}} book Leaving Springfield: the Simpsons {{and the possibility of}} oppositional culture. He wrote that the series influence on The Simpsons is [...] "acknowledged quite openly in the program itself," [...] and used a scene in [...] "Make Room for Lisa" [...] as an example. The scene shows Homer, Bart and Lisa visiting the Smithsonian Exhibition, where a jacket worn by Fonzie, a character from another 70's series, Happy Days, receives more attention from visitors than the Bill of Rights. It does however catch the attention of Homer, who picks it up and reads it while sitting in a wing chair owned by Archie Bunker, a character from All in the Family. Homer is accosted by two security guards, who assault him using, according to Alberti, [...] "the kind of language <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> to accept from the erstwhile occupant of that chair [...]" [...] Homer and the two guards have the following exchange: ...|$|E
500|$|Problems arose during Tilley's {{administration}} {{because of}} conflicting Samoan and American laws. In one case, a native had caught and eaten a skipjack, a sacred fish which {{could only be}} eaten {{with the permission of}} a local chief under Samoan law. Traditional punishment decreed that the offender's house should be burned down and his crops uprooted, and he should be exiled from the territory. The native challenged his punishment under the American legal system, however, resulting in the arrest of the chief responsible for ordering the destruction of his property. The chief was sentenced to a year of house arrest in a criminal proceeding, on which Tilley sat as judge, and he was ordered to pay compensation for the destroyed property. There were similar issues with Samoan customs not blending well with the newly introduced American political divisions in the territory. For example, the territory's three district governors had equal authority but they were of differing Samoan social status. This disparity made decision-making more difficult and caused social tensions. Despite these problems, Tilley was well-considered by the locals. On December 18, 1900, the local chiefs sent a letter of congratulations on the re-election of President McKinley in which they said of Tilley, [...] "you gave us a leader, a Governor, a High Chief, whom <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> to love and respect".|$|E

500|$|In North America, the Series (particularly {{the first}} few games) exposed the need for better {{preparation}} and off-season training. Philadelphia Flyers coach Fred Shero became an avid student of the Soviet style {{and was one of}} the first to bring the Soviet training techniques to the NHL as the Flyers won two Stanley Cup championships in 1974 and 1975. Tom Mellor (who joined the small but rapidly growing group of American-born NHL players after the 1972 Olympics) lamented that the NHL training methods of the early 1970s were vastly inferior to those of the Soviets. [...] "When I went to play for Detroit after the Olympics, Alex Delvecchio was the coach.... When he would coach, we would do a couple of one-on-ones, two-on-twos, three-on-twos, we'd scrimmage, and he would scrimmage with us. At the end of the scrimmage, we'd do a couple of figure eights and then go to the bar. That was the NHL and pro mentality." [...] Mark Howe commented that the Soviet national team must have trained six hours on the day of a game in the 1972 Winter Olympics. On the other hand, Swedish sports journalists were extremely impressed by the toughness and [...] "never say die" [...] fighting spirit of the Canadians, who lost only one game out of seven on European ice despite usually trailing in the third period. According to Soviet player Boris Mikhailov, who later became a coach, [...] "it was a meeting between two schools of hockey and we have since continued this great exchange and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> from each other, taking the best of both styles." ...|$|E

What was there new, or modern, or imaginative, or efficient, or economical in trying to give modern Washington the character of Imperial Rome?
