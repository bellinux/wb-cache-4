Neil Graf was tasked with coloring, Julian Narino was the background designer, and Adam Muto drew the props. Graf and Narino later got jobs with other series and studios—King of the Hill and Laika studio, respectively—but Muto continued working with Ward and eventually became Adventure Times co-executive producer and showrunner. The finished short ran for seven minutes, and production <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} split {{screening}} came to Nalluri after visiting a pub {{one night after}} filming <b>wrapped</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses split screen, as he was not yet aware of the show. The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane's past activities were snippets of real-life news from the United States, which were edited together. The music was composed by Jennie Muskett, who spent just {{two to three hours}} putting several pieces of background music together. One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan. Some publicity shots of Keeley Hawes in the series were shots of her with long brunette hair, though in fact she has short blonde hair.|$|E

25|$|The {{early history}} of the Côte de Nuits is <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the greater Cote d'Or. The Romans {{were the first to}} {{introduce}} viticulture into the area during their settlement of Gaul sometime during the 3rd century AD. Breaking away from the typical Roman style of planting near rivers, the Romans encouraged their allies in the area, the Aedui to plant vines on the narrow strip of land that was located to the east of their settlement at Augustodunum. It was this area, known asPagus Arebrignus, that was to eventually be subdivided into the Côte de Nuits and Côte de Beaune. When the area was under attack from the Alamans and other Germanic tribes, the Romans sought the help of a Baltic tribe known as the Burgundians who would eventually settle into the area and give the region its name.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{conclusion}} led Heidegger {{to depart from}} the phenomenology of his teacher Husserl and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of Ontology, a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between phenomena and noumena or between things in themselves (de re) and things as they appear (see qualia): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the openness {{to the process of}} Daseins becoming was to bridge the age-old gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in Rationalism, Empiricism, and methodological naturalism, his repudiation of the idea that facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a nominalist), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, a priori conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Heinrich von Kleist, Weltanschauung, and social constructionism), and his instrumentalist and negativist notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also process philosophy, dynamism, Instrumentalism, Pragmatism, and Vitalism).|$|E

500|$|It {{is likely}} that Murasaki enjoyed writing in solitude. She {{believed}} she did not fit well with the general atmosphere of the court, writing of herself: [...] "I am <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study of ancient stories... living {{all the time in}} a poetical world of my own scarcely realizing the existence of other people.... But when they get to know me, they find to their extreme surprise that I am kind and gentle". Inge says that she was too outspoken to make friends at court, and Mulhern thinks Murasaki's court life was comparatively quiet compared to other court poets. Mulhern speculates that her remarks about Izumi were not so much directed at Izumi's poetry but at her behavior, lack of morality and her court liaisons, of which Murasaki disapproved.|$|E

Screenwriter and director Kevin Smith praised the [...] "seat-of-your-pants" [...] season finale, writing that it managed to [...] "thread the needle with the Lilly Kane murder so well, it never feels marginalized or played out over 22 episodes". Smith compared the year-long murder mystery to that of Twin Peaks, stating that [...] "unlike Peaks, when the murderer is revealed and the storyline <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final , it doesn't feel like the show's outlived its relevance; thanks to the crisp writing, the deft fleshing-out of the Mars universe and the endearing cast, you’re left wanting Veronica's story to continue." ...|$|E
500|$|The climax {{has been}} praised for {{bringing}} unexpected inclusions within the war, {{as well as}} revelations regarding the characters' roles. A common comment among writers was that Gundam SEED blended elements from previous Gundam series and displayed it in fast-paced way, making it enjoyable to younger fans but still engaging older fans familiar with previous series. DVD Verdict writer Mitchell Hattaway further noted that while it used elements from other anime series, it still [...] "drew [...] in so quickly [...] soon found [...] <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proceedings".

2500|$|Alabama state {{highways}} {{that serve}} the city include State Route 13, State Route 17, State Route 20, State Route 133, and State Route 157.

Unfortunately, the experience might not have been all that Greg {{and the rest of the}} band might have hoped. Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude.

I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything."

2500|$|In its digital {{magazine}} Dabiq, ISIL explicitly claimed religious {{justification for}} enslaving Yazidi women. According to The Wall Street Journal, ISIL appeals to apocalyptic beliefs and claims [...] "justification by a Hadith that they interpret as portraying {{the revival of}} slavery as a precursor {{to the end of}} the world". ISIL appeals to the hadith and Quran when claiming the right to enslave and rape captive non-Muslim women. According to Dabiq, [...] "enslaving the families of the kuffar and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia's that if one were to deny or mock, he would be denying or mocking the verses of the Quran and the narration of the Prophet ... and thereby apostatizing from Islam." [...] Captured Yazidi women and children are divided among the fighters who captured them, with one fifth taken as a tax. ISIL has received widespread criticism from Muslim scholars and others in the Muslim world for using part of the Quran to derive a ruling in isolation, rather than considering the entire Quran and hadith. According to Mona Siddiqui, ISIL's [...] "narrative may well be <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> familiar language of jihad and 'fighting in the cause of Allah', but it amounts to little more than destruction of anything and anyone who doesn't agree with them"; she describes ISIL as reflecting a [...] "lethal mix of violence and sexual power" [...] and a [...] "deeply flawed view of manhood".

2500|$|The Nican mopohua {{which has}} been {{described}} as [...] "A Jewel of Nahuatl literature, whose beauty and depth of thought make it worthy of renown the world over" [...] relies on the beauty of the dialogues between the Holy Virgin and Juan Diego to express the most tender feelings to be found in world literature. [...] Her promise to grant the wishes of the locals who beseech her is prominent, as is her demand for a temple on the very spot. The Nican Mopohua section by Valeriano of Lasso de la Vega's account is related in a poetic style, typical of the most elegant formal classical Nahuatl in its full beauty. [...] The other parts are clearly different and with greater Spanish influence. The Nican Mopohua is unique for presenting a blending between the deepest Nahuatl thought with the Christian message. [...] Scholar Richard Nebel insists that the Nican Mopohua is not necessarily a historical account, but a document designed to convert the Nahua and [...] "bring about a state of harmony between different peoples, cultures, and religions, in order that, during a period of radical change, new possibilities of coexistence could be envisaged". It is precisely on this point that an abysmal difference exists with other Dialogues which invoke elements of the dramatic writings (called autos), many of which were used for the purposes of proselytization during the Spanish colonization of Mexico. [...] The autos reflect only Spanish Christian thinking, while the main characteristic of the Nican Mopohua is the exceptional blending of the best of two cultures. [...] Leon-Portilla suggests, [...] "That there is in [...] an exposition of key ideas in Christian thinking, <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> language and form conceived from the world of the Nahua. It is without a doubt that this narrative seeks to demonstrate who God and the Virgin Mary are and that their relations are of kindness and protection for human beings."

2500|$|Eclipse {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Anne Rouyer of School Library Journal {{gave the}} novel a positive review and said that, [...] "Meyer knows what her fans want: thrills, chills, {{and a lot}} of romance, and she delivers on all counts." [...] Rouyer also thought that as in the two previous installments, [...] "it is Meyer's effective and intense portrayal of first love in all its urgency, passion, and confusion that drives the story along with the supernatural elements coming in a close second", and said that the [...] "injection of heightened sexual tension and sensuality that hasn't been present in the series before" [...] contributed well to the emotional atmosphere of the novel. However, she found that the werewolves' and vampires' histories slowed the book's pace and called the newborn army's story a [...] "convoluted add-in", while noting that they [...] "contribute in some way to Bella's epiphanies about her future." [...] Katie Trattner of Blogcritics praised the characters and their development throughout the novel, particularly the histories of Rosalie and Jasper—contradicting Rouyer—stating, [...] "The history that formed them and their reactions towards Bella become clear and the characters much more solid because of this knowledge. I think {{that is part of the}} appeal of these books—the fact that you do become so <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> characters, that they touch places deep inside yourself." [...] She commended Meyer for painting a good emotional image, as well as Bella's emotional growth, and went on to say that she [...] "writes so fluidly and propels the reader forward so effortlessly." [...] Selby Gibson-Boyce of Tulsa World wrote, [...] "I read without stopping until I finished. Meyer's book would not detach itself from my hand. Exactly the same thing happened with Twilight and New Moon." [...] Publishers Weekly wrote, [...] "The legions of readers who are hooked on the romantic struggles of Bella and the vampire Edward will ecstatically devour this third installment of the story", while noting that, [...] "it's unlikely to win over any newcomers." [...] Kirkus Reviews concluded its review stating that the book's [...] "unsettling racially charged characterizations are offset by messages of overcoming difference and working together. Fans of Bella's angst-drenched love triangle will gobble this entry up, and the open-ended conclusion paves the way for Jake's story to come." ...|$|E
