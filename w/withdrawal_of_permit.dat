40|$|Thesis,The aim of {{this study}} was to explore {{language}} censorship in Zimbabwean films in Shona and English. The study concentrated on the themes of politics, culture and economic in the genre of the documentary, feature and short film genres. It was demonstrated that the Zimbabwean laws enabled authorities to impose censorship strategies that ranged from banning, restriction, persecution <b>of</b> filmmakers, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> films from circulation, and threats <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>permits</b> <b>of</b> film retailers. These visible, direct and banal forms of censorship have forced some filmmakers to flee the country. Most of the filmmakers who have remained in the country have been forced to deal with themes that appear harmless to the state. This state induced form of self-censorship on the filmmakers has resulted in the production of uncritical, and unreflective films whose staple diet were embedded in cultural stereotypes. The study argued that language is a signifying practice that cannot be interpreted in a single direction. Thus, despite these realities of film censorship some filmmakers deliberately encoded or used verbal and visual film language that generated surplus meanings with which the films could be re-read in ways that reveal new linguistic strategies to evade and challenge both the restrictive censorship laws as well as criticise the undemocratic political culture that has taken root in Zimbabwe. The study used eclectic theories such as Marxism, audience-reception approach, critical legal theories and language theories to analyse the films.

40|$|Participatory {{community}} mapping {{has been}} one of the tools promoted by Non-Government Organizations in Indonesia to increase public participation in decision-making and local control over resources. It has been taken up by communities seeking to restore customary (adat) authority over the local domain following the demise of the authoritarian Suharto regime, and to respond to the growing pressures and opportunities of globalisation. This study analyses the role of participatory community mapping in the process of reasserting local control over land use in Bali, and the challenges that alternative development strategies face in their engagement with wider political and economic structures. In one community, local customary rights were effectively exercised over a site whose adat status was contested by the state and they also succeeded in forcing a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> project <b>permits</b> over privately held land. Another village refused their own private rights to sell land on the open market, except under seriously restrictive collectively determined conditions.

As [...] "La Borinqueña", Puerto Rico's national song, was being played, the demonstrators began to march. They were then fired upon for over 15minutes by the police from their four positions. About 235 people were wounded and nineteen were killed. Among the dead were 17 unarmed civilians and two police officers {{at the hands of}} the Insular Police for a total of 19 dead, in addition 235 civilians were wounded, including women and children. Ultimately, responsibility for the massacre fell on Governor Winship, and he is considered to have, in effect, ordered the massacre. Many were chased by the police and shot or clubbed at the entrance of their houses as they tried to escape. Others were taken from their hiding places and killed. Leopold Tormes, a member of the Puerto Rico legislature, told reporters how a policeman murdered a nationalist with his bare hands. Dr. José N. Gándara, one of the physicians who assisted the wounded, testified that wounded people running away were shot, and that many were again wounded by the clubs and bare fists of the police. No arms were found in the hands of the civilians wounded, nor on the dead ones. About 150 of the demonstrators were arrested immediately afterward; they were later released on bail. The incident is known as the Ponce Massacre.|$|R

40|$|An earlier {{communication}} {{reported the}} antipyretic and acute toxic effects of acetanilid in rats (11). The present experiments were done on rats given repeated doses of acetanilid by stomach tube and include studies of growth, food consumption, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and determinations of hemoglobin, eryth-rocytes, leucocytes including differential counts, reticulocytes, and tests for methemoglobin and sulihemoglobin. Properly con-trolled, growth {{is often a}} delicate indication of the well-being of animals, its abnormality often preceding other symptoms. Several investigators have studied the effects of repeated doses of acetanilid on experimental animals.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} have shown {{an effect of}} nCPAP-therapy in lowering bloodpressure in patients with OSA and hypertension. Various reasons lead to interruption of nCPAP-therapy in everyday conditions. Until today the effects on bloodpressure and heartrate variability <b>of</b> such <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was unclear. In a study on 18 patients with OSA and hypertension, treated over several months to years with nCPAP-therapy, we investigated {{the influence of a}} 7 to 10 days <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy on bloodpressure and heartrate. We investigated data of 12 patients. As a methode of measuring bloodpressure and heartrate variability we used ambulatory- 24 h-bloodpressure-monitoring (ABDM). Effects <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was documented by repeated polysomnography. We focused on comparing the mean bloodpressure in 24 hours before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy and after restarting nCPAP-therapy. We seperately compared bloodpressure during the day and at night. Patients were used as their own controls, so we could compare the results before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy caused an immediate onset of sleeapnoea. Ceasing of therapy produced a significant rise in systolic 24 -h-bloodpressure of 4 mmHg and a significant rise in diastolic 24 -h-pressure of 2 respective 3 mmHg. The rise in bloodpressure was considerered as clinically not relevant. The variability of bloodpressure {{can be used as a}} hint for the close association of OSA and regulation of bloodpressure. Change of heartrate was only significant during the day on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy but frequency was always below 100 /min [...] Therefore the risk for patients through extensive rising in heartrate is considered low. These results led us to the assumption that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy of 7 to 10 days in patients with OSA and arterial hypertension causes a certain rise in bloodpressure which probably is not clinically relevant. This means that the risk of a cardiovascular event caused by a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy is low...|$|R
40|$|Background - The process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment}} in Critical Care environments has created ethical and moral dilemmas {{in relation to}} {{end of life care}} in the UK and elsewhere. Common within this discourse is the differing demands made on health professionals as they strive to provide care for the dying patient and family members. Despite reports that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment is a source of tension between those nurses and doctors involved in the process, the role of the nurse in facilitating <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment has received relatively little attention. Objectives – To illustrate how differing dying trajectories impact on decision-making underpinning <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment processes, and what nurses do to shape <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. Design - Qualitative methods of enquiry using clinical vignettes and applying Charmaz’s grounded theory method. Methods and settings - Single audio-recorded qualitative interviews with thirteen critical care nurses from four Intensive Care specialities: Cardiac; General; Neurological and Renal were carried out. Interviews were facilitated by an end-of-life vignette developed with clinical collaborators. Findings – Across critical care areas four key dying trajectories were identified. These trajectories were shaped by contested boundaries associated with delayed or stalled decision-making around how <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should proceed. Nurses provided end of life care (including collaborative and action-oriented skills) to shape the dying trajectory of patients so as to satisfy the wishes of the patient and family, and their own professional aims. Conclusions - Differing views as to when <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should commence and how it should be operationalised appeared to be underpinned by the requirements of the role that health professionals fulfil, with doctors focusing on making <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment decisions, and nurse’s being tasked with operationalising the processes that constitute it. Multidisciplinary teams need a ‘shared’ understanding of each other’s roles, responsibilities, aims, and motivations when planning and implementing the dying trajectory <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. <br/...|$|R
