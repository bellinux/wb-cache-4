5|$|The castle is now {{entered through}} the 13th-century {{southern}} gatehouse, which faces towards the former deer park. This entrance was once {{protected by a}} 14th-century fortified bridge, also called a barbican, but only one set of stone arches remain, showing two surviving arrow slits in arched recesses. The south gatehouse has two drum towers {{on either side of}} a gateway, protected by a portcullis, and would have had three floors, linked to a <b>wall</b> <b>walk</b> around the castle. It would originally have been faced with dressed stonework, which has since been removed. The north gatehouse on the opposite site of the bailey originally led into the town of Launceston. The first floor of the building was probably first used as the porter's room, then by the castle's constable, and finally later as a prison.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{during the}} {{troubles}} of the Barons' War a small tower was added {{in front of the}} gateway to make a proper gatehouse complete with portcullis. The portcullis mechanism mounted on the <b>wall</b> <b>walk</b> was reached via a flight of steps up {{over the back of the}} gate passageway, which also allowed access to the wall walks.|$|E
500|$|The Glassin Tower is a {{round tower}} {{that was built}} into the {{south-east}} corner of the ancient curtain wall, probably around 1550. The derivation of 'Glassin' is unknown. The purpose of the tower was to provide additional accommodation and to give the castle a more imposing appearance. Gunholes that allowed fire to be directed along the external face of the curtain wall improved defence. The tower has a vaulted basement for storing water, accessed separately from the courtyard. The basement has separate channels to allow water to be collected from the loch and waste water to be drained through a slop-drain. The lower chamber has an oriel window which would have given views over the loch. The upper chamber served as a bedchamber. At the very top a small room, accessible only from the <b>wall</b> <b>walk,</b> was possibly a study or library.|$|E

5000|$|The {{walls of}} Dún Aonghasa have been rebuilt to {{a height of}} 6m and have <b>wall</b> <b>walks,</b> chambers, and flights of stairs. The {{restoration}} is easily distinguished from the original construction {{by the use of}} mortar.|$|R
50|$|Sir Roger Vaughan's son and heir, Sir Thomas Vaughan, {{continued}} {{to develop the}} Court further during {{the last quarter of}} the 15th Century with the addition of the battlemented <b>wall,</b> <b>wall</b> <b>walks</b> and gatehouse http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/574237, thus enclosing the courtyard.|$|R
500|$|The {{resulting}} {{circuit of}} walls followed {{the line of}} the former Roman and Anglo-Saxon defences, incorporating them where they survived in good condition. Parts of the 14th century walls, for example along Burgate Lane, have been shown to [...] thick at the base and built of Kentish ragstone; other sections incorporated the original Roman wall, which was still up to [...] high in places. The new walls had a continuous <b>wall</b> <b>walk</b> and were crenellated. Most of the circuit was protected by an external ditch. The city walls retained the older system of Roman and Anglo-Saxon gates. West Gate was rebuilt around 1380 by the prominent mason, Henry Yevele, an unusually prominent architect for a city wall programme. As part of this work, Holy Cross Church was moved from over the gate to a nearby site. The old Roman Riding Gate was cut through by a new archway.|$|E
500|$|The keep {{occupies}} the southern corner of Peveril Castle. Construction probably began in around 1176, instigated by HenryII. Its plan is square, measuring less than , and the parapet is [...] above the keep's base; {{as the ground}} is uneven, {{on the other side}} it rises [...] above ground level. It is smaller than contemporary royal keeps such as those at Dover and Scarborough Castles. Today the exterior is coarse, but originally the facing would have been smooth; the south-east side, where the steep natural slope prevented removal of the facing stone, gives an idea of how it may once have appeared. A projection in the south-east face of the keep housed a garderobe. As was usual with Norman keeps, Peveril's was entered through the first floor and was accessed by a staircase. This entrance level would have been a large public room and the basement used for storage. A narrow staircase in the east corner allowed access to the basement and the <b>wall</b> <b>walk</b> around the top of the keep.|$|E
2500|$|The wall {{measures}} [...] {{in diameter}} and is up to [...] thick. It still stands to its full height with a <b>wall</b> <b>walk</b> [...] above the ground, and the battlemented parapet is also reasonably intact. The wall is surrounded in turn by a ditch measuring [...] by [...] deep. Both {{the wall and the}} internal buildings were constructed from slate which appears to have been quarried from the scarp face north-east of the castle.|$|E
50|$|Between 2006 and 2008 the bastion {{was subject}} to major {{restoration}} work {{as part of the}} Government of Gibraltar's city <b>walls</b> <b>walk</b> scheme As part of the restoration works, two Victorian RML guns from the nearby King's Bastion were relocated here.|$|R
50|$|The enceinte may be {{laid out}} as a {{freestanding}} structure or combined with buildings adjoining the outer walls. The enceinte not only provided passive protection for the areas behind it, but was usually {{an important component of}} the defence with its <b>wall</b> <b>walks</b> (often surmounted by battlements), embrasures and covered firing positions.|$|R

50|$|The {{fortress}} {{church is}} typically surrounded by defensive walls equipped with wall towers and <b>wall</b> <b>walks.</b> It is a {{development of the}} fortified churches, whose defensive walls were also the actual walls of the church. However, the terms are often used interchangeably and there is often no clear distinction. However, generally a fortified church is a single building, whereas a fortress church is a building complex.|$|R

50|$|The hill castle {{is first}} {{recorded}} in 1217 as castrum in Munjoje by Archbishop Engelbert I of Cologne. It was expanded {{in the middle}} of the 14th century into a fortress for the counts of Jülich and equipped with mighty ring <b>walls</b> and <b>wall</b> <b>walks.</b> In 1543 troops of Emperor Charles V besieged the site with heavy guns, captured it and plundered it together with the town of Monschau.|$|R
50|$|The {{curtain walls}} have a sloping batter (the wall slopes down to be thicker {{at the base}} than along the top) for extra defence, and would have {{included}} a <b>wall</b> <b>walk</b> {{all the way around}} the inner edge. Support holes in the curtain wall, just below the level of the <b>wall</b> <b>walk,</b> were to support a timber hourding, or fighting gallery, which projected out from the wall and protected the defenders atop the wall. Each corner tower was built with a solid circular basement, presumably accessed by a wooden ladder from the upper levels. The towers would have been entered on the first floor via a wooden staircase from the outside. There were no windows, just arrowslits, suggesting that the towers were purely for defence, not residence.|$|E

50|$|This {{garden was}} {{designed}} to showcase nearly 70 varieties of peonies and is enclosed on three sides with concrete walls. The north wall has a cantilevered <b>Wall</b> <b>Walk</b> intended to permit visitors an aerial view of the garden. Due to age and deterioration of the wall, the walkway was closed by the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The castle {{comprises}} a main tower 9.8 by 7.6 m, and a later stair tower, {{built on}} to the north east. The main tower is around 10m high to the eaves. Above this are crow-step gables, with corbelled <b>wall</b> <b>walks</b> along the gable ends. Three of the corners have round turrets. The stair tower is topped by a gabled caphouse. A sink at first floor level once drained via a carved gargoyle on the west side.|$|R
50|$|Windsor Hills Historic District is a {{national}} historic district in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is a cohesive residential suburb defined by rolling topography, winding, picturesque streets, stone garden <b>walls,</b> <b>walks</b> and private alley ways, early-20th century garden apartments, duplexes, and freestanding residences. Structures are predominantly of frame construction with locally quarried stone foundations. Windsor Hills developed over a period from about 1895 through 1929. The dominant styles include Shingle cottages, Dutch Colonial Revival houses, Foursquares, and Craftsman Bungalows.|$|R
60|$|As {{the last}} word had left Reist's lips Ughtred of Tyrnaus in all the bravery of his {{brilliant}} uniform passed through the great room. Marie, who had been watching for him, shrank back at his near approach in something like awe.

The unwonted excitement had given fire to his features, seemed indeed to have added inches to his great stature. No wonder that the people who saw him come raised their voices in a great shout of welcome.|$|R
50|$|During the {{classical}} era, societies became sophisticated {{enough to create}} tall ramparts of stone or brick, provided with a platform or <b>wall</b> <b>walk</b> for the defenders to hurl missiles from and a parapet {{to protect them from}} the missiles thrown by attackers. Well known examples of classical stone ramparts include Hadrian's Wall and the Walls of Constantinople.|$|E

50|$|In 1982, {{the front}} of the {{decaying}} “Shingho Doroja” (“Main Door” in the Bengali language) - that is, the gateway and entrance to Salam Manzil - appeared to have inscriptions or patterns on the <b>wall.</b> <b>Walking</b> through the gate, one would find a spacious compound containing a lot of greenery. A very long verandah with a crumbling roof, supported by a twin-pillar system, overlooked the compound. Opening onto the verandah were dilapidated chambers, which used to function as offices in the past, when the mansion was in a working state. In the past, one or more end-rooms of the verandah had housed palkis (palanquins). One particular palki was enormous and twelve bearers were required to carry it.|$|R
50|$|The castle had {{a sturdy}} enceinte, which {{enclosed}} the entire site and guaranteed protection for its occupants. The roughly 2-metre-thick and probably over ten-metre-high shield wall with its wooden <b>wall</b> <b>walk</b> and tiled roof was {{integrated into the}} early mediaeval enceinte. The buildings in the castle courtyard were made of stone and wood. From the then treeless summit, the Aschaff valley could be overlooked.|$|E
50|$|In 1984 the Museum of London {{set up a}} <b>Wall</b> <b>Walk</b> {{from the}} Tower of London to the museum, using 23 tiled panels. A number of these have been {{destroyed}} in subsequent years. At Noble Street, the panels were replaced by etched glass panels. These were intended as a prototype for new panels along the entire walk, but no further replacements have been made.|$|E
50|$|In {{general the}} Zwinger walls were {{markedly}} lower and less thick {{that the actual}} ring walls. Often only a parapet wall was erected around the intended killing ground of the Zwinger. Occasionally a covered or open <b>wall</b> <b>walk</b> {{was built on the}} inside of the wall, as at Trausnitz Castle in Landshut. Even underground wall walks with embrasures for hand guns may be seen, for example, at Hochhaus Castle near Nördlingen.|$|E
5000|$|The Boston Manor {{estate is}} thought to date back to at least 1163 and {{had a series of}} {{influential}} owners. At one time, {{it was part of the}} estate of royal financier Thomas Gresham, who also owned neighbouring Osterley Park. The house that survives in the centre of the park dates from 1623. Just under a century later, the grounds were described as comprising: [...] "gardens, <b>walls,</b> <b>walks,</b> courts, 5 fish ponds [...] [...] [...] Plantation and nursery computed to be 3 acres [...] [...] [...] Whole being well wooded and watered." [...] In 1670, the estate was sold for just over £5,000 to the Clitherow family, and it remained in their ownership for the succeeding 250 years.|$|R
