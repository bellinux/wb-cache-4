25|$|Knee {{osteotomy}} {{is commonly}} used to realign arthritic damage {{on one side of}} the knee. The goal is to shift the patient's body <b>weight</b> <b>off</b> the damaged area to the other side of the knee, where the cartilage is still healthy. Surgeons remove a wedge of the tibia from underneath the healthy side of the knee, which allows the tibia and femur to bend away from the damaged cartilage.|$|E

Some scholars interpret the Alexamenos graffito, the earliest surviving depiction of the Crucifixion, as including such a foot-rest. Ancient sources also mention the sedile, a small seat {{attached to the}} front of the cross, about halfway down, which could have served a similar purpose.|$|E

5000|$|Drop {{sets and}} the {{technique}} also {{go by the}} names breakdowns, descending sets, triple-drops (when {{a total of three}} different weights are used), down the rack or running the rack (when using dumbbells), up the stack (because with a weight machine, the pin is moved up the stack of plates with each drop in weight), strip sets (when you [...] "strip" [...] <b>weights</b> <b>off</b> the ends of a bar), or the stripping technique (so called because of [...] "stripping" [...] <b>weight</b> plates <b>off</b> with each drop in weight). Drop sets where originally called The Atkin's Multiple Poundage System after Henry Atkin who discovered this system in the 1940s and written about in his 1949 article The Atkin's Multiple Poundage System by Henry J. Atkin, which {{can be found on the}} [...] "The Tight Tan Slacks of Dezso Ban" [...] blog, and was originally meant to be used with barbells.|$|R
25|$|In a half-seat position, the rider's seat {{bones are}} lifted {{out of the}} saddle, and only the pelvis has contact. It is used for jumping when some seat aid may be necessary, {{especially}} for sharp turns, when riding downhills, on the approach to potentially spooky fences, or when the rider wishes to collect the stride. This seat is a compromise, allowing the jumping rider to have greater control than in two-point, but still keeping {{the majority of the}} rider's <b>weight</b> <b>off</b> the horse's back.|$|E
25|$|Reverse: The exact {{opposite}} of regular. The board is bent upwards starting at the middle, so that when laid flat the nose and tail are significantly off the ground. This design is ideal for park and freestyle as it allows a much smoother 360-degree rotation on both snow and rails. When standing on the board it is flexed down at the contact points by your weight, but can easily be lifted by shifting your <b>weight</b> <b>off</b> either foot. Sims first released this design in 1985, however, it was popularized recently by companies such as Lib-Tech and K2 Snowboarding.|$|E
25|$|Road {{bicycles}} for racing {{tend to have}} a steeper {{seat tube}} angle, measured from the horizontal plane. This positions the rider aerodynamically and arguably in a stronger stroking position. The trade-off is comfort. Touring and comfort bicycles tend to have more slack seat tube angle traditionally. This positions the rider more on the sit bones and takes <b>weight</b> <b>off</b> the wrists, arms and neck, and, for men, improves circulation to the urinary and reproductive areas. With a slacker angle, designers lengthen the chainstay so that the center of gravity (that would otherwise be farther to the back over the wheel) is more ideally repositioned over the middle of the bike frame. The longer wheelbase contributes to effective shock absorption. In modern mass-manufactured touring and comfort bikes, the seat-tube angle is negligibly slacker, perhaps in order to reduce manufacturing costs by avoiding the need to reset welding jigs in automated processes, and thus do not provide the comfort of traditionally made or custom-made frames which do have noticeably slacker seat-tube angles.|$|E

25|$|Néry {{is set in}} a north-south {{oriented}} valley {{around a}} small river, which feeds into the River Autonne to the north; it is overlooked from the east and west by high bluffs. The main landmark was a sugar factory, just south of the village, where L Battery were billeted; the cavalry regiments were stationed in and around the village proper. Dawn on 1 September came with heavy fog lying in the valley; the force had been awakened and prepared for a move at 4.30 am, but due to the terrible visibility it was decided to wait {{an hour and a half}} for the mist to clear, and the men stood down to rest, water the horses, and prepare breakfast. The teams for the artillery were left harnessed to their guns, but with the limbers lowered to take the <b>weight</b> <b>off</b> the horses. At 5.25 am, a patrol from the 11th Hussars, which had been sent out to the south-east, encountered a strong force of enemy cavalry and escaped back to the village; the regiment quickly took up dismounted defensive positions along the eastern edge of the village, though the commander of the 5th Dragoon Guards refused to believe an attack was imminent.|$|E
500|$|The pelvic fins {{are small}} and have blunt outer corners. The {{moderately}} thick tail measures 93–102% {{as long as the}} disc and lacks lateral skin folds and dorsal fins. One or two serrated stinging spines are present atop the tail, just ahead of the halfway point. The slender caudal fin originates a short distance behind the sting; it is symmetrical above and below, and terminates in a rounded leaf-like shape. The skin is densely covered by fine dermal denticles, that become sparse to absent on the pelvic fins, towards the ventral disc margin, and around the mouth. The deepwater stingray is purplish brown to blackish above; some rays also have irregular darker blotches and spots. The underside is white, with a narrow dark border along the lateral disc margins. The tail is entirely dark, and the caudal fin is black.

The aim {{of this research is}} to investigate the morphology of flat sheet membrane that uses silica from sugarcane bagasse as an additive. Six flat sheet membranes were then fabricated by varying the dope formulation. Membrane surface and cross-section area were analyse by scanning electron microscope (SEM).

To replace Albert, NBC tapped studio host Bob Costas for play-by-play. Matt Guokas did not return to his post as main color commentator, and was replaced by NBA legend Isiah Thomas; Costas was replaced on the pre-game show by Hannah Storm. Midway through the season, Costas and Thomas were joined by recently fired Detroit Pistons coach Doug Collins.

Woods made par on the first sudden-death hole; Mediate subsequently missed his par putt, giving Woods his 14th major championship. After the tournament, Mediate said [...] "This guy does things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination," [...] and Kenny Perry added, [...] "He beat everybody on one leg."

According to Carolyn Williams, Brian refused to see Landy: [...] "They told him that the only way that he could be a Beach Boy again, and the only way they would release his 1982 tour disbursement money, was if he would agree to see Dr. Landy.
