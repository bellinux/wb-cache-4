5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and Blue Team, {{were ordered}} to begin their {{simultaneous}} assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down {{the rear of the}} building, while another four-man team lowered a stun grenade through the skylight. The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the staff sergeant leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> The noise of the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.|$|E

5|$|When Ibn al-Ashtar {{returned}} to his position, he dismounted and the Umayyads advanced. In command of the Umayyad right wing was al-Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni, {{in command of the}} left wing was Umayr ibn al-Hubab, while Shurahbil ibn Dhi'l Kala' al-Himyari led the cavalry. Ubayd Allah marched along <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> soldiers. As the battle lines became closer, al-Sakuni's right wing assaulted al-Jushami's left wing. Al-Jushami fell, followed by his son Qurrah and their guards. Consequently, Ibn al-Ashtar's left wing was driven back, but under Abdallah ibn Warqa' al-Saluli they collected themselves and joined Ibn al-Ashtar's right wing. Afterward, Ibn al-Ashtar directed the right wing under al-Azdi to assault the Umayyads' left wing in the hope that Umayr ibn al-Hubab would hold true to his promise and fall back as agreed. However, Umayr held his ground and fierce fighting ensued.|$|E

Two days later, the Scottish general, Alexander Leslie, Lord Leven, joined the Fairfaxes and prepared to invest that city.|$|E

Forsberg recorded five points over four games as Sweden finished without a medal at fifth place. Several months later, competing in the 1998 World Championships, Sweden won a gold medal. Forsberg had recorded 11 points over seven games.|$|E
25|$|On chain timpani, {{the tension}} rods are {{connected}} by a roller chain {{much like the one}} found on a bicycle, though some manufacturers have used other materials, including steel cable. In these systems, all the tension screws can then be tightened or loosened by one handle. Though far less common than pedal timpani, chain and cable drums still have practical uses. Occasionally, a timpanist is forced to place a drum behind other items, so he cannot reach it <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> Professionals may also use exceptionally large or small chain and cable drums for special low or high notes.|$|E

He also made a posthumous appearance on ITV's Police Camera Action! special Crash Test Racers in 2000; {{this was one of}} many interviews to be aired posthumously. Hunt also competed in an exhibition race to mark the opening of the new Nürburgring in May 1984. Despite having no licence to ride a motorcycle, he accepted, instead of his usual fee, the then-new 1980 electric start Triumph Bonneville he had contracted to advertise on behalf of the struggling Triumph motorcycle workers' co-operative. With journalistic mirth, he turned up at the press launch <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> in plaster.|$|E

25|$|Sages, {{gods and}} other beings {{appeared}} to praise Shiva, who blessed Markandeya {{to remain a}} youth of 16 for seven kalpas (aeons). As no one remained {{in the world to}} make beings die, the earth became burdened by evil beings. The earth, the gods, and Markandeya invoked Shiva to revive Yama. Once again, Shiva touched Yama <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> bringing him back to life. A sequel from Thiruvanmiyur to this tale narrates how Shiva resurrected Yama on the request of the gods and Yama worshiped Shiva at Thiruvanmiyur to atone for his sin. The Thirukkadavoor and Thiruvanmiyur shrine legends narrate how Yama promises never to touch Shiva's devotees. Shiva's devotees on death are directly taken to Mount Kailash, Shiva's abode, on death and not to Yama's hell.|$|E

Lady Carmichael is thrilled to think that Poirot has visited to investigate some special crime but the detective tells her he is simply there to tame four wild horses. He visits General Grant whose house is filled with artifacts from India. The General himself completes the clichéd picture, sitting in an armchair <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> bandaged up from gout, drinking port and railing against the world. Poirot breaks the news of the drugs and listens to the old man's cries of anger and sworn threats against whoever is getting his girls into trouble.

25|$|In Game 1, Gibson {{completely}} {{shut down}} the Detroit lineup, striking out 17 batters, still a World Series record, en route to an easy 4–0 win. However, due {{in no small part}} to pitcher Mickey Lolich's victories in Games 2 and 5, the Tigers climbed back into the Series. Many fans believe the turning point in the Series came in the fifth inning of Game 5, with the Tigers down three games to one, and trailing in the game, 3–2. Left fielder Willie Horton made a perfect throw to home plate to nail Lou Brock (who tried to score from second base standing up), as catcher Bill Freehan blocked the plate <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> The Tigers came back with three runs in the seventh to win that game, 5–3, and stay alive in the Series. The Cardinals would not threaten to score the rest of this game, and scored only two more meaningless runs over the remainder of the series. In Game 6, McLain ensured a Game 7 by notching his only win of the Series, a 13–1 blowout, despite pitching on only two days' rest.|$|E

The Sabres eventually lost the series four games to two, with the decisive sixth game being one of the longest Stanley Cup playoff games in NHL history.
