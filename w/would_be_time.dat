5|$|As {{attendance}} at ISMB {{grew in the}} late 1990s, several satellite meetings and special interest group (SIG) meetings formed alongside the main conference. SIG meetings are held over {{one or two days}} before the main conference and focus on a specific topic, allowing more detailed discussion than there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> for in the main conference. Notable SIG meetings include the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC), which has been held annually since 2000 and Bio-Ontologies, which has been held annually since 1998. Satellite meetings are usually two days long and are held in conjunction with ISMB. The 12th CAMDA conference and the 9th 3DSIG meeting were held as satellite meetings of ISMB/ECCB 2013.|$|E
25|$|The TDC {{enables the}} {{submarine}} {{to launch the}} torpedo on a course {{different from that of}} the submarine, which is important tactically. Otherwise the submarine would need to be pointed at the projected intercept point in order to launch a torpedo. Requiring the entire vessel to be pointed in order to launch a torpedo <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> consuming, require precise submarine course control, and would needlessly complicate the torpedo firing process. The TDC with target tracking gives the submarine the ability to maneuver independently of the required target intercept course for the torpedo.|$|E
25|$|On 29 April, American {{ambassador}} to the Dominican Republic William Tapley Bennett, who had previously sent numerous reports to President Lyndon Johnson, reported that the situation had reached life-threatening proportions for U.S. citizens and that the rebels received foreign support. Bennett stressed that the United States must act immediately as {{the creation of an}} international coalition <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> consuming. Contrary to the suggestions of his advisers, Johnson authorised the transformation of evacuation operations into a large scale military intervention through Operation Power Pack, aiming to prevent the development of what he saw as a second Cuban Revolution.|$|E

25|$|At Bishop Auckland, {{where two}} of his {{children}} were born, Frankland confined himself to his parochial duties. After the Restoration {{he was one of}} the first to be attacked for nonconformity. His living was in the bishop's gift, but John Cosin (consecrated 2 December 1660) did not interfere with a peaceable man. An attorney named Bowster demanded of him, ‘publickly before the congregation,’ whether he intended to conform. Frankland thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> to answer this question when the terms of conformity had been settled; and meanwhile relied on the king's declaration (25 October 1660) dispensing with conformity. Bowster, with a neighbouring clergyman, got possession of the keys and locked Frankland out of his church. He indicted them for riot, but the case was dismissed at the assizes for a technical flaw in the indictment. Cosin now offered to institute Frankland and give him higher preferment if he would receive episcopal ordination. He even proposed, but without result, to ordain him conditionally, and ‘so privately that the people might not know of it.’ By the act of 1661 Frankland was confirmed in the possession of his living; but the uniformity act of the following year ejected him.|$|E
500|$|The Act {{was drafted}} by Haldane, {{in the winter of}} 1906, with the {{assistance}} of John Kemp and Frederick Liddell and the support of Douglas Haig. A final draft was sent to the King on 12 January and all that remained was to ensure its passage through the House of Commons. He was confident of the support of the Prime Minister, and privately discussed the bill with Arthur Balfour, the Leader of the Opposition, in order to ensure there would not be significant Conservative Party opposition. At the time, the governing Liberal Party was mostly absorbed with problems of social reform, and it was not guaranteed that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> to present a defence bill. At the beginning of the year, however, Haldane discovered that a bill scheduled for the session was not yet ready, and offered [...] "a small Bill of his own which might conveniently fill the gap".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, Ishihara stated that Gold and Silver started development right after Pokémon Red and Green were released in Japan. The original intention was to release the game in 1998, even synchronizing with the supposed end of the anime's [...] Development issues, worsened by Game Freak being sidetracked with Pokémon Stadium and the localization of the first generation, led the game to be postponed, and the original release slate {{was taken over by}} Pokémon Yellow. Programmer Shigeki Morimoto stated that part of why development took {{three and a half years}} was due to being a small team of only four programmers, [...] "We were very greedy in terms of all the features we wanted to include in the games". Ishihara declared that Gold and Silver were supposed to be the last in the series – [...] "I didn’t intend to make any more Pokémon titles. I even thought that once we entered the twenty-first century, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> for me to do something else entirely" [...] – and most of the licensed merchandising, including the Pokémon Trading Card Game, were to [...] "ensure Gold and Silver were successful".|$|E

2500|$|In August 2009, Roubini {{predicted}} that the global economy would begin recovering {{near the end of}} 2009, but the U.S. economy is likely to grow only about one percent annually during the next two years, which is less than the three percent normal [...] "trend." [...] He noted that the Fed is [...] "now embarked on a policy in which they are in effect directly monetizing about half of the budget deficit," [...] but that now [...] "monetization is not inflationary," [...] as banks were holding much of the money themselves and not relending it. When these attitudes reverse {{at the end of the}} recession, that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> for an [...] "exit strategy, of mopping up that liquidity" [...] and taking some of the money back out of circulation, [...] "so it doesn’t just bid up house prices and stock values in a new bubble. And that will be 'very, very tricky indeed,'" [...] he stated.|$|E
2500|$|Himilco {{chose not}} to set up base at Messene, which would have given him control over the strait and a harbor that could house his entire fleet, and also {{put him in a}} {{position}} to hinder naval traffic between Italy and Sicily. Himilco probably was not confident about holding the city this far away from Carthage. [...] Furthermore, majority of the Greeks of Messana were holed up in the hill fortresses nearby, and reducing them required time, which in turn would enable Dionysius to strengthen himself for the coming battle. The ultimate Carthaginian goal was the defeat of Syracuse, Messana was just a sideshow. Bringing reinforcements from Carthage <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> consuming as Carthage had no standing army and would need time to raise fresh mercenaries, while dividing the field army to guard Messana would decrease his striking power against Dionysius. Himilco on the other hand could not entirely ignore the hostile Greek fortresses in his rear, as they might cause problems once he left the site. His solution was simple and ingenious at the same time, something that is termed indirect approach.|$|E

2500|$|Regardless of Hood's {{personal}} motivations, his {{specific objective}} {{was to try to}} crush Schofield before he and his troops could escape to Nashville. [...] He was concerned that if he attempted to turn Schofield by crossing the Harpeth and getting between him and Nashville, the maneuver <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> consuming and the open terrain of the area would reveal his movements prematurely, causing Schofield to simply withdraw again. The Confederates began moving forward at 4:00p.m., with Cheatham's corps on the left of the assault and Stewart's on the right. Bate's division, on the left, was delayed in reaching its starting point as it marched around Winstead Hill, a movement that delayed the start of the entire army. Hood divided Forrest's cavalry—Chalmer's division on the far left, beyond Bate, and Buford and Jackson with Forrest, covering Stewart and facing the fords on the Harpeth. Lee's corps, and almost all of the army's artillery, had not yet arrived from Columbia. Hood's attacking force, about 19–20,000 men, was arguably understrength for the mission he assigned—traversing two miles (3km) of open ground with only two batteries of artillery support and then assaulting prepared fortifications.|$|E
2500|$|At the November 2010 FOMC meeting, Warsh was {{extremely}} {{skeptical of the}} Fed's plan to generate economic activity and jobs by trying to lower long-term interest rates. Although unemployment was close to 10%, Warsh told his colleagues that he would only vote for QE2 {{out of respect for}} Chairman Bernanke: [...] "If I were in your chair, I would not be leading the Committee in this direction, and frankly, if I were in the chair of most people around this room, I would dissent." [...] Even if unemployment were [...] "unacceptably high," [...] he suggested that he would vote against the program continuing if inflation inched up a bit: [...] "if inflation were to move up and were to be broadly consistent with the implicit inflation target [...] in different people's minds around this room, even if unemployment were unacceptably high, I think that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>time</b> to stop this program. If inflation expectations were {{to move out of the}} range that they have been in for a long time, that would be a reason to end this program, even if unemployment were exceptionally high and GDP were well below what we think the economy is ultimately capable of." [...] The Federal Reserve has a legal dual mandate to pursue maximum employment as well as to ensure price stability.|$|E
