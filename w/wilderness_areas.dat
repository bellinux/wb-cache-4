5|$|Wilderness is {{generally}} defined as {{areas that have}} not been significantly modified by human activity. <b>Wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, , national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. <b>Wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Some nature writers believe <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> are vital for the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> to {{be an integral part of}} the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere). They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite National Park {{is located}} in the central Sierra Nevada of California. Three <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> are {{adjacent}} to Yosemite: the Ansel Adams Wilderness to the southeast, the Hoover Wilderness to the northeast, and the Emigrant Wilderness to the north.|$|E
5|$|Senator Hatfield {{retired in}} 1996 {{after more than}} 46 years of {{political}} service, having won all eleven political campaigns he entered. During his tenure he gained {{billions of dollars in}} the form of federal appropriations for projects in Oregon. This included funding for transportation projects, environmental protection of <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> and scenic rivers, research facilities, and health care facilities.|$|E

5|$|Culturally the Antankarana {{have many}} {{similarities}} with the neighboring Sakalava. They practice tromba (ancestral spirit possession) {{and believe in}} nature spirits. They adhere {{to a wide range}} of fady (ancestral taboos), particularly including several that serve to protect wildlife and <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas.</b> The traditional economy of the Antankarana revolved around fishing and livestock, although more recently they have adopted farming; many are salary earners working in civil administration, teaching, trade and other areas.|$|E
5|$|The Wilderness Act {{enhanced}} the protection status of remote or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage {{of the act}} ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness-designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or mining, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment and bicycles. The ways people may enter <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> are on foot or on horseback.|$|E
5|$|By 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt {{more than}} doubled the forest reserve acreage, and Congress responded by {{limiting}} the President’s ability to proclaim new reserves. The National Forest System underwent a major reorganization in 1908, and in 1911 Congress authorized new additions to the system {{under the authority of}} the Weeks Act. The management goals provided by the Organic Act were expanded upon by the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 to include “outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes” {{as well as for the}} establishment of <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E
50|$|Garden Mountain Wilderness is a U.S. <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> in the Eastern Divide Ranger District of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. It {{is a small}} <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> {{in western}} Virginia, {{consisting}} of an area of 3,331 acres and bordering the Beartown and Hunting Camp Creek Wilderness. It was designated as <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> in 2009 by Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. The <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> also borders {{a portion of the}} Appalachian Trail.|$|R

5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> of the United States and {{protected}} some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest is a National Forest {{that covers}} 2,110,408 acres (854,052 ha) in the U.S. states of Idaho (~96 percent) and Utah (~4 percent). Managed by the U.S. Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it was {{originally}} named the Sawtooth Forest Reserve in a proclamation issued by President Theodore Roosevelt on May 29, 1905. On August 22, 1972 {{a portion of the}} forest was designated as the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA), which includes the Sawtooth, White Clouds, and Hemingway–Boulders <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas.</b> The forest is managed as four units: the SNRA and the Fairfield, Ketchum, and Minidoka Ranger Districts.|$|E
5|$|The Wilderness Act of 1964 {{enhanced}} the protection status of remote and/or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage {{of the act}} ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or extraction, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment, including even bicycles. The only manner in which people can enter <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> is either on foot or horseback. Hunting and fishing are permitted in the wilderness, {{just as they are}} throughout the forest, provided those engaging in such activities have the proper licenses and permits.|$|E
50|$|The Spanish Peaks <b>Wilderness</b> <b>area</b> of 17,855 acres (72.3 km2) {{encompasses}} the summits of both Spanish peaks. Hiking is {{popular in the}} <b>wilderness</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Rio Chama is a Wild and Scenic River and is {{not part}} of the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area.</b> A Forest Service road {{parallels}} the river and in some places the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> is only 100 yards from the road. The easy road access means that rafting is a popular activity when water levels are adequate. The Continental Divide Trail traverses the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> and crosses the river on Scull Bridge. Hiking and horseback riding are other popular activities in the <b>wilderness</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, {{the mining}} {{industry}} in Svalbard {{has had more}} rights to operations within protected areas than in mainland Norway, where all such activities would be completely banned. Indre Wijdefjorden has the most strict regulations, with a total ban on construction of buildings and facilities, laying of cables and roads, earthwork, drainage, drilling, blasting, and excavation of petroleum, gas and minerals. It is the authorities' goal that Svalbard is {{to be one of}} the best-managed <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> in the world. Svalbard, and thus the national park, is on Norway's tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone National Park is the {{centerpiece}} of the 20million acre/31,250square-mile (8,093,712ha/80,937km2) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes Grand Teton National Park, adjacent National Forests and expansive <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the continental United States, considered the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone. With the successful wolf reintroduction program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the area can still be found there.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientist}} with a PhD in plant physiology, Marshall became independently wealthy {{after the death}} of his father in 1929. He had started his outdoor career in 1925 as forester with the U.S. Forest Service. He used his financial independence for expeditions to Alaska and other <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas.</b> Later he held two significant public appointed posts: chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the Forest Service, from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During this period, he directed the promulgation of regulations to preserve large areas of roadless land that were under federal management. Many years after his death, some of those areas were permanently protected from development, exploitation, and mechanization with the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964.|$|E

5|$|NY373 exists entirely {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of Adirondack Park, a protected area maintained by the State of New York. Adirondack Park was created in the 1880s after concerns arose about logging trees in the area. The logging was a substantial part of New York's economy, but protests were lodged by The New York Times and others against the clearing of entire mountains and <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> of trees. Public opinion turned firmly against the loggers by the 1880s, and the park was created in 1885. It was the first State Forest Preserve in America. The park was further protected in 1894 when a clause was added to the New York State constitution which banned the selling of timber from state parks.|$|E
5|$|Numerous fady protect <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas,</b> {{particularly}} {{including the}} Ankarana massif. Excessive cutting of mangrove trees for wood or {{the setting of}} bush fires are both prohibited, as {{is the use of}} nets with holes less than 15 millimeters to prevent catching immature fish. Certain species are protected through fady that forbid hunting them, including sharks, rays and crocodiles. Many fady also exist to regulate relations between the sexes. For instance, it is taboo for a girl to wash her own brother's clothing. Conservative communities adhere to a fady against medical injections, surgery or modern medicines due to their association with their historic enemies the Merina, who were the first to use them widely; instead, tromba ceremonies and traditional herbal remedies are commonly used for healing. These taboos are most strongly applied in the center of Antankarana territory around the village of Ambatoharaña and less so in the villages at the periphery of the region.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2015 {{wilderness}} designations, the White Cloud and Boulder mountains {{were part}} of the largest unprotected roadless area in the United States outside of Alaska. In the absence of Congressional action that would designate the Boulder-White Clouds region as wilderness, the area had been studied for possible protection as a national monument by presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act. Former Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne initially studied the area for national monument status, but did not recommend it because Congressional action seemed likely. The 2015 bill passed after receiving increased attention when President Obama indicated he would designate a national monument in the area if the wilderness bill did not pass. Additionally, other large areas of the forest are parts of proposed <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas,</b> such as through the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act. These other proposals have gained no support among Idaho's congressional delegation because the bills could place undue public use and development restrictions on Idaho's public lands.|$|E

50|$|The Mount Evans Wilderness is a U.S. <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Area</b> in Arapaho National Forest and Pike National Forest about 30 mi west of Denver, Colorado. The <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> {{is named}} after Mount Evans.|$|R
5|$|Shoshone National Forest has {{virtually}} all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger first visited the region. The forest {{is home to the}} Grizzly bear, cougar, moose, tens of thousands of elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas</b> within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E
5|$|State Route 190 (SR 190) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California that is split into two parts by the Sierra Nevada. The western portion begins at Tipton at a {{junction}} with State Route 99 and heads east towards Porterville before ending at Quaking Aspen in the Sequoia National Forest. The eastern portion begins at US 395 at Olancha, heads east through Death Valley National Park, and ends at State Route 127 at Death Valley Junction. The 43.0-mile (69.2km) portion over the Sierra Nevada remains unconstructed, and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) {{has no plans to}} build it through the <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas.</b> SR 190 is a National Scenic Byway known as the Death Valley Scenic Byway.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} jobs that horses do very well, and no {{technology}} has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for {{certain types of}} patrol duties and crowd control. Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance. Horses {{can also be used}} in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in <b>wilderness</b> <b>areas.</b> Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.|$|E
50|$|Flat Tops <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Area</b> is {{the third}} largest U.S. <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Area</b> in Colorado. It is 235214 acre, with 38870 acre in Routt National Forest and 196344 acre in White River National Forest. It was {{designated}} a <b>wilderness</b> <b>area</b> in 1975. Trappers Lake, located {{in the north of}} the area, was the lake that inspired Arthur Carhart, a United States Forest Service official, to plead for wilderness preservation.|$|R
