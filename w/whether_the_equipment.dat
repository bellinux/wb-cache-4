Spot scanning availability depends on the machine and the institution.

The resolution of 960H depends on <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> is PAL or NTSC based: 960H represents 960 x 576 (PAL) or 960 x 480 (NTSC) pixels. 960H represents an increase in pixels of some 30% over standard D1 resolution, which is 720 x 576 pixels (PAL), or 720 x 480 pixels (NTSC). The increased resolution over D1 comes {{as a result of}} a longer horizontal scan. The difference is that whilst D1 has a 4:3 aspect ratio 960H has a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio. The extra pixels are used to form the increased area to the sides of the D1 image. The pixel density of 960H is identical to standard D1 resolution so it does not give any improvement in image quality, merely a wider aspect ratio.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a productive asset, called equipment or capital good, and {{we examine the}} properties of, {{as well as the}} interactions between, the operating policies, which are determined by its optimal utilization and maintenance, and the capital policy of scrapping, which defines the optimal time when the productive asset is retired from its current use. Starting with an abstract model and using the approach of optimal control, initially we characterize the various types of equipment by assigning to them a single total profit index, which indicates how the above policies affect the flow of operating revenues plus capital gains or losses. This index is a function of market-determined prices. So using it we then investigate how the operating and capital policies are influenced by the rate of discount, the price of new equipment, and the rise or fall of the price of new equipment relative to the value of its output. Among other interesting results, we find that the effects of these prices on the nature and interactions of optimal policies depend crucially on <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> is of the usual profit making type, where output is the main source of revenue, or of the antique type, where the main source of revenue is capital gains.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of support of the integrated rescue system with assigned Army detachments. The theoretical part summarizes the transformation of the Ministry of Defence which had a major impact on the extent of the assistance provided. All rescue battalions were canceled and three engineer battalions and two separate rescue companies were created. Two rescue battalions were transformed into light motorized battalions and forwarded to the subordination of the Fourth and Seventh Mechanized Brigade. Organizational components of the ACR allocate a number of specialized teams for support intervening IRS. These include teams for ground and aerial radiation survey and decontamination detachments of people and technology, as well as some others, such as rescue detachment, detachment of transport humanitarian aid, a subunit of the earthwork, a subunit of the blasting and demolition, and more. Conditions requiring deployment of detachment vary according to the type of the assistance requested. They are primarily intended deployment Permanent Standby Force as planned assistance on request. This is the detachments in the central alarm plan and in accordance with the Act on the IRS ACR is required to provide such assistance. In providing assistance in dealing with radiological emergencies, ACR is equipped with a large number of devices, equipment and technologies. These are mainly radiometers, personal and group dosimeters. In the decontamination means is a habitat for decontamination of people and habitat for decontamination techniques LINE- 82 nd. The purpose of this thesis was to analyze <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>equipment</b> ACR is still up-to-date with the times and that will be sufficient in comparison with similar Fire Rescue equipment. In the event of a radiation emergency is important to minimize the harmful effects of ionizing radiation on the population and the affected people. The lower limit of measurement was elected as the main comparing of the parameters measuring devices. In the case of decontamination of the equipment, attention was focused on the capacity of decontaminated people and technology. Carried out research revealed that earmarked detachments are equipped with measuring devices of varying ages and abilities. Some devices have been created {{at the time of the}} risk of nuclear war. This corresponds to their durable construction and a relatively high threshold, which is insufficient for the conditions solving a radiation accident in peaceful state. In addition, some of these instruments provide information and the measured value in the old, disused units, which can cause transmission of misleading information. Other devices are, however, modern, ergonomic, highly sensitive at low dose rate values, providing real-time information on the clear LCD display. Unique capabilities of the ACR give the possibility of performing aerial radiation survey, which greatly helps to keep the overview and assessment of future developments spread of radioactivity in the environment. The equipment ACR is quite outdated in the area of decontamination technology. Again, it originated at the time of the risk of nuclear war. The priority was a simple construction and operation, the ability of decontamination of large numbers of affected persons and equipment. However, there was practically no environmental solutions, separate showers for men and women and water consumption. On the other hand, the number of decontamination equipment of ACR virtually doubles the capacity of the firefighters equipment, which in terms of large accidental release of radioactive substances and decontaminated large number of people and technology is a distinct advantage. Overall, the Army units are able to qualitatively and quantitatively support the affecting IRS components and thus contribute significantly to dealing with radiological emergencies of any kind...|$|E

30|$|To {{the extent}} possible, {{systematic}} variance in additional determinants of innovative output {{that do not}} result from the staffing pattern should therefore be controlled for. In particular, other determinants of firms’ innovative output that are also related to the staffing strategies and/or the growth and dominance regimes could cause—if they are not considered—an omitted variable bias. As additional determinants of firm-level innovative productivity, we therefore account for the following set of observable controls (Wagner 2008; Criscuolo et al. 2010): First, large firms {{are more likely to}} introduce or generate a new product than smaller firms, but if smaller firms do, the turnover share realized through innovations is higher than for their larger counterparts (Strotmann and Mathes 2005, p. 11). Firm size is accounted for by the average number of employees expressed in full-time equivalents for the respective establishment and year.
