Later, when asked by Fox News, Sestak insisted he had not decided whether he would run for the office, but declined to immediately endorse Specter and said he had to [...] "wait and see".

The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: [...] "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in?
