5|$|When Stone lectured in {{the dress}} {{in the fall}} of 1851, hers was the first Bloomer most of her audiences had ever seen. But by then, the dress had become controversial. Although {{newspapers}} had initially praised the practicality of the new style, they soon turned to ridicule and condemnation, now viewing the trousers as a usurpation of the symbol of male authority. Many women retreated in the face of criticism, but Stone continued to wear the short dress exclusively for the next three years. She also <b>wore</b> <b>her</b> hair short, cut just below her jaw line. After Stone lectured in New York City in April, 1853, the report of her speeches in the Illustrated News was accompanied by this engraving of Stone in the Bloomer dress.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, Russell {{was signed}} to a seven-year {{contract}} by film mogul Howard Hughes, {{and made her}} motion-picture debut in The Outlaw (1943), a story about Billy the Kid that {{went to great lengths}} to showcase her voluptuous figure. The movie was completed in 1941, but it was not released until 1943 in a limited release. Problems occurred with the censorship of the production code over the way her ample cleavage was displayed. When the movie was finally passed, it had a general release in 1946. During that time, she was kept busy doing publicity and became known nationally. Contrary to countless incorrect reports in the media since the release of The Outlaw, Russell did not wear the specially designed underwire bra that Howard Hughes had designed and made for her to wear during filming. According to Jane's 1985 autobiography, she said that the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it and <b>wore</b> <b>her</b> own bra with the cups padded with tissue and the straps pulled up to elevate her breasts.|$|E
