5|$|A poll {{released}} by Angus Reid on January 7, found that 53% of respondents <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the prorogation, while 19% supported it. 38% believed Harper used the prorogation {{to curtail the}} Afghan detainee inquiry, while 23% agreed with Harper's explanation that the prorogation was necessary economically.|$|E
5|$|Activist groups {{interpreted}} {{his comments}} as warnings to President George W. Bush {{about the implications}} of nominating Supreme Court justices who <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the Roe v. Wade decision. Specter maintained that his comments were a prediction, not a warning. He met with many conservative Republican senators, and based on assurances he gave them, he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee's chairmanship in late 2004. He officially assumed that position when the 109th Congress convened on January 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{eventually}} {{broke with}} Most and aligned {{himself with the}} autonomists. The autonomists, an anarchist group associated with Josef Peukert, emphasized individual freedom. They feared the domination of the anarchist movement by a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> Most. Soon, Berkman {{was working for the}} autonomists' publications, Der Anarchist and Die Autonomie, but he remained committed to the concept of violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.|$|E

Dragging Canoe <b>was</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> selling the lands along the Holston and Watauga and Nolichucky rivers of East Tennessee.

5|$|Citizens in {{the south}} <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> a {{centralised}} government, and to the decrees of its rule, which resulted in rebellion. Prior to the revolution France had been divided into provinces with local governments. In 1790 the government, the National Constituent Assembly, reorganised France into administrative departments in order to rebalance the uneven distribution of French wealth, which had been subject to feudalism under the monarchical Ancien RÃ©gime.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the promise}} of the design, many {{operational}} officers <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the use of volatile hydrogen peroxide aboard ship. Ultimately, the Mark 16 went into limited production while work on the Mark 17 was suspended in 1941, but resumed in 1944. Admiral Ernest King favored focusing research efforts on electric torpedoes so work on the oxygen system was downgraded. As such, the U.S. Navy made no combat use of the oxygen torpedo design during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Halfway {{through the}} year South Katanga was further divided into the provinces of Katanga Oriental and Lualaba (also known as the new South Katanga). Though they <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> such divisions, many Katangese leaders from the secession joined the new provincial governments. A new {{constitutional}} commission was established, and in March 1964 it recommended that the Congo switch from its parliamentary system to a presidential model of government.|$|E

5|$|However, Newcastle and his Lieutenant General, Lord Eythin, <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> any pitched {{battle and}} {{possibly}} offended by Rupert's high-handed attitude. Rather than join Rupert immediately they temporised, claiming {{that it would}} take time to clear the earth and rubble which had been used to block the city gates of York during the siege. Newcastle's soldiers in York then refused to fight unless given their delayed payment, a dispute which Eythin may have fomented. A number were also absent, pillaging the abandoned allied siege works and encampments outside the city, and had yet to return.|$|E
5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Eurypontid King of Sparta Eudamidas III, son of Agis IV, died. Pausanias, the Greek writer, {{claims that}} Cleomenes had him poisoned. In order to {{strengthen}} his position against the ephors, who <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> his expansionist policy, Cleomenes recalled his uncle Archidamus V from his exile in Messene to ascend the Eurypontid throne, {{but as soon}} as Archidamus returned to the city, he was assassinated. Cleomenes' involvement in the plot is unclear, since ancient sources contradict each other: Polybius claims that Cleomenes ordered the murder, but Plutarch disagrees.|$|E

5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> their rule. Their {{aim was to}} rule the universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of Reality and the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E
5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> a wet season Hmong offensive, supporting instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars as a prelude to a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive sputtered out at the end of July.|$|E
5|$|The coup {{ultimately}} failed, as it {{met with}} the resistance {{of most of the}} warriors, who <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the king's assassination. As a result, the Lombard garrison in Ticinum proclaimed Duke Cleph the new king, and Helmichis, rather than going to war against overwhelming odds, escaped to Ravenna with Longinus' assistance, taking with him his wife, his troops, the royal treasure and Alboin's daughter Albsuinda. In Ravenna the two lovers became estranged and killed each other. Subsequently, Longinus sent Albsuinda and the treasure to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Abd al-Rahman {{helped the}} British to retain Sudanese support during the First World War, when they <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the Turkish Empire, despite his being a Muslim leader. He lent his support again during {{a crisis in}} 1924 when there were anti-British riots in Egypt and the British Governor-General of the Sudan was assassinated. Meanwhile, he grew wealthy from cotton production, for which his {{supporters}} provided labor, and influential among the intelligentsia. The British administration distrusted him. When Governor General Sir Geoffrey Archer paid a formal and friendly visit to Abd al-Rahman in March 1926, Archer was dismissed and Abd al-Rahman was placed under travel restriction.|$|E
5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E
5|$|Ashina Zhong, {{the brother}} of She'er, {{also served as a}} Turkic general of the Tang Dynasty, and was a {{participant}} in a military performance hosted by Emperor Gaozong in 655. Another Turkic member of the Ashina clan, Ashina Helu, briefly served as a commander of the Tang army in Gansu before his rise as a kaghan of the Western Turkic Khaganate. During his reign, the Turkic tribes were unified under a single leader. Emperor Gaozong, Taizong's successor, dispatched a military expedition in 657 against Helu, who had been raiding Tang settlements. The campaign was led by the general Su Dingfang and the Turkic commanders Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen, who <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> Helu. Helu was defeated and captured by the Tang forces, and the territories annexed from the Western Turks were placed under Tang governance through the Anxi Protectorate.|$|E

5|$|At Kaufmann's request, Denver artist Allen Tupper True {{was hired}} to handle the design and {{decoration}} of the walls and floors of the new dam. True's design scheme incorporated motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of the region. Although some initially <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist. With {{the assistance of the}} National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics. The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animalsâ lizards, serpents, birdsâ and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas. In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the last}} male {{member of the}} House of ÃrpÃ¡d, Andrew was elected king {{after the death of}} King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a {{coronation}} diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretendersâAlbert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurerâchallenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> his rule.|$|E
5|$|By 1980 the bridge's {{structure}} {{had come}} under attack from marine woodworm, which threatened its closure. British Rail discovered that woodworm had eaten into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated it would cost Â£2.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which immediately resulted {{in the loss of}} traffic from Tywyn, including explosives traffic to and from the factory at Penrhyndeudraeth. That traffic was re-routed via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. However, Gwynedd County Council <b>were</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> closing the bridge completely as 40% of all railway traffic in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a Â£2.5 million grant from the EEC to repair the bridge, with a further Â£4.6m being spent on improving the signalling. The bridge was closed entirely to traffic for six months during the temporary repair works eventually undertaken, and 30 of the piles were replaced.|$|E
