50|$|Carrier current {{transmission}} (originally called <b>wired</b> <b>wireless)</b> employs guided low-power radio signals, {{which are}} transmitted along electrical conductors. The transmissions are {{picked up by}} receivers that are either connected to, or a short distance from, the conductors. Carrier current transmission is used to send audio and telemetry to selected locations, and also for low-power broadcasting that covers a small geographical area, such as a college campus. The {{most common form of}} carrier current uses longwave or mediumwave AM radio signals that are sent through existing electrical wiring, although other conductors can be used, such as telephone lines.|$|E

50|$|Windows Firewall {{was first}} {{introduced}} as part of Windows XP Service Pack 2. Every type of network connection, whether it is <b>wired,</b> <b>wireless,</b> VPN, or even FireWire, has the firewall enabled by default, with some built-in exceptions to allow connections from machines on the local network. It also fixed a problem whereby the firewall policies would not be enabled on a network connection until several seconds after the connection itself was created, thereby creating a window of vulnerability. A number of additions were made to Group Policy, so that Windows system administrators could configure the Windows Firewall product on a company-wide level. XP's Windows Firewall cannot block outbound connections; it is only capable of blocking inbound ones.|$|E
5000|$|Planning for NG9-1-1 {{started in}} 2000 and was {{published}} in NENA's Future Path Plan in 2001. [...] NENA's NG9-1-1 Project began in 2003 and continues to an ultimate goal of establishing national NG9-1-1 architecture and operations standards, and implementation plans to accomplish advanced 9-1-1 systems and services. Public safety communications experts recognized that the nation's current 9-1-1 system was not capable of handling the text, data, images and video that are increasingly common in personal communications. The stated goal of a related USDOT project is: [...] "To enable the general public to make a 9-1-1 “call” (any real-time communication - voice, text, or video) from any <b>wired,</b> <b>wireless,</b> or IP-based device, and allow the emergency services community {{to take advantage of}} advanced call delivery and other functions through new internetworking technologies based on open standards." [...] The project is aimed at supporting establishment of a national architecture for an NG9-1-1 system that would meet these goals, and to create a transition plan for NG9-1-1.|$|E

Erstwhile Knight Ridder promulgated concept of portable magazines, newspaper, and books in 1994."Within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the internet of contents {{that had previously been}} written for print newspapers, radio, or television was no longer sufficient." [...] The rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations (or individuals) to deliver text, audio, and video material over the same <b>wired,</b> <b>wireless,</b> or fiber-optic connections. At the same time, it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information. This digital convergence of news media, in particular, was called [...] "Mediamorphosis" [...] by researcher Roger Fidler http://rji.missouri.edu/staff-and-advisers/roger-fidler.php, in his 1997 book by that name. Today, we are surrounded by a multi-level convergent media world where all modes of communication and information are continually reforming to adapt to the enduring demands of technologies, [...] "changing the way we create, consume, learn and interact with each other".|$|E

Further we turn to practical aspects and demonstrate how to implement mixed <b>wired</b> and <b>wireless</b> access, and finally we point out some realization aspects...|$|R

30|$|In theory, TCP {{works well}} {{regardless}} of the underlying transmission medium, such as <b>wired,</b> <b>wireless,</b> and optical. In practice the standard TCP congestion control mechanism has been optimized for wired networks. However, the major problem in TCP is that it recognizes and handles all packet losses as network congestion, that is buffer overflow. Hence, performing unjustified congestion control when a loss is due to other reasons, such as packet reordering [150], fading and shadowing in wireless networks [130], and wavelength contention in optical networks [214]. As a consequence, TCP unnecessarily reduces its transmission rate at each detected packet loss, lowering the end-to-end throughput.|$|E
