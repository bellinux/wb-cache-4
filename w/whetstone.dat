5|$|The {{following}} January Rogers married Sarah <b>Whetstone,</b> {{daughter of}} Rear Admiral Sir William <b>Whetstone,</b> {{who was a}} neighbour and close family friend. Rogers became a freeman of Bristol because of his marriage into the prominent <b>Whetstone</b> family. In 1706, Captain Rogers died at sea, leaving his ships and business to his son Woodes. Between 1706 {{and the end of}} 1708, Woodes and Sarah Rogers had a son and two daughters.|$|E
5|$|By now, the War of the Spanish Succession {{had broken}} out, and news of its {{declaration}} reached Benbow on 7 July. He detached <b>Whetstone</b> and six ships to search off Port St Louis in Hispaniola for a French squadron under Admiral Jean du Casse, which he believed would {{call at the}} port on his voyage to Cartagena, and from there he might raid English and Dutch shipping. After <b>Whetstone</b> had left, Benbow took his squadron and sailed for Cartagena, anticipating that either he or <b>Whetstone</b> would find Du Casse and bring him to battle.|$|E

5000|$|Naxos or Naxus (Ancient Greek: [...] ) was {{an ancient}} town of Crete, {{according}} to the Scholiast (ad Pind.

The islands Crete and Naxos were famed for their <b>whetstones</b> (Plin. xxxvi. 22; xviii. 28), hence the confusion.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} that <b>Whetstone</b> had reached Hispaniola, Du Casse had already departed. Benbow's force {{subsequently}} sighted the French on 19 August, sailing off Cape Santa Marta. The French had three transports and four warships carrying between 68 and 70 guns, while Benbow commanded seven ships carrying between 50 and 70 guns. The English forces were heavily scattered, and the light winds meant that they were slow to regroup. They did not achieve a form of collective order until four in the afternoon, after which a partial engagement was fought, lasting about two hours, until nightfall caused the fleets to temporarily break off.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Hassinger still {{owned the}} rights to The Electric Prunes's name, and was {{encouraged}} {{by the success of}} Mass in F Minor, which prompted him to assemble a new line-up. He was steered toward the Colorado group, Climax, by Rich Fifield. Fifield had worked in fellow Colorado band, Hardwater (previously the surf rock band The Astronauts), which was managed by Poncher, and produced an album with Axelrod. The new Electric Prunes line-up included Climax members Richard <b>Whetstone</b> (vocals, guitar), John Herron (organ), and Mark Kincaid (guitar) with Brett Wade (bass guitar), who was recommended by The Collectors. With the group restructured, Axelrod, again, composed all the material for their next album, in the same vein as the previous effort, and centered it around the Jewish prayer, Kol Nidre. The album, titled Release of an Oath, utilized several session musicians including Howard Roberts, Carol Kaye, and Earl Palmer, and saw <b>Whetstone</b> as the only band member to contribute to the recordings. Although the album was considered more cohesive and progressive than its predecessor, it failed to chart upon its release in November 1968. Afterwards, Axelrod returned to his past position at Capitol Records, and The Electric Prunes toured as a supporting act for bands such as Steppenwolf, Canned Heat, and New Buffalo Springfield.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{constructed}} between 1935 and 1938, originating at SR 82 in <b>Whetstone</b> and heading south into Sierra Vista. From there, it turned east for a stretch {{and then turned}} south following its current route to Bisbee. At this time, {{the section of the}} route corresponding to the current routing was paved, while the northern section was still a gravel road. The northern section was improved in 1942. Between 1961 and 1963, SR 90 took over the segment of SR 92 north of Sierra Vista, leaving SR 92 to the section south of the city and east to Bisbee. Since then, the routing has not been modified.|$|E

5|$|The {{artefacts}} recovered include {{fragments of}} pottery, charcoal, bone and a <b>whetstone</b> (a stone for sharpening blades). Later, on excavation, spinning whorls and weaving combs were found, suggesting textile production, although {{this may have}} been for domestic use rather than industry. Evidence of bronze-casting and iron-smelting were found. Fine jewellery made from bronze bone have also been found showing a high degree of craftsmanship. Files and hammer heads were examined by metallography which showed that carbon compositions were found to be generally low. In 1905 an early British tin coin was discovered, believed to be from the 1st century A.D, which was sent to the British Museum. Various other objects from the excavation are also help by the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|When {{originally}} constructed, Archway Road {{went through}} countryside with few buildings - though by 1828 the Woodman pub {{at the junction}} with Muswell Hill Road, and the now demolished Wellington pub at the junction with North Hill provided refreshments to travellers; however, {{with the coming of}} the railways in 1867 ribbon development started along the road, including the Camra Heritage listed Winchester Tavern with the distinctive attached parade of shops and house with deep arched eaves built by the Imperial Property Investment Co in 1881. At the northern end of Archway Road, the road re-intersects with the traditional Great North Road route (at this point called North Hill). The roads almost immediately re-diverge, with the Great North Road route heading north as the A1000 towards Finchley, <b>Whetstone</b> and Barnet and the A1 heading west as Aylmer Road.|$|E
5|$|By the 5thcentury, the Romans had {{withdrawn}} from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One {{of the methods}} used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories {{was the use of}} ceremony and insignia. The tomb of an unknown king– evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia– at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy <b>whetstone</b> sceptre, on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the figure of a stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.|$|E

The <b>whetstones</b> found by the 2014 and 2015 teams provide further evidence for craft production and possible subsequent trade at Tønnesminde, as <b>whetstones</b> were another trade item increasingly produced during the Viking Age.|$|R
