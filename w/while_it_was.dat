5|$|Tropical Cyclone Urmil {{originated}} from a weak tropical disturbance over the open {{waters of the}} south Pacific Ocean on January13. Around 1800UTC, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 06F, <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> located about 370km (230mi) west of Pago Pago, American Samoa. Forming {{in the wake of}} Tropical Cyclone Tam, the disturbance rapidly organized within an environment of favorable diffulence aloft, warm waters (29°C; 84.2°F), and moderate wind shear. Six hours later, RSMC Nadi upgraded 06F to a tropical cyclone and gave it the name Urmil <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> situated near Niuatoputapu, Tonga. Shortly after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the storm quickly traveled towards the south-southeast. Around 0600UTC on January14, the JTWC classified Urmil as Tropical Cyclone 07P.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E
