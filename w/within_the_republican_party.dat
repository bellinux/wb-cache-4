5|$|As President of the United States, Rutherford B. Hayes {{had caused}} heated {{tensions}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> Hayes had {{moved away from}} party patronage by offering government jobs to Southern Democrats instead of Northern Republicans. His actions drew heavy criticism from those inside his party, such as Roscoe Conkling of New York and James G. Blaine of Maine. Hayes had known since the dispute over the 1876 election that he was unlikely to win in 1880, and had announced at his 1877 inauguration {{that he would not}} run for a second term. Without an incumbent president in the race, the rival factions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds, eagerly anticipated the 1880 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|A heated {{public debate}} followed, which {{resulted}} in a substantial rift <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions. The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote. Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives. The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.|$|E
5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E

50|$|Chris Lauzen officially {{began his}} {{campaign}} on September 19, 2007. Rudy Clai officially entered the race on October 7, but withdrew {{less than a}} month later, citing dysfunction <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Illinois <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to {{friction}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> caucus, Boehner {{decided to}} step down as speaker and resign his seat in Congress. He scheduled a Republican caucus non-binding vote for speaker on October 8, and a full floor vote on October 29. Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader and second-in-command to the Speaker, was initially viewed as the favorite to win the Speakership. However, due to the opposition of the Freedom Caucus, McCarthy {{dropped out of the}} race on October 8, and the caucus vote was postponed.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{graduated}} from Jefferson College (now Washington & Jefferson College) in 1858 with a bachelor's degree, and studied {{for two years}} at the Western Theological seminary (now Pittsburgh Theological Seminary). In 1861, he was appointed professor of mathematics at Western College (now Leander Clark College), a United Brethren-affiliated college in Shueyville, Iowa, and taught there for one year. The United Brethren, a pietist church that arose first among Pennsylvania Germans during the Great Awakening, {{was one of the}} earliest churches in the United States to embrace abolitionism. By Thompson's time, they had also joined the fight for the prohibition of alcohol, though most did so from <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> and did not join the small single-issue Prohibition Party.|$|E
5|$|Citing {{opposition}} from <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> {{as well as}} fallout from controversial comments he made about the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi, McCarthy {{dropped out of the}} race on October 8. Following McCarthy's departure from the race, Republicans renewed their efforts to recruit Ryan as a candidate. Boehner personally called Ryan twice to ask him to run, and Chaffetz said that he would not run against Ryan if he chose to enter the race. Ryan also received calls from Mitt Romney and Trey Gowdy, among others, encouraging him to run for Speaker. Additional Ryan endorsements came from Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, 2016 Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise from Louisiana. On October 9, close aides of Ryan confirmed that Ryan was reconsidering the possibility of a run.|$|E
50|$|Following the 1964 presidential {{campaign}} in which Lyndon Johnson trounced Goldwater, Hess became disillusioned with traditional politics and became more radical. Hess {{and others on}} the losing team had found themselves outsiders <b>within</b> <b>the</b> national <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> due to their support of the controversial Goldwater. Hess felt he'd been purged by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> and he departed from involvement with grand-scale politics altogether.|$|R

50|$|Gibson {{became a}} leader of the Progressive {{movement}} in Vermont, which ultimately led to creation of a recognized faction <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Vermont <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> <b>the</b> Aiken-Gibson Wing. The Aiken-Gibson Wing was more liberal than the party establishment, which had been led for years by conservative business interests including the Smith family of St. Albans, the Fairbanks family of St. Johnsbury, and the Proctor family of Proctor.|$|R
5|$|President Harrison {{had proven}} unpopular; there were {{divisions}} even <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> {{as the year}} 1892 began and Harrison began his re-election drive. Although no declared candidate opposed Harrison, many Republicans were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged. Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley, Reed, and the aging Blaine. Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate, Harrison's managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of the convention in Minneapolis, requiring him to play a public, neutral role. Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall, though no active {{effort was made to}} convert delegates to McKinley's cause. McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him; nevertheless he finished third, behind the renominated Harrison, and behind Blaine, who had sent word {{he did not want to}} be considered. Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket, Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in the November election. In the wake of Cleveland's victory, McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas' {{service in}} Congress {{coincided with a}} {{worsening}} of factionalism <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Iowa <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> with an [...] "insurgent" [...] contingent loyal to the career and platform of Des Moines attorney (and later Governor and U.S. Senator) Albert B. Cummins, and another [...] "stand-patter" [...] faction hostile toward Cummins. Thomas was considered {{a leader in the}} pro-Cummins faction. He also served on the House Committee on the Judiciary.|$|R

25|$|Worried by {{his support}} among Republicans, Governor Chamberlain canvassed several {{counties}} of the state. Accompanied by Republicans held in low esteem {{by the white}} community, the meetings were often disrupted by Democrats. However, the growing strength and militancy of the Democrats served the purpose of reducing the opposition to Chamberlain <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1926, {{the fourth}} and final dissent arose <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Paulista <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> (PRP). <b>The</b> dissidents were led by Dr. José Adriano de Marrey Junior. He founded the Democratic Party (PD), which, among other reforms, {{advocated}} a program of higher education {{as well as the}} overthrow of PRP power. This political crisis originated <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Freemasons, chaired by Dr. José Adriano de Marrey Junior. As such, São Paulo was divided during the elections of 1930.|$|R
25|$|Harry Aumack, II, was {{selected}} as mayor in April 2013 to fill the vacant seat of Robert McLeod, who had resigned in the previous month citing internal battles <b>within</b> <b>the</b> local <b>Republican</b> <b>party,</b> exemplified by <b>the</b> struggles to fill a council vacancy in late 2012. Ken Howe was named in January 2013 to fill the vacant seat that expires {{at the end of}} 2013 of Republican Evelyn Ambrose, who resigned in December 2012 as she was relocating to Puerto Rico.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Henry Carter (October 30, 1854September 17, 1911) was a {{territorial}} delegate, a United States Representative, and a U.S. Senator from Montana. The {{child of}} Irish immigrants, Carter rose from a childhood spent on small {{farms in the}} Midwest {{to become one of}} the most successful and popular politicians in the early history of the State of Montana. He also made a name for himself <b>within</b> <b>the</b> national <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> becoming in 1892 the first Catholic to serve as chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> National Committee.|$|R
25|$|In the 2003 {{legislative}} session, Frist enjoyed many successes. He {{was able}} to push many initiatives through to fruition, including the Bush administration's third major tax cut and legislation that was against partial-birth abortion. However, the tactics {{that he used to}} achieve those victories alienated many Democrats. He also was instrumental in developing and then passing the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the historic and unprecedented funding commitment to fight disease. In 2004, by comparison, he saw no major legislative successes, with the explanations ranging from delay tactics by Democrats to lack of unity <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smith {{was also}} a key {{advocate}} for embattled conservative Trent Lott's return to a leadership post <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> in 2006. Lott had resigned his position as Senate Republican Leader in 2002, following controversy surrounding his perceived support of Sen. Strom Thurmond's (R-SC) segregationist politics. After the party {{lost control of the}} Senate in November 2006, Republicans elected Lott to the post of Minority Whip (the second-highest Republican position in the Senate.) During the closed-door election, Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) nominated Lott for the position. Smith then seconded the nomination and delivered a supportive address before casting his vote.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the final}} year of the Taft {{administration}} (1912), pressure had been building <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> for legislation which would impose modern financial accounting and budgeting procedures on the federal government. Worsening national debt due to expenditures required by World War I and a greatly enlarged federal government led to passage of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. This legislation, which President Harding signed into law on June 10, 1921, created the Government Accounting Office (GAO), an independent agency answerable solely to Congress. The head of the GAO was the Comptroller General of the United States, a non-partisan position which could only be filled by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Comptroller General served for a single, non-renewable, 15-year term.|$|E
50|$|Pattangall was the Democratic {{candidate}} for Governor of Maine in 1922 and 1924 but lost both times. The second race was against Republican Owen Brewster, who {{was supported by}} the Ku Klux Klan. Pattangall made Brewster's Klan support the centerpiece of the campaign. Although this was not a winning strategy, it helped {{set the stage for a}} split <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Maine <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> around <b>the</b> issue of Klan support, resulting in the election of anti-Klan (and anti-Brewster) Republican Senator Arthur R. Gould in 1926.|$|R
50|$|This {{election}} {{would mark}} {{the beginning of}} Vermont’s transition from a staunchly Republican state to being one of the most Democratic states. Ronald Reagan represented the ascendency of <b>the</b> conservative movement <b>within</b> <b>the</b> modern <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> a party which would become increasingly dominated by conservatives, Southerners, and Evangelical Christians during and after Reagan's administration. Vermont would consequently begin shifting increasingly toward the Democrats in the years to come. It is a highly Democratic state today, as of 2017, as it has been for nearly 25 years.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the tenure}} of Governor Eben Sumner Draper (first elected in 1908), {{divisions}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> state <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> deepened, and tariff reform {{was one of the}} dividing factors. [...] This position prompted Foss to bolt the party, and he bought his way onto the Democratic Party ticket as its nominee for lieutenant governor in 1909; <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> won <b>the</b> election by a narrow margin. [...] In March 1910 he finally gained office, winning a special election to a seat in the United States House of Representatives, filling a vacancy caused by the death of William C. Lovering.|$|R
25|$|Among Craig's classmates was William E. Jenner, {{who would}} later become his primary {{opponent}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> The two often argued over politics while in school together. In 1931 Craig married his classmate Kathryn Louisa Heiliger. After graduating with a law degree in 1932, the couple returned to Clay County where they had two children, Margery and John, and Craig began practicing law in his father's firm. As the Great Depression set in, demand for lawyers dropped and Craig {{had only a few}} cases a year. He began to become involved in local politics and became the chairman of the county Republican Party in 1938. The following year he became the town of Brazil's attorney. In 1940 he was able to have himself named a candidate for lieutenant governor at the state convention, but was defeated in the vote.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party in {{the state}} {{suffered}} a substantial loss in voters due to the disfranchisement measures. Jones {{became involved in the}} struggle between the Lily Whites and the Black and Tans <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> In 1902, Jones helped organize a slate of black Republicans to challenge the Lily Whites and Democrats in the city of Little Rock general election. The struggle reached a breaking point in 1920, when the blacks nominated J.H. Blount, a Negro candidate, for Governor for the first time. In that year, Jones was selected as the Black and Tan contender for the Arkansas Republican National Committee. Four years later, Jones, J. H. Blount, N. R. Parker and J. Hibbler helped organize a Black and Tan protest meeting in Little Rock in which a list of demands for equal political treatment was presented to the Lily Whites. Eventually, a compromise was reached that guaranteed black representation on the Republican State Central Committee.|$|E
500|$|He {{ran against}} {{incumbent}} Democratic Governor John B. Swainson {{in the general}} election. [...] Romney campaigned on revising the state's tax structure, increasing its appeal to businesses and the general public, and getting it [...] "rolling again". Romney decried both the large influence of labor unions within the Democratic Party and the similarly large influence of big business <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> [...] His campaign {{was among the first}} to exploit the capabilities of electronic data processing.|$|E
50|$|After O'Donnell's poor performance, {{there was}} {{considerable}} discussion within Republican circles regarding whether the party had lost a sure Senate seat by nominating her instead of Castle. Party pragmatists said that this had happened, and pointed to other races in Nevada and Colorado where Tea Party-favored candidates had lost races against Democratic rivals. Party purists dismissed this concern, and said that running candidates who supported fundamentally conservative values was always worthwhile. For her own part, O'Donnell criticized divisions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> state <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> following her primary win and said the consequent lack of support had led to her defeat.|$|R
5000|$|Kuchel pointedly {{refused to}} endorse ticket-mate Nixon's {{candidacy}} {{for governor in}} 1962 in a heated race against incumbent Democrat Edmund G. [...] "Pat" [...] Brown, Sr. He had first attempted {{to steer clear of}} <b>the</b> factional infighting <b>within</b> <b>the</b> California <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> which took place in the 1950s between Vice President Nixon, US Senate Republican Leader William F. Knowland, a conservative, and Republican Governor Goodwin J. Knight, a liberal. Known as a moderate, Kuchel eventually backed Knowland in his campaign to oust Knight in <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> primary for governor in 1958. Knight then ran for the United States Senate, but he and Knowland both lost that year.|$|R
50|$|The TNGU was {{chaired by}} its ministers on a {{round-robin}} basis, changing every three months. Mudge as Minister of Finance took the rotating chairmanship in 1986 and in 1988.
