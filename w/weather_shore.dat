60|$|The {{proximity}} of the reef, which formed a <b>weather</b> <b>shore</b> to the boat, prevented anything like a swell on the water, notwithstanding the steadiness and strength of the breeze, which had now blown for near twenty-four hours. The same wind, in open water, would have raised sea enough to cause a ship to pitch, or roll; whereas, the light-house boat, placed where she was, scarce rose and fell under the undulations of the channel through which she was glancing.|$|E
6000|$|Wilder had now {{undertaken}} {{himself the}} task of running his vessel between the islands of Connannicut and Rhode. Fortunately for the heavy responsibility he had assumed, the channel was not difficult and the wind had veered so far to the east as {{to give him a}} favourable opportunity, after making a short stretch to windward, of laying through in a single reach. But this stretch would bring him under the necessity of passing very near the [...] "Rover," [...] or of losing no small portion of his 'vantage ground. He did not hesitate. When the vessel was as nigh the <b>weather</b> <b>shore</b> as his busy lead told him was prudent the ship was tacked, and her head laid directly towards the still motionless and seemingly unobservant slaver.|$|E
50|$|The Kaikoura Peninsula {{environment}} {{is subject to}} highly energetic processes {{in terms of both}} marine and <b>weathering</b> processes. <b>Shore</b> platforms are exposed to the dominant wave directions and are in the intertidal zone. Consequently, both marine erosive forces and subaerial weathering processes contribute to erosion. Shore platforms range from 40 m to over 200 m wide and are cut in Tertiary mudstones and limestones.|$|R

50|$|Spring is {{a season}} of growth, with new grass growing and flowers blooming. Animals come out of hibernation, and sun fills {{the city and its}} surroundings. Temperatures are on the rise, but March and April bring much rain, with light rain that can last for hours on end. That gives way to warm May and June months, and <b>shore</b> <b>weather</b> is in the {{forecast}} for many residents.|$|R

"I will mind," [...] {{she said}} quietly; [...] "but I am {{as likely to}} be carried to the churchyard as you are, and you {{remember}} what I should like, and try, Bill, if you give up the water yourself, to see that he is with a man as doesn't drink. Most of the things we hears of--of barges being run down, and of men falling overboard on a dark night--are just drink, and nothing else. You are not a man as drinks yourself; you take your glass when the barge is in the creek, but I have never seen you the worse for liquor since you courted me fifteen years ago, and I tell you there is not a night when you are out on the barge as I don't thank God that it is so. I says to myself, when the wind is blowing on a dark night, 'He is anchored somewheres under a <b>weather</b> <b>shore,</b> and he is snug asleep in his cabin. There is no fear of his driving along through it and carrying on sail; there is no fear of his stumbling as he goes forward and pitching over'; and no one but myself knows what a comfort it is to me. You bring him up in the same way, Bill. You teach him as it is always a good thing to keep from liquor, though a pint with an old mate aint neither here nor there, but that he might almost as well take poison as to drink down in the cabin." ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{difficulty}} occurred {{concerning the}} command of the vessel, but the matter had been finally settled by an amicable compromise. As the distrust of Jasper was far from being appeased, Cap retained a supervisory power, while {{the young man was}} allowed to work the craft, subject, at all times, to the control and interference of the old seaman. To this Jasper consented, in preference to exposing Mabel any longer to the dangers of their present situation; for, now that the violence of the elements had ceased, he well knew that the Montcalm would be in search of them. He had the discretion, however, not to reveal his apprehensions on this head; for it happened that the very means he deemed the best to escape the enemy were those which would be most likely to awaken new suspicions of his honesty in the minds of those who held the power to defeat his intentions. In other words, Jasper believed that the gallant young Frenchman, who commanded the ship of the enemy, would quit his anchorage under the fort at Niagara, and stand up the lake, as soon as the wind abated, in order to ascertain the fate of the Scud, keeping midway between the two shores as the best means of commanding a broad view; and that, on his part, it would be expedient to hug one coast or the other, not only to avoid a meeting, but as affording a chance of passing without detection by blending his sails and spars with objects on the land. He preferred the south because it was the <b>weather</b> <b>shore,</b> and because he thought it was that which the enemy would the least expect him to take, though it necessarily led near his settlements, and {{in front of one of}} the strongest posts he held in that part of the world.|$|E
5000|$|Lee shore, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} windward and ward shore, is a nautical {{term used to}} describe a stretch of shoreline that is to the lee side of a vessel — meaning {{the wind is blowing}} towards it. A <b>weather</b> <b>shore</b> has the wind blowing from inland over it out to sea. For example, a person standing on a shore when the wind is blowing out to sea (or any large body of water) is standing on a <b>weather</b> <b>shore.</b> If the wind is blowing into shore from the sea, the person is on a lee shore.|$|E

"But he {{will never}} get there, sir," [...] said old Yeo, who had come upon deck to murmur his Nunc Domine, and gaze upon that sight beyond all human faith or hope: [...] "Never, never will he <b>weather</b> the Flanders <b>shore,</b> against such a breeze as is coming up.

But it was plausible enough from a strictly professional point of view and it had the usual features: disablement, dangerous drifting along the <b>shore,</b> <b>weather</b> more or less thick for days, fear of a gale, ultimately a resolve to go in and anchor anywhere on the coast, and so on. Fairly plausible.|$|R
60|$|Dimchurch kept at {{the helm}} {{and the other two}} {{investigated}} their capture. She was three parts decked. In the cabin they came upon a lantern and flint and steel, and soon had light, which helped them greatly in their work. In the bow ropes were stored away, while in a locker they found some bread, which, although stale, was very acceptable. They also unearthed two or three suits of rough sea clothes with which they were glad to replace the light clothes they had carried away with them from the palace grounds, for though the <b>weather</b> on <b>shore</b> was warm the sea-breeze was chilly. Among other useful things they also discovered several long knives, and axes, and a flat stone for cooking upon.|$|R
50|$|The Delaware {{proceeds}} {{to capture a}} British post-office packet carrying the pay for the British Army in Canada, then raids several islands, including St. Kitts. In the course of action, off the <b>weather</b> <b>shore</b> of Martinique, Delaware encounters the frigate HMS Calypso, Sir Hugh Davenant, commanding, accompanied by two smaller ships. The action between the four is interrupted when the French inform both parties {{that they will not}} allow French neutrality to be violated.|$|E
50|$|Cockburn Channel and the Bárbara Channel {{have the}} same {{entrance}} into the Pacific, but it runs in an easterly direction along {{the south side of}} Clarence Island for 40 miles and into Magdalen Sound in Magellan Strait. In working through this passage the south shore ought to be preferred, as it is usually a <b>weather</b> <b>shore,</b> {{and it seems to be}} better provided with coves and inlets in which a vessel may find it convenient to anchor. Two rocks are plainly visible above water in the entrance to Cockburn Channel. One rock lies about 10.5 miles 168° from Mount Skyring and appears to be identical with Leon Rock, which is shown on the charts. The other lies northeastward of Tussac Rocks, about 7.5 miles 171° from Mount Skyring.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>weather</b> <b>shore</b> is {{potentially}} treacherous for kitesurfers and windsurfers, {{who can be}} blown out to sea if {{the wind is blowing}} from the land. For them, a lee shore is safer. For ocean-going vessels during a storm, a lee shore is treacherous because the wind slowly forces the vessel toward the shore, where it will beach or break up. For this reason Bernard Moitessier, the great ocean sailor, called the coastline [...] "the great whore"; it attracts sailors during a storm but is in fact highly dangerous. In shallow coastal water, maneuvering is impaired, waves may become steeper, and objects may be obscured. Navigating during a storm, either by chart or by dead reckoning, becomes extremely difficult. A storm surge may make the entrance to a protected body of water prohibitively treacherous or impossible to locate. Heavy weather tactics more often dictate heading out to sea, where deeper water and more room for maneuver allow a sailboat to heave to or adopt other defensive measures. In landsmen's parlance, this is called [...] "riding out the storm." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} bars and spits formed {{on the shores}} of Lake Manly and are {{preserved}} to this day. Some rocks in shoreline deposits left by the lake display evidence of honeycomb <b>weathering.</b> The southern <b>shore</b> of Lake Manly was formed by alluvial fans that had coalesced {{at the foot of the}} Avawatz Mountains; these fans are still growing and displacing the Amargosa River eastwards. Some sand and gravel deposits at Salt Spring Hills with elevations of about 180 m may have been formed by either Lake Manly or another paleolake south of Death Valley, Lake Dumont.|$|R

She ran about 18 mi off the coast in ballast—carrying no freight or {{passengers}} though many had applied—with 34 persons on board.

50|$|Full-scale {{production}} of the two-inch pipe was started on 14 August 1942, using steel from the now near-defunct Corby steel works, and six weeks later, on 30 October, a 30 mi length was loaded on board HMS Holdfast {{under the command of}} Commander Treby-Heale OBE, RNR, which was {{to be used as a}} full-scale rehearsal of Operation PLUTO. This trial occurred between 26 December and 30 December 1942, the 30 mile length being laid across the Bristol Channel, in rough <b>weather,</b> and the <b>shore</b> ends being connected at Swansea and Ilfracombe. Those aboard monitoring the test were Mr. Hartley (Anglo-Iranian Oil), Mr. Tombs (Anglo-Iranian Oil), Mr. Colby (Iraq Petroleum), Mr. Betson (Post Office), Commander Hardy (Admiralty), and Mr. Whitehead OBE (Johnson and Phillips), who had designed the pipe handling equipment.|$|R
500|$|In France, {{the victory}} {{was the cause}} of celebration, Le Moniteur Universel declaring that [...] "the combat covers the French arms with glory and shows what they are capable of". Linois was proclaimed a {{national}} hero and presented with a Sabre d'honneur by Napoleon. [...] The French victory over a significantly stronger British force was an unusual event in the war during which the Royal Navy had dominated at sea. Saumarez publicly represented the battle as a victory, declaring that he had [...] "compleatly [...] succeeded in disabling the Enemy's ships", although in private he acknowledged the defeat. Historian Richard Gardiner commented that [...] "The well trained and led French had fought hard and skillfully and a combination of <b>weather,</b> luck and <b>shore</b> support had given them the victory against a superior force of which they had captured one. It is, however, also significant that this rare British setback occurred close inshore with all the difficulties and chanciness that implied." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{investment}} {{decision on the}} placement of wind turbines is, neglecting legal formalities, mainly driven by the aim to maximize the expected annual energy production of single turbines. The result is a concentration of wind farms at locations with high average wind speed. While this strategy may be optimal for single investors maximizing their own return on investment, the resulting overall allocation of wind turbines may be unfavorable for energy suppliers and the economy because of large 02 uctuations in the overall wind power output. This paper investigates to what extent optimal allocation of wind farms in Germany can reduce these 02 uctuations. We analyze stochastic dependencies of wind speed for a large data set of German on- and o 00 <b>shore</b> <b>weather</b> stations and 01 nd that these dependencies {{turn out to be}} highly nonlinear but constant over time. Using copula theory we determine the value at risk of energy production for given allocation sets of wind farms and derive optimal allocation plans. We 01 nd that the optimized allocation of wind farms may substantially stabilize the overall wind energy supply on daily as well as hourly frequency...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} long-term {{changes in}} the fish fauna of Brokopondo Reservoir, Suriname, the first large reservoir (1560 km²) that was created in tropical rainforest. Before closure of the dam in 1964, the fish fauna of Suriname River had 172 species, high diversity and high evenness. The riverine fauna was dominated by small-sized species, but no single species was dominant in numbers. Large catfishes were dominant in biomass. Species were evenly distributed over riverine habitats: rapids, tributaries and main channel. Four years after closure of the dam, only 62 fish species were collected from Brokopondo Reservoir, but {{the composition of the}} fish fauna was still changing. The reservoir fauna in 1978 was very similar to the reservoir fauna in 2005, indicating that a stable equilibrium had been reached 14 years after closure of the dam. The reservoir fauna had 41 species, low diversity and low evenness. Most species of Suriname River and its tributaries with strict habitat requirements did not survive in Brokopondo Reservoir. Fish community structure was different among four habitats of Brokopondo Reservoir. The open-water habitat (10 species) was dominated by the piscivores Serrasalmus rhombeus, Acestrorhynchus microlepis and Cichla ocellaris and their prey Bryconops melanurus and two Hemiodus species. B. melanurus fed on zooplankton, Culicinae pupae and terrestrial invertebrates. Hemiodus fed on fine flocculent detritus, demonstrating that the detritus-based food chain was still important in late stages of reservoir development. Serrasalmus rhombeus also fed on peccaries that drowned when swimming across the large reservoir in rough <b>weather.</b> The <b>shore</b> community (27 species) was dominated by seven cichlids, but early stages and juveniles of the open-water species S. rhombeus and B. melanurus also occurred in the shore habitat. Fish biomass in the shore habitat was 66. 5 ± 59. 9 kg ha- 1. The cichlid Geophagus surinamensis and the characid B. melanurus had a lower biomass in Brokopondo Reservoir than in Suriname River. Serrasalmus rhombeus showed reduced body length in Brokopondo Reservoir as compared to riverine populations...|$|R
40|$|Shore {{platforms}} on the Kaikoura Peninsula {{have been}} examined to determine the roles of marine and sub aerial weathering processes in platform evolution. Erosion was measured to assess rates of development and processes of erosion. Lowering rates on platforms are presented from two years of monitoring using a traversing micro-erosion meter. Cliff retreats were calculated using aerial photographic interpretation. Marine processes were investigated by using deep water wave data, by measuring waves on shore platforms and by analysing measured tidal data. Weathering processes were investigated using tidal data, climate data, the Schmidt Hammer test, and a laboratory experiment on wetting and drying. Lowering rates over two years ranged from 0. 07 to 19. 80 mm, and annual rates ranged from 0. 154 to 9. 194 mm/yr. Rates of erosion varied with lithology {{and the type of}} platform. Erosion on Type A mudstone platforms was 1. 98 mm/yr; on Type B mudstone platforms erosion was 0. 733 mm/yr; and on limestone platforms it was 0. 88 mm/yr. The grand mean lowering rate for all shore platforms was 1. 13 mm/yr. These rates fall {{in the middle of the}} range of published rates from previous studies at Kaikoura and at locations around the world. For the first time, erosion data from a traversing micro-erosion meter were presented as volumes of material eroded. The total volume of rock eroded from study sites having, each with an area of 45. 4 cm 2, ranged from 1. 20 to 92. 50 cm 3. A significant finding was that rock surfaces swell up as indicated by a rise in surface level rather than lowering from erosion. The maximum measured swelling was 8. 90 mm. At some measurement sites as much as 90 per cent of measurements showed swelling over a period of 98 days. Values for erosion and swelling were higher during summer months. Both erosion and swelling were shown to be statistically related to season, suggesting that weathering is the group of processes causing both erosion and swelling. Summer provides better conditions for wetting and drying, which is thought to be the most important <b>weathering</b> process on <b>shore</b> platforms. Horizontal retreat rates were calculated over 52 years for cliffs, beaches and lagoon deposits backing shore platforms at Kaikoura, these ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 91 m/yr. Investigation of marine processes showed that the deep water wave environment off the Kaikoura Peninsula is very energetic, but the amount of wave energy delivered to platforms is very low. A comparison of deep water wave energy flux with wave energy flux at the landward cliff of platforms, showed that there was a reduction by as much as five orders of magnitude. An analysis of the role of breaking waves revealed that these were ineffective as an erosional agent because the depth of water offshore causes breaking well before waves arrive on platform surfaces. Shear stresses and dynamic forces under waves were calculated from waves measured on shore platforms. This showed that these forces never exceeded the compressive strength the platform rocks at Kaikoura. It was concluded that wave forces are not directly capable of causing erosion. Evidence of <b>weathering</b> on <b>shore</b> platforms came from a number of distinctive surface morphologies on platforms: honeycombs, salt crystal growths, water layer weathering; and slaking. Schmidt Hammer test data showed: firstly, that weathering had occurred; and secondly, that rock strength was reduced through weathering by as much as 50 per cent. <b>Weathering</b> processes on <b>shore</b> platforms rely on repeated wetting and drying, and for this reason the number of wetting and drying cycles was estimated. The number of cycles ranged from 104 to 379 per year, the variation was due to tidal influences and the growth of algae during winter months. At elevations low in the tide range fewer cycles occurred; the greatest number occurring between the peaks of spring and neap tides, where rainfall adds to the number. Most cycles were estimated to occur between 0. 6 and 0. 9 m above mean sea level on the more landward margins of platforms. It was at these elevations and locations that the highest rates of erosion were measured. Laboratory experiments on wetting and drying showed that only one cycle was needed to cause erosion. Waves were shown not to cause erosion, while sub aerial weathering does. Statistical analysis showed significant relationships between erosion, and wetting and drying and elevation. Based on these results it was concluded that the development of shore platforms at Kaikoura relies on weathering resulting from repeated wetting and drying. This is contrary to recent work which proposed that shore platforms result from marine erosion. Published mathematical models of shore platform development were found to be invalid at Kaikoura, because they were designed on the assumption that platforms are indeed wave cut features. This assumption is incorrect for shore platform development at Kaikoura. An empirical model is presented to explain platform evolution and the differences in platform morphology. A separation between platform types is presented based on the ability of weathering to cause erosion and on compressive strength. This is contrary to a published demarcation between types based on the erosive force of waves and on compressive strength. The type of equilibrium that platforms tend towards is considered. It is proposed that there are two ways to consider equilibrium. First, platforms may be lowered to an as-yet-unidentified elevation; this was viewed as being a static form of equilibrium. Secondly, platforms may continuously widen because weathering is an ongoing process. It was proposed that there is no equilibrium width for shore platforms...|$|R
40|$|Using an {{original}} rock profiling technique especially adapted to locally common smooth and irregular / deeply <b>weathered</b> (karstic) rocky <b>shores,</b> 38 base-line profiles were established at 19 rocky-shore sites to investigate surface-denudation characteristics exhibited by natural rock surfaces {{found on the}} Maltese coast. The latter were identified as being representative of actual or potential bathing platforms, thus offering a valuable alternative to otherwise scarce beach environments on the tourist rich Islands of Malta. Observations on shore surface denudation over a 3 – 5 year period were subsequently related to degree of exposure, erosion and weathering processes considered active at each site. Identification of distinct surface-denudation characteristics for sub-divisions within the Globigerina Limestone and similar surface-lowering rates for Lower Coralline Limestone and the Lower Globigerina Limestone sub-division were considered to qualify otherwise subjective interpretation of local bedrock resistance to marine erosion and weathering. The design of an innovative 'Rock Profiler', was identified as an improvement to traditional profiling techniques, allowing surface elevation measurements over both smooth and indented rock surfaces, achievements of more representative rock surface profiling over extended sample areas (with a 95 consecutive point line-transect), accurate assessments of rock surface micro-relief and of carrying out profiling independent of rock surface plane. This study provided for the first time, accurate and distinct surface-denudation rates for the main geological formations exposed on the Maltese coast, these being 1. 38 mm/yr for Upper Coralline Limestone, 9. 16 mm/yr for Middle Globigerina Limestone, 0. 74 mm/yr for Lower Globigerina Limestone and 0. 77 mm/yr for Lower Coralline Limestone. peer-reviewe...|$|R

[...] As several were recognized, ergo it is one! Dr. Livingstone heard from independent sources that the so-called Victoria Nyanza is a lake region, not a lake; his account of the Okara (Ukara), and the three or four waters run into a single huge sheet, is substantially the same as that which, after a study of the Rev.
