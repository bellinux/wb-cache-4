40|$|Here, we {{describe}} our collaborative efforts to use N-methyl-d-aspartate (NmDA) receptor antagonists as a transla-tional tool to advance {{our understanding of}} the pathophysi-ology of schizophrenia and identify potential new targets for treatment of schizophrenia.

Our work has provided insights into potential mechanisms that may con-tribute to disrupted cortical function in schizophrenia and has helped identify potential treatment targets for the dis-order. The translational nature of this study made the clini-cal testing of the first of these targets feasible.

5000|$|Akasheh {{has been}} one of the {{foremost}} proponents for moving the Iranian capital of Tehran to Isfahan because of a distinct threat from a devastating earthquake. According to Akasheh's calculations, there is a 90 percent chance of a 6.0-magnitude quake hitting the capital and a 50 percent chance of 7.5-magnitude earthquake. The vast majority of buildings in Tehran are located on the convergence of some 100 known fault lines which in its present architectural form are incapable of withstanding even a moderate earthquake. A hypothesis presented by Akasheh indicates that a 6.8 quake in Tehran would kill more than 700,000 people. According to Akasheh, [...] "Tehran must be rebuilt; if not it should be moved.

In an interview on radio, Olsen explained the Goldwater position. Hulsizer did not guarantee the bonds up to $75 million, but intended to back parking revenues up to $75 million over the 30-year lease. At $2.5 million per year, Olsen estimated that would be the parking revenues at the arena from concerts alone. The taxpayers of Glendale were not being offered any guarantee on the bonds. Glendale met in a public forum with Goldwater to attempt to end the impasse, but both sides did not change their positions on the possible deal.|$|E

5000|$|On October 23, 2007, Kerr gave {{a memorable}} {{speech at the}} annual [...] "GEOINT" [...] conference on Geospatial Intelligence (to an {{audience}} including many people from his prior NRO job). He said,"We really need to realize what a loaded word security really is. When I’m at work, and throughout my day, security is safety, as a barrier against physical or emotional harm. When I go home at night, security is privacy, as an expectation of freedom from unnecessary burdens. In the intelligence community, {{we have an obligation}} to protect both safety and privacy, and over the course of GEOINT 2007, as we talk about the hows of new technologies and tradecraft, I’d like to take a step back right now and talk about the whys."Safety and privacy - it's common thinking that, in order to have more safety, you get less privacy. I don’t agree with that. I work from the assumption that you need to have both. When we try to make it an either/or proposition, we’re bound to fail."Later in the speech, he said,"Too often, privacy has been equated with anonymity; and it's an idea that is deeply rooted in American culture. The Lone Ranger wore a mask but Tonto didn’t seem to need one even though he did the dirty work for free. You’d think he would probably need one even more. But in our interconnected and wireless world, anonymity - or the appearance of anonymity - is quickly becoming a thing of the past."Anonymity results from a lack of identifying features. Nowadays, when so much correlated data is collected and available - and I’m just talking about profiles on MySpace, Facebook, YouTube here - the set of identifiable features has grown beyond where most of us can comprehend. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> beyond the construct that equates anonymity with privacy and focus more on how we can protect essential privacy in this interconnected environment."Protecting anonymity isn’t a fight that can be won. Not with me in my current job. Anyone that's typed in their name on Google understands that. Instead, privacy, I would offer, is a system of laws, rules, and customs with an infrastructure of Inspectors General, oversight committees, and privacy boards on which our intelligence community commitment is based and measured. And it is that framework that we need to grow and nourish and adjust as our cultures change."I think people here, at least people close to my age, recognize that those two generations younger than we are have a very different idea of what is essential privacy, what they would wish to protect about their lives and affairs. And so, it's not for us to inflict one size fits all. It's a need to have it be adjustable to the needs of local societies as they evolve in our country. Eventually, we can only hope that people's perceptions - in Hollywood and elsewhere - will catch up."These remarks produced major news coverage that said he'd said that [...] "privacy no longer can mean anonymity...Instead, it should mean that government and businesses properly safeguards sic people's private communications and financial information." ...|$|E
