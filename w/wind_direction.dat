5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective.

40|$|Changes in the {{percentages}} of eight main surface <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> at 14 meteorological stations in Estonia, Northeast Europe, were studied during 1966 – 2008. Long-term changes in <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> are related to variations in the large-scale atmospheric circulation but partly also {{to changes in the}} surroundings of the stations and in wind obstacles. Significant alterations in <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> were determined, and found to be the strongest in the winter season. The percentages of W and SW winds have clear positive trends, while SE, E and NE winds are characterized by negative tendencies in winter. In conclusion, <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> have probably been shifted from east to west. Differences in trends between the stations are explained by changes in wind obstacles around the stations. The trends in wind roses in Estonia were caused by the intensification of the westerly circulation over the Atlantic/European sector during the winter season...|$|R

5|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>direction</b> {{is usually}} {{expressed}} in terms of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, windsocks indicate <b>wind</b> <b>direction,</b> and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E

Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy.

5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills. The {{average annual}} sunshine totals around 1,600hours. Rainfall {{tends to be}} associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and a large proportion of rain falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 35–60inch (900–1500mm). About 10–20days of snowfall is typical. From November to March, mean wind speeds are highest; winds are lightest from June to August. The predominant <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> is from the south-west.|$|E

5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference.

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{stability}} of the boundary-layer stratification, high-latitude winds over complex terrain are strongly affected by blocking and channelling effects. Consequently, at many low-lying communities in the Canadian Archipelago, including Cape Dorset and Iqaluit considered in this study, surface winds for the most part are from two diametrically opposed directions, following the orientation of the elevated terrain. Shifts between the two prevailing <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> can be sudden and are associated with geostrophic <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> within a well defined narrow range. To quantitatively investigate the role of large-scale pressure gradients and the quasi-geostrophic overlying flow, an idealised dynamical system for the evolution of channelled surface winds is derived from the basic equations of motion, in which stability of stationary along-channel <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> is described {{as a function of the}} geostrophic wind. In comparison with long-term horizontal wind statistics at the two locations it is shown that the climatologically prevailing <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> can be identified as stationary states of the idealised wind model, and that shifts between prevailing <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> can be represented as stability transitions between these stationary states. In that sense, the prevailing local wind conditions can be interpreted as attracting states of the actual flow, with observed surface winds adjusting to a new stable direction as determined by the idealised system within 3 ? 9 h. Over these time-scales and longer it is therefore advantageous to determine the relatively slow evolution of the observationally well-resolved large-scale pressure distribution, instead of modelling highly variable surface winds directly. The simplified model also offers a tool for dynamical downscaling of global climate simulations, and for determining future scenarios for local prevailing wind conditions. In particular, it allows an estimation of the sensitivity of local low-level winds to changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation...|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa on July 27. Initially, virgorous convection persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the convection on July 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection. On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> from northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed.
