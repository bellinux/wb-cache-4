5|$|Although the {{creation}} of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works {{are thought to have}} been written by women. For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found. However, Edward F. Wente asserts that, even with explicit references to women reading letters, it is possible that women employed others to write documents.|$|E

5|$|The Whitechapel murders were {{committed}} {{in or near}} the impoverished Whitechapel district in the East End of London between 3 April 1888 and 13 February 1891. At various points some or all of these eleven unsolved murders of <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ascribed to the notorious unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper.|$|E

50|$|Thor and the Amazon <b>Women</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> called “… {{about as}} bad as they come.” The film’s unflattering {{portrayal}} of black people and <b>women</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> criticized as racially insensitive and anti-feminist.

5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{relegated to a}} {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|As of , 35 {{individuals}} {{have served as}} mayor. There have been 36 mayoralties because Edwin M. Capps served two non-consecutive terms; he is counted chronologically as both the ninth and sixteenth mayor. The longest term was that of Pete Wilson, who served for eleven years over three terms prior {{to the establishment of}} successive term limits. The shortest term, not counting interim or acting mayors, was that of George P. Tebbetts, who served for less than two months before the position of mayor was abolished due to the bankruptcy of the city. Percy J. Benbough is the only mayor to have died in office. Two <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> elected mayor: Maureen O'Connor and Susan Golding consecutively. John F. Forward, Sr. and John F. Forward, Jr. are the only father and son to have both served as mayor.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} female students, {{making it the}} first coeducational school among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. The requirement that women (at least freshman women) must live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the Cornell School of Nursing historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E
