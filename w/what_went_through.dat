6000|$|The special {{correspondent}} of the San Francisco Bulletin, a reliable authority, writes from Fort Langley, twenty-five {{miles up the}} Fraser, under date the 25th May, {{that he had just}} come down from Fort Yale, where he found sixty men and two hundred Indians, with their squaws, at work on a [...] "bar" [...] of about five hundred yards in length--called [...] "Hills Bar," [...] one mile below Fort Yale, and fifteen miles from Fort Hope, all trading posts of the Hudson's Bay Company. [...] "The morning I arrived, two men (Kerrison and Company) cleaned up five and a-half ounces from the rocker, the product of half a day's work. Kerrison and Company the next day cleaned up ten and a-half ounces from two rockers, which I saw myself weighed. This bar is acknowledged {{to be one of the}} richest ever seen, and well it may be, for here is a product of fifteen and a-half ounces of gold, worth 247 and a half dollars, or 50 pounds sterling, from it in a day and a-half to the labour of two rockers. Old Californian miners say they never saw such rich diggings. The average result per day to the man was fully 20 dollars, some much more. The gold is very fine; so much so, that it was impossible to save more than two-thirds of <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> the rockers. This defect in the rocker must be remedied by the use of quicksilver to `amalgamate' the finer particles of gold. This remedy is at hand, for California produces quicksilver sufficient for the consumption of the `whole' world in her mountains of Cinnabar. Supplies are going on by every vessel. At Sailor Diggings, above Fort Yale, they are doing very well, averaging from 8 to 25 dollars per day to the man. I am told that the gold is much coarser on Thompson River than it is in Fraser River. I saw yesterday about 250 dollars of coarse gold from Thompson River, in pieces averaging 5 dollars each. Some of the pieces had quartz among them. Hill, who was the first miner on the bar bearing his name, just above spoken of, with his partner, has made some 600 dollars on it in almost sixteen days' work. Three men just arrived from Sailor Diggings have brought down 670 dollars in dust, the result of twelve days' work. Gold very fine. Rising of the river driving the miners off for a time." ...|$|E

50|$|In an {{interview}} with Michael Singer, when asked about film's ability to grant a form of immortality, Heckerling describes the experience during the accident: “There was the whole thing-the yellow light and all that stuff-and <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> my mind right then was, ‘Well, at least I got the film to the lab.’ So it’s not going to save you from anything, obviously, but something about it pulls you forward.” Eventually, she finished the film and held a screening that gained a very positive response, causing Heckering to call {{it one of the}} best days of her life. Her next step was to use the film to get a job. Tom Mount, president of Universal Pictures, showed {{a lot of interest in}} Heckerling but because she was not backed by an agent they could not hire her. After months of struggling to find an agent, Mount called Heckerling up on the phone and asked her to make a film.|$|E

5000|$|Tisdale's music, {{which is}} {{predominantly}} considered pop, has included ballads, dance-pop, hip hop, and rock influences. Boys, heartbreak, and relationship breakups are common themes in Tisdale's songs. She defined her music {{career as a}} way to connect herself with the fans and to inspire them. She claimed that, while Headstrong (2007) allowed her to [...] "learn herself as an artist", with her second album, Guilty Pleasure (2009), she knew exactly {{what she wanted to do}} as an artist. Tisdale has named many influences on her musical career, including Christina Aguilera, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, Pat Benatar, [...] Pink, Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Led Zeppelin, and AC/DC. Tisdale said that [...] "almost anything" [...] inspires her, but she is mainly inspired by female pop singers. She often co-writes the songs she records; for her debut album Headstrong, she had writing credits in four songs, while she co-wrote five tracks for her album Guilty Pleasure. The songs in which she has songwritting credits are often personal. In 2009, while discussing the songs she co-wrote for her second studio album, Tisdale said that [...] "a lot of the songs on the album were about survival and staying strong" [...] and that she wanted those songs to be [...] "a statement and a reflection of <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> over the past year and how has grown up." [...] She named the song [...] "What If" [...] as the most personal song she co-wrote for Guilty Pleasure. She discussed the death of her grandfather in the song [...] "You're Always Here", which she wrote with her husband French.|$|E
5000|$|On September 24, 2013 {{the band}} {{released}} their fifth album Negativity. The album {{was produced by}} Steve Berlin and displayed a slicker polished sound than previous releases, with McCauley revealing that Berlin changed the structure of every song he took to the sessions and [...] "doesn’t settle for any {{of that kind of}} raggedy, kind of charming, first take kind of sound". Crowell added that “Steve had a really large hand in shaping this album” and that [...] "there is a fair bit of layering on the album, but I like it as the keyboardist, because there is more keyboards". The album was preceded by the Ian O'Neil song The Dream's In The Ditch, which was originally intended for his Dirt Naps project. The band performed the song on Conan on September 25, 2013. Many of McCauley's songs on the album were written on piano instead of guitar and were put together whilst on vacation in Namibia and Johannesburg in 2012. The band demoed close to 30 songs for the album, with Berlin picking 12 to work on including a duet with pop singer Vanessa Carlton on In Our Time. McCauley later married Carlton in December 2013 in a ceremony officiated by former Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks The album was influenced by recent events in McCauley's life including his father, a Democrat who represented Providence, pleading guilty to filing false tax returns and conspiring to defraud the federal government of more than $500,000 resulting in a 27-month prison sentence and a $10,000 fine, the death of his uncle, his wedding engagement to Nikki Kvarnes of Nashville band Those Darlins collapsing due to his drug use and drinking and subsequently getting clean from drugs. The song Mr. Sticks is about family struggles with the title being his father's childhood nickname and Pot Of Gold is a [...] "stream of consciousness recollection of <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> my head and what kinds of misadventures I got myself into when I was doing crack". Throughout 2013, O'Neil and the Ryan brothers played several shows with Ravi Shavi frontman Rafay Rashid in their new side project Happiness.|$|E
30|$|In {{the past}} TAPA studies, {{researchers}} {{used to collect}} the relevant data through video-taping the composition marking process of the participant teachers and the verbalization of <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> their minds directly during the marking concurrently. In order to minimize the disturbances caused by the recording, the cameras were usually set either behind the participants or directly above their hands and the compositions. Nevertheless, there are still two intractable problems with this mode of data collection. On the one hand, the awareness of {{the very existence of}} the cameras would inevitably impose pressure on the participants and hence affect their marking performance. On the other hand, the hands and arms of the participants would keep blocking the view of the compositions from time to time, undermining the completeness of the data collected. In view of these considerations, we have developed a camera-free, tablet-based composition marking recording system that can concurrently record all the necessary data and information concerning the marking and the think-aloud process.|$|E

40|$|In the {{challenging}} times {{of budget cuts}} and reviews, libraries are faced with issues such as justifying acquisition, negotiating deals and reviewing current subscriptions (pertaining to electronic resources) among others. With {{the rapid growth of}} electronic resources, libraries have to continuously assess their acquisition models and policies to constantly ensure that they are balancing their budget and users ’ needs as well. This paper highlights the role played by Technical and Digital Services (TADS) section of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) library (Saudi Arabia) in acquiring the electronic resources (electronic books, electronic journals, databases, image and reference) for the community. It will describe the processes during the early days when KAUST library was inaugurated; how electronic resources were acquired and <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> during those days. The paper will elaborate further how the acquisition model has evolved and the various important roles played by the library staff in ensuring that acquisitions/subscriptions are justified, within the budget and provides ROI for the library...|$|E

50|$|While {{this has}} {{very little to do}} with modern psychology, Guido's {{philosophy}} of spiritelli was part of the guiding principles of Arabic medicine, considered very advanced at Dante's times.
