40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{identify}} the indications of mechanical support in postcardiotomy left ventricular failure in patients {{who are unable to}} undergo transplantation. METHODS: From 1989 through 1997, 61 patients with postcardiotomy left ventricular failure beyond intra-aortic balloon pumping were assisted with the Hemopump cardiac assist system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn). Their mean age was 64 +/- 8 years. Comorbidity was prevalent; 47 % underwent cardiac massage before pump support, and evolving myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 43 % before surgery. Multivariable logistic regression of data known at the moment of pump insertion was performed {{to identify the}} risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of the patients were <b>weaned</b> from the <b>device,</b> but only 30 % were discharged home. Cardiac index evolution during the first hours after pump insertion (P <. 001) is the only independent predictor for possibility to <b>wean</b> from the <b>device</b> in the multivariable analysis. Acute renal failure is the only variable retained in the model for 90 -day mortality. Device-related complications were far more frequent with the femoral (54 %) than with the transthoracic (6 %) cannula. Only 13 % of the patients had bleeding complications. CONCLUSIONS: One third of the patients with postcardiotomy heart failure refractory to use of the intra-aortic balloon pump can be saved with the use of an endovascular axial flow pump.

Fenceline weaning involves placing the calves in a pasture adjacent to their cows so they can have contact with each other through the fence. Two-stage <b>weaning</b> utilizes anti-suckling <b>devices</b> that clip into the calves noses and prevent them from suckling their cows. The calves remain with the cows for a short amount of time, then they are weaned and separated from their cows. This allows the stressors of weaning to be faced in two stages.

40|$|Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is a {{valuable}} tool to save patients suffering from severe cardiogenic schock. However, the reversibility of multiorgan failure (MOF) limits the survival. We investigated predictors of recovery from of MOF in patients supported with biventricular assist device (BVAD) or total artificial heart (TAH). Methods We investigated 426 patients implanted with BVAD/TAH between 1988 and 2006, except for postcardiotomy syndrome and transplant failure. In 187 patients without technical or bleeding problems requiring re-thoracotomy evaluation of 69 clinical, hemodynamic, echocardiographic and laboratory parameters was performed. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups regarding procedural success. Group I – survival > 30 days or heart transplantation or <b>weaning</b> from <b>device</b> (n= 123) and Group II – dead on system < 30 days after surgery (n= 64). Results The overall survival was 66 %. The patients in group I were younger (40. 1 vs. 45. 6 years, p= 0. 029), had higher systolic blood pressure (97 vs. 90. 6 mmHg, p= 0. 027), lower serum creatinine (1. 9 vs. 2. 4 mg/dl, p= 0. 004) and higher arterial pH (7. 4 vs. 7. 3, p= 0. 004). The multivariate analysis did not show any significant predictors for recovery from MOF. Conclusion MCS reverses MOF. However, the standard markers for severity of cardiogenic schock and grade of MOF do not predict survival on BVAD/TAH. Therefore, rapid MCS installation as bridge to decision with subsequent employment of decision algorhythm is necessary in all patients with severe cardiogenic schock and MOF...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveWe {{analyzed}} the factors influencing the cardiac function of patients after weaning from ventricular assist devices {{and established a}} prognostic index. MethodA multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model of the clinical parameters of 28 patients with end-stage heart failure before implantation of a ventricular assist device and directly before <b>weaning</b> from the <b>device.</b> ResultsAfter <b>weaning</b> from the ventricular assist devices, 14 of the 28 investigated patients showed stable cardiac function, and 12 had recurrent heart failure, but only 1 of them died before transplantation or implantation of another ventricular assist device, and 2 patients died of causes unrelated to heart failure. In addition to left ventricular ejection fraction, the duration of symptomatic heart failure and left ventricular intracavitary dimensions in diastole measured before ventricular assist <b>devices</b> <b>weaning</b> were the major factors influencing cardiac function after weaning. In the group of patients with heart failure duration less than 3 years, only 2 of 13 cases were recurrent, but in the group with heart failure duration more than 3 years, 10 of 15 cases were recurrent. In 10 patients with 40 to 50 mm left ventricular intracavitary dimensions in diastole before weaning, only 1 case was recurrent. In 10 patients with 51 to 55 mm left ventricular intracavitary dimensions in diastole, 3 cases were recurrent. In the group with left ventricular intracavitary dimensions in diastole more than 56 mm, all 8 cases were recurrent. A prognostic index was calculated using the following formula: prognostic index = − 10. 10 + 0. 208 (heart failure duration in years) + 0. 173 (pre-explantation left ventricular intracavitary dimensions in diastole in millimeters). In the group with a prognostic index less than 0, only 2 of 16 cases were recurrent, {{and the rate of}} stable cardiac function in the 51 st month after weaning was 83. 6 %. In the group with a prognostic index greater than 0, 10 of 12 cases were recurrent, and the rate of stable function in the 57 th month was 0. 0 %. ConclusionIn patients with off-pump left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40 %, the duration of symptomatic heart failure and the left ventricular intracavitary dimensions in diastole measured before weaning yield a useful index to predict long-term cardiac function after weaning from ventricular assist devices...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundHypercapnic {{respiratory}} failure {{in patients with}} COPD frequently requires mechanical ventilatory support. Extracorporeal CO 2 removal (ECCO 2 R) techniques have not been systematically evaluated in these patients. MethodsThis is a pilot study of a novel ECCO 2 R device that utilizes a single venous catheter with high CO 2 removal rates at low blood flows. Twenty hypercapnic patients with COPD received ECCO 2 R. Group 1 (n = 7) consisted of patients receiving noninvasive ventilation with a high likelihood of requiring invasive ventilation, group 2 (n = 2) consisted of patients {{who could not be}} weaned from noninvasive ventilation, and group 3 (n = 11) consisted of patients on invasive ventilation who had failed attempts to <b>wean.</b> ResultsThe <b>device</b> was well tolerated, with complications and rates similar to those seen with central venous catheterization. Blood flow through the system was 430. 5 ± 73. 7 mL/min, and ECCO 2 R was 82. 5 ± 15. 6 mL/min and did not change significantly with time. Invasive ventilation was avoided in all patients in group 1 and both patients in group 2 were weaned; PaCO 2 decreased significantly (P <. 003) with application of the device from 78. 9 ± 16. 8 mm Hg to 65. 9 ± 11. 5 mm Hg. In group 3, three patients were weaned, while the level of invasive ventilatory support was reduced in three patients. One patient in group 3 died due to a retroperitoneal bleed following catheterization. ConclusionsThis single-catheter, low-flow ECCO 2 R system provided clinically useful levels of CO 2 removal in these patients with COPD.

40|$|Application of the {{miniaturized}} ImaCor Trans-Esophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) probe in Heart Transplant/Mechanical Cardiac Support Patients In {{the surgical}} cardiac care unit (SCCU), therapeutic interventions often {{need to be}} done at the bedside, necessitating the need for a rapidly employable diagnostic tool for the cardiac intensivist. We report the clinical utility of the miniature ImaCor TEE-probe in guiding management of post heart transplant (H-Txp) and mechanical cardiac support patients (MCS) and describe the economic benefit of such a device. This is an IRB approved retrospective review of MCS/H-Txp patients who had ImaCor TEE monitoring in the SCCU of our institution in 2011. The effect on management was stratified into 3 categories; Major (tamponade/device selection/RV failure), Moderate (<b>weaning</b> support <b>device</b> guidance/ inotrope management/fluid management/hemodynamic instability) and Minor (line placement/useful data). The ImaCor TEE-Probe was utilized in a total of 34 patients, of which 21 were either supported by MCS or were post H-Txp. Of these, 13 were on ECMO, 9 were post-VAD, 3 supported by the Impella device and 4 were post-H-Txp. 6 patients were placed on more than 1 method of MCS and 1 patient was supported by ECMO after a H-Txp. The device had a Major effect on management in 4 patients (19 %), Moderate effect in 13 (62 %) and a Minor effect in 4 (19 %). The cost difference between this new device and the traditional TEE is also significant (900 USD vs 4000 USD). Our institution saved in excess of 150, 000 USD with the use of this device instead of traditional TEE. This figure did not include the ability of this probe to be used repeatedly within a 72 -hour time frame, and the potential cost of going to the operating theatre for further management. This device has proven to be an invaluable new adjunct in the SCCU by allowing previously unobtainable continuous real time monitoring of the MCS/H-Txp patient. Use of the ImaCor TEE-probe provides the cardiac intensivist with timely important clinical data that improves patient care and is economically advantageous...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} achievability of <b>device</b> <b>weaning</b> in {{patients}} receiving left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) {{as a bridge}} to transplantation. Methods: Eighteen consecutive patients receiving a LVAD between September 1997 and June 2002 {{were included in the}} study. During a four-month follow-up, patients were repeatedly evaluated with right heart catheterization and echocardiography and, if functional improvement was observed, studied with the device turned off. Cardiac recovery was defined as off-pump LVEF >= 40 % together with a significant improvement in invasive haemodynamic measurements (CI >= 2. 5 and PCWP <= 10 - 12 mm Hg). Patients fulfilling these criteria were considered for weaning. Results: Three patients fulfilled the predefined criteria for cardiac recovery and were subjected to device explantation. In one patient, a young female with acute myocarditis, the following course was uneventful. In the second patient, a male with dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure reoccurred only a few days later. The third patient had a relapse of giant cell myocarditis and was transplanted. One patient underwent transplantation before follow-up evaluation could be performed. Conclusion: In our experience, patients with severe advanced heart failure are unlikely to show significant cardiac recovery following treatment with LVAD, in contrast to previous suggestions.

40|$|Background and Objectives：The {{ventricular}} assist device (VAD) {{was developed}} as a bridge to cardiac trans-plantation, but the current research trends are advancing {{the purpose of the}} bridge toward cardiac recovery. Using a simulation, we investigated the effects of long-term VAD implantation on the hemodynamic parameters related to the prognosis of heart failure so as to shed light on its preclinical and clinical applicability. Materials and Method：A moving-actuator type artificial heart developed by the Seoul National University Artificial Heart Laboratory was used as a model of the biventricular assist device. The initial values of the hemodynamic parameters were set according to the guidelines of VAD implantation. We then performed a simulation that tracks changes in the hemodynamic variables related to successful <b>device</b> <b>weaning</b> and the prognosis of heart failure. Results：Cardiac indices (CIs) at one hour and six months after VAD implantation were 2. 98 l/min/m 2 and 2. 60 l/min/m 2, respectively. The systolic, diastolic and mean aorta pressures were 121, 84 and 99 mmHg six months after the VAD implantation. During the pump-off stage after six months, the he-modynamic parameters values were as follows：CI 2. 53 l/min/m 2, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 10 mmHg, left ventricular end-diastolic volume 105 ml, left ventricular ejection fraction 0. 58, mean aorta pressure 84 mmHg, and end-systolic wall stress 108 kdyn/cm 2.

40|$|Ventricular assist device (VAD) support induces reverse {{remodeling}} {{of failing}} myocardium {{that leads to}} occasional functional recovery of the adult heart. While {{there have been numerous}} clinical reports in adult patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy, little is known about reverse remodeling in children, which has increasing clinical potential with the recent expansion of pediatric VADs in the setting of static organ supply for heart transplantation. Pediatric myocardium also promises theoretical advantages for recovery over adult myocardium due to its greater abundance of cardiac progenitor cells. To identify potential targets of future studies, we conducted a literature review with two aims: (i) to summarize clinical cases of pediatric patients who exhibited cardiac recovery following VAD support; and (ii) to analyze genetic changes in pediatric myocardium induced by VAD support compared with those observed in adult patients. Several clinical series of pediatric VAD cases report that small proportions of their cohorts were <b>weaned</b> off from <b>device</b> support, but a lack of information about the etiology and support duration of these patients limits the ability to determine whether they represent reverse remodeling of myocardial structure or just recovery from acute illness. A comparison of pediatric and adult gene expression changes with VAD support reveals approximately 40 % of genes to be oppositely regulated, indicating that the pediatric genetic response is distinct. These observations highlight a necessity to better understand reverse remodeling specific to pediatric myocardium, which is crucial to improving clinical strategies for bridge-to-recovery in children...|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid to}} late 1970s {{numerous}} cardiovascular {{programs were}} competing {{to find a way to}} extend life for those with inoperable end-stage cardiovascular disease. Bernhard began his breakthrough work at Boston Children's Hospital as one of the principal clinical investigators of the development of temporary heart assist devices. His work changed the development of research into heart assist devices when the Nation Heart Lung and Blood Institute was preparing to cancel all related research. At an American Heart Association meeting in November 1978 he announced that two people had survived for several days with the left ventricular heart assist device Ventricular Assist <b>Device</b> before being <b>weaned</b> off the <b>device.</b> In 1987, after ten years of continued work, Bernhard went on to work to develop a left ventricular heart pump, manufactured by Thermedics, Inc. of Woburn, MA an affiliated company of Thermo Electron Corporation with funding by the National, Heart Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. This research opened pathways to survival for severely ill cardiovascular patients.The early part of Bernhard's career was spent in surgical service to children with severe heart disorders. Bernhard performed most of his surgery at Children’s Hospital in Boston where he treated children and adolescents from 1960 until his retirement. Bernhard’s work included the development of ground breaking surgical techniques for the heart and the first successfully implanted LVAD device (see Ventricular Assist Device) manufactured while working with a group of scientists from Thermedics, Inc. of Woburn, MA.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Extracorporeal {{support of}} heart and lung {{function}} (venoarterial perfusion) during cardiac arrest (ECPR) has been advocated {{as a means of}} improving survival following cardiac arrest. The authors retrospectively reviewed their institution's seven-year experience with this intervention. Methods: Emergency department patients and inpatients in cardiac arrest or immediately postarrest were considered candidates. ECPR was instituted using venoarterial bypass and was continued until patients regained sufficient cardiopulmonary function to allow <b>weaning</b> from the <b>device</b> or until their condition was deemed irrecoverable. Results: ECPR was attempted in 25 patients and successfully instituted in 21. Four patients (16 %) were converted from ECPR to ventricular assist devices, two of whom survived and await transplantation. Seven additional patients were discharged from the hospital, resulting in an overall survival of 36 %. Because none of the children treated survived, there was a trend toward higher age among survivors (survivors 40 ± 14 yr, nonsurvivors 33 ± 15 yr, p = 0. 29). The duration of conventional CPR was shorter among survivors (survivors 21 ± 16 min, nonsurvivors 43 ± 32 min, p = 0. 04), as was the duration of extracorporeal support (survivors 44 ± 21 hr, nonsurvivors 87 ± 96 hr, p = 0. 18). Survival was seen only in patients whose conditions were amenable to a definitive therapeutic intervention, particularly cardiac arrest due to respiratory or pulmonary embolic disease. While four of the five patients treated in the ED were successfully supported, none survived to discharge. Conclusion: In select patients with reversible disease, extracorporeal CPR can be used to successfully treat cardiac arrest. Further investigation into its most appropriate application is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: The use of weaning {{predictive}} indicators {{can avoid}} early extubation and wrongful prolonged mechanical ventilation. This study aimed {{to determine the}} power of the integrative weaning index (IWI) in predicting the success rate of the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in patients under mechanical ventilation. Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 105 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for over 48 h were enrolled. Before weaning initiation, the IWI was calculated and based on the defined cutoff point (≥ 25), the success rate of the SBT was predicted. In case of <b>weaning</b> from the <b>device,</b> 2 -h SBT was performed and the physiologic and respiratory indices were continuously studied while being intubated. If they were in the normal range besides the patient's tolerance, the test was considered as a success. The result was then compared with the IWI and further analyzed. Results: The SBT was successful in 90 (85. 7 %) and unsuccessful in 15 (14. 3 %) cases. The difference between the true patient outcome after SBT, and the IWI prediction was 0. 143 according to the Kappa agreement coefficient (P < 0. 001). Moreover, regarding the predictive power, IWI had high sensitivity (95. 6 %), specificity (40 %), positive and negative predictive values (90. 5 % and 60), positive and negative likelihood ratios (1. 59 and 0. 11), and accuracy (86. 7 %). Conclusion: The IWI as a more objective indicator has acceptable accuracy and power for predicting the 2 -h SBT result. Therefore, in addition to the reliable prediction of the final weaning outcome, it has favorable power to predict if the patient is ready to breathe spontaneously as the first step to weaning...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveBiventricular assist device {{support with}} a paracorporeal pulsatile device {{is known to}} be an {{efficient}} bridge to recovery for patients with fulminant myocarditis–related cardiogenic shock. Whether these patients can be as efficiently supported with femorofemoral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains unclear. MethodsFrom 2001 to 2006, 11 patients were referred to our cardiac surgery department for fulminant myocarditis–related cardiogenic shock. The first 5 patients (mean age, 32 ± 2 years) were supported with a biventricular assist device (Thoratec, Pleasanton, Calif; group I), whereas the remaining patients (40 ± 4 years) were supported with femorofemoral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (group II). Preimplantation probability of death was calculated by using the APACHE II score, which was 11 ± 9 in group I versus 24 ± 18 in group II. ResultsOne patient in each group died while receiving support. In group I the death occurred after 18 days of support in a patient who had 45 minutes of external resuscitation before biventricular assist device implantation. In group II a patient who remained unstable during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was switched to a biventricular assist device 13 days later and eventually died of tamponade after 45 days. All other patients were <b>weaned</b> from the <b>device</b> after a mean duration of support of 21 ± 5 days in group I versus 13 ± 4 days in group II. At hospital discharge, the mean ejection fraction was 45 % ± 5 % in both groups, and at 6 months' follow-up, it was 65 % and 75 %, respectively, in groups I and II.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{examines}} short-term mechanical assist device support for cardiac transplant patients and compares their outcomes with nontransplant patients requiring similar support. MethodsOf 350 cardiac transplant patients at our institution, 7 patients required mechanical ventricular assistance with the Abiomed BVS 5000 assist device (Abiomed, Inc, Danvers, Mass) after transplant secondary to severe acute rejection with cardiogenic shock (n = 4) or primary graft failure (n = 3). Recovery of ventricular function, survival to discharge, and complications were determined for the transplant group and {{compared with a}} second group comprising all other patients supported with the BVS 5000 at our institution (n = 15). Additionally, the results of prior series reporting mechanical ventricular support of the failing transplant heart are reviewed. ResultsDemographics and duration of support were similar between the groups. The transplant group had a higher <b>wean</b> rate from <b>device</b> relative to the nontransplant group (100 % versus 13 %; P < 0. 01). Five of 7 in the transplant group achieved survival to discharge (71 %), relative to 5 of 15 in the nontransplant group (33 %). Complications {{between the two groups}} were similar, although the transplant group experienced a higher rate of renal insufficiency (57 % versus 13 %, P = 0. 05). ConclusionSevere acute rejection with cardiogenic shock and primary graft failure are two conditions that may warrant mechanical ventricular support in the cardiac transplant patient. Transplant patients with these conditions have a high rate of ventricular functional recovery, greater than nontransplant patients supported with the same device and for a similar period of time. Although the incidence of renal insufficiency was higher, the majority of transplant patients who were supported with the BVS 5000 achieved survival to discharge...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Abiomed BVS 5000 {{ventricular}} assist device (VAD) {{has been}} approved in Belgium for emergency cardiac support in patients with postcardiotomy failure {{with the aim of}} native heart function recovery. Other indications have emerged from world wide experience, but the indication and usefulness of emergency implantation of assist devices is often debated. METHODS: To decide which patients benefit most from emergency ventricular assist device implantation, we retrospectively reviewed our results of mechanical circulatory support with Abiomed in 20 patients over a 4 -year period. Fifteen patients with mean age 58 +/- 6 years experienced postcardiotomy failure and underwent biventricular assist device (BVAD) implantation (group A), after elective (n = 9) or after emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 6). Five patients (group B), with mean age 35 +/- 19 years, had an implantation for other underlying conditions: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 3), myocarditis (n = 1) and primary cardiac allograft failure (n = 1). RESULTS: Of these two groups, eight and two patients respectively needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation before VAD implantation. The mean duration of support in both groups was 5. 8 (range 12 h- 13 days) and 4. 4 days (range 2 h- 9 days) respectively. Six and two patients could be <b>weaned</b> from the <b>device</b> and nine and one patients respectively, died on the device. Two patients in group B underwent successful heart transplantation and four patients in group A died after weaning. Two patients in the postcardiotomy group and four patients in group B survived (13 % and 80 %) with an overall survival and discharge rate of 30 %. CONCLUSION: Although sample sizes are small, better survival rates with emergency Abiomed BVS 5000 implantation were obtained in the non postcardiotomy group (group B). For patients in the postcardiotomy group, outcome was negatively influenced by cardiac arrest and resuscitation before urgent CABG. Since death is the only alternative for these patients in cardiogenic shock and organ recovery cannot be predicted, we continue to consider emergency VAD implantation in this patient populatio...|$|R
