5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-Medieval painter.|$|E

This issue is anticlimactic and fails to wring much emotion from the final battle between Captain Marvel and Iron Man." [...] Justin Partridge of Newsarama gave it a 3 and said, [...] "To summarize, Civil War II #8 was basically an episode of Whose Line Is It Anyway?: Everything was made up and the stakes didn't matter...

500|$|Non-Mormon reviewers praised {{either the}} author's research, the {{excellence}} of her literary style, or both. Newsweek called Brodie's book [...] "a definitive biography in the finest {{sense of the}} word," [...] and Time praised the author for her [...] "skill and scholarship and admirable detachment." [...] Other reviews were less positive. Brodie was especially annoyed by the review of novelist Vardis Fisher, who accused her of stating [...] "as indisputable facts <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be regarded as conjectures supported by doubtful evidence." [...] Bernard DeVoto wrote a mixed review, but he praised the biography as [...] "the best book about the Mormons so far published." [...] DeVoto, who believed Joseph Smith was [...] "paranoid," [...] said that Brodie had not provided adequate psychological explanations for Smith's behavior. Brodie also {{came to believe that}} a thorough psychological analysis of Smith was essential and that she [...] "hadn't gone far enough in this direction." ...|$|E
500|$|Dalrymple {{analyses}} {{the media}} attention and reaction to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, and how certain media interpreted a perceived lack of emotion {{on the part of}} the girl’s parents as evidence of guilt. Dalrymple writes that the [...] "demand that emotion should be shown in public, or be assumed not to exist and therefore indicate a guilty mind, is now not an uncommon one", and cites two similar cases involving Joanne Lees and Lindy Chamberlain. Dalrymple then analyses the outcry from the public and the media to the lack of emotion shown by the Queen after the death of Princess Diana, and contends that [...] "the tabloid newspapers carried out <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be called a campaign of bullying against the sovereign" [...] and that those gathered outside Buckingham Palace were [...] "bullying rather than expressing any genuine grief". He concludes by asserting that the sentimentality shown by both the media and the public “was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself".|$|E
500|$|Mark Bozon of IGN {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the game's dated graphics, found the overall gameplay very slow, and found the garbled voice work unsettling while enjoying the soundtrack. He concluded that, even as a fan of old school and abstract gameplay design, he had not enjoyed his time with the game. Lark Anderson, writing for GameSpot said there was [...] "never a dull moment" [...] due to the eccentric cast and story, and found the puzzle elements to be an entertaining challenge. His main complaints were the poor graphics, unresponsive camera system, lack of direction during navigation and the constant need for backtracking. Nintendo World Report's Nick DiMola noted the dialogue for its humor, but generally faulted most other aspects of the game; he called its graphics and sound low-quality, felt the gameplay was shallow, and found the puzzle solving segments a chore. He found it hard to recommend the title for any but dedicated fans of Suda's work. PALGN reviewer Ben Chev called the script [...] "well-written in <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be described as a typical Suda 51 style", and praised the music for its unique take on classical music. However he generally faulted the gameplay and called the graphics the worst he had seen for the DS.|$|E

500|$|Monteverdi is lauded {{by modern}} critics as [...] "the most {{significant}} composer in late Renaissance and early Baroque Italy"; [...] "one {{of the principal}} composers {{in the history of}} Western music"; and, routinely, as the first great opera composer. These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was largely unknown to the composers that followed him for three centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich and others have pointed out, the composers of the late 20th and 21st century that have identified with Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their own. Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by Monteverdi's reputation as [...] "a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority" [...] – although the composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, [...] "showing <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be described as an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for the purpose". In a letter dated 16 October 1633 Monteverdi appears to endorse the view of himself as a [...] "modern": [...] "I would rather be moderately praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary". However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but {{while at the same time}} protective of his status as a competent composer in the stile antico. Thus, says Chew, [...] "his achievement was both retrospective and progressive". Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing up much of the early Baroque. [...] "And in one respect in particular, his achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music." ...|$|E

Wittgenstein argues that language has an underlying logical structure, a structure that provides the limits of what can be said meaningfully. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: [...] "What we can say at all can be said clearly," [...] he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be. He wrote in the preface: [...] "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should {{have to be able to}} think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought)." ...|$|E
