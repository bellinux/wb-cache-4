The Lakers became the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> a 2–0 lead versus Phoenix. They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime. Following the season head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired.|$|E

Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a motorcade through Dallas to the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; the pictures were developed, but kept in storage until their publication in 2013.|$|E
5|$|At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, {{many of them}} {{bearing the}} republic's vierkleur ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue a restored, {{independent}} republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then—Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign.|$|E

5|$|Bradford City {{have spent}} two {{seasons in the}} Premier League. In 1999–2000, they avoided relegation with just 36 points, then a record low to stay up, after {{defeating}} Liverpool 1–0 in the final game with a headed goal from David Wetherall. The club have won promotion {{in a total of}} eight seasons and been relegated on ten occasions; three relegations in the previous seven seasons meant the 2007–08 season was their first in the fourth tier in 26 years. Bradford City have also played in European competition <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> one of England's two places in the Intertoto Cup in 2000.

5|$|From 872 to 877 {{there was}} {{apparently}} {{a period of}} calm, since the sources are silent on any military operations in Sicily.

The kings of the Aryacakravarti dynasty were historically patrons of literature and education. Temple schools and traditional gurukulam classes on verandahs (known as Thinnai Pallikoodam in Tamil) spread basic education in religion and in languages such as Tamil and Sanskrit to the upper classes. The Portuguese introduced western-style education after their conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619. The Jesuits opened churches and seminaries, but the Dutch destroyed them and opened their own schools attached to Dutch Reformed churches <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> over Tamil-speaking regions of Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|The club {{have only}} reached the rounds proper of the FA Trophy on four occasions, {{the first round}} in 1977–78 and 1990–91, and the second round in 1982–83, where they were beaten 0–3 by Altrincham after taking them to a replay, and in 1989–90, when they were beaten 0–2 by Bath City. They have twice reached {{the third round of}} the FA Amateur Cup, the first in 1969–70 when they were beaten 0–4 by St Albans City, and the second the {{following}} year in 1970–71 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> Skelmersdale United to a replay and were beaten 0–1.

5|$|The {{first of}} the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in Romania in 1959. The oldest of the International Science Olympiads, the IMO has since been held annually, except in 1980. That year the {{competition}} initially planned to hold in Mongolia was canceled due to soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Because the competition was initially founded for Eastern European countries participating in the Warsaw Pact, {{under the influence of}} the Eastern Bloc, the earlier IMOs were hosted only in Eastern European countries, gradually spreading to other nations.

5|$|On 8 August 1918, the Allies {{launched}} their Hundred Days Offensive. During the fighting around Amiens, the battalion {{was responsible for}} capturing 200 prisoners {{as well as a}} number of machine guns and artillery pieces. They remained in the line throughout August and September, undertaking further attacks at Biaches and Mont St Quentin. Casualties during this time were high and by the end of September 1918 the battalion's strength had fallen to 31 officers and 537 men. Their final engagement of the war came on the night of 3 October 1918, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> part in the Battle of Beaurevoir. During this battle, the battalion attacked around Prospect Hill, suffering 67 casualties. The following night they crossed the Estrees Road and took up position northeast of Estrees to support the 6th Brigade which was attacking positions beyond Beaurevoir.|$|E
5|$|Porto first {{participated in}} {{international}} club competitions in 1956, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> {{part in the}} second edition of the European Cup. Qualification for this competition – contested between Europe's national champions – was achieved after Porto secured their fourth Primeira Divisão title in the previous season. Their debut was in a preliminary round tie against Spanish champions Atlético Bilbao. At their new home ground, the Estádio das Antas, Porto lost the first match 2–1 and were eliminated a week later in Bilbao, after a 3–2 defeat. Porto returned to this tournament two years later but fell at the same stage. After three seasons without qualifying for European competitions, Porto finished the 1961–62 league as runners-up and entered the non-UEFA-affiliated Inter-Cities Fairs Cup {{for the first time}} in 1962–63. They were knocked out in the first round by Dinamo Zagreb, who secured a draw in Yugoslavia after winning in Portugal. Porto returned to the Fairs Cup in the following season, but failed to advance past the first round.|$|E
5|$|The battalion's next {{engagement}} came on 26 March 1917 {{when they}} undertook {{an attack on}} Lagnicourt, during which they lost 11 killed and 29 wounded. The 27th Battalion did not undertake a major engagement until 20 September <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> part in the Battle of Menin Road, which resulted in success for the Australians. During the battle, they were committed to the fighting {{as part of the}} first wave which routed the German forces. Advancing under a cover of artillery and machine gun fire, the battalion captured a section of the German line known as the 'Blue Line' between Polygon Wood and a position known as the Iron Cross Redoubt. Later, they successfully took part in the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October, which was their last major offensive action in 1917.|$|E

5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot {{made her}} way to the village of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken to one of the bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run from the top of the masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Fifth Army's advance up the Liri valley, the Māori Battalion's {{next major}} {{engagement}} came in early 1944 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> part in the fighting around Monte Cassino. The position at Cassino was dominated by an historic Benedictine monastery. Throughout January the Allies continued their advance, but as they were checked by the German positions at Cassino the advance stalled. On the night of 17/18 February 1944, {{as part of an}} attempt to establish a bridgehead into the German lines, the Māoris were tasked with attacking the railway station in Cassino. They met very stiff resistance, and although they managed to reach the railway station they were unable to wrest control of it from its defenders. Lacking armoured support, which had failed to arrive, they fought through the morning and into the afternoon, but when their position was assaulted by two German tanks they were forced to withdraw. The two assaulting companies, 'A' and 'B', suffered over 60 per cent casualties, losing 128 men killed or wounded. In March they were again involved in fighting around Cassino, however, it was not until May that the position was eventually captured, by which time the New Zealanders had been withdrawn from the line, and transferred back to the Eighth Army.|$|E
5|$|When it opened, {{the station}} {{had a single}} platform, {{on the west side}} of the track. Road access was through a large {{forecourt}} to the west from Clanage Road / Rownham Hill, now the A369. There was a two-storey building facing the road, the ground floor of which had a single long room, partitioned into a waiting room, booking office and station master's office. The ground floor also housed a coal-fired boiler and washing facilities, while upstairs was spacious living accommodation accessed by a private staircase. A single north-facing bay platform for goods vans was at the north end of the station. The station was noted as having an excellent garden alongside the platform. The nearby Rownham Ferry allowed passengers to cross the river to Hotwells and Clifton. Services on the Portishead railway were operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, with six trains per day in each direction on weekdays and one on Sundays. The operation of these transferred to the Great Western in 1876, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> over the Bristol and Exeter, and in 1884 the Great Western took ownership of the Bristol and Portishead. The station was visited by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1878.|$|E
