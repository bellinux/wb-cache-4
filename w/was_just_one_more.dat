25|$|In one {{instance}} of DRM {{that caused a}} rift with consumers, Amazon.com in July 2009, remotely deleted purchased copies of George Orwell's Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) from customers' Amazon Kindles after providing them a refund for the purchased products. Commentors have described these actions as Orwellian and have compared Amazon to Big Brother from Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. After Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos issued a public apology, the Free Software Foundation wrote that this <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> example of the excessive power Amazon has to remotely censor what people read through its software, and called upon Amazon to free its e-book reader and drop DRM. Amazon then revealed the reason behind its deletion: the e-books in question were unauthorized reproductions of Orwell's works, which were not within the public domain and to which the company that published and sold them on Amazon's service had no rights.|$|E

2500|$|Ali {{opened the}} fight moving and scoring with right crosses to Foreman's head. Then, {{beginning}} in the second round—and {{to the consternation of}} his corner—Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the [...] "Rope-a-dope", so violated conventional boxing wisdom—letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will—that at ringside writer George Plimpton thought the fight had to be fixed. Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. In reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: [...] "I thought Ali <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: 'That all you got, George?' I realized that this ain't what I thought it was." ...|$|E

This <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> sign of how tightly the fortunes of Seir Kieran and Offaly had converged.

5000|$|The 19th {{century was}} also a time when [...] "scientific racism" [...] flourished.

Such claims were later proven false, but this <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> obstacle for the blacks in London to hurdle over. The late 19th century effectively ended the first period of black immigration to London in notable numbers to Britain. This decline in immigration gave way to the gradual incorporation of blacks and their descendants into this overwhelmingly white society.|$|E

Rudolph had bested Grigorian seven years earlier at the 1991 World Amateur Boxing Championship finals. Grigorian avenged his amateur defeat by stopping Rudolph {{in the sixth}} round.

Artur <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> defense away from becoming the longest reigning lightweight champion, but ultimately lost his belt to Acelino Freitas by unanimous decision on 3 January 2004.
