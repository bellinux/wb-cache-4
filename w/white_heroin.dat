During this period of intense grief, he began abusing alcohol, cocaine, and other drugs. He eventually became addicted to alcohol and cocaine. He reached his darkest moment with substance abuse while touring in London for The Fragile, when he mistakenly purchased china <b>white</b> <b>heroin,</b> which he believed to be cocaine; he consequently overdosed and was resuscitated at a local hospital.|$|E

5000|$|One night, Kane accidentally {{drops and}} breaks open {{one of the}} dolls, exposing a <b>white</b> dust (<b>heroin)</b> {{contained}} therein. As it turns out, Braden uses the doll gallery as a front for his drug-smuggling business. He tries to strike a deal with Caifano (Mario Gallo), a mob boss, but Caifano and Braden cannot find common ground and eventually engage in a turf war. Braden, as a silver [...] "demon"-masked ninja, assassinates Caifano's informers and relatives to make him cower down. The police are confused about the killings, and local police martial arts trainer and expert, Dave Hatcher (Keith Vitali), is assigned to find a consultant. Dave persuades Cho to see his boss and Cho attests that only a ninja could commit these crimes, but refuses to aid the police any further.|$|R

Rich and Curt inquire as to how Art did not feel the need to become involved in any group during prison, and what landed him in jail in the first place. Art reveals that he was in for attempted murder of a woman's husband, stating simply [...] "I guess girls are my main weakness." [...] Pandora's friend and coworker Mamma Too Tight arrives.

50|$|Drugs expert Dr Adam Winstock has {{questioned}} whether the drug dealer wasn't murdering the buyers on purpose, instead. He also mentions that the street price of <b>white</b> <b>heroin</b> is three times the price of cocaine, which makes the scenario of a drug dealer, a person driven by the desire of profit, very unlikely to have accidentally substituted heroin for cocaine once, and much less so multiple times {{for more than two}} months.|$|E

J.J. has a problem with Tony, a <b>white</b> gangster, trafficking <b>heroin</b> into a predominantly black community. The drugs have been negatively affecting the kids and adults because many of them become addicted. He talks to a man called Diablo (Damu King) about taking care of securing the neighborhood from Tony’s men and any other drug dealer pushing in the territory.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Detoxification often {{serves as}} an initial contact for {{treatment}} and represents an opportunity for engaging patients in aftercare to prevent relapse. However, there is limited information concerning clinical profiles of individuals seeking detoxification, {{and the opportunity to}} engage patients in detoxification for aftercare often is missed. This study examined clinical profiles of a geographically diverse sample of opioid-dependent adults in detoxification to discern the treatment needs {{of a growing number of}} women and whites with opioid addiction and to inform interventions aimed at improving use of aftercare or rehabilitation. METHODS: The sample included 343 opioid-dependent patients enrolled in two national multi-site studies of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN 001 - 002). Patients were recruited from 12 addiction treatment programs across the nation. Gender and racial/ethnic differences in addiction severity, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk, and quality of life were examined. RESULTS: Women and whites were more likely than men and African Americans to have greater psychiatric and family/social relationship problems and report poorer health-related quality of life and functioning. Whites and Hispanics exhibited higher levels of total HIV risk scores and risky injection drug use scores than African Americans, and Hispanics showed a higher level of unprotected sexual behaviors than whites. African Americans were more likely than <b>whites</b> to use <b>heroin</b> and cocaine and to have more severe alcohol and employment problems. CONCLUSIONS: Women and whites show more psychopathology than men and African Americans. These results highlight the need to monitor an increased trend of opioid addiction among women and whites and to develop effective combined psychosocial and pharmacologic treatments to meet the diverse needs of the expanding opioid-abusing population. Elevated levels of HIV risk behaviors among Hispanics and whites also warrant more research to delineate mechanisms and to reduce their risky behaviors...|$|R

5000|$|Under Pulawa's {{leadership}} The Company {{extended a}} firm hold over the criminal rackets on the island, often resorting to extreme violence when necessary.

The Company was able to exert some of its criminal control into Hawaiian communities on the mainland, mainly in Nevada and California. The syndicate made connections with figures in the American mafia, but in some other cases also had a rivalry with some of them. Rumor has it that when once two mob members active in Las Vegas were sent to Hawaii to teach a local Hawaiian gang leader a lesson for muscling in on illegal gambling rackets in Nevada, The Company killed the two mob thugs and returned their chopped up bodies to the mainland {{in the back of a}} trunk with a note attached: [...] "Delicious, send more." ...|$|E
40|$|The present article {{documents}} {{an authentic}} process of heroin manufacturing in Afghanistan: <b>white</b> <b>heroin</b> hydrochloride produced using simple equipment {{and a small}} quantity of chemicals. The quantities of chemicals actually used corres-ponded to the minimum needed for manufacturing heroin. The only organic solvent used was acetone, and {{only a very small}} quantity of it was used. Because the chemicals used in the demonstration were from actual seizures in Afghanistan, some of the chemicals had been disguised or repackaged by smugglers. Others had been put into labelled containers that proved to be counter-feit, and some glass containers used were not the original containers of the manufacturer displayed on the label. The brown heroin base prepared as an intermediate step in the process shares some of the characteristics of the South-West Asia type of heroin preparations often seized in Germany. The final product of the documented heroin manufactur-ing process was <b>white</b> <b>heroin</b> hydrochloride, which shares the key characteristics of the <b>white</b> <b>heroin</b> occasionally seized in Germany and other countries in Western Europe since 2000.
