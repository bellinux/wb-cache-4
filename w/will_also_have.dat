5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E

40|$|An {{image is}} {{represented}} {{as a collection of}} pixels that make up the composition of the matrix. At each pixel stored color information. Image is consists of a collection of color such as a palette, each color in the palette has a unique number for each color. That color information will be used to represent an image. Each pixel stores the value for each of red green blue. Range of colors used is 8 bits, so the image that save with 24 bit is image with the true color, that is color range between 0 to 255. An image <b>also</b> <b>has</b> a size of dimension / resolution in visualization given by the width x height. Resolution is how much pixel that contain in a picture. Much more resolution that the picture has means that this picture <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> a bigger pixel, so the picture will look softer in a visualization manner. However, much more resolution that a picture has means that this picture <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> a big size...|$|R

5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
