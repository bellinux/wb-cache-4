5|$|A small example {{excavated}} {{from underneath}} the Late Preclassic levels of Structure E3-1 at Chalchuapa in El Salvador may date to the Middle Preclassic. Three potbelly monuments were found resting on a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador, a site near Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms. These monuments <b>were</b> <b>large</b> and especially obese. Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 were important in securely dating the potbelly style of sculpture. The El Salvador potbellies conform to the Monte Alto style of boulder sculpture.|$|E
25|$|If {{a number}} is the {{successor}} of another number, {{then the first}} number is said to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> than the other number. If a number <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than another number, and if the other number <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than a third number, then the first number <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> than the third number.

But six <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than five, therefore six <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> than three.

5|$|Company towns {{were once}} common in British Columbia. Many <b>were</b> <b>large,</b> but never had {{municipal}} government and were largely located on company-owned land. A few such as Granisle, Tumbler Ridge and Wells became municipalities, {{while others have}} become ghost towns. Among the largest were Anyox, Bralorne, Ocean Falls, Cassiar, Gold Harbour (Tasu) and Kitsault.|$|E
5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket). The eyes <b>were</b> <b>large</b> {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E

5|$|Gustav {{initially}} {{appeared as}} a significant threat to the Lesser Antilles, which was devastated by Hurricane Hugo about a year prior. As a result, several hurricane watches and warnings were issued on August 27, but all were discontinued later that day as Gustav turned northward. The only effects reported on the Lesser Antilles <b>were</b> <b>large</b> swells, light winds, and light rains. Following the passage of Gustav, no damage or fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts in Scotland are earthworks, {{sometimes}} with wooden or stone enclosures, built on higher ground, which usually include a significant settlement, built within the modern boundaries of Scotland. They were first {{studied in the}} eighteenth century and the first serious field research was undertaken in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century there <b>were</b> <b>large</b> numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites, with an emphasis on establishing a chronology of the forts. Forts have been classified by type and their military and ritual functions have been debated.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{elephants}} {{were considered}} formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour {{to protect their}} sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they <b>were</b> <b>large</b> enough.

5|$|In Egypt, there <b>were</b> <b>large</b> {{communities}} of Coptic Christians, Melkites, Turks, Armenians, and Black Africans—the latter two groups {{had a large}} presence in Upper Egypt. Under the Fatimids, non-Muslims in Egypt generally prospered, {{with the exception of}} Caliph al-Hakim's reign. However, with Shirkuh's ascendancy to the vizier position, a number edicts were enacted against the non-Muslim population. With the advent of the Syrian expeditionary force (consisting of Oghuz Turks and Kurds) into Egypt, waves of maltreatment of minorities occurred, irrespective of religion. These incidents occurred while Shirkuh and Saladin were viziers to the Fatimid caliph.|$|E
5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants <b>were</b> <b>large</b> farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E
5|$|Steel drums are a distinctively Trinidadian {{ensemble}} {{that evolved}} from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, bamboo tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by {{pieces of metal}} used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty-some tones. Steel bands <b>were</b> <b>large</b> orchestras of these drums, and were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched {{part of the culture}} of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

5|$|The Early Woodland {{period in}} Indiana came between 1000 BC and 200 AD and {{produced}} the Adena culture.

5|$|The Song navy was {{of great}} {{importance}} during the consolidation of the empire in the 10th century; during {{the war against the}} Southern Tang state the Song navy employed tactics such as defending large floating pontoon bridges across the Yangtze River in order to secure movements of troops and supplies. There <b>were</b> <b>large</b> ships in the Song navy that could carry 1,000 soldiers aboard their decks, while the swift-moving paddle-wheel craft were viewed as essential fighting ships in any successful naval battle.|$|E
5|$|The men at Boulogne {{formed the}} core for what Napoleon would later call La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men {{organized}} into seven corps, which <b>were</b> <b>large</b> field units that contained 36 to 40 cannon each and {{were capable of}} independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps (properly situated in a strong defensive position) could survive {{at least a day}} without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign.|$|E

The encyclopedia Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era was fully compiled in 729 by Gautama Siddha (fl. 8th century), an ethnic Indian astronomer, astrologer, and scholar born in the capital Chang'an.|$|E
5|$|A {{second letter}} {{arrived from the}} west, this time {{addressed}} to Cope. The writer, O. W. Lucas, was a naturalist who had been collecting plants near Cañon City, Colorado when he came upon an assortment of fossil bones. After receiving more samples from Lucas, Cope concluded the dinosaurs <b>were</b> <b>large</b> herbivores, gleefully noting that the specimen was larger than any other previously described, including Lakes' discovery. Hearing of Lucas' finds, Marsh instructed Mudge and a former student, Samuel Wendell Williston, {{to set up a}} quarry on his behalf near Cañon. Unfortunately for Marsh, he learned from Williston that Lucas was finding the best bones and refused to quit Cope to come work for Marsh. Marsh ordered Williston back to Morrison, where Marsh's small quarry collapsed and nearly killed his assistants. This setback would have dried up Marsh's bone supply from the west, if not for receipt of a third letter.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there <b>were</b> <b>large</b> outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E
