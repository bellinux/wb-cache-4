5|$|A secret brotherhood summons {{a dragon}} from its native dimension, {{so as to}} cause {{destruction}} and mayhem across the city of Ankh-Morpork. Rumours of the dragon's rampage across the city reaches Unseen University. Since the Archchancellor wishes the involvement {{of at least one}} wizard in the matter, Rincewind is summoned to handle the problem. After acquiring a book to learn <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> track the dragon to its lair, Rincewind searches the city for the various components needed to assemble a dragon detector and brings them back to the Archchancellor. After the Archancellor lets slip that the dragon's lair is stocked with gold, Rincewind snatches the dragon detector from him, searches the city, finds the lair, and takes all the gold within it. Just before he leaves, the dragon stops him and requests his aid in removing the brotherhood's hold upon her, claiming they are using her for evil and are planning to make her go on a major rampage.|$|E

25|$|The state, {{especially}} around {{the capital of}} Cuernavaca, has experienced a housing boom since the late 1990s. More than 10,000 houses were built from 2000 to 2008 and another 50,000 are planned through 2013. The state's office of urban development states that this is far above <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> house the state's population.

25|$|The grating {{fabrication}} {{challenge was}} eased {{by the discovery}} of a phase moiré effect which provides an all-phase-grating interferometer that works with compact sources, called the polychromatic far-field interferometer (see figure on the right). Phase gratings are easier to make when compared with the source and analyzer gratings mentioned above, since the grating depth required to cause phase shift is much less than <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> absorb x-rays. Phase gratings of 200 - 400 nanometer periods have been used to improve phase sensitivity in table-top PFI imagers. In PFI a phase grating is used to convert the fine interference fringes into a broad intensity pattern at a distal plane, based on the phase moiré effect. Besides higher sensitivity, another incentive for smaller grating periods is that the lateral coherence of the source needs to be at least one grating period.|$|E

25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, {{it may be a}} sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E

500|$|Learning that a hero with a million-to-one chance {{can stop}} it, Rincewind {{searches}} for the right components to be that hero, journeying across the city, the Disc, and even over the edge, to find the necessary items, including a sword that goes [...] "ting", a birthmark, and a magic spell.

Despite having <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> combat the dragon, Rincewind fails to stop it, and so seeks out an alternative method. Taking a swamp dragon called Mambo the 16th, and feeding him hot coals and a lit firecracker, Rincewind tries again, but Mambo stops working when he becomes infatuated with the dragon. Rincewind then throws a love custard tart at the dragon. The dragon falls in love with Mambo, and the two fly off to perform mating dances.
