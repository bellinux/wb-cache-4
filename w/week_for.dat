40|$|Summary The EORTC Breast Cancer Cooperative Group {{carried out}} a {{randomized}} trial to compare doxorubicin with epirubicin as secondline chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Two hundred and fifty-nine patients {{with at least one}} site of metastatic disease entered this trial, of whom 232 patients were eligible. Treatment consisted of doxorubicin 75 mg m- 2 or epirubicin 90 mg m- 2 i. v. every 3 weeks. The overall response rates for doxorubicin and epirubicin were 36 % and 28 % respectively (P = 0. 173). The median time to progression was 23 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> doxorubicin and 19 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> epirubicin (P = 0. 063) and the median duration of response was 40 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> doxorubicin and 32 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> epirubicin (P = 0. 059). The median survival was 47 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> doxorubicin and 44 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> epirubicin (P = 0. 196). Leucocyte count on retreatment day (P = 0. 011) and platelet nadir (P = 0. 031) were significantly lower in the doxorubicin-treated group. Also mucositis (P < 0. 001), diarrhoea (P = 0. 005) and haemorrhage (P = 0. 048) were significantly worse in the doxorubicin arm. Nin...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} 50 {{randomly}} selected South Glamorgan general practitioners was undertaken {{to determine how}} often they would treat and see patients with uncomplicated controlled essential hypertension. The decision to treat for high blood pressure depended {{on the level of}} diastolic pressure, patient age and sex, and interactions between diastolic pressure and age and diastolic pressure and sex. The range of responses for visit frequently was every two weeks to once yearly. On average, patients would be seen every 14. 8 weeks (standard deviation, 9. 2 weeks). The follow-up interval was significantly affected by level of pretreatment diastolic pressure (16 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> pressures 95 to 100 mmHg; 13. 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> pressures greater than 105 mmHg), the patient's age (13. 9 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> those 40 to 49 years old; 15. 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> those 60 to 65 years old), and the decision to treat for high blood pressure (13. 4 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> those treated; 17. 9 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> those not treated). If the variability of physician opinion observed in this study is reflected in practice patterns, then {{it is important to know}} whether these variations affect outcome. Follow-up intervals can be related to physician, patient, illness characteristics, and outcomes. Visit frequency is a useful variable for studying the process of care...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Lapatinib is an orally {{reversible}} inhibitor of epidermal {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) /human {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor 2 (HER- 2) tyrosine kinases with demonstrated activity in patients with HER- 2 -positive breast cancer. In the current phase III open-label trial, lapatinib was compared with hormone therapy (HT) in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that express EGFR and/or HER- 2. Patients and Methods Patients with advanced RCC who had experienced disease progression through first-line cytokine therapy-stratified by Karnofsky performance status and number of metastatic sites-were randomly assigned to lapatinib 1, 250 mg daily or HT. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points included overall survival (OS), safety, and biomarker analyses. Results Four hundred sixteen patients were enrolled onto the study. Median TTP was 15. 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> lapatinib versus 15. 4 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> HT (hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 94; P =. 60), and median OS was 46. 9 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> lapatinib versus 43. 1 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> HT (HR = 0. 88; P =. 29). In a biomarker analysis of patients with EGFR-overexpressed tumors (3 + by immunohistochemistry [IHC]; n = 241) median TTP was 15. 1 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> lapatinib versus 10. 9 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> HT (HR = 0. 76; P =. 06), and median OS was 46. 0 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> lapatinib versus 37. 9 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> HT (HR = 0. 69; P =. 02). These results were confirmed by Cox regression analysis. No unexpected toxicities were observed; the most commonly reported drug-related adverse events (all grades) for lapatinib were rash (44 %) and diarrhea (40 %). Conclusion Lapatinib was well tolerated with equivalent overall efficacy to HT in advanced RCC patients who had experienced disease progression while receiving cytokines, and the study supports that lapatinib prolonged OS relative to HT in patients with 3 + EGFR status determined by IHC...|$|R

40|$|Twenty six {{patients}} with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), {{who failed to}} achieve complete remission or had relapsed after conventional chemotherapy (CHOP or CHOP-Bleo) were treated with a four-drug combination of mitoxantrone, etoposide, cisplatin and prednisolone (MEPP). Of 24 patients evaluated, five (21 %) achieved complete remission and seven (29 %) responded partially. The median duration of remission was 25 <b>weeks,</b> 38 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> complete responders (CRs), 24 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> partial responders (PRs). The median survival time after initiation of therapy was 93 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> CRs, 50 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> PRs and 25 <b>weeks</b> <b>for</b> non-responders (NRs). The difference in survival time between CRs and NRs was statistically significant. Myelosuppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity; WBC nadir below 1, 000 /μl occurred in 66. 2 % of evaluable courses. Two {{patients with}} bone marrow involvement died of infection due to granulocytopenia. Renal toxicity of cisplatin was moderate {{and there was no}} cardiotoxicity of mitoxantrone detected. Despite severe myelotoxicity, these results indicate that MEPP regimen is useful as a salvage therapy for relapsed or refractory NHL...|$|R
