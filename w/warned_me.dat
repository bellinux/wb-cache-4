Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
500|$|Albert Bouchard {{began writing}} music for Imaginos {{following}} {{the release of}} the band's first album in 1972. There were plans as early as 1975 to release a concept album dedicated to Pearlman's scripts, but the material was not ready. All of the songs had been written by 1977, with the participation of various band members, and at least four of them ("Astronomy", [...] "In the Presence of Another World", [...] "I Am the One You <b>Warned</b> <b>Me</b> Of", [...] "Imaginos") were completed and demoed during the recording sessions for the album Spectres. Demos of the other tracks were recorded by A. Bouchard and remained in various stages of development during the following years, with the band uninterested in pursuing the Imaginos project that Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman had been insistently proposing.|$|E

500|$|Blue Öyster Cult {{interrupted}} their {{schedule of}} US shows only {{just before the}} album release in June 1988, to familiarize the band members with the new material. The 1987 formation with Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Rogers and Riddle remained the closest available to a full reunion, given J. Bouchard's unwillingness to participate and the opposition to A. Bouchard. The Imaginos Tour began in the East Coast of the US in July, and continued on {{to most of the}} States. The set lists were based mainly on old material and included only two or three songs from Imaginos, usually [...] "I Am the One You <b>Warned</b> <b>Me</b> Of", [...] "In the Presence of Another World" [...] and the new version of [...] "Astronomy". Blue Öyster Cult visited Canada in January 1989, France in February, the United Kingdom in March, and concluded their European tour in Germany in April.|$|E

She made her debut as the character Nancy Donovan in the December 10, 2009, episode [...] "Secret Santa", and later guest starred in the episode [...] "Winter Madness". In December 2009, it was confirmed that actress Elizabeth Banks would guest star, and in the February 11, 2010, episode [...] "Anna Howard Shaw Day" [...] she made her debut as Avery Jessup, a CNBC correspondent.

Keith Powell, who plays Toofer Spurlock, was asked about his reaction towards his storyline in the [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter" [...] script, in which he said [...] "They kind of <b>warned</b> <b>me</b> about that one – I thought it was a really fun thing because Affirmative Action has permeated corporate culture.

500|$|Several {{established}} {{actors were}} {{considered for the}} leading role of Rusty Sabich. Kevin Costner turned down the role, and Robert Redford was vetoed by Pollack due to his age. When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends <b>warned</b> <b>me</b> this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, all the action takes place around him. Things happen to him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There are many things I found I could express with that short haircut. Simplest of all, I wanted to tell the audience to leave their baggage at home — not to expect the Harrison Ford they've seen before." ...|$|E

Actress Jessie Wallace was cast in the role of Kat after the {{character}} was developed at an improvisation session for thirty actors and actresses earlier in the year.

Basically, Kat goes clubbing, steals other people's men and gets into fights. I love her. Everyone's <b>warned</b> <b>me</b> to expect a lot of stick in the street – Kat's such a full-on character.

Dan and Winnie co-authored a publication for schools by the Department of Education School Publications Branch, Writing in New Zealand: The New Zealand Novel (1956, parts 1, 2). Chris Laidlaw who used to drink with Dan in Oxford said there was [...] "an abiding sadness about Dan; a melancholy that sprang, I think, from his frustration at being a prophet without honour in his own country. ... He was an early victim of the great New Zealand clobbering machine and often <b>warned</b> <b>me</b> to beware of this."

2500|$|Before Andrea Martin {{accepted}} the role, director René Auberjonois (Odo) confided in her that {{working under the}} Ferengi prosthetics would be the hardest acting she'd ever done if she'd never worked under such makeup before. [...] Auberjonois speculated that she took the role anyway because he'd been so upfront with her. [...] Martin's makeup for Ishka took three hours every day. [...] Ishka, being older, required extra development of the makeup protheses. [...] Makeup designer Michael Westmore explained that they [...] "made a thin skin that went over one of [...] stock Ferengi heads [...] [...] They [...] made a new face for her, wrinkled, and did {{the backs of her}} hands." [...] The script for [...] "Family Business" [...] also complicated the makeup process because it called for Ishka to be nude in several scenes; therefore, makeup needed to be developed for parts of Ferengi never before seen. [...] One take over Ishka's shoulder had to be reshot because the producers felt that Martin's [...] "supple skin" [...] didn't match the character; Westmore and crew [...] "took Kleenex, wrinkled it up and rubberized it, and covered her back and shoulders", a process Martin didn't care for, saying, [...] "Boy, if you hadn't <b>warned</b> <b>me</b> about this, I would be out the door." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reportedly, Crumb filed {{a lawsuit}} to have his name removed from the film's credits. San Francisco {{copyright}} attorney Albert L. Morse said that no suit was filed, but an agreement was reached to remove Crumb's name from the credits. However, Crumb's name has remained in the final film since its original theatrical release. [...] In response to his distaste for the film, Crumb had [...] "Fritz the Cat—Superstar" [...] published in People's Comics later in 1972, in which a jealous girlfriend kills Fritz with an icepick; he has refused to use the character again. and wrote the filmmakers a letter saying not to use his characters in their films. [...] Crumb later cited [...] the film as [...] "one of those experiences I sort of block out. The last time I saw it was when I was making an appearance at a German art school in the mid-1980s, and I was forced to watch it with the students. It was an excruciating ordeal, a humiliating embarrassment.

2500|$|In 1974, he {{sold out}} the Pavilion Theatre {{in his home}} town. In 1975, the rapidity and extent of Connolly's {{breakthrough}} was used to secure him a booking on Britain's premier TV chat show, the BBC's Parkinson. Connolly {{made the most of}} the opportunity and, ignoring objections from his manager, told a bawdy joke about a man who had murdered his wife and buried her bottom-up so he'd have somewhere to park his bike. This ribald humour was unusually forthright on a primetime Saturday night on British television in the mid-1970s, and his appearance made a great impact. He became a good friend of the host, Michael Parkinson, and now holds the record for appearances on the programme, having been a guest on fifteen occasions. Referring to that debut appearance, he later said: [...] "That programme changed my entire life." [...] Parkinson, in the documentary Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years, stated that people still remember Connolly telling the punchline to the 'bike joke' three decades after that TV appearance. When asked about the material, Connolly stated, [...] "Yes, it was incredibly edgy for its time. My manager, on the way over, <b>warned</b> <b>me</b> not to do it, but it was a great joke and the interview was going so well, I thought, 'Oh, fuck that!!' I don't know where I got the courage in those days, but Michael did put confidence in me." [...] Connolly's UK success spread to other English-speaking countries: Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. [...] However, his broad Scottish accent and British cultural references made success in the US improbable.|$|E

He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease.

2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly <b>warned</b> <b>me</b> about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E
