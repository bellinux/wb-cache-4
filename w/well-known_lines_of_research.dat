In a first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> we investigate the automatic nature of individual appraisal variables such as goal conduciveness and coping potential.

40|$|Reference to space, {{especially}} with prepositions, plays {{a central role}} in natural language and is receiving more and more attention over the past decades.

To address the transfer issue in this paper, first we will summarize the evidence from two different <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>research.</b> The first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> is on literacy development in other (monolingual) contexts. This research helps us identify the universal versus language-specific factors of literacy development around the world.

Finally, after discussing these cognitive underpinnings of transfer, we will also relate these factors to their sociocultural contexts of development...|$|R

40|$|This {{working paper}} engages {{theoretically}} and empirically with the emerging field of civilizational analysis {{in international relations}} (IR). It divides the civilizational turn in IR into four developing <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> research: ‘civilizational dynamics’; ‘inter-civilizational ethics’; ‘deconstructing civilization/s’; and ‘civilizational constructions’. The paper argues that out <b>of</b> these four <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> ‘civilizational constructions’ appears {{to be not only}} the least developed but also a highly promising one. This <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> moves the ongoing debate beyond the current overwhelming focus on whether civilizations exist and matter, or not, in international relations. A ‘civilizational constructions’ <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> sheds instead much needed light on how emerging forms of civilizational-based thinking are contributing to socially and materially construct civilizations as meaningful entities in world politics by embedding them in new international practices and institutions. The empirical import of a ‘civilizational constructions’ <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> is offered in an analysis of American foreign policy. The case study explores how in the aftermath of 9 / 11, the “Muslim world” asserted itself not only as a civilizational strategic frame of reference in the consciousness of American policymakers, but also as a civilizational organizing principle of American foreign policy practices and institutions...|$|R
