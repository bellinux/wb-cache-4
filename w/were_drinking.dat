5|$|The Browns {{advanced}} to the AAFC championship in 1946, but {{a week before the}} game, Rymkus and teammates Jim Daniell and Mac Speedie were arrested and held for several hours after a confrontation with Cleveland police. The men <b>were</b> <b>drinking</b> as they waited to pick up Speedie's wife, who was coming on a plane from Utah. Daniell, who was driving the car the three men were in, honked at a police car that was blocking him, leading to an argument and the arrests. Rymkus and Speedie were charged with creating a disturbance and Daniell was charged with public intoxication. Daniell, the Browns' captain, was kicked off the team after the incident, but Rymkus and Speedie remained. The Browns {{went on to win the}} championship the following week, and Rymkus was named to a combined all-AAFC and NFL team.|$|E

5000|$|Suppose {{everyone}} <b>is</b> <b>drinking.</b> For {{any particular}} person, it cannot {{be wrong to}} say that if that particular person <b>is</b> <b>drinking,</b> then everyone in the pub <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> — because everyone <b>is</b> <b>drinking.</b> Because everyone <b>is</b> <b>drinking,</b> then that one person must drink because when that person drinks everybody drinks, everybody includes that person.|$|R

5000|$|So as it {{was applied}} here, the {{statement}} [...] "if he <b>is</b> <b>drinking,</b> everyone <b>is</b> drinking" [...] was taken to be correct in one case, if everyone <b>was</b> <b>drinking,</b> {{and in the other}} case, if he <b>was</b> not <b>drinking</b> — even though his drinking may not have {{had anything to do with}} anyone else's drinking.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the beakers were designed for the consumption of alcohol, and that the introduction of the substance to Europe may have fuelled the beakers' spread. Beer and mead content have been identified from certain examples. However, not all Beakers <b>were</b> <b>drinking</b> cups. Some were used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores, others have some organic residues associated with food, and still others were employed as funerary urns.

50|$|Alcohol {{expectations}} {{can operate}} {{in the absence of}} actual consumption of alcohol. Research in the United States over a period of decades has shown that men tend to become more sexually aroused when they think they have <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> alcohol, — even when they have not <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> it. Women report feeling more sexually aroused when they falsely believe the beverages they have <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> contained alcohol (although one measure of their physiological arousal shows that they became less aroused).|$|R

25|$|Absinthe's {{popularity}} grew steadily {{through the}} 1840s, when absinthe {{was given to}} French troops as a malaria preventive. When the troops returned home, they brought their taste for absinthe home with them. The custom of drinking absinthe gradually became so popular in bars, bistros, cafés, and cabarets that, by the 1860s, the hour of 5p.m. was called l'heure verte ("the green hour"). Absinthe was favoured by all social classes, from the wealthy bourgeoisie, to poor artists and ordinary working-class people. By the 1880s, mass production had caused the price of absinthe to drop sharply. By 1910, the French <b>were</b> <b>drinking</b> 36million litres of absinthe per year, as compared to their annual consumption of almost 5billion litres of wine.|$|E

25|$|Six of the Cázares men, Rodolfo Cázares Garza, Manuel Alberto Cázares Garza, Héctor Cázares Garza, Rodolfo Ignacio Cázares Solís, Rubén Luna Mendoza, and Rodolfo Garza Solís, {{were kept}} together. The women and children, {{along with one}} of the grandfathers, were kept in a {{separate}} vehicle throughout most of the first day. After leaving the house, the captors drove them around the city for several hours and switched them into different vehicles on busy streets in broad daylight. The kidnappers drove several of the vehicles they took from the family's homes. According to one family member, the kidnappers even stopped for gas and did not pay for the service. In their portable radio conversations while driving, the family heard them speaking about avoiding Los Zetas, the rival crime syndicate of the Gulf Cartel. That evening, the women were taken to a hostage safe house where at least twenty other men <b>were</b> <b>drinking</b> and smoking cannabis. The windows in this disclosed location were covered. A shootout broke out near the premises and the victims were transported to another location in another SUV (while in the vehicle, the family was blindfolded and placed next to a corpse). The Cázares had the impression that they kidnappers were looking where to hide their victims. The family believes that the kidnappers moved them around Matamoros for hours because they did not expect to find {{a lot of people in}} the houses where they carried out the abductions.|$|E
