5|$|In the <b>whaleboat,</b> Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor. The boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
5|$|The <b>whaleboat</b> {{managed to}} {{rendezvous}} with Catalpa the following day, which then {{headed out to}} sea. They were chased by the steamship SS Georgette, which had been commandeered by the colonial governor. Though Georgette {{caught up with the}} whaler on 19 April, Catalpa master claimed they were in international waters, and that an attack on Catalpa would be considered an act of war against the United States. Not wanting to cause a diplomatic incident, Georgette allowed Catalpa to flee.|$|E
50|$|Whaleships {{had two or}} more <b>whaleboats,</b> open {{rowing boats}} used in the capture of whales. <b>Whaleboats</b> brought the {{captured}} whales to the whaleships to be flensed or cut up. Here the blubber was rendered into oil using two or three try-pots set in a brick furnace called the tryworks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Whaleboats</b> became {{prevalent}} in ancient Inuit and Yupik culture when trade {{and other forms}} of nutrition were sparse. <b>Whaleboats</b> gave them a means of travelling to distant places in order to obtain resources. Natives had to gather sustenance, generally large game such as whales, when at all possible, from the sea. <b>Whaleboats</b> were not always taken out to sea to hunt whales, but they could also be used to transport dead whales that they had scavenged from the shallow waters. <b>Whaleboats</b> used in whaling had a stout post mounted on the aft deck, around which the steersman would cinch the rope once the whale had been harpooned, and by which the whale would drag the boat until it was killed. Large baleen and bow heads whales became their main export to Europe and the Americas, which in turn would help in revitalizing the trade in their region, an area that ranged from the Bering-Chukchi Sea to eastern Arctic.|$|R
5|$|They are {{relatively}} slow swimmers, allowing whalers {{to catch up}} to them in their <b>whaleboats.</b>|$|R
5|$|Tragedy did strike Marblehead {{though in}} November 1942. As her <b>whaleboat</b> was being hoisted back aboard, a sailor from her landing party fell {{overboard}} {{and failed to}} ever resurface. The sailor had a newly issued style of life vest on that required being inflated by mouth. This incident brought Captain Chandler to order that Omahas boarding party's return to wearing the older style life jackets that had proven themselves effective {{even though they were}} more cumbersome and bulky.|$|E
5|$|At sunrise on 25 July 1953 New Jersey {{was off the}} key port, {{rail and}} {{communications}} center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factory area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a <b>whaleboat</b> {{in an attempt to}} spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness she could not see the results of her six-gun salvo.|$|E
5|$|During the Philippine–American War, Yorktown {{stood in}} to Baler Bay, {{on the west}} coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish {{garrison}} that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's <b>whaleboat</b> provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river's mouth and out of sight of Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted signalman, made it back to the ship.|$|E
5000|$|On July 12, 1775, Colonel John Greaton with a {{detachment}} of 500 American soldiers, in 65 <b>whaleboats,</b> raided Long Island where they [...] "liberated" [...] all the sheep and cattle grazing there, and captured 17 British sailors who were guarding the animals. British men-of-war, when alerted about the raid, {{fired at the}} <b>whaleboats.</b> A British schooner, towing barges loaded with armed marines, chased the American <b>whaleboats</b> back to their encampment in Squantum and Dorchester. One American soldier was killed on Moon Island. Moon Island was not connected to Squantum at this time and a waterway was open from behind Squantum (Squaw Rock) across {{the mouth of the}} Neponset River to a large rock called Savin Hill.|$|R

5|$|It {{was while}} {{operating}} off the Iberian Peninsula that Collier devised {{a need for}} an improved type of ships' boat. He developed a design based on elements of both a <b>whaleboat</b> and a jolly boat, and had one built for him at Plymouth Dockyard. The boat proved extremely useful after tests aboard the Surveillante, especially at being able to land safely on a flat beach to give close support. Collier further modified it by installing a howitzer in the bows, and soon boats of its type were being requested by other captains for their ships. In 1813 Collier succeeded Sir Home Popham in commanding the north coast squadron, Spain. He and a small squadron supported General Arthur Wellesley and General Sir Thomas Graham in the capture of San Sebastián and the siege of Bayonne.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Taleba Bay {{force on}} Stuart {{transferred}} to Tieryo, a ship's launch and a ship's <b>whaleboat,</b> and was ashore by 03:30 on 23 October. They captured a Japanese machine gun position at about 06:00. Two platoons went south {{where they were}} engaged by Japanese forces. The Japanese were driven beyond Niubulu Creek, but a heavy Japanese counterattack from the north at 09:00 inflicted casualties on the Australians and forced them {{to withdraw from the}} area. Gategood broke radio silence and attempted to contact Arnold on the 108 set, but was unable to reach him. After this, they came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire, which inflicted heavy casualties. Having lost six men killed and ten wounded, with three more posted as missing, the Australians were forced to fall back under pressure from the pursuing Japanese. Lieutenant Clifford Hoskings would later receive the Military Cross for silencing a Japanese machine gun in the ensuing fighting. Faced with being overrun, Gategood withdrew his force even further, at first back to Taleba Bay, and then to Mud Bay aboard Stuart, arriving on 24 October.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>whaleboat</b> again {{made for}} the ship a police cutter with 30 to 40 armed men was spotted. The two boats raced to reach the Catalpa first, with the <b>whaleboat</b> winning, and the men {{climbing}} aboard as the police cutter passed by. The cutter turned, lingered briefly beside the Catalpa, and then headed to shore.|$|E

25|$|Explorer had two 1,500-U.S.-gallon (1,249- Imperial-gallon; 5,678-liter) tanks for {{gasoline}} and diesel oil for the fleet of 16 boats she operated, consisting of four 30-foot (9.1-meter) heavy launches powered by 30-hp (22.4-Kw) diesel engines and outfitted for hydrographic surveying, two additional launches carried on heavy davits, two 24-foot (7.3-meter) <b>whaleboats</b> powered by gasoline engines, two non-magnetic <b>whaleboats,</b> and six 16- and 20-foot (4.9- and 6.1-meter) skiffs and dories. She {{also had a}} 5-ton magazine for the storage of explosives used in radio acoustic ranging operations.|$|R
2500|$|Navigating {{equipment}} included Sperry gyrocompass and autopilot, {{radio range}} finder and a fathometer. Velero III carried two [...] steel motor <b>whaleboats</b> and two [...] wooden fishing and shore boats.|$|R
25|$|The {{minesweeping}} operation, {{carried out}} without specialized equipment, involved two steam launches and two whaleboats from Marblehead and Dolphin. A launch and <b>whaleboat</b> side by side, {{connected to the}} other launch and <b>whaleboat</b> by a rope with a chain drag in the center, swept the channel. When the drag met an obstruction, the boats came together and crossed {{the ends of the}} drag. The boats were then hauled carefully up to the mine, which was brought to the surface and disarmed. Twice the drag brought up two mines together.|$|E
25|$|During the lull between attacks he commandeered a motor <b>whaleboat</b> {{and began}} picking up {{survivors}} from Arizona and other {{ships in the}} harbor. The first person his boat pulled from the water was the Petty Officer in Charge of the Number Four turret on Arizona. Jack did not recognize him as {{he looked like a}} seal, black with oil head to toe.|$|E
25|$|The Hibbard-Swenson Company diesel {{auxiliary}} schooner Kamchatka (formerly the whaling bark Thrasher) {{was lost}} to fire in the Bering Sea April 14, 1921. The crew, including Swenson, escaped without loss of life and reached Alaska in a motor launch and a <b>whaleboat.</b> They had no water and subsisted on wieners and oranges from the cargo, running the launch's engine on distillate {{due to a lack}} of gasoline.|$|E

50|$|Four {{days after}} leaving Nantucket {{the ship was}} struck by a sudden storm and {{suffered}} a knockdown, having been rolled almost ninety degrees onto her side. Two of the ship’s <b>whaleboats</b> were lost and another was damaged. This mishap was caused in part by miscalculations on the part of Pollard and his officers, and in part by the inexperience of the crew. Pollard declared the damage was so extensive that they should return to Nantucket for repairs, but Chase and Joy persuaded him to go forward to the Azores and hope to replace the <b>whaleboats</b> there.|$|R
25|$|To {{compound}} the confusion, a second Avenger arrived and, thinking the wreckage {{on the water}} was a surfaced submarine, strafed it. Vigilance launched her motor <b>whaleboat</b> at 0051 {{and picked up a}} survivor who had remained alive despite the crash, explosion, and machine-gun fire. Vigilance continued the search for other survivors but found none. At 0524, the minesweeper was ordered to transfer the wounded man to hospital facilities ashore.|$|E
25|$|The Pequod gams {{next with}} the Bachelor, a Nantucket ship heading home full of sperm oil. Every now and then, the Pequod lowers for whales with success. On {{one of those}} nights in the <b>whaleboat,</b> Fedallah prophesies that neither hearse nor coffin can be Ahab's, that before he dies, Ahab must see two hearses — one not made by mortal hands and the other made of American wood — that Fedallah will precede his captain in death, and finally that only hemp can kill Ahab.|$|E
25|$|Sailing on 3 August for Okinawa, West Virginia reached Buckner Bay on 6 August—the day Little Boy, {{the first}} atomic bomb, was {{dropped on the}} city of Hiroshima. At 9:15pm on 10 August, West Virginia picked up a radio report that the Japanese {{government}} agreed to surrender {{under the terms of}} the Potsdam Declaration if its people could keep the Emperor of Japan as their ruler. Although the ships in the bay soon began celebrating, on 12 August Pennsylvania was torpedoed; West Virginia sent a <b>whaleboat</b> the next day with pumps for the damaged ship.|$|E
25|$|Hunting for {{sperm whales}} {{during this period}} was a {{notoriously}} dangerous affair for the crews of the 19th-century <b>whaleboats.</b> Although a properly harpooned sperm whale generally exhibited a fairly consistent pattern of attempting to flee underwater {{to the point of}} exhaustion (at which point it would surface and offer no further resistance), it was not uncommon for bull whales to become enraged and turn to attack pursuing <b>whaleboats</b> on the surface, particularly if it had already been wounded by repeated harpooning attempts. A commonly reported tactic was for the whale to invert itself and violently thrash {{the surface of the water}} with its , flipping and crushing nearby boats.|$|R
2500|$|The next day, Diligent {{sent two}} boats in {{to cut off}} some rebel <b>whaleboats</b> that had landed at Loyds Neck. [...] and Raven also sent in boats. However, an American galley fired on the boats, which withdrew.|$|R
50|$|After a whale rammed {{and sank}} the whaler Essex of Nantucket on 20 November 1820, the {{survivors}} were left floating in three small <b>whaleboats.</b> They eventually resorted, by common consent, to cannibalism to allow some to survive.|$|R
25|$|Carrington {{inspected}} {{the area around}} Moturoa, then set out by <b>whaleboat</b> to examine Waitara, rowing 5km up the Waitara River. He returned to Wellington, determined to examine sites in the South Island before making a final decision. Barrett guided the Brougham around barren areas near Nelson, highlighting swampy areas that would be unsuited to settlement. Biographer Angela Caughey claimed Barrett's choice of locations to show Carrington {{was part of a}} strategy, motivated by self-interest, to discourage the surveyor from siting New Plymouth in that area instead of Taranaki. On 26 January Carrington informed Wakefield that despite his reservations, he had opted to site his town at Ngamotu.|$|E
25|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, then-Lieutenant Arnold {{made his way}} to Pearl Harbor under fire. After quite a bit of trouble convincing the crew of a <b>whaleboat</b> to take him to Ford Island, his normal duty station, he finally got to the island. There, {{during the middle of the}} first wave’s attack, he fired up the only flyable Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter on the island. A ground crew member crawled up on the wing telling him, “You can’t take this airplane!” “The heck I can’t, get off my wing!” Arnold replied. “But it doesn’t have any ammunition!” came the response.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of the jolly boat was developed further during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, particularly by the frigate commander Sir George Collier. Collier, who {{was active in the}} close blockade of the Spanish coast during the Peninsular War, combined the features of a jolly boat with those of a <b>whaleboat</b> and found the result extremely seaworthy and particularly effective in carrying out shore landings. The design was particularly buoyant and was often described as a type of lifeboat. Several captains ordered these boats for their own ships, while the Admiralty considered the possibility of ordering a general replacement of old-style jolly boats with the new 'lifeboat' design on several occasions, but were deterred by the cost. By 1815 however the Stores Committee had authorised the replacement of the old-style jolly boats with the improved versions as and when it proved practical for a ship's commander to carry this out.|$|E
50|$|U.S. Navy support also {{included}} a Landing Ship Tank (LST) of 1,051 LSTs built during the war, the destroyer USS Saufley, and smaller vessels such as landing craft and motor <b>whaleboats</b> from nearby Naval Station Key West.|$|R
