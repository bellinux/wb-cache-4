Alternatively, Turner writes that, unknown to Epstein, arrangements had been made between Ramon Ramos and Vic Lewis for the Beatles to spend the night on the yacht, since that presented a better security option than a city hotel. Aspinall, who had arrived at the marina with the Beatles' hand luggage while they <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bay, said that their abduction was carried out by a militia gang who were rivals of the individuals presenting the upcoming concerts.|$|E

Marcelle died of meningitis at age two. It is rumored that Piaf slept with a man to pay for Marcelle's funeral.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} the crew <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} ice during the night when a break-up of the pack occurred. When morning came, the group, consisting of Tyson, Meyer, six of the seamen, the cook, the steward, {{and all of the}} Inuit, found themselves stranded on an ice floe. The castaways could see the Polaris [...] away, but attempts to attract the ship's attention with a large black cloth were futile. Resigned to the ice, the Inuit soon had igloo shelters built, and Tyson estimated that they had [...] of food. They also had the ship's two whaleboats, and two kayaks, although one kayak was soon lost during a breakup of the ice. Meyer reckoned that they were drifting on the Greenland side of the Davis Strait and would soon be within rowing distance of Disko. He was incorrect; the men were actually on the Canadian side of the strait. The error caused the men to reject Tyson's plans for conserving. The seamen soon broke up one of the whaleboats for firewood, making a safe escape to land very unlikely. One night in November, the men went on an eating binge, consuming a large quantity of the food stores. The group drifted on the ice floe {{for the next six months}} over [...] before being rescued off the coast of Newfoundland by the sealer Tigress on April 30, 1873. All probably would have perished had the group not included the skilled Inuit hunters Ebierbing and Hendrik, who were able to kill seal on a number of occasions. Despite this, scarcely a word was written about the Inuit in either the official reports of the expedition, or the press.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{occurrence}} of World War I, the Gibson Girl transformed into the Flapper, which dominated {{the period of the}} “Roaring Twenties”. Women transitioned towards androgynous looks, whereby hairstyles were kept short, and wore brassieres that flatten the chest. Loose clothing was also a trend, as it downplayed the waist by lowering it below the navel, resulting in a straight boyish figure. Dress senses soon become more casual as well, and {{is said to have been}} a representation of the reduction in social or political tension after the war, or an extensive disagreement with the Prohibition movement. With advertisements increasingly advocating the need to achieve a thinner frame, many women therefore pursued diets and exercises. Although slimmer body types were favoured, a sporty and healthy appearance was still prized above the frail and sickly look from the Victorian Era.The 1930’s and 1940’s witnessed the devastating effects of the 2nd World War, which unfortunately led to The Great Depression. While men <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield, females began entering the workface. This resulted in more formal and traditional military dress styles for women, which caused another shift in body image. While waists’ remained thin but prominent, the media embraced a more curvaceous look similar to the hourglass figure, through the addition of broad shoulders and large breasts as well. Since this era was part of the golden age of Hollywood, many celebrities continued to influence this trend by wearing tight fitted clothing that emphasized their figures. Pin-up girls and sex symbols radiating glamour soon followed in the 1950’s, and the proportions of the hourglass figure expanded. Notable names include Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, and Jessica Rabbit. In order to achieve this ideal figure, women consumed weight-gain supplements [...] The release of Playboy magazine and the Barbie doll during this era were other additions in the need to achieve this ideal.Depictions of the perfect woman; however, slowly grew thinner from 1960’s onwards. The “Swinging Sixties” saw a similar look to the Flapper with the emergence of high-fashion model Twiggy, who promoted the thin and petite frame, with long slender legs, and an adolescent but androgynous figure. Other characteristics include, small busts, narrow hips, and flat stomachs. Hence, many women either underwent diets or switched to weight-loss supplements to achieve the new look. This eventually resulted in an increase in anorexia nervosa sufferers during the 1970’s. Nonetheless, greater importance was soon placed on fitness, and actress Farrah Fawcett introduced a more toned and athletic body type. The exercise craze continued in the 1980’s with Jane Fonda and the release of workout videos, motivating women to be thin but fit and svelte. This era also saw the rise of tall, long legged supermodels; such as Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford, dominating the industry, and setting a new beauty standard for females around the world.|$|E
