5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E

25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E

25|$|The {{route of}} {{transmission}} {{is important to}} epidemiologists because patterns of contact vary between different populations and different groups of populations depending on socio-economic, cultural and other features. For example, low personal and food hygiene {{due to the lack}} of a clean water supply may result in increased transmission of diseases by the fecal-oral route, such as cholera. Differences in incidence of such diseases between different groups can also throw light on the routes of transmission of the disease. For example, if it is noted that polio is more common in cities in underdeveloped countries, without a clean water supply, than in cities with a good plumbing system, we might advance the theory that polio is spread by the fecal-oral route. It can be minimised to a certain extent if we all consider being sure of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reprieve, a London-based {{human rights}} group, {{said it had}} talked to two sources from the raided village, {{who said that the}} raid went wrong from the start as the Seals opened fire on a 70-year-old {{partially}} blind man, named Nasser Al-Adhal, who had come out of his house {{to see what was going}} on, possibly to greet the US soldiers after mistaking them for visitors. On hearing al-Adhal being shot, other men then emerged from their homes, and four of them were shot dead by the Seals, according to the Reprieve account. According to Reprive investigators, they were “still trying to get a really full picture of exactly what happened, but <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> know is that Seals landed in the village, and they appear to have been trying to target a group of possible militants but in the course of the ground raid something went wrong, and they ended up killing a number of the people from the village, including a man of about 70, Nasser al-Adhal, who suffered from very bad eyesight. The four other villagers were killed when they started to argue with the Navy Seals after the shooting of Nasser al-Adhal. Six villagers were seriously injured, including another elderly man who was around 69 years old. After that, Al-Qaida fighters gathered nearby, after were alerted by the gunshots in the village and firefight ensued in which at least two of them were killed. The Navy Seals then left with the help of air support from a helicopter.” A US central command spokesman, Maj. Josh Jacques, said that the Reprieve report would be investigated.|$|E

The track samples The Salsoul Orchestra's [...] "Love Break". The production was described by IGN as having a [...] "Middle Eastern tinge" [...] with synthesized strings that [...] "unleash a darkly atonal whirl that sounds too much like something either Timbaland or The Neptunes or Mannie Fresh have concocted". The Guardian wrote that the production contains [...] "wan-sounding imitations of the Neptunes' sparse, breathy funk". PopMatters described the bridge as being [...] "relaxed yet faintly ominous" [...] with 50 Cent and Olivia crooning: [...] "Girl <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> (<b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do)</b> / And where we do (and where we do) / The things we do (things we do) / Are just between me and you (oh yeah)."

In conversation with Mann, Alvaro Ruiz observes: [...] "In the Norte Chico we see almost no visual arts.

According to McIlrath: [...] "Their faith in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> and the fact that they cared about stuff we cared about was an eye-opener."
