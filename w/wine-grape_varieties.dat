50|$|Other {{well-known}} estates {{include the}} Grorother Hof (established around 1327) and Hof Armada (possibly established {{as early as}} c. 1100), both south of the village center, and Schloss Sommerberg (est. 1563) to the west. North of the Grorother Court is the Europa-Wienberg ("Europe-vineyard"), in which are planted various characteristic <b>wine-grape</b> <b>varieties</b> of Europe (described by signs). A mill dating from 1699 also still stands in the southeastern portion of the Gorother Hof estate.|$|E
40|$|The California wine {{industry}} {{has been in the}} midst of a prolonged boom for more than 30 years. In 1975, California was home to approximately 330 wineries; by 2006 there were nearly 2, 500. There has been a dramatic shift in demand toward higher priced and higher quality table wines, as reflected in the total revenues and crush shares of the stateâ€™s four major growing regions. We examine the major trends in the California wine-grape industry over the last 30 years, specifically differences that are arising between the coastal and inland growing regions and migration of the various <b>wine-grape</b> <b>varieties</b> grown throughout the state...|$|E
40|$|The Lodi Winegrape District {{is one of}} {{the largest}} in California and {{encompasses}} a wide diversity of <b>wine-grape</b> <b>varieties,</b> production systems and soils, which complicates grape nutrient management. To identify regions within this district that have similar nutrient-management needs, we are developing a soil-landscape model based on soil survey information. Our current model identifies five regions within the Lodi district with presumed relationships between soil properties and potassium-supplying ability. Region 1 has weakly developed, clay-rich soils in basin alluvium; region 2 has weakly developed, coarser-textured soils on recent alluvial fans, flood plains and stream terraces; region 3 has moderately developed soils on low terraces derived from granitic alluvium; region 4 has highly developed soils on high terraces derived from mixed alluvium; and region 5 has weakly developed soils formed on undulating volcanic terrain. Field and lab studies of soils in these regions show that our model is reasonable in concept, but that it must be fine-tuned to account for differing degrees of soil variability within each region in order to make realistic nutrient-management predictions...|$|E
