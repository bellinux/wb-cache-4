5|$|As expected, Chapman {{was named}} as captain for the Australian tour. The MCC touring team was {{regarded}} as a strong one by commentators; the only controversy was the omission of Frank Woolley which was not fully explained. Rumours in later years said that Chapman was responsible for leaving Woolley out as he <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> his county team-mate, but Lemmon regards this as unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Varon {{was quoted as saying}} she was legitimately jealous of the 2004 WWE Diva Search winner Christy Hemme. She retracted the statement on her website, claiming the reporter had misquoted her when she mentioned that she <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> Hemme's paycheck, as it was a lot higher than what Varon received in her rookie year.|$|E
5|$|From the Goebbels Diaries, {{researchers}} {{learned that}} Riefenstahl had been friendly with Joseph Goebbels {{and his wife}} Magda, attending the opera with them and going to his parties. Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat. She therefore insisted his diary entries could not be trusted. By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered with {{what he saw as}} her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.|$|E

5|$|Helena's {{favourite}} son, Prince Christian Victor, died in 1900, followed shortly by her mother, Queen Victoria, at Osborne House on 22 January 1901. The new King, Edward VII, did {{not have}} close ties with his surviving sisters, {{with the exception of}} Princess Louise. Helena's nephew, Prince Alexander of Battenberg (later Marquess of Carisbrooke) recorded that Queen Alexandra <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> the royal family, and would not invite her sisters-in-law to Sandringham. Moreover, Alexandra never fully reconciled herself to Helena and Christian following their marriage controversy in the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually nothing {{was left of the}} original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E
5|$|His father distrusted or <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> George's popularity, which {{contributed to}} the {{development}} of a poor relationship between them. The birth in 1717 of George's second son, Prince George William, proved to be a catalyst for a family quarrel; the king, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The king was angered when George, who disliked Newcastle, verbally insulted the duke at the christening, which the duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. George and Caroline were temporarily confined to their apartments on the order of the king, who subsequently banished his son from St James's Palace, the king's residence. The Prince and Princess of Wales left court, but their children remained in the care of the king.|$|E

5|$|Before long, Darnley grew arrogant. Not {{content with}} his {{position}} as king consort, he demanded the Crown Matrimonial, which would have made him a co-sovereign of Scotland {{with the right to}} keep the Scottish throne for himself if he outlived his wife. Mary refused his request, and their marriage grew strained even though they conceived by October 1565. He <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> her friendship with her Catholic private secretary, David Rizzio, who was rumoured to be the father of her child. By March 1566, Darnley had entered into a secret conspiracy with Protestant lords, including the nobles who had rebelled against Mary in the Chaseabout Raid. On 9 March, a group of the conspirators, accompanied by Darnley, murdered Rizzio in front of the pregnant Mary at a dinner party in Holyrood Palace. Over the next two days, a disillusioned Darnley switched sides, and Mary received Moray at Holyrood. On the night of 11–12 March, Darnley and Mary escaped from the palace, and took temporary refuge in Dunbar Castle before returning to Edinburgh on 18March. The former rebels Lords Moray, Argyll and Glencairn were restored to the council.|$|E
5|$|Despite the poetics {{attached}} to Germanicus by ancient authors, it is accepted by historians such as Anthony Barrett that Germanicus was an able general. He {{fought against the}} Pannonians under Tiberius, quelled the mutiny in the Rhine, and led three successful campaigns into Germania. As for his popularity, he was popular enough that the mutinous legions of the Rhine attempted to proclaim him emperor in AD 14; however, he remained loyal and led them against the German tribes instead. Tacitus and Suetonius claim that Tiberius <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> Germanicus' popularity, but Barrett suggests their claim might be contradicted by the fact that, following his campaigns in Germany, Germanicus was given command of the eastern provinces – a sure sign he was intended to rule. In accordance with the precedent set by Augustus, Agrippa had been given command of those same provinces in the east when Agrippa was the intended successor to the empire.|$|E

An oblivious Steph did not realised that she is being stalked by serial killer, Toby Mills (Henry Luxemburg). It {{was part of a}} storyline that had been running in the background for while. He attacked her, and proceeds by stabbing her in the head and leaving her to die. Steph was then found unconscious and she woke up a week later in hospital where she was diagnosed with epilepsy.

5|$|When Torres again {{goes into}} cardiac arrest, Montgomery {{delivers}} her daughter at twenty-three weeks's gestation. The baby is initially unable to breathe, so with Sloan's support, Robbins steps in {{and is able}} to revive her. Across the operating room, Torres's condition begins to improve. Once the surgery is complete, the doctors deal with their own affairs; Sloan's former partner Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) commits to her new relationship with resident Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams); Lexie's sister (and series main character) Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo, primary series star) confesses that she <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> Torres's pregnancy, which prompts her husband Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) to promise that they will have a child together; Altman tells Yang that she can no longer teach her; Sloan and Robbins bond over their shared parenthood. Later, as Robbins keeps a vigil by Torres's bedside, the hallucinatory Torres is able to rouse her recovering self. As she regains consciousness, Torres accepts Robbins's proposal.|$|E
5|$|With {{his wife}} Hadley Richardson, Hemingway first visited the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona, Spain, in 1923, {{where he was}} {{following}} his recent passion for bullfighting. The couple returned to Pamplona in 1924—enjoying the trip immensely—this time accompanied by Chink Dorman-Smith, John Dos Passos, and Donald Ogden Stewart and his wife. The two returned a third time in June1925 and stayed at the hotel of his friend Juanito Quintana. That year, they brought with them a different group of American and British expatriates: Hemingway's Michigan boyhood friend Bill Smith, Stewart, recently divorced Duff, Lady Twysden, her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb. In Pamplona, the group quickly disintegrated. Hemingway, attracted to Duff, <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> Loeb, who had recently been on a romantic getaway with her; {{by the end of}} the week the two men had a public fistfight. Against this background was the influence of the young matador from Ronda, Cayetano Ordóñez, whose brilliance in the bullring affected the spectators. Ordóñez honored Hemingway's wife by presenting her, from the bullring, with the ear of a bull he killed. Outside of Pamplona, the fishing trip to the Irati River (near Burguete in Navarre) was marred by polluted water.|$|E

25|$|Lawler {{has stated}} several {{theories}} {{as to why}} he was allowed to leave. His first involves the ascent of Carter's career alongside the downfall of Chyna's. In his contention, Chyna <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> his wife's push inside the company, in part due to the Right to Censor storyline, and in part because of his wife's offer to pose for Playboy magazine. Until that time, Chyna had been the second major wrestling star from the World Wrestling Federation to have done a piece in Playboy (after Sable); during Chyna's debut on the adult magazine, she had suddenly broken her friendship with Carter.|$|E
25|$|During {{inquiries}} into {{natural gas}} exports in the 1950s, the ERCB recommended {{the creation of}} a province-wide natural gas gathering system. The thinking behind this idea was twofold: first, it would be more efficient to develop a single gathering system than to let gathering systems evolve piecemeal. Second, such a system would eliminate the possibility of federal regulation of gas within the province. Alberta <b>was</b> <b>jealous</b> <b>of</b> its hard-won control over natural resources and saw gas transportation within the province as an aspect of resource management. The province was also very conscious of the potential of natural gas and its products for provincial industrial development.|$|E
