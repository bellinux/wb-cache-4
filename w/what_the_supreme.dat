These range from personal memoirs by historical Paraguayan figures to passages from books written by Europeans in Paraguay at the time. [...] They are arranged by a 'Compiler' whose footnotes {{tell the story}} of how the book was put together. The body of the novel is composed of a polemical collection of versions of Paraguayan history. The first text is <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> dictates to his assistant Patiño, about {{what is happening in the}} present. This includes the constant abuses Francia heaps upon Patiño and their attempts to discover the authors of a pasquinade, found nailed to the door of the Asunción Cathedral, that falsely announces Francia's death and burial arrangements. It is mostly Francia's vulgar rambling, including accusing meek Patiño of attempting to usurp him. The author of the pasquinade is never discovered in spite of their high scrutiny.|$|E

[...] He argues {{that the best way}} to improve the quality of education while fighting rising costs, growing numbers of dropouts, and higher levels of violence and drug use among students is to reduce the reach of centralized government in the schools and return control over school curricula, funding, and administration back to parents and local communities.|$|E
