5|$|On 23 July 2014, two Su-25s <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in the Donetsk {{region of}} Ukraine. A {{spokesperson}} for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said the aircraft <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by missiles fired from Russia.|$|E
5|$|At first, the Japanese bombers {{appeared}} {{to be trying to}} approach and attack Enterprise but turned toward Chicago after six Enterprise CAP fighters began to engage them. Four other CAP fighters chased the 751AG aircraft as they entered the anti-aircraft fire from Chicagos escorting destroyers. Two of the bombers <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> before they could release their ordnance. Six more <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> moments later, but not before they dropped their torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Altogether JG 1 lost 25 {{pilots and}} 29 {{aircraft}}. This return for around 60 enemy aircraft (54 on the ground) cannot {{be considered a}} complete success, although the damage at St. Denijs Westrem and Maldegem had been significant. Just nine of the fighters lost by JG 1 are confirmed to have been shot down in combat with Spitfires. It is possible a further three <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by Spitfires, or perhaps ground fire. Two Spitfires <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and destroyed, with two more damaged. One pilot of each Squadron (308 and 317) was killed. The total Spitfire losses were perhaps 32.|$|E
50|$|On 9 July MiG-15s intercepted 6 B-29s {{that were}} attacking the airfield, 1 MiG <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by escorting F-86s while another <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by B-29 gunners.|$|R
5000|$|... 20-22 April 1941: one SM.79 (278th Squadriglia, torpedo unit) <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> on the 21st, another, from 34 Gruppo <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> {{the next}} day, by Fulmars from ...|$|R
50|$|V6 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> on 21 August 1942 on the Taranto to Tripoli route by a Bristol Beaufighter; V8 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> on {{the same}} route on 10 December 1942.|$|R
5|$|At 08:13, {{the first}} {{formations}} took off. In total, 64 Fw 190D-9s participated. Before {{the target was}} reached, some 14 D-9s were forced to turn back due to AAA damage or mechanical difficulties. Three Fw 190s were lost to German AAA fire. At 09:10, when the front was reached, Allied heavy AAA units began to engage the formation and another five <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b> Most of the fire was from British Naval AAA defences defending the Scheldt Estuary. As the formation crossed the Dutch and Belgian border, I./JG 26 and III./JG 54 were intercepted by Spitfires. Five of the Fw 190s <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b> I./JG 26 destroyed or damaged the few aircraft at the airfield. AAA defences claimed five kills and I./JG 26 reported two Fw 190s lost to Spitfires. Several others were lost over the airfield. Other losses occurred against friendly fire again on the return flight.|$|E
5|$|At Gosport, five {{aircraft}} {{were lost}} and five damaged. Several buildings were wrecked and two hangars damaged. But {{there were no}} casualties. The Ju 87 attack had been accurate, and no bombs fell outside the military compounds. In the Gosport area, 10 barrage balloons <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and two damaged.|$|E
5|$|During {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, nine Zeros <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b> From these wrecks, the Allies learned that the Zero lacked armor and {{self-sealing}} fuel tanks, but little else about its capabilities. The Zero's flight performance characteristics—crucial to devising tactics and machinery to combat it—remained a mystery.|$|E
50|$|During the War in Abkhazia (1992-1993), a Russian Mi-8 {{helicopter}} <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by a Georgian Army SA-14 on December 14, 1992, {{resulting in}} the death of 3 crew and 58 passengers, most of them Russian refugees. A Georgian Air Force Su-25 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> over Nizhnaya Eshera on 4 July 1993 by SA-14, and several other aircraft on both sides may have <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by SA-14s.|$|R
5000|$|We {{had to send}} a U-2 over to gain {{reconnaissance}} {{information on}} whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational. We believed that if the U-2 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> it would <b>be</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, {{and that it would}} represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict. And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack. It <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> on Friday.... Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought [...] "Well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack." [...] Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation. And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2.|$|R
5|$|His {{two younger}} {{brothers}} also became fighter pilots and aces. Paul claimed 17 victories, he <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and killed on 31 October 1942. Wilhelm-Ferdinand, credited with 54 victories, <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and killed on 17 August 1943.|$|R
5|$|II./JG 1 {{attacked}} the airfield at St. Denis Westrem. Of the 36 II./JG 1 Fw 190s that took off, 17 <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> a staggering 47% loss rate. Among the pilots lost were several experienced fliers. In exchange, the Germans shot down two Spitfires, and seven forced-landed. At St. Denis 18 Spitfires were destroyed on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Swiss {{aircraft}} also intercepted U.S. aircraft {{who were}} off-course, or whose crews preferred asylum in Swiss internment camps over German or Italian POW camps; {{they were then}} forced to land on Swiss airstrips. When the bombers did not cooperate or even fired at the Swiss (who were using Axis-type interceptors), they <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|The He 111Z's {{operational}} {{history was}} minimal. One machine {{was caught by}} RAF fighter aircraft over France on 14 March 1944. The He 111Z was towing a Gotha Go 242, and was shot down. Eight <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> or destroyed {{on the ground in}} 1944.|$|E
50|$|A Macedonian {{helicopter}} <b>was</b> allegedly <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> {{during the}} clashes; KFOR claims that a helicopter <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in the area, while Skopje denied the reports.|$|R
5000|$|... 7 August 1945: Two of the squadron’s Privateers {{were caught}} by ﬁve enemy ﬁghters {{in the area}} of Sagami Wan. One enemy {{aircraft}} <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and one of the squadron PB4Y-2 bombers <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in ﬂames, with no survivors.|$|R
50|$|On 8 October 1987, an LPAF Su-22M-22K <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by a FIM-92A Stinger missile in {{northern}} Chad. The pilot, Capt. Diya al-Din, ejected and was captured. The LPAF immediately organized a recovery operation; subsequently a Jamahiriya MiG-23 Flogger <b>was</b> also <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by another Stinger. In December 1988 a Libyan People's Air Force SF.260 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> over northern Chad by Chadian troops.|$|R
5|$|The Japanese military's {{efforts to}} defend Singapore from air attack were unsuccessful. Due to the weak {{state of the}} island's air defences, only nine B-29s <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> during the American campaign, all of them during {{daylight}} raids. Minesweeping operations were also slow, and it took three weeks to declare the port safe after each Allied minelaying raid. The surviving crew members of the American bombers that <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> met varying fates; a small number linked up with resistance movements such as the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army, while others were captured by the Japanese and held in harsh conditions. Those who were captured by the IJN and held at the Naval Base were beheaded. After the war, the Japanese personnel believed responsible for atrocities against these prisoners were tried during the Seletar War Crimes Trials and those found guilty were executed or served long prison sentences.|$|E
5|$|The zenith of B-52 {{attacks in}} Vietnam was Operation Linebacker II (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Christmas Bombing), conducted from 18 to 29 December 1972, which consisted of waves of B-52s (mostly D models, but some Gs without jamming equipment and with a smaller bomb load). Over 12 days, B-52s flew 729 sorties and dropped 15,237tons of bombs on Hanoi, Haiphong, and other targets. Originally 42 B-52s were committed to the war; however, numbers were frequently twice this figure. During Operation Linebacker II, fifteen B-52s <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> five were heavily damaged (one crashed in Laos), and five suffered medium damage. A total of 25 crew men were killed in these losses. North Vietnam claimed 34 B-52s <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|Waldron's {{squadron}} sighted {{the enemy}} carriers and began attacking at 09:20, followed by Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6, from Enterprise) whose Wildcat fighter escorts also ran low on fuel {{and had to}} turn back at 09:40. Without fighter escort, all 15 TBD Devastators of VT-8 <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> {{without being able to}} inflict any damage. Ensign George H. Gay, Jr. was the only survivor of the 30 aircrew of VT-8. VT-6 lost 10 of its 14 Devastators, and 10 of Yorktowns VT-3's 12 Devastators <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> with no hits to show for their effort, {{thanks in part to the}} abysmal performance of their unimproved Mark 13 torpedoes. Midway was the last time the TBD Devastator was used in combat.|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} that no civil {{aircraft}} may <b>be</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> even if the aircraft {{is used as a}} weapon by terrorist. The {{court held that}} the passengers' dignity and right to life would be violated if the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{day later}} he <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> and wounded on 16 August 1940 (research {{shows that he}} <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by Helmut Wick). After recuperating at the Royal West Sussex Hospital at Chichester he rejoined No. 1 Squadron on 1 October 1940 at RAF Wittering.|$|R
50|$|Michael Enslin, 21 {{years of}} age the time, <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in a BAe Hawk at 1000 feet while {{recovering}} from a dive. He survived for 5 days in the bush until he was rescued. He was the third pilot to <b>be</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 10 U.S. {{aircraft}} <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} Japanese ships; some of the aircrews were rescued by seaplane or submarine. In total, the U.S. lost 12 men. Some of the Japanese survivors reported that U.S. fighter aircraft machine-gunned Japanese survivors floating in the water. Japanese survivors also reported that U.S. aircraft temporarily halted their attacks on the Japanese destroyers {{during the time that}} the destroyers were busy picking up survivors from the water.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one hour}} later, Hiryū's second attack wave, {{consisting}} of ten B5Ns and six escorting A6Ms, arrived over Yorktown; the repair efforts {{had been so}} effective that the Japanese pilots assumed that Yorktown must be a different, undamaged carrier. They attacked, crippling Yorktown with two torpedoes; she lost all power and developed a 23-degree list to port. Five torpedo bombers and two fighters <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in this attack.|$|E
5|$|As the Ju 87s {{began their}} attack, Spitfires from No. 234 Squadron engaged the 25-strong Bf 109 escort {{commanded}} by Hauptmann Karl-Wolfgang Redlich. I./JG 27s commander, Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Eduard Neumann heard the battle developing, but communications were poor {{and he decided}} to let Redlich, one of his most experienced Staffelkapitän (Squadron Leaders) fight alone. In the resulting combat, three Bf 109s <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
50|$|On April 21, 2005, six Blackwater USA {{independent}} contractors {{were killed in}} Iraq when their Mil Mi-8 Hip helicopter <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b> Also killed <b>were</b> three Bulgarian crewmembers and two Fijian gunners. Initial reports indicated that the helicopter <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by rocket propelled grenades.|$|R
25|$|Eight persons {{died when}} Dakota VT-CLA <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 24 May 2001, a Cessna 152 {{violated}} Israeli airspace and <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by an IDAF AH-64 Apache. Estephan Nicolian, a Lebanese student pilot, <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> after ignoring repeated warnings by Israeli ATC to turn back. This is {{the only}} known operational air-to-air kill using an AGM-114 Hellfire missile.|$|R
5|$|At 08:40, the {{opposing}} aircraft strike formations passed {{within sight of}} each other. Nine Zeros from Zuihō surprised and attacked the Enterprise group, attacking the climbing aircraft {{from out of the}} sun. In the resulting engagement, four Zeros, three Wildcats, and two TBFs <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down,</b> with another two TBFs and a Wildcat forced by heavy damage to return to Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|At around 17:00 a large {{formation}} of enemies {{showed up on}} radar headed towards TG38.3. As before, {{a great deal of}} these <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by combat air patrol. The surviving enemy planes flew down to the water level to evade further radar detection. These planestorpedo bombers and fighterssuccessfully ambushed the formation just minutes later. Evasive maneuvers, squall weather, and poor fighter cover {{on the part of the}} Japanese helped TG38.3 escape without suffering any significant damage.|$|E
5|$|Galland himself flew on {{unauthorised}} interception {{flights to}} experience the combat pressures of the pilots, and witnessed USAAF bombers being escorted by large numbers of P-51 Mustangs. Nevertheless, on occasions the Sturmbock tactics worked. For example, on 7 July 1944 Eighth Air Force bombers belonging to the 492nd Bomb Group were intercepted unescorted. The entire squadron of 12 B-24s <b>were</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down.</b> The USAAF 2nd Air Division lost 28 Liberators that day, the majority to a Sturmbock attack.|$|E
50|$|On August 31, 2014, a Syrian {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> by an Israeli Air Defense Command MIM-104D Patriot missile near Quneitra, {{after it}} had penetrated Israeli airspace over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Nearly a month later, on September 23, a Syrian Air Force Sukhoi Su-24 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> in similar circumstances.|$|R
50|$|Sri Lanka Air Force Avro 748 CR835 <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> on 28 April 1995 by a SA-7 missile {{filed by}} the LTTE. The plane, an Avro 748-334 Srs. 2A airliner, was en route to Ratmalana Airport and <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> <b>down</b> soon after {{take-off}} from SLAF Palaly. All 51 crew and passengers were killed.|$|R
5000|$|John Edmund Greene DFC (2 July 1894 - 14 October 1918) was a Canadian First World War flying ace, officially {{credited}} with 15 victories.
