It was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, whose previous endeavors included music videos, commercials and the cult film, Spun (2003). The documentary emerged from Madonna's urge to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary, , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer's views on life and spirituality.

500|$|Nesbitt's {{performance}} in Hear My Song had also impressed first-time screenwriter and film director Kirk Jones, who cast {{him in his}} 1998 feature film Waking Ned. Playing amiable pig farmer [...] "Pig" [...] Finn brought Nesbitt to international attention, particularly in the United States (where the film was released as Waking Ned Devine); the cast was nominated for the 1999 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Theatrical Motion Picture.

In 2001, he made his debut as a lead actor in a feature film in Peter Cattaneo's Lucky Break. He played Jimmy Hands, an incompetent bank robber who masterminds an escape from a prison by staging a musical as a distraction. On preparing for the role, Nesbitt said, [...] "Short of robbing a bank there wasn't much research I could have done but we did spend a day in Wandsworth Prison and that showed the nightmare monotony of prisoners' lives.

50|$|However, {{the notion}} of most likely state comes not from this thinking; it comes from {{statistical}} mechanics, a field well known to Wilson and not so well known to transportation planners. The result from statistical mechanics <b>is</b> that <b>a</b> descending series <b>is</b> most likely. Think {{about the way the}} energy from lights in the classroom is affecting the air in the classroom. If the effect resulted in an ascending series, many of the atoms and molecules <b>would</b> <b>be</b> affected <b>a</b> lot and <b>a</b> few <b>would</b> <b>be</b> affected <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> The descending series would have many affected not at all or not much and only a few affected very much. We could take a given level of energy and compute excitation levels in ascending and descending series.
