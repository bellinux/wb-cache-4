60|$|Nevertheless, {{creeping}} darkly {{through the}} places which this excellent person had haunted in his lifetime, {{there was a}} hidden stream of private talk, such {{as it would have}} shocked all decency to speak loudly at the street-corners. It is very singular, how the fact of a man's death often seems to give people a truer idea of his character, whether for good or evil, than they have ever possessed while he was living and acting among them. Death is so genuine a fact that it excludes falsehood, or betrays its emptiness; it is a touchstone that proves the gold, and dishonors the baser metal. Could the departed, whoever he may be, return in a week after his decease, he would almost invariably find himself at a higher or lower point than he had formerly occupied, on the scale of public appreciation. But the talk, or scandal, to which we now allude, had reference to matters of no less old a date than the supposed murder, thirty or forty years ago, of the late Judge Pyncheon's uncle. The medical opinion with regard to his own recent and regretted decease had almost entirely obviated the idea that a murder was committed in the former case. Yet, as the record showed, there were circumstances irrefragably indicating that some person had gained access to old Jaffrey Pyncheon's private apartments, at or near the moment of his death. His desk and private drawers, in a room contiguous to his bedchamber, had been ransacked; money and valuable articles were missing; there was a bloody hand-print on the old man's linen; and, by a powerfully <b>welded</b> <b>chain</b> of deductive evidence, the guilt of the robbery and apparent murder had been fixed on Clifford, then residing with his uncle in the House of the Seven Gables.|$|E

Accordingly, the study was extended to evaluate crack growth rate also in flash <b>welded</b> <b>chain</b> links. These were fatigue tested in the as-welded and welded and heat treated conditions {{and the results were}} then compared with those obtained with the base material.

As this material is largely used for fabricating offshore mooring chains, the study was extended to include quenched and tempered flash <b>welded</b> <b>chain</b> links. Martensite content was varied by varying the austenitization temperature and fatigue behavior of quenched and tempered specimens was determined by following crack growth during constant amplitude cyclic loading. The results indicate that {{an increase in the}} tempered martensite volume fraction is associated with a {{reduction in the number of}} cycles to failure and that for a given microstructural condition, the fatigue life of the welded joints is invariably shorter than that of the base metal. Finally, the fatigue behavior is presented and discussed considering the mechanical properties and the toughness of the fatigued specimens. ...|$|E

Two specimens have been subjected for testing to get repeatable experimental observations. Both the specimens tested for the required number of fatigue cycles (97000 cycles as per ASME, Mandatory Appendix 6) towards the structural integrity demonstration. At the end of fatigue testing, the maximum linear indication of the surface defect of the weld area increased from 20 mm to 25 mm without any loss of integrity. Individual links of both the chains were able to articulate freely after completing the fatigue test. After completing the required fatigue cycle both the specimens were subjected to break load testing. The lowest break load obtained from both the specimen was 27. 1 t and the respective collapse load obtained as per the ASME double slope method was 22 t. The above results indicated that, IFTM chain assembly qualifies for the safety with very high margins. Also, these experimental results give confidence that, collapse load obtained by the ASME double slope method is having a very high margin (∼ 18 %) with the actual break load. Finite element analysis has also been performed before conducting the experiment to understand the overall stress distribution of the chain under load condition and also to identify the critical location.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate, with two {{probabilistic}} analytical models, the effectiveness of several alternative fatigue management strategies for steel bridge welds. The investigated strategies employed, in various combinations, magnetic particle inspection, gouging and rewelding, and postweld treatment by peening. The analytical models included a probabilistic strain-based fracture mechanics model and a Markov chain model. For comparing the results obtained with the two models, the fatigue life was divided into a small, fixed number of condition states based on crack depth, similar to those often used by bridge management systems to model deterioration due to other processes, such as corrosion and road surface wear. The probabilistic strain-based fracture mechanics model was verified first by comparison with design S-N curves and test data for untreated welds. Next, the verified model was used to determine the probability that untreated and treated welds would be in each condition state in a given year; the probabilities were then used to calibrate transition probabilities for a much simpler Markov chain fatigue model. Then both models were used to simulate a number of fatigue management strategies. From the results of these simulations, the performance of the different strategies was compared, and the accuracy of the simpler Markov chain fatigue model was evaluated. In general, peening was more effective if preceded by inspection of the <b>weld.</b> The Markov <b>chain</b> fatigue model did a reasonable job of predicting the general trends and relative effectiveness of the different investigated strategies...|$|R

Yet with over three decades of progress, limitations associated with poor material properties, slow fabrication speeds, expensive cost, and volumetric size constraints continue to disappoint. How can we move beyond the current dimensional limits of additive manufacturing and escape the printer's 'box'? What are the routes to 3 D print a house, a microfluidic system, or a biological scaffold? Can we produce an Additive Manufacturing Map? This thesis focuses on expanding the limits of additive manufacturing through novel experimental developments across material, spatial, and temporal dimensions. A dimensional additive manufacturing mapping methodology for plotting theoretical and experimental results is generated and discussed. Research into the material dimension resulted in new additive fabrication techniques for construction. Processes include printed insulated formwork, robotically <b>welded</b> metal <b>chain,</b> and techniques using locally sourced materials (sand, natural fibers, soil, and ice). Research into the spatial dimension includes the design, fabrication, and characterization of a mobile Digital Construction Platform capable of 3 D printing architectural-scale structures. The platform has a diametrical reach of over 20 m through a compound arm system and can autonomously drive, gather local materials, self-charge via photovoltaics, and fabricate structures larger than itself. A 14. 6 m by 3. 7 m proof-of-concept structure was successfully 3 D printed onsite with a machine manufacturing time under 13. 5 hours. Research into microscopic scale fabrication produced a fractal glass electro-sintering technique and initial investigations into a combination one- and two-photon polymerization 3 D printer. Research into the temporal dimension focused on fabrication techniques using biomaterials and living systems, such as thermal deposition of squid sucker ring teeth protein, and 3 D printable microfluidics. Developments include printable structures to host cellular life, and the design and characterization of a multi-material microfluidic proportional valve. The projects were evaluated with a dimensional methodology workflow, generating an additive manufacturing map. With this mapping methodology, quantified queries, evaluations, and designs - for various additive fabrication tasks dependent on a value proposition - can be responded to, analyzed, and built. by Steven J.

40|$|The Western Australian School of Mines (WASM) {{developed}} {{a large area}} static test facility to enable the evaluation of three forms of surface support; namely, mesh, shotcrete and membranes. The purpose of this thesis is to document the test conditions and procedures under which these tests were conducted and to document the outcomes from testing. A review of previous mesh testing established that the most common method used {{for the evaluation of}} mesh types was two-dimensional linear elastic analyses, often using catenary principles. These analysis techniques have been used to estimate the tension in the wires of mesh and the strength characteristics of the mesh. These methods assume that forces are only transferred along directly loaded wires and that failure of the mesh is only related to the tensile strength of the wire. The force – displacement response from fully restrained mesh tests conducted at the WASM test facility have been characterised into distinct phases, clearly demonstrating the non-linear behaviour of mesh. The initial force response to displacement is slow; however the force response increases dramatically with further displacement. This behaviour has been shown to follow a cubic relationship. The force – displacement results have also been used to develop load transfer concepts for both <b>weld</b> mesh and <b>chain</b> link mesh. These concepts suggest that forces are transferred away from the directly loaded wires through adjoining wires, distributing forces over a greater area of the mesh. The force capacity of the weld mesh is not only dependent on the tensile strength of the wire but also the quality of the welding process. Likewise, the force capacity of chain link mesh is not only dependent on the tensile strength of the wire but also diamond configuration which allows load to be shared across a greater area of mesh. Several other test conditions were evaluated as part of the test program, including mesh sheet overlaps and wire orientation. The results have demonstrated that the boundary conditions and mesh orientation alters the force – displacement response of mesh. Most current shotcrete testing techniques focus on quality assurance and quality control. Shotcrete support mechanism and failure mechanisms are complex and not well understood. The WASM punch test method was developed to evaluate shotcrete using realistic shotcrete failure mechanisms such as shear and flexural failure and adhesion loss. The behaviour of shotcrete is characterised by an initial stiff reaction followed by rupture of the cement matrix. Rupture generally occurs at displacements of less than 5 mm. The rupture force of fibre reinforced shotcrete is dependent only on the cement content of the shotcrete mix and the thickness of the layer, and not on the fibre type. The post rupture reaction of shotcrete is dependent on the reinforcing material; namely fibres or mesh. Mesh reinforced shotcrete had much greater force and displacement capacity compared with fibre reinforced shotcrete. Membranes have two theoretical support models (Norcroft, 2006); namely, the membrane support model and the beam support model. A total of 6 tests were undertaken to investigate the behaviour of a particular membrane product under the two theoretical support models. These tests were aimed at determining a suitable test method that could determine the capacity of the membrane and the behaviour of the membrane under realistic loading conditions. The results from both test programs demonstrated that the membrane has limited force and displacement capacity and cannot be compared with conventional mesh and shotcrete as suggested in the product data sheet. The failure mechanism was shear failure with minimal adhesion loss observed. The development of the WASM test facility has enabled the evaluation and comparison of various surface support elements. The results of this testing have provide a valuable insight into the performance of each of the individual products...|$|R
40|$|Polypropylene (PP) is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} polyolefin, which is being used {{in a wide variety}} of applications. Depending on the final application, the chemical and morphological properties of PP have to be tailored. The current research work was performed with a particular focus towards the morphological changes in PP triggered by welding. Welding is a widely applied method for joining plastics which, however, generates a complex morphological polymer structure at the weld. The effect of processing on the morphology of PP was studied for welds between plates of PP homopolymer (PP-H). Due to the complex interplay of heating and cooling rates as well as the mechanical forces during <b>welding,</b> the PP <b>chains</b> rearrange themselves in different patterns and forms different zones in the weld, which were qualitatively analyzed by polarized light microscopy (PLM). Three distinct zones, which differ in their crystal structure and size, were observed in PLM, namely the injection molded plate with the original morphology, the weld seam and the weld core. The different cooling and heating rates cause the polymer to crystallize at different rates. Quantitative studies on these effects raised upon welding are a prerequisite to modulate the end use properties of a welded PP. Hence, the orientation of polymer chains was quantified by infrared microscopy (µFT-IR) across PP welds. Thus it could be shown that the polymer chains were oriented along machine direction (MD) at the plates and normal direction (ND) at the weld seams. One of the major applications of PP is the sector of pipes which are being used to transport various kinds of liquid media. Disinfection of water by strong oxidants due to health reasons is a routine process in the current situation. Yet, the transportation of this disinfected water can cause severe damages to PP. A detailed research on the deterioration rates and the mechanisms underlaying when PP is in contact with hot water and chlorinated water with different chlorine concentrations and at different temperatures was carried out. The pipes chosen for the durability studies were a random copolymer of propylene with ethylene (PP-R) nucleated with α- and β-nucleating agents (PP-R 1 and PP-R 2 respectively). The pipes were stabilized with 1, 3, 5 -tris (3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -hydroxybenzyl) - 2, 4, 6 -methylbenzene (AO- 13), Pentaerythritol tetrakis (3 - 3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -hydroxyphenyl) propionate (AO- 18) and the processing stabilizer tris(2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite (PS- 2). The characteristic ester carbonyl absorption in the infrared spectrum at 1740 cm- 1 was used to quantify AO- 18. However, the characteristic bands of AO- 13 overlapped with the bands of AO- 18 and PS- 2. To overcome this problem a new method has been developed for µFT-IR to quantify AO- 13 from a mixture with AO- 18 and PS- 2. The quantification results of AOs obtained from µFT-IR were well supported by Extraction→HPLC. PP is vulnerable to deterioration in the absence of stabilizers. Thus, monitoring the stabilizer loss is an alternative approach to determine the durability of polymers in reactive environments. Degradation/extraction of AOs is highly dependent on the morphology of the material. In that case, the extrusion of polymer melt into the form of hollow cylindrical pipes generates a distinct morphological profile across the pipe wall. Using µFT-IR it could be shown that the polymer chains in PP-R 1 were orientated along the extrusion direction due to the fast crystallization of the injected melt triggered by α-nucleation. The diffusion of small molecules through these kinds of oriented networks is faster than randomly oriented ones. In PP-R 2, the β- nucleation led to a random orientation of polymer chains at the inner surface which gave impermeability towards the small molecules. This difference in the penetration characteristics of PP-R 1 and PP-R 2 manifested in different deterioration rates of the pipes. The faster penetration of the media caused the formation of a higher amount of macroradicals in PP-R 1. Hence a higher amount of AOs was required to stabilize these macroradicals to prevent the polymer chain scission. In order to understand the influence of temperature on the degradation of the polymer, ageing was carried out at two temperatures 95 and 110 °C. Out of these experiments, the degradative processes of the polymer, namely the loss of antioxidants and reduction in molar mass of the polymer, proceeded more rapidly at 110 °C. Experiments with different chlorine concentrations showed that deterioration was more pronounced at higher chlorine concentrations. The depletion of the two AOs, AO- 18 and AO- 13, differs in their rates. In detail it was found that AO- 18 is lost faster to the inner medium than AO- 13, irrespective of ageing condition and temperature. The degradation of AO- 18 can be caused via two mechanisms: The hydrolysis of the ester bond and via the intended donation of phenolic hydrogen to the macroradicals. On the contrary AO- 13 is susceptible towards degradation solely by the quenching of macroradicals. Therefore, an accelerated degradation of AO- 18 was observed irrespective of the ageing temperature...|$|R
40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} part of a {{research}} project focused on the kinematic and tectonic evolution of some key areas of the Western Mediterranean region from the early Cretaceous to present. The aim of this project is to obtain a quantitative model that reconciles the kinematic constraints with the geological-geophysical data recorded in the Mediterranean area. We will provide, using a large amount of data published in many papers in the literature, to develop a coherent reconstruction that will best explain the large scale tectonics of the western Mediterranean region. The kinematic model is obtained taken into account different data derived from various geological datasets, like tectono‐metamorphic events, structural observations, stratigraphic record, magmatic activity distribution and palaeomagnetic data (where available). Reconstruction was carried out using integrated software, PCME 4. 0, for the developing of paleogeographic or paleotectonic maps. This software enabled us to create paleotectonic maps by the rotation of all present day tectonic elements to their ancient position by applying rotational motions to numerous microplates and tectonic elements involved {{in the evolution of the}} western Mediterranean area. In particular, this PhD thesis is focused on the Neogene evolution of the Sicilian Maghrebian chain. In order to obtain a self-consistent model, it was necessary to reconstruct the Mediterranean evolution, starting from the Mesozoic paleogeography of the western Mediterranean area. The first step was to build a kinematic model that explains the tectonic relation among Western Alps, Alpine Corsica, and Calabrian Arc in the general context of tectonic evolution of the western Mediterranean during the late Cretaceous and the Cenozoic. We propose an alternative model, which overcome the classical models that either interpreting Corsica as the backstop of the Apennine subduction or apply a not easily justified geodynamically model of subduction flip (assuming the detachment of the Ligurian slab following the southeast dipping subduction stage). We suggest that the opposite subduction polarities for Alpine Corsica and for the Calabrian Arc are associated with the occurrence of a transform boundary active since the late Cretaceous. Moreover this new scenario, involving the definition of a new set of plate boundaries for the western Alps–Corsica area, satisfactorily takes into account geological constraints represented by metamorphic ages, stratigraphic record and structural data and also provides useful insights into the geometry of the larger (Africa–Iberia–Eurasia) plate boundary configuration and the original setting of the associated subduction zones. Moreover, the model explains the origin and the structural evolution of the wedge-top deposits, which develops in an extensional context (among Alpine Corsica, Calabria and Kabylies) during the Corsica and Sardinia block rotation, such as “Cilento Unit”, and “Capo d'Orlando Fm. ”. The second step provides a kinematic model of the Tyrrhenian- Apennine system evolution since the early Burdigalian. In this model, we divide the Apennine chain into six deformable sectors, characterized by homogeneous Tyrrhenian extensional deformation, each other separated by the transverse structures of the chain (Ancona-Anzio Line, Sangineto Line, Taormina Line) for which the model explains the origin and evolution. The rotation poles (Euler poles) of each sector are defined through a morfostructural analysis of the tectonic lineament in the Tyrrhenian basin and along the Apennine chain. The ultimate goal of this PhD thesis was the characterization of the tectonic evolution of the Sicilian-Maghrebian chain and Southern Tyrrhenian area in the framework of the Tyrrhenian-Apennine system since the early Oligocene. The main tectono-sedimentary stages of the Caltanissetta foredeep basin and of the Cefalù basin, active from upper Miocene to Plio-Pleistocene, are described from a kinematic point of view through a series of plate reconstructions that show the Caltanissetta basin peculiarity with respect to the Maghrebian chain foredeep. The development of the Neogene systems is deeply controlled by the Mesozoic physiography of the African and European margin: the sinking of the oceanic lithosphere, the thinning of the continental lithosphere, the location, and the structure of the different domains (Imerese, Sicanian, Panormide, and Iblean-Pelagian block) controls the development and the propagation of the foredeep and of the thrust tectonics. Starting from the early Miocene, the foredeep (e. g. the Caltanissetta basin) develops on to the frontal sector of the chain, which is characterized by transversal extension on to the upper plate, while moved towards South-South East involving the Panormide carbonate platform, the basin domains (Imerese-Sicanian domains) and the Iblean-Pelagian domain. This process drives the thinning of the thrusted units whose thickness and elevation decrease toward the south. As a consequence of these coupled processes (E-W extension and contractional deformation in NNW-SSE direction), the geological setting of Sicily is characterized by a deep basin (the Caltanissetta foredeep), evolved since the Tortonian times, and by a chain, which develops in W-E direction, in the northern sector. The thrusting is contemporaneous with lateral movements related to the E-W extension in the basin accompanied by the late Miocene-early Pleistocene clockwise rotations of the extensional structures, undergoing a tectonic inversion, during the progressively deformation of Sicilian margin. This extensional process involves the whole Sicily and it is responsible for the development not only of the Caltanissetta Basin but even of the northern Sicily offshore basins (e. g. the Cefalù basin). More in detail, the continuity of the extensional area is interrupted by an E-W trending regional structure (e. g. the Kumeta-Alcantara fault) that dislocates the different sector (the Caltanissetta Basin to the south and the Cefalù Basin to the north). Along this transpressional structure, which links the two different sector of the basin, the Sicilian Maghrebian chain develops starting from the Tortonian times. The extensional process in the Northern-Central Sicily Tyrrhenian margin ends in the late Pliocene when this sector of the Sicilian <b>chain</b> <b>welded</b> to Europe with cessation of extension in the southwestern Tyrrhenian Sea and with the formation of the Taormina Line, a major NW-SE boundary between Sicily and Calabrian Arc. From this time, the progressive migration of the thrust front, which is today located in the southern Sicily offshore and, on land, along the Gela-Catania alignment, is controlled by the Africa-Europe movement. Moreover, this model includes a self-consistent reconstruction of the southern Tyrrhenian Sea margin and of the tectonics that led to the formation of structural highs and deep sedimentary basins (Peri–Tyrrhenian basins) and of the Aeolian volcanoes...|$|R
