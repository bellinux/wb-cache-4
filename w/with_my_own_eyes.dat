The crisis of the individual is a product of the same modern organized social system that has provided many benefits. If the crisis becomes sufficiently severe, however, it can undermine all of those benefits, and there are signs that this is now happening. When the crisis of the natural environment becomes life-threatening, we pay attention. The crisis of the individual may be more life-threatening than we yet realize; the evidence of individual decay is all around us...|$|R

2500|$|The Baykalsk Pulp and Paper Mill was {{constructed}} in 1966, directly on the shoreline, bleaching paper with chlorine and discharging waste into Baikal. After decades of protest, the plant was closed in November 2008 due to unprofitability. In March 2009, the plant owner announced the paper mill would never reopen. On 4 January 2010, production was resumed. On 13 January 2010, Vladimir Putin introduced changes in the legislation legalising {{the operation of the}} mill, which brought about a wave of protests of ecologists and local residents. This was based on Putin's visual verification from a minisubmarine, [...] "I could see <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> — and scientists can confirm — Baikal is in good condition and there is practically no pollution". In September 2013, the mill underwent a final bankruptcy, with the last 800 workers slated to lose their jobs by 28 December 2013.

He decorated coronations of Paul (1797), Alexander I (1801) and Nicholas I (1826) while his lifelong benefactor Yusupov administered all three events. Gonzaga became a trusted consultant to heiress and later empress Maria Fyodorovna, Golitsyn and Yusupov families and diversified into decorating palace interiors and landscape design. Fyodor Glinka described Gonzaga's three-dimensional trompe-l'œil folly in Pavlovsk Park (1815): [...] "What {{is a reality}} and what is a dream? ...

Primary education was also declared free and available to every Filipino, regardless of race or social class.

2500|$|According to Matei Călinescu, Paul Georgescu made special {{efforts to}} push Marxist-Leninist rhetoric and {{conclusions}} into {{the texts of}} non-communist authors he reviewed for publishing, in particular those of philosopher and critic Tudor Vianu. In his recollections, first published in 1998, Călinescu wrote: [...] "In 1957-1958, [...] I could see <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> how the magazine's editor in chief, Paul Georgescu, was in the printing house, adding the political clichés and the daily slogans into the galley proofs of Tudor Vianu's weekly articles." [...] Călinescu focuses on one such instance, when Georgescu was reportedly so angered by a Vianu text on Renaissance humanism (lacking the obligatory mention of Marxist humanism), that he called him [...] "bourgeois pig" [...] and modified the piece to contain [...] "five or six ritualistic expressions in the wooden tongue". Constantin Ţoiu also recalled that his own relationship with Georgescu cooled when the latter discovered that Ţoiu was frequenting banned author Ion Negoiţescu—this, Ţoiu claimed, explains why {{he was no longer}} given permission to publish in Gazeta Literară. Georgescu took a personal part in condemning and marginalizing Negoiţescu (who was ultimately arrested in 1961), describing him as a [...] "reactionary" [...] author who had failed in adopting [...] "the judicious attitude".|$|E

Vette's research, along with other evidence, was presented to High Court Judge Peter Mahon, {{who was in charge of}} the commission. Vette served as an adviser to Mahon during the proceedings, and his findings proved especially influential. Justice Mahon even took a helicopter ride to Mt. Erebus during the course of his investigation to experience the phenomenon of sector whiteout for himself. As he later described it, [...] "I was taken for a flight myself in white out conditions and saw <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> the flat terrain of ice and snow stretching forth for more than forty miles when in fact right in front of us there was a snow ridge several hundred feet high". Mahon's final report was published on 27 April 1981, and it largely agreed with Vette's hypotheses. Mahon found Air New Zealand to be financially responsible, describing their attempts to shift the blame on to the late flight crew as [...] "very clearly part of an attempt to conceal a series of disastrous administrative blunders". ANZ appealed the ruling to the New Zealand Court of Appeal, and, although the financial penalties were ultimately removed, the court declined to overturn any of Mahon's factual findings.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{critics have}} argued that Smart's work {{comments}} on modern urban alienation, a post-industrial landscape that has fallen from human control. Others have cast him as a realist, hyper-realist, 'off-beat classicalist' and a metaphysical painter. Some critics have even referred to Smart's paintings as portraying 'Orwellian gloom' – a statement referring, in particular, to George Orwell's literary political masterpiece, Nineteen Eighty-Four. James Gleeson believes that Smart's paintings are [...] "too real to be real"; and believes that his realist portrayals of 20th century life {{are nothing more than}} superb geometrical compositions and bold colour, of man in his naturalistic, man-made environment. It is true, for instance, that trees are rarely seen in Jeffrey Smart's artworks, and the only grass is that growing between concrete stones, but as Smart claimed: [...] "an artist has to be moved to move his viewers", and Smart was moved by man in nature – man-made nature – not concerned with your typical Australian landscape. [...] "I like living in the 20th century – to me the world has never been more beautiful. I am trying to paint the real world I live in, as beautifully as I can <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes...</b> It's obvious a bunch of flowers or a billabong is beautiful, and I love natural beauty, but I am not moved by it.... to me composition is everything".

He said he had begged his officers to let him destroy more houses and added: [...] "I didn't see, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes,</b> people dying under the blade of the D-9 [...] and I didn't see house falling down on live people.

[...] "If we had moved into the building where they were ambushed, we would have buried all those Palestinians alive. [...] "I kept thinking of our soldiers. I didn't feel sorry for all those Palestinians who were left homeless. [...] I just felt sorry for their children, who were not guilty. There was one wounded child, who was shot by Arabs. A Golani paramedic came down and changed his bandages, till he was evacuated. We took care of them, of the children. The soldiers gave them candy. [...] But I had no mercy for the parents of these children. I remembered the picture on television, of the mother who said she will bear children so that they will explode in Tel Aviv.

2500|$|At the Hungarian {{left wing}} the Hungarian advance, {{covered by the}} cannons from the fortress, was stopped by the enemy cavalry, and pushed back to the {{so-called}} Star Fort of Komárom. The retreating Liebler-brigade was pursued towards Nagyigmánd by two regiments of the Hungarian hussars led by Major General József Nagysándor, supported by the 47th battalion and a 12-pound battery, but they were attacked from two sides by 4 enemy heavy cavalry regiments, which put the Hungarian cavalry in the danger of being obliterated, but {{the resistance of the}} infantry battalion, which entered quickly in a square formation, stopped the imperial cavalry. The Hungarian infantry from the Hungarian left wing retreated in square formations while shooting towards the center led by Damjanich. The 26th Hungarian battalion with a bayonet attack, forced the imperial heavy cavalry to retreat, saving the 47th battalion from a difficult situation, and holding until Damjanich sent the Ferdinánd Hussars to help them. With this on the left wing the Hungarians managed to hold the powerful imperial advance, so the battle here continued with artillery duel, until they run out of cannonballs.
