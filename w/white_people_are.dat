For example, researchers Raj Bhopal and Liam Donaldson opine that since <b>white</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> a heterogeneous group, the term white should therefore be abandoned as a classification {{for the purposes of}} epidemiology and health research, and identifications based on geographic origin and migration history be used instead.|$|E

The opposing faction is called One-Seedline Christian Identity and its adherents hold the view that all people are descended from Adam, but they believe that only Aryans (meaning Northern Europeans) are truly God's chosen people.|$|E

After a visit in which Reginald described the group's teachings, including the belief that <b>white</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> devils, Little concluded that every relationship he'd had with whites had been tainted by dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred. Little, whose hostility to religion had earned him the prison nickname [...] "Satan", became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam.|$|E

[...] The concept of racism as understood by a limited number of social scientists and some others, they allege, requires as a fundamental element a superior-to-inferior group-based power relationship, which a hate crime against white people they believe does not have. However, other social scientists who define racism in a broader sense realize [...] "whites" [...] have over the many centuries, and often do experience discrimination and segregation from their [...] "non white" [...] human cousins, because of their actually or perceived race. And since the components of discrimination and segregation exist within an academic definition of racism, [...] "whites" [...] have been, and many times are victims of racism. Current prison culture in America is a classic example of such discrimination and segregation, as whole groups, and different [...] "races" [...] are discriminated against and segregated based on such, with [...] "whites" [...] receiving more harsh treatment because of their perceived race and/or minority status in prison.|$|E
