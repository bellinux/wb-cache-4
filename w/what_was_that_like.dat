Statistical predictive validity has regularly been demonstrated for the complex selection procedure by which young high-potential administrative entrants are recruited to the Civil Service.

5000|$|A {{portmanteau}} language {{which is}} said to combine English and French syntax, grammar and lexicons to form a unique interlanguage, sometimes ascribed to mandatory basic French education in the Canadian anglophone school systems.

This phenomenon {{is more common in}} the eastern half of the country where there is a greater density of Francophone populations. Franglais can also refer to the supposed degradation of the French language thanks to the overwhelming impact Canadian English has on the country's Francophone inhabitants, though many linguists would argue that while English vocabulary can be freely borrowed as a stylistic device, the grammar of French has been resistant to influences from English and the same conservatism holds true in Canadian English grammar, even in Quebec City.|$|R

The study takes a quantitative approach for investigating how these two consumer types are affected by the store environment.

The results also showed that to make hedonic customers revisit the store, retailers should focus on the style of the store, floor space allocation, product presentation, sound level, lighting and the interior material.

40|$|In a prior study (Garrett, 2011), I {{introduced}} a simple thermodynamics-based economic growth model. By treating civilization as a whole, it <b>was</b> found <b>that</b> the global economy's {{current rate of}} energy consumption can be tied through a constant to its current accumulation of wealth. The value of the constant is λ = 9. 7 ± 0. 3 milliwatts per 1990 US dollar. Here, this model is coupled to a linear formulation {{for the evolution of}} atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Despite the model's extreme simplicity, multi-decadal hindcasts of trajectories in gross world product (GWP) and CO 2 agree closely with recent observations. Extending the model to the future, the model implies that the well-known IPCC SRES scenarios substantially underestimate how much CO 2 levels will rise for a given level of future economic prosperity. Instead, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> shown <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>like</b> a long-term natural disaster, future greenhouse warming should be expected to retard the real growth of wealth through inflationary pressures. Because wealth is tied to rates of energy consumption through the constant λ, it follows that dangerous climate change should be a negative feedback on CO 2 emission rates, and therefore the ultimate extent of greenhouse warming. Nonetheless, if atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are to remain below a "dangerous" level of 450 ppmv (Hansen et al., 2007), {{there will have to be}} some combination of an unrealistically rapid rate of energy decarbonization and a near immediate collapse of civilization wealth. Effectively, civilization is in a double-bind. If civilization does not collapse quickly this century, then CO 2 levels will likely end up exceeding 1000 ppmv; but, if CO 2 levels rise by this much, then the danger <b>is</b> <b>that</b> civilization will gradually tend towards collapse...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to its unique epistemology, Marx's theory is built on concepts—such as forces and relations of production—that have no counterpart in classical political economy. Even when existing terms are adopted—for example, the theory of surplus value, which combines David Ricardo's concepts of rent, profit, and interest—their meaning and relation to other concepts in the theory is significantly different. However, more fundamental to Marx's [...] "break" [...] is a rejection of homo economicus, or the idea, held by the classical economists, that the needs of individuals can {{be treated as a}} fact or [...] "given" [...] independent of any economic organisation. For the classical economists, individual needs can serve as a premise for a theory explaining the character of a mode of production and as an independent starting point for a theory about society. Where classical political economy explains economic systems as a response to individual needs, Marx's analysis accounts for a wider range of social phenomena in terms of the parts they play in a structured whole. Consequently, Marx's Capital has greater explanatory power than does political economy because it provides both a model of the economy and a description of the structure and development of a whole society. In Althusser's view, Marx does not simply argue <b>that</b> human needs <b>are</b> largely created by their social environment and thus vary with time and place; rather, he abandons the very idea <b>that</b> there can <b>be</b> a theory about <b>what</b> people <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> prior to any theory about how they come to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> way.|$|R

We had Roger George, who was quite a {{well-known}} special effects man. It went really well, though we had one little mishap that wasn’t really our fault—in the final shootout we blew up a blue van <b>that</b> <b>was</b> parked over an oil pipeline, so after the initial explosion the oil pipeline caught fire.Armitage says Jan Michael Vincent's character Ben Arnold was named after Benedict Arnold, Kris Kristofferson's character Aaron was named after Aaron Burr and Judson Prett's Harry Lee was Lighthorse Harry Lee:The entire movie is full of these very slightly coded reference to the Revolutionary War…although <b>What</b> I <b>was</b> really doing there <b>was</b> Vietnam. <b>What</b> would it <b>be</b> like if people took over your town, as we had been doing to the hamlets of Vietnam? What if we brought Vietnam back to America, <b>what</b> would <b>that</b> <b>be</b> <b>like?</b> <b>That’s</b> kind of <b>what</b> we <b>were</b> going after, but since the Bicentennial year was coming on and bringing a lot of revisionist history with it, I thought I’d include a little Revolutionary War in the recipe. I’ve always tried to include something subversive, not hidden from anyone, just for my own interests.The production designer was Jack Fisk. [...] "We had absolutely no money, no budget, but Jack did extraordinary things—and Sissy Spacek was our assistant art director on that," [...] said Armitage.Armitage says that once Kris Kristofferson agreed to do the film [...] "everybody else followed. Bernadette Peters wanted to work with him, Victoria Principal, and Jan-Michael came over... It was a good shoot, but it was rough. It was 30 days, it was 108 degrees in the Simi Valley, so {{a lot of it was}} tough to do. But we worked through it, finished on time and under budget." ...|$|R

It seems that they ill-used him so atrociously that, at last, his {{firmness}} gave way, and he did let out some information. Poor soul, the flesh is weak, you know. <b>What</b> it <b>was</b> he did not tell me. There was a crushed spirit in that mangled body. Nothing I found to say could make him whole. When they let him out, he crept into that hole, and bore his remorse stoically. He would not go near anyone he knew. I would have sought assistance for him, but, indeed, where could I have gone looking for it? Where was I to look for anyone who had anything to spare or any power to help? The people living round us were all starving and drunken. They were the victims of the Ministry of Finances. Don't ask me how we lived. I couldn't tell you. It was like a miracle of wretchedness. I had nothing to sell, and I assure you my clothes were in such a state <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> impossible for me {{to go out in the}} daytime. I was indecent. I had to wait till it was dark before I ventured into the streets to beg for a crust of bread, or whatever I could get, to keep him and me alive. Often I got nothing, and then I would crawl back and lie on the floor by the side of his couch. Oh yes, I can sleep quite soundly on bare boards. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> nothing, and I am only mentioning it to you so that you should not think I am a sybarite. It was infinitely less killing than the task of sitting for hours at a table in a cold study to take the books of Peter Ivanovitch from dictation. But you shall see yourself <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>like,</b> so I needn't say any more about it." ...|$|R
