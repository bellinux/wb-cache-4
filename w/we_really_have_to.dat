All <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is puncture the plane at a countably infinite set of points {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. But a closed contour in the punctured plane might encircle {{one or more of}} the poles of Γ(z), giving a contour integral that is not necessarily zero, by the residue theorem. By cutting the complex plane we ensure not only that Γ(z) is holomorphic in this restricted domain– we also ensure that the contour integral of Γ over any closed curve lying in the cut plane is identically equal to zero.|$|E

"One" [...] was {{released}} as the album's third single in February 1992 as a benefit single, {{with all of}} the band's royalties being donated to different AIDS research organisations for each country in which the single {{was released}}. The group's manager Paul McGuinness commented on their decision: [...] "The band feels that [...] is the most pressing issue of the day, and <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> focus people's attention to the AIDS plague that has been with us for 10 years." [...] To promote safe sex, U2 sold condoms bearing the album title Achtung Baby at their Zoo TV Tour concerts. The cover of the single release is a photograph by David Wojnarowicz. The photograph depicts buffaloes falling off a cliff after being chased by Native American hunters. The single's liner notes explain that Wojnarowicz [...] "identifies himself and ourselves with the buffalo, pushed into the unknown by forces we cannot control or even understand".|$|E

He attributes this work to why Advance Wars is so highly revered. In designing maps, he comments {{that it is impossible}} to please everyone, explaining that some people prefer maps where they start out weak and grow stronger, while others prefer to start out strong and tear through their opponent. His goal was to ensure that there were enough maps that people could say [...] "Here we go, here’s one of my maps. This is what I was waiting for". The mechanic of unlocking maps was introduced into the game as a means of getting gamers to play the game for longer. However, in an interview discussing why the feature was removed in the future title , a developer commented that it prevented people who were too busy to spend the time unlocking levels, and that there were better ways to keep players interested.|$|E

60|$|The {{reference}} to the future in this question is not essential. The same question arises when we apply the laws that work in our experience to past things of which we have no experience--as, for example, in geology, or in theories as to {{the origin of the}} Solar System. The question <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask is: 'When two things {{have been found to be}} often associated, and no instance is known of the one occurring without the other, does the occurrence of one of the two, in a fresh instance, give any good ground for expecting the other?' On our answer to this question must depend the validity of the whole of our expectations as to the future, the whole of the results obtained by induction, and in fact practically all the beliefs upon which our daily life is based.|$|E
