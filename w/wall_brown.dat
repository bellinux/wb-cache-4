500|$|In {{the course}} of {{gathering}} up these weapons, Vandygriff passed the dug-in position of Private First Class Melvin L. Brown, a BAR man in the 3rd Squad. Brown was next to the wall on the extreme left of the platoon position {{at a point where}} the wall was only about [...] high. At the bottom of the wall around Brown's position lay 15 to 20 North Korean dead. Earlier in the day, about 08:00, Kennedy had visited Brown and had seen five North Korean dead that Brown had killed with BAR fire. Subsequently, Brown exhausted his automatic rifle ammunition, then his few grenades, and finally he used his entrenching tool to knock the North Koreans in the head when they tried to climb over the <b>wall.</b> <b>Brown</b> had been slightly wounded in the shoulder early in the morning, but had bandaged it himself and refused to leave his position.|$|E

30|$|The wood {{samples in}} this study were well decayed in appearance. After lignin was removed from the cell walls using peracetic acid, a {{longitudinal}} surface was observed to assess the type of wood decay (i.e., white rot, brown rot, soft-rot type 1, and soft-rot type 2) [27 – 30]. White rot was identified by bore holes formed on cell <b>walls.</b> <b>Brown</b> rot was identified by cell wall thinning and/or crevices along the direction of microfibrils. Soft-rot type 1 (S 1) was identified by cavities with conical ends inside the walls and Soft-rot type 2 (S 2) was identified by irregular erosion on surface of inner cell wall (Table  1; Fig.  2). Only sample HIM 15 was observed to possess white rot through microscopic investigation. Bacteria were observed on the surface of cell walls in HIM 11.|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of the work of the 1st Marquess, Clandeboye is home to the largest area of {{broad-leaved}} woodland in Northern Ireland, consisting mostly of oak, birch, and beech. The estate is also home to a large variety of animal species; those recorded as present on the estate include the osprey, red kite, tree sparrow, barn owl, yellowhammer, song thrush, pipistrelle bat, red squirrel, fallow deer, common newt, marsh fritillary, and the <b>wall</b> <b>brown</b> butterfly.

50|$|Oystercatcher, curlew, lapwing, skylark, cuckoo, wheatear, pied flycatcher, siskin and {{hawfinch}} {{are just}} some of the 94 species of birds seen in the area. There are a large variety of butterflies in the countryside around the village, most notably the nationally rare pearl-bordered fritillary and the small pearl-bordered fritillary due to the mixture of upland, woodland and meadow habitats that are found. Common blue, <b>wall</b> <b>brown,</b> speckled wood, and small copper can also be regularly seen as well as many of the more common butterflies. There are many mammals in the area too, red squirrels, roe deer, foxes and badgers can all be regularly seen in woodland.|$|E
50|$|Several {{rare and}} {{beautiful}} moths and butterflies {{can be found}} within the reserve. Of the 23 butterfly species recorded at Murlough, the marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia), is of European importance - other notable species include dark-green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), grayling (Hipparchia semele) and cryptic wood white (Leptidea juvernica). One species, the <b>wall</b> <b>brown</b> butterfly (Lasiommata megera) has not been recorded {{for several years and}} is considered extinct at this site. Over 660 species of moth have been recorded within the boundary of Murlough Nature Reserve, more than at any other site in Northern Ireland - notable examples include small elephant hawkmoth (Deilephila porcellus), sand dart (Agrotis ripae) and the micro moths Pyrausta cingulata and Hysterophora maculosana. The total number of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) recorded within the nature reserve boundary is 685 (348 macro moths, 314 micro moths and 23 butterflies).|$|E
