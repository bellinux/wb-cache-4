25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of <b>wear</b> <b>particles,</b> ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E

Comparison of theory with experiment was based on Bryant’s particle ejection theory established for wear associated with thermal mounding on carbon graphite sliders. Contact between a slider and rotor initiates a thermal mound cycle in which extreme temperatures evolving inside the slider concentrates the contact into a thermal mound; during simulations, stresses intensify until material strengths are exceeded and stress failure creates a microcrack.

50|$|Plowing {{occurs when}} {{material}} is displaced to the side, {{away from the}} <b>wear</b> <b>particles,</b> resulting {{in the formation of}} grooves that do not involve direct material removal. The displaced material forms ridges adjacent to grooves, which may be removed by subsequent passage of abrasive particles. Cutting occurs when material is separated from the surface in the form of primary debris, or microchips, with little or no material displaced to the sides of the grooves. This mechanism closely resembles conventional machining. Fragmentation occurs when material is separated from a surface by a cutting process and the indenting abrasive causes localized fracture of the wear material. These cracks then freely propagate locally around the wear groove, resulting in additional material removal by spalling.|$|E

It is also imperative to always use the correct fluid for the system; the two types of fluids and their associated system components are not interchangeable.

Obviously oil or grease should be kept away from the contact surface because they would significantly reduce the coefficient of friction which could drastically decrease the torque potentially causing failure. Oil mist or lubricated particles can also cause surface contamination. Sometimes paper dust or other contamination can fall in between the contact surfaces. This can also result in a loss of torque. If a known source of contamination is going to be present many clutch manufactures offer contamination shields that prevent material from falling in between the contact surfaces.|$|E

Vibration and oil analysis have become the two most commonly used techniques for fault detection and tracking. These techniques are generally used independently as expert knowledge is required in each field, and {{due to a lack}} of understanding about how to integrate them. However, numerous case studies of machine failures have reported on the benefit of a correlated approach. This project focused on the development of an analytical strategy that, for the first time analyses vibration data in conjunction with oil and wear debris data for machine health assessment. In order to achieve the goal of developing a strategy for correlated application of vibration, oil and <b>wear</b> <b>particle</b> analysis using artificial intelligence, a number of project objectives were identified. The project objectives were to investigate the fault detection abilities of {{condition monitoring}} techniques as a basis for developing a correlated strategy, and finally to implement this strategy using artificial intelligence. These objectives were collated into a project plan that consisted of a comprehensive survey of condition monitoring techniques and correlation investigation, correlation strategy development, expert system development and a testing phase. The project was performed in a number of stages to allow the progress to be monitored. The first stage comprised a thorough literature review to ascertain the current research status in the condition monitoring field, as well as confirming the project objectives. The second and third stages were concerned with the preparation of spur and worm gearbox laboratory test rigs, and the operation of suitable experiments. The measured condition monitoring data allowed the fault detection of the vibration, oil and <b>wear</b> <b>particle</b> analysis techniques to be assessed. The data was also used for verification of the correlation strategy developed in stage four. Stage five was concerned with the development of three expert systems for vibration analysis, oil and <b>wear</b> <b>particle</b> analysis, and correlated condition analysis respectively. The expert system for correlated condition analysis was constructed using the correlation strategy of stage four of the project. All expert systems were thoroughly tested using laboratory and industry derived data to verify correct operation. The outcomes of this research project contribute to the current academic knowledge of the condition monitoring field, as well as provide industry with potential economic and environmental benefits. The novel strategy for correlation of vibration, oil and <b>wear</b> <b>particle</b> analysis techniques, as well as the demonstration of the effectiveness of the developed expert systems are contributed to the academic research community. The expert systems include additional innovative features such as a fault root-cause analysis algorithm, and a new strategy for machine remaining lifetime estimation using a wear approach that can be updated using condition monitoring data. The fully functional expert system software package complete with user interface is contributed to the industry partner Industrial and Technical Services for potential future commercialisation. The developments of this project can provide significant benefits to the mining, mineral processing and manufacturing industries if the project outcomes are implemented. The correlated condition monitoring strategy allows improved early fault detection, more reliable fault diagnosis and the ability to perform root-cause analysis, compared to conventional vibration, oil and <b>wear</b> <b>particle</b> analysis. These advances combine to improve the efficiency of the maintenance program resulting in increasing machine uptime, reduced maintenance costs and lower environmental impact. The adoption of the project developments could therefore ultimately improve the profitability of the venture, and help Australian operations to remain financially viable on a global scale...|$|R
