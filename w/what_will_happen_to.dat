He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E

25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others.

Peasant women blame not the wind but Khan Gzak for the devastation.

The two lovers sing of their joy of being reunited and of the expectation that Ivan will lead the Russians to victory against the Khan. Unaware of Igor's return, Skula and Yeroshka, the drunken gudok players, sing a song that mocks him. Then they notice him in the distance. After a moment of panic about <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them, Skula says that they should rely on their cunning and decides on a plan that will save them. They ring the church bells to summon a crowd.

500|$|Overall, [...] "House's Head" [...] {{was very}} well {{received}} by critics. [...] Sara Morrison, from Television Without Pity, called the moment that House gets back his memory [...] "the best ten minutes of television you might ever see".

500|$|The pair {{initially}} traveled mainly over flat snowfields. Nansen {{had allowed}} 50days {{to cover the}} [...] to the pole, requiring an average daily journey of seven nautical miles (13km; 8.1mi). On 22 March a sextant observation showed that the pair had travelled [...] towards the pole at a daily average of over nine nautical miles (17km; 10mi). This had been achieved despite very low temperatures, typically around , and small scale mishaps including {{the loss of the}} sledgemeter that recorded mileage. However, as the surfaces became uneven and made skiing more difficult, their speeds slowed. A sextant reading on 29 March of 85°56′N indicated that a week's travel had brought them [...] nearer to the pole, but also showed that their average daily distances were falling. More worryingly, a theodolite reading that day suggested that they were at only 85°15′N, and they had no means of knowing which of the readings was correct. They realised that they were fighting a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to northerly progression.

500|$|Tracing is {{a process}} that allows for the {{recovery}} of property (such as land or money) by the owner if it is taken involuntarily, and the owner has not consented to the transfer of title. This can be through theft, breach of trust, or mistake. Owners can recover their property and perhaps also any profits made from it, or in situations where the property cannot be recovered (as it has been mixed in with other property, or cannot be found), substitute property. The process has two steps, following and tracing. In Foskett v McKeown, Lord Millett defined them by saying that [...] " [...] are both exercises in locating assets which may or may be taken to represent an asset belonging to the [...] and to which they assert ownership. The process of following and tracing are, however, distinct. Following is the process of following the same asset as it moves from hand to hand. Tracing is the process of identifying a new asset as the substitute for the old". Following, therefore, is simply establishing who the original owner of property is, where that property is, and returning it to the original owner. Tracing arises when the property cannot be returned and the court is asked to recognise an interest in new property, such as whatever the defendant received in exchange for the claimant's original property. Tracing can occur at both the common law and equity. It is not a remedy for breach of trust; tracing is merely the process of identifying the property. It is then up to the courts to decide <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E
500|$|In 1982 Sheldon Jaffery and Roy Torgeson {{met with}} Weinberg to propose taking over as licensees, but Weinberg {{decided not to}} pursue the offer. [...] The {{following}} year, Brian Forbes approached Weinberg with another offer. Forbes' company, the Bellerophon Network, was an imprint of a Los Angeles company named The Wizard. [...] Ashley reports that Weinberg was only able to contact Forbes by phone, and even that was not always reliable, so negotiations were slow. [...] Forbes' editorial director was Gordon Garb and the fiction editor was Gil Lamont; Forrest Ackerman also assisted, mainly by obtaining material to include. [...] There {{was a good deal}} of confusion between the various participants in the project: according to Locus, a science fiction trade journal, [...] "Ackerman says he has had no contact with publisher Forbes, does not know <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the material he put together, and is as much in the dark as everybody else. [...] Lamont says that he is still renegotiating his contract and is not sure where he stands". The original plan was for the first issue to appear in August 1984, dated July/August, but before it appeared the decision was taken to change the contents, and a new, completely reset issue finally appeared {{at the end of the}} year, dated Fall 1984. [...] Even with this delay a final agreement had not yet been reached with Weinberg over licensing. [...] Only 12,500 copies were printed; these were sent to two distributors who both went into bankruptcy. [...] As a result, few copies were sold, and Forbes was not paid by the distributors. [...] Despite the financial setback, Forbes attempted to continue, and a second issue eventually appeared. [...] Its cover date was Winter 1985 but it was not published until June 1986. [...] Few copies were printed; reports vary between 1,500 and 2,300 in total. [...] Mark Monsolo was the fiction editor, but Garb continued as editorial director; Lamont was no longer involved with the magazine.|$|E

30|$|Our {{interpretation}} of this interaction {{is that in the}} middle of an event it is easier <b>to</b> predict <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> two <b>to</b> three seconds ahead, so viewers’ eyes are somewhat likely to jump ahead to the to-be-contacted object. For example, in Fig.  1, once the actor steps on the ladder and reaches up toward the chandelier with the streamer in his hand, it is fairly clear which object the actor is about to touch because there are no other objects nearby. When this happens, their eye may have moved on by the time the actor’s hand actually reaches the object, leading to decreased looking times right before contact. In contrast, near an event boundary it is more difficult to predict two to three seconds ahead, so the eye is more likely to reach the object being manipulated just before the actor’s hand arrives, leading to increased looking times right before contact. These effects are not huge but they appear robust.|$|R
40|$|Engagement {{with work}} {{involves}} many sub-activities. Folders and files creation {{are one of}} the sub activities which we engaged in achieving our task(s). The objective {{of this study is to}} understand how people manage information in these domains: desktop, folders, emails and bookmarks. A semi-structured interview on 17 computer users of different backgrounds has been conducted. The average time taken was 45 to 60 minutes. During the interview sessions, we prompted the users to show us and guide us through their desktop screen, folders, emails and web bookmarks. Using this method, we identified similar patterns among these users in how they make a folder in root directory environment, in emails and in bookmarks. We found two types of folder creations: pre-folder and post-folder.
