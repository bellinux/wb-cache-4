5000|$|... 1. Fast: If the {{listener}} <b>is</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> or {{her head in}} quick succession, it implies {{that he or she}} disagrees with the speaker and wants to take the speaker's role.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even if that coach driver <b>is</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> fist at us, eh?" [...] {{answered}} Dave, and he bobbed {{his head}} {{in the direction of the}} coach, which had hauled up but was now going on.|$|R
60|$|There were exclamations of doubt, and Koogah, whose years <b>were</b> many, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|R

Good-by; I shan't see you again {{for a week or}} so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, some drunken man, I suppose," [...] {{answered}} the lime-burner; [...] "some merry fellow from the bar-room in the village, who dared not laugh loud enough within doors lest he should blow {{the roof of}} the house off. So here he <b>is,</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> jolly sides at the foot of Graylock." ...|$|R

60|$|From {{the tone}} {{in which this}} was said Ruby knew that the captain <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> head gravely, and from the noise of {{articles}} being kicked about and falling, he became aware that the unconquerable man was filling a fifth pipe.|$|E
60|$|She {{sank into}} a chair, leaning back, with her knees crossed; {{and at that}} moment Noel admired her. She had said it beautifully; she looked so calm. Fort was {{lighting}} her cigarette; his hand <b>was</b> <b>shaking,</b> <b>his</b> face all sorry and mortified.|$|E

60|$|No one answered. Lemuel stood {{pale and}} silent, {{fronting}} the porter, who <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> fist in his face. He {{had not heard}} anything definite in the outrage that assailed him. He only conjectured that it was exposure of Williams's character, {{and the story of}} his own career in Boston.|$|E
60|$|At her {{declaration}} {{the preacher}} gave a start {{that must have}} been suspicion or confirmation, or both. He bent low to peer into the face of the dead Pearce.

60|$|His {{remarks were}} {{suddenly}} {{cut short by}} a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left.

60|$|The Poonga-Poonga men's {{laughter}} died down, {{and they}} regarded the spectacle with glittering eyes and gluttonous expressions. The Tahitians, {{on the other}} hand, were shocked, and Adamu Adam <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> head slowly and grunting forth his disgust. Joan was angry. Her face was white, but in each cheek was a vivid spray of red. Disgust had been displaced by wrath, and her mood was clearly vengeful.|$|E
60|$|But now Mr. May {{had laid}} his detaining hand on James's arm. And now he <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> {{employer}} by the hand.

60|$|No, Sahib! It is useless. You {{can hear}} him trumpet. He is telling Kala Nag that he cannot come over. See! He has swung round and <b>is</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> head. He <b>is</b> no fool. He knows what the Barhwi means when it is angry. Aha! Indeed, thou art no fool, my child! Salaam, Ram Pershad, Bahadur! Take him under the trees, mahout, and see that he gets his spices. Well done, thou chiefest among tuskers. Salaam to the Sirkar and go to sleep.|$|R
