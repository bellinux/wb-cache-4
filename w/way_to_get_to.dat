5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways to get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad with the rest of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Masada's western side.|$|E
5|$|The {{city also}} has water {{transportation}} that ply the Terengganu River. The lifeline {{between the north}} and south parts of the city are the water taxis more popularly known as bot penambang. Bot penambang are engined, roofed wooden boats made to carry passengers from Seberang Takir Jetty and Pulau Duyong Kecil Jetty to Kuala Terengganu Jetty. It is the easiest and shortest <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the city. There are also ferry services to the resort island of Redang and other small islands, although these services are mainly carried out by modern express ferries. The ferries dock at Syahbandar Jetty, {{just in front of the}} General Post Office.|$|E

The party also learns that the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Demon Lord is through Zenith Tower, but to activate the tower, they need to collect the sword, armor, shield, and helmet of legend. While doing so, the Hero meets his double in Real Weaver's Peak, who gets spooked, and speaks 'Y-You. Y-You're m-m-me!', and says that he must prove himself {{to be faithful to}} his family if he is to join powers. Returning to Real Somnia, the King and Queen tell the Hero that he is indeed the prince. When he fused with his clone, the Hero gained his memory back, much like Ashlynn and Carver had done.|$|E

When Teleri refused to give or lend their ships, Fëanor ordered the Noldor to take the ships. The Teleri resisted, and a battle broke out, in which many of them were slain. The battle became known as the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, or the first kinslaying. His sons would commit two other acts of warfare against elves in Middle-earth in his name.|$|E

25|$|A ferry {{service from}} St. George to 39th Street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, became city-operated in 1906. A second route from St. George to Brooklyn, was created on July 4, 1912, with the Brooklyn & Richmond Ferry Company {{providing}} service to 69th Street in Bay Ridge. This service was infrequent, and in March 1924, New York City Plant and Structures Commissioner Grover A. Whalen {{suggested that the}} 69th Street service be placed under city operation. In June 1924, the route to 39th Street {{was taken over by}} the New York Bay Ferry. By the end of that summer, the three ferry routes were advertised as the most convenient <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Staten Island until a tunnel between Staten Island and Brooklyn could be completed.

25|$|Under the {{development}} plan, future phases {{would see the}} addition of several new midfield concourses and a new south terminal. A fourth runway (parallel to the existing runways 1 and 19 L) opened in 2008, and development plans include a fifth runway to parallel the existing runway 12–30. If this runway is built, the current runway will be redesignated as 12L-30R while the new runway will be designated 12R-30L. An expansion of the B concourse, used by many low cost airlines as well as international arrivals, has been completed, and the building housing Concourses C and D will eventually be knocked down {{to make room for}} a more ergonomic building. Because Concourses C and D are temporary concourses, the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> those concourses is via moving walkway from the Concourse C station which is built in the location of the future gates and Concourse D by mobile lounge from the main terminal.|$|E
25|$|The vagrants Varlaam and Misail, who {{are dressed}} as monks and are begging for alms, and their {{companion}} Grigoriy, {{who is in}} secular garb, arrive and enter. After exchanging greetings, Varlaam requests some wine. When the Hostess returns with a bottle, he drinks and launches into a ferocious song ("So {{it was in the}} city of Kazan") of Ivan the Terrible's siege of Kazan. The two monks quickly become tipsy, and soon begin to doze. Grigoriy quietly asks the Hostess for directions to the Lithuanian border. The Hostess mentions that the police are watching the ordinary roads, but they are wasting their time, because there is an alternative, less well-known <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the border. Policemen appear in search of a fugitive heretic monk (Grigoriy) who has run off from the Chudov Monastery declaring that he will become Tsar in Moscow. Noticing Varlaam's suspicious appearance and behavior, the lead policeman thinks he has found his man. He cannot read the ukaz (edict) he is carrying, however, so Grigoriy volunteers to read it. He does so, but, eyeing Varlaam carefully, he substitutes Varlaam's description for his own. The policemen quickly seize Varlaam, who protests his innocence and asks to read the ukaz. Varlaam is only barely literate, but he manages to haltingly read the description of the suspect, which of course matches Grigoriy. Grigoriy brandishes a dagger, and leaps out of the window. The men set off in pursuit.|$|E

Each of these routes had its own deadly hazards, from shipwreck to typhoid fever and cholera.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{felt that}} the chronological running order put more {{emphasis}} on the band's well-regarded earlier periods. [...] "The selection of songs perhaps indicates Garbage view their career the same way many fans do", wrote Victoria Durham of Rock Sound, and [...] "that they never quite managed [...] the brilliance of their early work." [...] Johnny Dee of Classic Rock expressed, [...] "The later material here sounds formulaic, however, new song [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] adds strings to the dynamic and sits well alongside their peerless early material". AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered that despite ignoring 2000s singles such as [...] "Run Baby Run", [...] "it already seems that the comp has lingered far longer than necessary on the last stage of Garbage's career", {{in contrast to the}} debut album singles [...] "still sounding sleek and alluring." [...] Kerrang! magazine's Tom Byrant also felt that Garbage's work had dated, expounding, [...] "Something that was once {{so much a part of}} the Zeitgeist has remained rooted to the era it marked, untranslatable across the millennial divide. Still, songs like 'Stupid Girl' and 'Only Happy When It Rains' [...] maintain an urgency and spite that sees their intent remain intact." [...] Billboard writer Kerri Mason praised the choice of remixes on the special edition: [...] "the band continually brought the best of dance's best producers, not one of the thirteen tracks is a throwaway." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH called the compilation a [...] "deserved retrospective", further noting that [...] "the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know Garbage is through their albums, which demonstrate their strength in depth.
