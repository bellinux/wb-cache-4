2500|$|The Nation of October 1987 noted: [...] "'Hill was shaken, {{he became}} very disturbed, {{by the case}} of the son of a thirty-year embassy employee, a student who was arrested, never to be seen again,' {{recalled}} former New York Times reporter [...] 'Hill took a personal interest.' He went to the Interior Minister, an army general with whom he had worked on drug cases, saying, 'Hey, what about this? We're interested in this case.' He buttonholed (Foreign Minister Cesar) Guzzetti and, finally, President Jorge R. Videla himself. 'All he got was stonewalling; he got nowhere.' de Onis said. 'His last year was marked by increasing disillusionment and dismay, and he backed his staff on human rights right to the hilt." [...] "It sickened me," [...] said Patricia Derian, the Mississippi civil rights crusader who became President Jimmy Carter's State Department point person on human rights, after Hill reported to her Kissinger's real role, [...] "that with an imperial <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> an American could sentence people to death {{on the basis of a}} cheap whim. As time went on I saw Kissinger's footprints in a lot of countries. It was the repression of a democratic ideal." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a case in}} point, Hazlitt {{brings in}} Irving's own mentor, the Scottish theologian, scientist, philosopher, and {{minister}} Dr. Thomas Chalmers (1780â€“1847), whom Hazlitt had heard preach in Glasgow. Comparing the published writings of both men, Chalmers was, thought Hazlitt, much more interesting as a thinker. Although he ultimately dismisses Chalmers' arguments as [...] "sophistry", Hazlitt admires the elder clergyman's [...] "scope of intellect" [...] and [...] "intensity of purpose". His Astronomical Discourses were engaging enough that Hazlitt had eagerly read through the entire volume at a sitting. His claim to our attention must rest on his writings; his unprepossessing appearance and ungainly manner in themselves, maintains Hazlitt, drew no audience. Chalmers' follower Irving, on the other hand, gets by {{on the strength of}} his towering physique and the novelty of his performances; judging him as a writer (his For the Oracles of God, Four Orations had just gone into a third edition), [...] Hazlitt finds that [...] "the ground work of his compositions is trashy and hackneyed, though set off by extravagant metaphors and an affected phraseology ... without the turn of his head and <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> his periods have nothing in them ... he himself is the only idea with which he has yet enriched the public mind!" ...|$|E
60|$|Herr Freudenberg smiled. With a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{they were}} alone.|$|E
50|$|Sumyeong Jangja {{sent out}} all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> horses, bulls and hounds at the Cheonjiwang, {{but with a}} <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> <b>hands,</b> all the beasts {{suddenly}} found themselves atop the roof of Sumyeong Jangja's palace. With another <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> <b>hands,</b> the iron pots in Sumyeong Jangja's kitchen launched themselves into Sumyeong Jangja's garden.|$|R
6000|$|And {{while she}} grovelled at his feet, [...] She felt the King's breath wander o'er her neck, [...] And in the {{darkness}} o'er her fallen head, [...] Perceived the <b>waving</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> that blest.|$|R
60|$|It was in {{the eastern}} or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang {{throughout}} the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the <b>waving</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|Old Mazey {{dismissed}} {{the subject with}} another dreary <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|So saying, with a {{peremptory}} <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{he dismissed}} his nephew.|$|E
60|$|The Commissioner {{dismissed}} {{the whole thing}} airily with a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{those same}} gentlemen who wear red coats are marching in the {{direction}} of the Hamilton plantation," [...] little Frenchie said with another shrug <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoulders and a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> as if to intimate that there was very much more which he might say, and I, understanding somewhat of the gesture, cried out impatiently: ...|$|R
60|$|Dom Clemente smoked out his {{cigarette}} before he answered, {{and then he}} <b>waved</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was {{a hoarse}} {{cry from the}} men, which Francesco silenced by a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mailed <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{then turned}} from one {{combatant}} to the other, with a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Clay {{indicated}} the handsome room and its rich fittings with a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Herr Freudenberg was {{thoughtful}} {{for several}} moments. Then with a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> he dismissed Estermen.|$|E
6000|$|Isobel {{turned red}} and uttered an exclamation, but enjoining silence on {{her with a}} <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fat <b>hand,</b> her father went on: ...|$|R
60|$|A very grim look {{came over}} {{his face as he}} spoke, {{and it seemed to me}} that all that was French had gone out of him, and that it was the pure Corsican, the man of strong passions and of strange revenges, who stood before me. His memory had gone back to those early days <b>of</b> <b>his,</b> and for five minutes, wrapped in thought, he paced up and down the room with his quick little tiger steps. Then with an {{impatient}} <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> he came back to his palace and to me.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{following}} a counting session, the Count would laugh maniacally, [...] "AH AH AH AH AH!", accompanied by thunder and lightning flashes. He wouldn't let anything interrupt his counting, and used hypnotic powers to temporarily stun {{people with a}} <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> This practice, however, was discontinued in the mid-1970s because of concern that young viewers would become frightened. In the mid-1970s, the Count became friendlier, did not have hypnotic powers, and interacted more with the characters (both live actors and Muppets). His laugh also changed from maniacal laughter to a more triumphant, stereotypical Dracula-style laugh.|$|R
60|$|He wheeled {{his chair}} around, and {{invited me to}} {{accompany}} him with a courteous <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|With a last <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> he rode off, {{the chief}} and his six companions {{trotting}} alongside.|$|E
60|$|Llewellyn made no reply, {{but with}} a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> turned and went down the hill again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, then, comrades," [...] said Gaffer Ditchley, [...] "an it be as Master Lance says, I {{think we}} should bear a hand for stout old Sir Geoffrey, against a low-born mean-spirited fellow like Bridgenorth, who shut up a shaft had cost thousands, without getting a penny profit on't. So hurra for Sir Geoffrey, and down with the Rump! But hold ye a blink--hold"--(and the <b>waving</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> stopped the commencing cheer)--"Hark ye, Master Lance, it must be all over, for the beacon is as black as night; and you know {{yourself}} that marks the Lord's death." ...|$|R
50|$|The video {{starts with}} a shy female hard rock fan walking through the {{corridors}} of a school, singing softly along to the song playing on her headset. She reaches an entrance to the gym, where she stands watching the cheerleaders practice. Suddenly, the lights flicker and go out, and a wind starts to blow. As the chorus starts to play, {{the doors to the}} gym are blown off of their hinges by Mr. Lordi, who enters and crushes the now-screaming cheerleaders with a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> killing them. There is a fiery flash, and the entire band appears in the centre of the gym, playing the song.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the current}} maid bawled up-stairs, [...] "Supper on de table!" [...] Kennicott was upon his back, {{flapping}} <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in the earnest {{effort to be}} a seal, thrilled by the strength with which his son kicked him. He slipped his arm about Carol's shoulder; {{he went down to}} supper rejoicing that he was cleansed of perilous stuff. While Carol was putting the baby to bed he sat on the front steps. Nat Hicks, tailor and roue, came to sit beside him. Between <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> as he drove off mosquitos, Nat whispered, [...] "Say, doc, you don't feel like imagining you're a bacheldore again, and coming out for a Time tonight, do you?" ...|$|R
60|$|With a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> enjoining silence, Tull {{stepped forward}} {{in such a}} way that he {{concealed}} Venters.|$|E
60|$|And Daylight, with a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> {{definitely}} {{indicated the}} whole landscape and the creeks that lay beyond the divides.|$|E
60|$|Renewed applause bore {{witness to}} the {{popularity}} of The Philanthropist, whom Mr. Bryan had indicated with a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Ef {{you mean}} by that, sir, that ye reckon ye won't return my fire, ye're blind and wrong. For it will do you no good with them," [...] {{he said with a}} {{significant}} <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> crippled <b>hand</b> towards the following crowd, [...] "nor me neither." ...|$|R
60|$|Startling as this {{admission}} {{might have}} been to any other lawyer, Starbottle was absolutely relieved by it. The absence of any mirth-provoking correspondence, and the appeal solely to <b>his</b> own powers <b>of</b> persuasion, actually struck his fancy. He lightly put aside the compliment with a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> white <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep your seat, old man," [...] {{said the}} visitor, with an airy <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> large <b>hand.</b> [...] "My name's Smith; and I've {{come in a}} yacht. You are the consul--is that right? A big, cool guy on the beach {{directed}} me here. Thought I'd pay my respects to the flag." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked around}} at his {{companion}} with a little <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> which seemed to deprecate {{the mention of the}} subject.|$|E
60|$|With a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> Macnab tramped on ahead, the sleigh-bells {{rang out}} merrily {{and the rest}} of the party followed.|$|E
60|$|And with a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> he {{disappeared}} abruptly {{down a flight}} of steps and under the shadow of a ponderous arch.|$|E
60|$|He paused, {{and with}} a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thick, short-fingered <b>hand</b> he {{dismissed}} this less important subject-matter and once more spoke with his wonted eagerness on that which lay nearest his heart.|$|R
60|$|But now Mr. May {{had laid}} <b>his</b> detaining <b>hand</b> on James's arm. And {{now he was}} shaking his {{employer}} by the hand. And now James, in his cheap little cap, was smiling a formal farewell. And Mr. May, with a graceful <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grey-suÃ¨de-gloved <b>hand,</b> was {{turning back to the}} Moon and Stars, strutting, whilst James was running home on tip-toe, in his natural hurry.|$|R
6000|$|My uncle's {{house in}} Jermyn Street {{was quite a}} small one--five rooms and an attic. [...] "A man-cook and a cottage," [...] he said, [...] "are all that a wise man requires." [...] On the other hand, it was {{furnished}} with the neatness and taste which belonged to his character, so that his most luxurious friends found something in the tiny rooms which made them discontented with their own sumptuous mansions. Even the attic, which had been converted into my bedroom, was the most perfect little bijou attic that could possibly be imagined. Beautiful and valuable knick-knacks filled every corner of every apartment, and the house had become a perfect miniature museum which would have delighted a virtuoso. My uncle explained the presence of all these pretty things with a shrug <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoulders and a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] "They are des petites cadeaux," [...] said he, [...] "but {{it would be an}} indiscretion for me to say more." ...|$|R
