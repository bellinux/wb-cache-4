25|$|Although {{many aspects}} of the {{internment}} camps caused negative changes within the Japanese-Canadian community, some of these changes had limited positive impacts. For example, many women faced lesser domestic responsibilities within the internment camps. Living spaces were small and crowded so cleaning was shared among multiple woman and took less time than at home. Childcare was also less taxing on women because the cramped quarters allowed for multiple women to care for children at once. In addition, new-found free time allowed younger women to get education and older women to participate in <b>wage-earning</b> jobs, such as workers on beet farms.|$|E
25|$|In February 1996, the United States {{agreed to}} pay Iran US$131.8 million in {{settlement}} to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice relating to this incident, together with other earlier claims before the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. US$61.8 million of the claim was in compensation for the 248 Iranians killed in the shoot-down: $300,000 per <b>wage-earning</b> victim and $150,000 per non-wage-earner. In total, 290 civilians on board were killed, 38 being non-Iranians and 66 being children. It was not disclosed how the remaining $70 million of the settlement was apportioned, though it appears a close approximation {{of the value of}} a used A300 jet at the time.|$|E
25|$|George J. F. Clarke owned ten adult working slaves. Four were women, {{one of whom}} {{tended to}} his household, {{and the other three}} were hired out as laundresses or house servants. The six men labored mostly in his timber {{business}} alongside rented slaves and <b>wage-earning</b> freemen. Clarke was among the province's prominent citizens who admitted fathering children by black women, enslaved and free. He lived as husband and wife with Flora Leslie, a former slave whom he had freed, and made their children his heirs, dividing his property among them in his will. He had four children by another black woman named Anna or Hannah Benet after Flora died; they and she were left a legacy of 1,500 acres as well.|$|E
25|$|Often {{times after}} {{internment}} families {{could not be}} reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community lead to an even more intensified gap between the generations. Children had no one with whom to speak Japanese outside the home {{and as a result}} they rarely learned the language fluently. The lack of community also led to a lack of Japanese foundation and many children lost touch with their culture. Mothers had also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on <b>wage-earning</b> jobs, which meant that they had less time to teach their children about traditional Japanese culture and traditions. The internment camps had forever changed the way of Japanese-Canadian life.|$|E
25|$|Costa Rica {{has been}} cited in various {{journals}} as Central America's great health success story. Its healthcare system is ranked {{higher than that of}} the United States, despite having a fraction of its GDP. Prior to 1940, government hospitals and charities provided most health care. But since the 1941 creation of the Social Insurance Administration (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social – CCSS), Costa Rica has provided universal health care to its <b>wage-earning</b> residents, with coverage extended to dependants over time. In 1973, the CCSS took over administration of all 29 of the country's public hospitals and all health care, also launching a Rural Health Program (Programa de Salud Rural) for primary care to rural areas, later extended to primary care services nationwide. In 1993, laws were passed to enable elected health boards that represented health consumers, social insurance representatives, employers, and social organizations. By the year 2000, social health insurance coverage was available to 82% of the Costa Rican population. Each health committee manages an area equivalent to one of the 83 administrative cantons of Costa Rica. There is limited use of private, for-profit services (around 14.4% of the national total health expenditure). About 7% of GDP is allocated to the health sector, and over 70% is government funded.|$|E

On the evening of 27 February 2002, Vishwa Hindu Parishad declared a statewide strike in response to the Godhra train burning incident, starting from 28 February. On {{the first day of the}} strike, a mob of approximately 5,000 people, allegedly led by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Bajrang Dal, attacked and attempted to burn the entire Muslim community of Naroda Patiya. The rioting began at 9 am when the Noorani Mosque was destroyed by exploding liquified petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders.|$|E
500|$|Malawi's economy while Banda was {{president}} was {{often cited as}} an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development. While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the <b>wage-earning</b> workforce. All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called Kamuzu Academy (Eton of Africa). In Banda's own words [...] "I do not want my boys and girls to do what I had to do — to leave their homes and their families and go away from Malawi to get an education", was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi.|$|E
500|$|Herodotus (III, 137-38), {{who lived}} some years after Milo's death, says the wrestler {{accepted}} {{a large sum}} of money from the distinguished physician Democedes {{for the privilege of}} marrying Milo's daughter. [...] If Herodotus is indeed correct, then Milo was probably not a member of Croton's nobility for such an arrangement with a <b>wage-earning</b> physician would have been beneath the dignity of a Greek noble. Democedes was a native of Croton and enjoyed a successful career as a physician at Croton, Aegina, Athens, and Samos. He was captured by Darius in the defeat of the Samian tyrant Polycrates and taken to the Persian capital of Susa as a slave. [...] There, he carefully tended both the king and queen and was eventually permitted to revisit Croton, but under guard. [...] He escaped his Persian guards and made his way to Croton, where he married Milo's daughter. [...] The physician sent a message regarding his marriage to Darius, who was an admirer of the wrestler and can only have learned of him through Democedes during his slavery at Susa.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of the repressive campaign of the National Guard, in 1975 a group within the FSLN's urban mobilization arm began to question the viability of the GPP.

2500|$|Homeowners {{are usually}} {{expected}} to put approximately 500hours of [...] "sweat equity" [...] {{into their own}} or other project homes, although this amount may vary by location, the number of <b>wage-earning</b> adults in each family, and the recipients' health issues. This sweat equity acts as the down payment on the home. Every hour spent earning this sweat equity must be approved and signed off on by an official Habitat for Humanity representative. Sweat equity has no monetary value and cannot be 'refunded'.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "labour-leisure" [...] {{tradeoff}} is the tradeoff {{faced by}} <b>wage-earning</b> human beings between {{the amount of}} time spent engaged in wage-paying work (assumed to be unpleasant) and satisfaction-generating unpaid time, which allows participation in [...] "leisure" [...] activities and the use of time to do necessary self-maintenance, such as sleep. The key to the tradeoff is a comparison between the wage received from each hour of working and the amount of satisfaction generated by the use of unpaid time.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{increasing}} inequality, {{the effect of}} Bush's tax cuts on the upper, middle and lower class is contentious. Some economists argue that the cuts have benefited the nation's richest households {{at the expense of}} the middle and lower class, while libertarians and conservatives have claimed that tax cuts have benefitted all taxpayers. Economists Peter Orszag and William Gale described the Bush tax cuts as reverse government redistribution of wealth, [...] " [...] the burden of taxation away from upper-income, capital-owning households and toward the <b>wage-earning</b> households of the lower and middle classes." ...|$|E

The Division focused on three types of settlements communities of part-time farmers near <b>wage-earning</b> employment, communities of farmers resettled from unproductive land, and communities of [...] "stranded" [...] industrial workers, namely miners and loggers. The latter type, which eventually included Cumberland Homesteads, drew the most criticism, as many believed such communities would never be self-supporting.|$|E
2500|$|When {{questioned}} in 1920 by Rep. Tinkham about why {{all members of}} the Women’s Bureau were unmarried, Van Winkle explained that, “I really do not personally approve of having married women away from their families, and we think it would be bad for the work to have her divided attention, as our work demands our whole attention.” Speaking more generally in 1928, she stated that “the average <b>wage-earning</b> wife is not intelligent enough to manage both home and job,” and “most women who babble of careers would be better off as homemakers.” ...|$|E

Her original [...] "Third Grade" [...] teaching certificate {{can be seen on}} page 25 of William Anderson's book Laura's Album (1998). She later admitted she did not particularly enjoy teaching but felt the responsibility from a young age to help her family financially, and <b>wage-earning</b> opportunities for women were limited. Between 1883 and 1885, she taught three terms of school, worked for the local dressmaker, and attended high school, although she did not graduate.|$|E

2500|$|More {{economic}} opportunity for Harkers Island came {{as the country}} began pulling itself out of the Great Depression. Electrification came to the island in 1939. The Harkers Island Rural Electric Authority was the first electrical cooperative in the United States to supply power to members through a submarine cable system. In November 1941, {{the construction of a}} new United States Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry Point, [...] to the northwest of Harkers Island, brought more <b>wage-earning</b> jobs to the local economy. When the United States entered World War II, Harkers Island was on the front lines. German submarines patrolled the North Carolina coast and sank merchant shipping traffic, especially oil tankers. Island residents could watch the tankers burning offshore at night. Further improvements in the island's utility services would have to wait until after the war. Telephone service finally arrived in 1948. The man who primarily owned most of the property on Harkers Island at this time was Earl Davis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{industry}} was tightly controlled by descendants of missionary families and other Caucasian businessmen, concentrated in corporations known in Hawaii as [...] "The Big Five". [...] These included Castle & Cooke, Alexander & Baldwin, C. Brewer & Co., H. Hackfeld & Co. (later named American Factors (now Amfac) and Theo H. Davies & Co., which together eventually gained control over {{other aspects of}} the Hawaiian economy including banking, warehousing, shipping, and importing. [...] This control of commodity distribution kept Hawaiians burdened under high prices and toiling under a diminished quality of life. [...] These businessmen had perfected the double-edged sword of a <b>wage-earning</b> labor force dependent upon plantation goods and services. [...] Close ties as missionaries to the Hawaiian monarchy along with capital investments, cheap land, cheap labor, and increased global trade, allowed them to prosper. Alexander & Baldwin acquired additional sugar lands and also operated a sailing fleet between Hawai`i and the mainland; the shipping concern became American-Hawaiian Line, and later Matson. [...] Later the sons and grandsons of the early missionaries played central roles in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893, creating a short-lived republic. In 1898, the Republic of Hawaii was annexed by the United States and became the Territory of Hawaii, aided by the lobbying of the sugar interests.|$|E

60|$|In {{its early}} days, {{socialism}} was a revolutionary movement {{of which the}} object was the liberation of the <b>wage-earning</b> classes {{and the establishment of}} freedom and justice.

60|$|The {{method of}} gradual reform has many merits as {{compared}} to the method of revolution, and I have no wish to preach revolution. But gradual reform has certain dangers, to wit, the ownership or control of businesses hitherto in private hands, and by encouraging legislative interference for the benefit of various sections of the <b>wage-earning</b> classes. I think it is at least doubtful whether such measures do anything at all to contribute toward the ideals which inspired the early socialists and still inspire the great majority of those who advocate some form of socialism.|$|E
60|$|Kennicott {{had never}} thought of giving her an allowance. His mother had never had one! As a <b>wage-earning</b> {{spinster}} Carol had asserted to her fellow librarians that when she was married, {{she was going to have}} an allowance and be business-like and modern. But it was too much trouble to explain to Kennicott's kindly stubbornness that she was a practical housekeeper as well as a flighty playmate. She bought a budget-plan account book and made her budgets as exact as budgets are likely to be when they lack budgets.|$|E

60|$|These {{thoughts}} passed swiftly {{through his}} mind, {{and he decided}} to ask her. It was a breach of etiquette, of course, but oftentimes <b>wage-earning</b> girls waived formalities in matters of this kind.

His ten dollars, discreetly expended, would enable the two to dine very well indeed. The dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull routine of the girl's life; and her lively appreciation of it would add to his own triumph and pleasure.|$|E
60|$|For instance, I {{talked to}} two decidedly {{thoughtful}} fellow journalists immediately on my arrival {{at a town}} in which {{there had been some}} labour troubles. I told them my general view of Labour in the very largest and perhaps the vaguest historical outline; pointing out that the one great truth to be taught to the middle classes was that Capitalism was itself a crisis, and a passing crisis; that it was not so much that it was breaking down as that it had never really stood up. Slaveries could last, and peasantries could last; but <b>wage-earning</b> communities could hardly even live, and were already dying.|$|E

[...] "It is impossible fairly to pass upon {{the methods of}} labor unions, or to devise plans for remedying their abuses, until it is recognized, to begin with, that unions are based upon class antagonism and that their policies are dictated by the necessities of social warfare. A strike is a rebellion against the owners of property. The rights of property are protected by government. And a strike, under certain provocation, may extend as far as did the general strike in Belgium a few years since, when practically the entire <b>wage-earning</b> population stopped work in order to force political concessions from the property-owning classes. This is an extreme case, but it brings out vividly the real nature of labor organization as a species of warfare whose object is the coercion of one class by another class." ...|$|E

Let us suppose that {{as time goes}} by the Authorities become more and more {{convinced}} {{of the value of the}} Army's prison work, and pass over to its care criminals in ever-increasing numbers, as they are doing in some other countries and in the great Colonies, what will be the effect upon the Army itself? Will not this mass of comparatively useless material clog the wheels of the great machine by overlading it with a vast number of ex-prisoners, some of whom, owing to their age or other circumstances, are quite incapable of earning their livelihood, and therefore must be carried till their deaths? When I put the query to those in command, the answer given was that they did not think so, as they believed that the Army would be able to turn the great majority of these men into respectable, <b>wage-earning</b> members of society.|$|E
60|$|The end {{of their}} {{enterprise}} came suddenly. A disaster in his family left Trowse unexpectedly poor. It was necessary {{for him to take}} at once some <b>wage-earning</b> position. The two young men parted, curiously enough, without regret. Powers, though no sentimentalist, possessed his due share of the affections, had an innate love for the beautiful, and a longing for a catholic and universal understanding of his fellows. Where Trowse would gaze with unmoved face, and pursue his calm calculations, Powers could only peer with barely veiled horror. They held together through those three years of unorthodox study, but toward the end of it they had drawn wide apart. Trowse entered the ranks of his profession a man of steel, without nerves or sentiment or pity. Powers, with his fuller understanding of life, had no longer any desire for a regular career. Possessed of ample means, the necessity for it had never existed. He left England almost at once, and entered upon a somewhat restless but comprehensive scheme of travel.|$|E

60|$|I {{believe this}} way of talking about women and their higher culture is almost entirely a growth of the classes which (unlike the journalistic class to which I belong) have always a {{reasonable}} amount of money.

They say eternally, like my correspondent, that the ordinary woman is always a drudge. And what, {{in the name of the}} Nine Gods, is the ordinary man? These people seem to think that the ordinary man is a Cabinet Minister. They are always talking about man going forth to wield power, to carve his own way, to stamp his individuality on the world, to command and to be obeyed. This may be true of a certain class. Dukes, perhaps, are not drudges; but, then, neither are Duchesses. The Ladies and Gentlemen of the Smart Set are quite free for the higher culture, which consists chiefly of motoring and Bridge. But the ordinary man who typifies and constitutes the millions that make up our civilisation is no more free for the higher culture than his wife is.|$|E
