As {{he was not a}} citizen of the United States, Fraina was forced to make this trip without a passport and legal visas. The services of one Jacob Nosovitsky were employed by the CPA to aid with Fraina's travel arrangements and to accompany him abroad. Nosivitsky, believed to be an active and trustworthy member of the Communist movement and an individual who had been used as a secret international courier, was in actuality a police spy working undercover in the radical movement and reporting on the activities of its principals to the U.S. Department of Justice as its special employee N-100.|$|R

50|$|Because {{there was}} such a brief period between the two conclaves, the lists of electors are nearly {{identical}} and thus they are presented in the same article. However, the following notes have to be made. There were 114 electors {{at the time of the}} August conclave, but only 111 of them actually participated; due to ill health, Valerian Gracias, John Joseph Wright, and Bolesław Filipiak did not attend. Wright, however, did participate in the October conclave. Gracias and Filipiak, who had been too sick in August like Wright, again did not participate in October; Gracias died during Pope John Paul I's pontificate and Filipiak died on the opening day of the October conclave. As Albino Luciani had been elected pope at the August conclave and subsequently died, the October <b>conclave</b> was also <b>attended</b> by 111 electors.|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} have observed {{an increase in}} the incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) {{over the past two decades}} with emergence of new risk factors and isolation of new fungal pathogens. Early diagnosis and appropriate antifungal treatment remain the cornerstones of successful outcomes. However, due to non-specific clinical presentations and limited availability of rapid diagnostic tests, in more than half of cases antifungal treatment is inappropriate. As a result, the emergence of antifungal resistance both in yeasts and mycelial fungi is becoming increasingly common. The Delhi Chapter of the Indian Association of Medical Microbiologists (IAMM-DC) organized a 1  day workshop in collaboration with BSAC on 10 December 2015 in New Delhi to design a road map towards the development of a robust antifungal stewardship programme in the context of conditions in India. The workshop aimed at developing a road map for optimizing better outcomes in patients with IFIs while minimizing unintended consequences of antifungal use, ultimately leading to reduced healthcare costs and prevention development of resistance to antifungals. The <b>workshop</b> was a <b>conclave</b> of all stakeholders, eminent experts from India and the UK, including clinical microbiologists, critical care specialists and infectious disease physicians. Various issues in managing IFIs were discussed, including epidemiology, diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in different healthcare settings. At the end of the deliberations, a consensus opinion and key messages were formulated, outlining a step-by-step approach to tackling the growing incidence of IFIs and antifungal resistance, particularly in the Indian scenario...|$|R
