25|$|H.B. Warner, who {{was cast}} as the {{drugstore}} owner Mr. Gower, actually studied medicine before going into acting.

In the silent era, he had {{played the role of}} Jesus Christ in Cecil B. DeMille's The King of Kings (1927).

25|$|Arena's latest venture, her {{new album}} Eleven, is so named {{because it is the}} 11th album of her {{recording}} career, but also because she likes its astrological implications' '11' being a figure of enlightenment and artistic sensitivity. Like its predecessor, 2013's Reset, Eleven is a pop-heavy collection, featuring songwriting collaborations with, among others, Kate Miller-Heidke, Hayley Warner and Evermore's Jon Hume. Her new album, was recorded in Sydney, Melbourne, London and Stockholm, as well as in Paris. The Eleven album is a mix of atmospheric electronica (Unravel Me, Overload), smouldering anthems (Wouldn't Be Love If It Didn't, Love Falls, Not Still in Love <b>with</b> <b>You)</b> <b>and</b> dance-friendly pop (Magic). Arena's most recent release, Eleven, became her seventh Top 10 album in Australia by debuting at No. 2 on the ARIA album chart in November 2016, and is now certified gold.|$|E

I therefore released Prinz Eugen at noon yesterday {{so that she could}} conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle.

25|$|In a 1995 Washington Post article, Jim Marks cited Bawer's {{observation}} that (in Marks's paraphrase) “it gets harder {{to claim that}} {{gay men and lesbians}} are outside mainstream culture, when so much of mainstream culture—the Mona Lisa and Moby-Dick, to use Bawer's examples—is seen as the product of gay and lesbian minds.” In a 1996 piece on gay marriage, New York Times columnist Frank Rich cited Bawer's view that there existed “a gentlemen's agreement” among Washington conservatives. He quoted Bawer as saying: “They say 'We'll socialize <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> your significant other and we'll all be charming, as long as you don't mention it in public, and we get to say anything we want in public.'” A 1997 Washington Post article about an upcoming episode of Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom, “Ellen,” on which her character would come out of the closet, mimicking DeGeneres's own recent coming out, ended with a quote from Bawer. “People used to do courageous things without having a publicist around to tell the world,” he said.|$|E

500|$|Parker {{stated that}} Isaac Hayes' {{membership}} had previously kept the show's creators from writing a full episode which parodies Scientology.

Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of [...] based on Scientology, but Showtime prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology. Parker commented, [...] "We're going, That's fucked up. And hearing other people say, 'You can't do that' – you can only say 'You can't do that' so many times to Matt and me before we're gonna do it.

500|$|Douglas Rankine of Wired UK and McKinley Noble of GamePro thought {{previously}} existing Nintendo DS {{games were}} revitalized with the Nintendo DSi XL's larger screens; games like Scribblenauts and The World Ends with You benefited from increased touchscreen precision and increased legibility of text, respectively. CVG's Mike Jackson {{argued that the}} bigger screens, which made its unchanged resolution blockier, would probably be less noticeable to the older demographic for which the XL is undoubtedly designed. However, Jackson and IGN's Scott Lowe and Chris Burke agreed its clear and vivid colors considerably compensated for its unchanged resolution. Carol Mangis of PC Magazine thought families looking to share a handheld between members should consider a DSi XL, but the larger screens were not enough of an incentive for current DSi owners to upgrade. Lowe, Burke, Jackson, and Bakalar concluded the larger DSi model is not an essential upgrade; Jackson explained [...] "if you tend not {{to carry it out}} <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> only ever tend to use it at home, then the DSi XL is the better choice".|$|E

Kitsis thought that [...] "It was interesting what [...] said to Michael … that really carries through Michael's arc." [...] Later in the season, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) tries to shoot Michael in the head, but the gun jams and the next day, {{a manifestation of the}} island in the form of Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears before Michael. Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island's [...] "cosmic intervention of fate" [...] also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack's suicide attempt in the third-season finale. Following the broadcast of the fourth midseason premiere, Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying. Cuse has said that [...] "There is a raging debate on the show about what constitutes free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael's story was sort of a argument on the destiny side of that equation. He had more destiny to fulfil with that island than he anticipated and maybe the audience anticipated." [...] Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "the island doesn't let you go until it's done <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I think that the rest of our characters are going to feel the reverberations of that, as well." ...|$|E
