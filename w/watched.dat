5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children.

Three-year-olds who <b>watched</b> regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who <b>watched</b> the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes.

Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E
