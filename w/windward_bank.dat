50|$|The Orsova {{departed}} on its {{maiden voyage}} from Tilbury 17 March 1954, with Sydney as its main destination. The following month, on its return voyage from Sydney to Tilbury, it became stuck against {{the bank in}} the Suez Canal. This was attributed to {{the combination of a}} strong crosswind and a pilot unfamiliar with the vessel. Sixty or so local males were recruited on the <b>windward</b> <b>bank</b> of the canal to pull the ship off the leeward bank, using one of the ship's mooring lines, so that it could once again make way. This operation took several hours. Meanwhile, a group of passengers who had disembarked at Port Suez to take a bus tour, and who {{were on their way to}} Port Said to rejoin the ship, were left stranded when it was decided, in order to stay on schedule, not to dock at Port Said.They were subsequently flown to Naples, Orsova's next port of call.|$|E
