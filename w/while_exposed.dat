5|$|On 26 April 1915, at Wieltje, Belgium, Jemadar Mir Dast led his platoon {{with great}} bravery during the attack, and {{afterwards}} collected various {{parties of the}} regiment (when no British officers were left) and kept them under his command until the retirement was ordered. He also displayed great courage that day when he helped to carry eight British and Indian officers to safety <b>while</b> <b>exposed</b> to heavy fire.|$|E

Corey attended to the wounded <b>while</b> <b>exposed</b> to fire, and continued to direct other bearer parties throughout the action until wounded himself, receiving wounds in the right groin and thigh. It was during this engagement that he was awarded a third bar to his Military Medal. Evacuated to a casualty station, Corey was operated on before receiving a transfer to a general hospital at Le Havre. Operated on again, he was sent to a hospital in Bristol, England. Repatriated to Australia on 30 April 1919, he was medically discharged in June.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} state +5 {{can be produced}} by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten sodium nitrite. Manganate (VI) salts can be produced by dissolving Mn compounds, such as manganese dioxide, in molten alkali <b>while</b> <b>exposed</b> to air. Permanganate (+7 {{oxidation state}}) compounds are purple, and can give glass a violet color. Potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate, and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers. Potassium permanganate, also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties; it {{is used as a}} topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives {{to be used in the}} preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.|$|E

25|$|A {{pioneering}} design, the Routemaster outlasted {{several of}} its replacement types in London, survived the privatisation of the former London Transport bus operators and was used by other operators around the UK. In modern UK public transport bus operation, the old-fashioned features of the standard Routemaster were both praised and criticised.

25|$|The {{molecular}} {{composition of}} ketchup is what creates ketchup's pseudoplastic characteristics. Small polysaccharides, sugars, acids, and water {{make up the}} majority of the metastable ketchup product, and these small structures are able to move more easily throughout a matrix because of their low mass. <b>While</b> <b>exposed</b> to shear stress, the molecules within the suspension are able to respond quickly and create an alignment within the product. The bonds between the molecules are mostly hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and electrostatic interactions, all of which can be broken when subject to stress. Hydrogen bonds are constantly rearranging within a product due to their need to be in the lowest energy state, which further confirms that the bonds between the molecules will be easily disrupted. This alignment only lasts for as long as shear stress is applied. The molecules return to their original disorganized state once the shear stress dissipates.|$|E

As a corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, Smith was engaged in the Second Battle of Ypres. On 26 April 1915, Smith, on his own initiative, recovered wounded soldiers <b>while</b> <b>exposed</b> to sustained fire and attended to them [...] "with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk". His conduct secured a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, which was awarded to Smith in August 1915.|$|E

2500|$|Barrels are {{constructed}} in cooperages. The traditional method of European coopers {{has been to}} hand-split the oak into staves (or strips) along the grain. After the oak is split, it is allowed to [...] "season" [...] or dry outdoors <b>while</b> <b>exposed</b> to the elements. This process can take anywhere from 10 to 36 months during which time the harshest tannins from the wood are leached out. These tannins are visible as dark gray and black residue left on the ground once the staves are removed. The longer the wood is allowed to season the softer the potential wine stored in the barrels may be but this can add substantially {{to the cost of}} the barrel. In some American cooperage the wood is dried in a kiln instead of outdoor seasoning. While this method is much faster, it does not soften the tannins quite as much as outdoor seasoning.|$|E
2500|$|Colt was {{eliminated}} after phase I, leaving only HK {{to move on}} to phase II. [...] This phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through.

[...] Three pistols went through a 30,000-round endurance test and maintained accuracy of [...] at 25 meters; only the O-ring needed replacement after 20,000 rounds. [...] The weapons worked in temperatures from -25 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit <b>while</b> <b>exposed</b> to mud, ice, and sand. [...] Phase III was the awarding of a production contract to HK in June 1995. [...] Their pistol was type classified as the Mark 23 Mod 0, and 1,950 systems were ordered at $1,186 each. [...] All pistols were produced in Germany and the first was delivered to SOCOM on 1 May 1996.|$|E
