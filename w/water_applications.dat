40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} sprinkler irrigation on the characteristics of topsoil pores. Total soil porosity, capillary porosity, air-space porosity and porosities of different pore shapes were analyzed using images analysis of thin sections of soil samples. The experimental treatments included five <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensities (5. 3, 7. 7, 11. 0, 15. 0 and 20. 7 mm/h), five drop diameters (0. 76, 1. 28, 1. 92, 3. 18, 4. 19 mm) and five <b>water</b> <b>application</b> amounts (9. 0, 23. 6, 37. 5, 49. 6, 59. 4 mm). The compounding sprinkler system was used in the experiments of <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity and single sprinkler was used in the experiments of drop size and <b>water</b> <b>application</b> amount. The total porosity, air-space porosity and porosities of elongated pores have the similar decreasing tendency and pattern when <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity, drop diameter or <b>water</b> <b>application</b> amount increase. Capillary porosity, porosities of round and irregular pores have no obvious changing tendency. The decreasing porosities of the elongated pores and macropores are the main reasons for the decreasing of total porosity under sprinkler irrigation. To maintain soil structure in good conditions, the reasonable parameters would be considered for <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity, drop diameter and <b>water</b> <b>application</b> amount. © 2008 Elsevier B.

Nitrogen applications did not significantly increase yields because of high initial soil nitrogen and nitrogen added with the irrigation water. Significant yield differences did exist between the 60 % consumption use (CU) irrigation level and the 90 % and 120 % CU irrigation levels. The 60 % CU level resulted in appreciable plant water stress and appreciably lower yields.

Increased <b>water</b> <b>application</b> rate lengthened the periods of peak flowering and peak boll production but had no effect on petiole NO₃-N.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{operating}} pressure heads on <b>water</b> <b>application</b> uniformity in microirrigation submain units was evaluated. Research {{results show that}} <b>water</b> <b>application</b> uniformity either increases or slightly decreases as operating pressure head increases in a range when the emission exponent x {{less than or equal}} to 0. 5 in most cases. The <b>water</b> <b>application</b> uniformity decreases as operating pressure head increases in a range when the emission exponent x > 0. 5. The relationship between operating pressure head and average emitter discharge in submain units can be considered as approximately linear for operating pressure heads in a small range (usually between the allowable minimum and maximum operating pressures of the submain units). These results help to estimate the average emitter discharge rate easily in a submain unit for an increased or decreased operating pressure head when one is attempting to manage emitter discharge dynamically according to the requirements of crop root growth for different periods. Generally, a microirrigation system designed to meet the desired uniformity of <b>water</b> <b>application</b> according to the allowable minimum operating pressure head would be better when x {{less than or equal to}} 0. 5 because <b>water</b> <b>application</b> uniformity increases as operating pressure increases if emitter discharges are being managed dynamically.

40|$|Sprinkler irrigation, {{as one of}} {{the useful}} {{technologies}} for the development and utilization of saline soils, has been extensively used in coastal saline soils. However, few studies have been related to the effects of <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity on movement of water and salt transport under sprinkle irrigation in this region. A soil-column experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity on the movement of wetting front, water redistribution characteristics and salt leaching of coastal highly-saline soil. The experiments included two kinds of coastal highly-saline soils (clayey and sandy) and five <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity treatments, in which the sprinkle irrigation was controlled at 1. 72, 3. 13, 5. 27, 8. 75 and 10. 11 mm/h, respectively. The results showed that under sprinkle irrigation, the <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity and soil clay content significantly influenced the movement of the soil-wetting front. With the increase of <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity, the driving velocity of the wetting front increased, while the moist depth decreased. To some extent, the soil clay content had a negative effect on the movement of the wetting front. With the redistribution of the soil moisture, the volumetric moisture content of the same depth was largest at the <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity of 3. 13 mm/h in clayey highly-saline soil, while in sandy highly-saline soil, the most optimal water preserving capability was observed at the <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity of 1. 72 mm/h. After sprinkler irrigation, the salts in the upper soil layer were well leached, and moved down to the subsoil, where the soil salt content increased sharply to reach maximum. The suitable <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity of sprinkler irrigation was different on these two kinds of soils. Among the five treatments, the best leaching effect was obtained at the <b>water</b> <b>application</b> intensity of 3. 13 mm/h in clayey highly-saline soil, and 8. 75 mm/h in sandy highly-saline soil.

Three water flux densities (0. 0442, 0. 0265 and 0. 0189 cm min - 1) and NO 3 concentration rates (150, 00 and 600 mg L - 1) were used. The used soil has a loamy sand texture. The {{results indicate that the}} first <b>water</b> <b>application</b> rate (0. 0442 cm min - 1) be able to leach the nitrate from soil columns. The nitrate concentration was differed according the nitrate application rate (71, 1 and 53 mg L - 1, respectively), in which increasing nitrate application rate increased the nitrate concentration in the leachate. The other <b>water</b> <b>application</b> rates did not show a significant leaching of nitrate.
