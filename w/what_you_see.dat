A fire in 1906 saw the theatre destroyed and a replacement opera house was built in 1907 and still forms {{part of the building}} today. The local authority took control of the buildings in 1914, acquired it in 1919 and rebuilt all but the theatre in 1926. A further fire destroyed these later buildings in 1932 and work started almost immediately to construct their replacement; which is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> today.

He left Microsoft in 2002 to co-found, with business partner Gregor Kiczales, a company called Intentional Software. This company markets the intentional programming concepts Simonyi developed at Microsoft Research. In this approach to software, a programmer first builds a language environment specific to a given problem domain (such as life insurance). Domain experts, aided by the programmer, then describe the program's intended behavior in a <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)-like manner. An automated system uses the program description and the language to generate the final program. Successive changes are only done at the WYSIWYG level.|$|E

500|$|Srikula adepts {{most often}} worship Lalita using the {{abstract}} Sri Chakra yantra, which {{is regarded as}} her subtle form. The Sri Chakra can be visually rendered either as a two-dimensional diagram (whether drawn temporarily {{as part of the}} worship ritual, or permanently engraved in metal) or in the three-dimensional, pyramidal form known as the Sri Meru. It is not uncommon to find a Sri Chakra or Sri Meru installed in South Indian temples, because – as modern practitioners assert – [...] "there is no disputing that this is the highest form of Devi and that some of the practice can be done openly.

500|$|The ride {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} July 2014 opening.

500|$|Psycho is now {{considered}} to be the first film in the slasher film genre, and has been referenced in films numerous times; examples include the 1974 musical horror film Phantom of the Paradise, 1978 horror film Halloween (which starred Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh's daughter), the 1977 Mel Brooks tribute to many of Hitchcock's thrillers, High Anxiety, the 1980 Fade to Black, the 1980 Dressed to Kill and Wes Craven's 1996 horror satire Scream. Bernard Herrmann's opening theme has been sampled by rapper Busta Rhymes on his song [...] "Gimme Some More" [...] (1998).

500|$|Edward Rice {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of a Jacobean house on the site of an earlier medieval mansion in 1659, and it was completed the following year. Turrets and battlements were added between 1760 and 1780. Though the property remains Jacobean, around 1856, there were significant changes made in the Venetian Gothic style, which today emanate the ambiance of the Victorian period. The tower was added, and alterations were made by R. K. Penson of Oswestry. [...] The National Trust writes of it: [...] "Most of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> of the grand building today dates back to the 1850s, when it was given a fashionable Gothic facelift, with stone cladding and four impressive turrets". A limestone refacing occurred at the same time. Newton House is a Grade II* listed property, as are its summer house and the inner and outer courtyard ranges. The nearby dairy cottage, ha-ha, dovecote, fountain, deer abattoir, icehouse, home farmhouse, corn barn and byre/stable range are Grade II listed in their own right.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{of the two}} episodes {{occurred}} from September 24, 2014, until October 8, 2014. The Flashs {{episode was}} directed by Glen Winter, and Arrows by Jesse Warn. The fight scene between the Flash and Arrow in The Flash episode was shot over three nights. Because {{this was the first}} time Stephen Amell's character fought someone with superpowers, he had to change the way he performed stunts to accommodate the special effects. Comparing the filming of both series, Grant Gustin described The Flash shooting as [...] "really tedious," [...] working with [...] "a lot of plate shots that are empty shots of the area we are going to be in" [...] and later added in post-production, as opposed to Arrow where [...] "they shoot it from the perfect angles and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> is what you get". Gustin also recalled at times it got confusing on set because they were shooting both episodes at the same time.|$|E

The group described the plans as [...] "a deeply unattractive project that has no affordable housing anywhere on the [...] site, no decent jobs for local people and no credible public transport strategy". They also criticised how appropriate the project was in its location, and proposal of other large buildings on the site. Keith Garner of the group said [...] "I feel that there's a real problem of appropriateness. They need a completely different kind of scheme, not this airport-lounge treatment. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> now is a majestic building looming up from the river.

The show was the usual Friday night Chesterfield Supper Club with an important exception—it was also being broadcast on television. The experimental simulcast was to continue for three Friday [...] "Supper Club" [...] shows, but had gone so well, NBC decided to extend the televised version through August 1949. Years later, Como admitted to being scared and feeling awkward initially, but somehow managed to just be himself. Said Como, [...] "You can't act on TV.

500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> in the parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand.

500|$|In 2001, Evangelical {{journalist}} Richard Abanes, who {{has written}} several books arguing against new religions and Mormonism, published a polemical text that made similar allegations to the video: Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick. Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between Harry Potter and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like Harry Potter, you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it." ...|$|E
