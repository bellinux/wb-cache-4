60|$|It had {{happened}} to us three on a previous journey that we had made {{in another part of}} Africa to owe our lives to iron shirts of native make, and remembering this, I had suggested before we started on our present hazardous expedition that we should have some made to fit us. There was a little difficulty about this, as armour-making is pretty well an extinct art, but they can do most things in the way of steel work in Birmingham if they are put to it and you will pay the price, and the end of it was that they turned us out the loveliest steel shirts it is possible to see. The workmanship was exceedingly fine, the web being composed of thousands upon thousands of stout but tiny rings of the best steel made. These shirts, or rather steel-sleeved and high-necked jerseys, were lined with ventilated <b>wash</b> <b>leather,</b> were not bright, but browned like the barrel of a gun; and mine weighed exactly seven pounds and fitted me so well that I found I could wear it for days next to my skin without being chafed. Sir Henry had two, one of the ordinary make, viz. a jersey with little dependent flaps meant to afford some protection to {{the upper part of the}} thighs, and another of his own design fashioned on the pattern of the garments advertised as 'combinations' and weighing twelve pounds. This combination shirt, of which the seat was made of wash-leather, protected the whole body down to the knees, but was rather more cumbersome, inasmuch as it had to be laced up at the back and, of course, involved some extra weight. With these shirts were what looked like four brown cloth travelling caps with ear pieces. Each of these caps was, however, quilted with steel links so as to afford a most valuable protection for the head.|$|E
50|$|Leather must {{be washed}} {{to remove any}} {{ingrained}} dirt; Its ideal to <b>wash</b> <b>leather</b> with water alone. Depending of {{the condition of the}} leather, there are variety of mechanical cleaning techniques that may be used and required. Materials such as soft brushes, water jets, ultrasonic cleaners, and ultrasonic dental tools are effective cleaning tools for leather. When leather is mechanically cleaned with a soft steam of water, soft brushed and sponges can also be used. In the case of consistent impurities, leather can be cleaned by chemical means, with the use of small amounts of non-ionic detergents. The chemical cleaning must be followed with a rinse under a stream of water.|$|E
5000|$|Preston {{continued}} {{to develop new}} techniques and ways of working with leathers. His obituary noted that he invented <b>washed</b> <b>leather</b> as a fashion item and later experimented with techniques such as painting, waxing and brocading leather, also {{looking for ways to}} increase its suppleness. He was successful in the Italian market and considered a high-fashion brand in Los Angeles. By 1991, Liz Smith in The Times said: [...] "Nigel Preston's sarong skirts, bush shirts and jackets in supple suede have long been classics collected by fashion purists".|$|R
50|$|Shirin Guild {{is renowned}} for utilising {{unconventional}} materials and manufacturing technologies, which she combines with traditional fabrics and craftsmanship. Guild's innovative, minimalistic garments {{are made of}} uniquely devised fabrics, based on yarns made from cashmere, silk, linen, wool, cotton, stainless steel, copper, hemp, bamboo, pineapple and even paper, or combinations thereof. Guild's designs were originally inspired by Iranian peasant clothes and other traditional garments from around the world. Initially known for oversize, square-shaped patterns, designed to take form on the feminine body, in recent years, the designer's style has evolved to embrace a leaner silhouette. This has attracted younger buyers to the brand, which, in general, had previously been favored by the middle aged woman. Complementing her creations, Shirin Guild has formed associations with leading craftspeople to make unique accessories such as handwoven shawls in artistic designs; dip-dyed, hand-felted neckpieces and mittens, and <b>washed</b> <b>leather</b> bags.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1970s, {{the leather}} {{industry}} {{was one of}} the most lucrative businesses in Iran. Before the revolution, Iranians were able to build some of the machinery, such as gear boxes for the wooden drums used for <b>washing</b> the <b>leather.</b> After the 1979 Islamic revolution, sanctions against Iran affected the leather industry. As a result of these sanctions, some Iranian chemical companies began to produce chemical products for the industry and the manufacturers of leather processing machinery developed as well.|$|R

50|$|About 85% of {{the leather}} at Horween Leather Company {{is made from}} cowhide. The company's workers take raw hides, which arrive salted to prevent deterioration, trim them, and remove their hair with {{chemicals}} in an extremely large <b>washing</b> drum. The <b>leather</b> is then treated with salt and pickled for 24 hours, so that it reaches a desired pH level. It is then bated, tanned, and finished.|$|R
5000|$|Small {{pieces of}} chamois leather (often called [...] "chamois cloth") are {{commonly}} used as blending tools by artists drawing with charcoal. The leather blends the charcoal more softly and cleanly than the artist's fingers, which can leave smudges. The chamois {{is also used to}} lighten the drawing (or portions of it) by removing some charcoal in a more subtle and nuanced way than most erasers could. The charcoal can be <b>washed</b> from the <b>leather</b> using soap and water.|$|R
50|$|The {{decline of}} formal wear {{led to the}} rise of streetwear fashion. High-end and luxury brands are {{starting}} to develop “luxury sportswear”, for example Alexander Wang, Gucci, and DKNY. Among this type of “luxury sportswear”, luxe fabrics were used to produce their sportswear fashion for a high contrast on the sporty silhouette. Fabrics like silk organza, <b>washed</b> satin, <b>leather,</b> neoprene, and wool crepe were used to produce the “luxury sportswear”. These types of fabrics may help experiment a garment with texture, and may assist in capturing a modern-sports spirit of the season. Details of the designs in “luxury sportswear” looks are pulled directly from actual active wear. The two words, “luxury” and “minimalism” were first used together for sportswear in fashion, to interpret a fresh sports look which is sleek and clean, but bearing recognizable athletic influences. Common mix-and-match combination of “luxury sportswear” on streetwear are track pants under basketball shorts, with bold patterns and sumptuous fabrics for men; And light colored pencil skirts, with bomber jackets and sleek tops, which is cut in satin or tweed for women.|$|R
