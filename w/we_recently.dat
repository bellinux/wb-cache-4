It calls for the cessation of violence against the civilian populations who {{have been forced to}} flee in huge numbers and demands that the Burmese security forces ensure their protection and guarantee the restoration of safe humanitarian access. We reaffirm our support for the work of the humanitarian organizations on the ground. They provide aid and protection to all civilian populations. We are helping the French NGOs in order to respond {{to the needs of the}} affected populations as well as the internally displaced persons in Rakhine State; this is in addition to France’s voluntary contribution to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). France calls on Bangladesh to continue to accept the Rohingya who are seeking refuge within its borders. A political solution must be found in order to put an end to this cycle of violence. In this respect, we reaffirm our support for the Burmese government in implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State chaired by Kofi Annan".|$|E

Mr. Temple is a widower, and has no son. Mr. Temple was formerly our minister at several of the German Courts, where he was distinguished by his abilities and his hospitality to his travelling countrymen.
