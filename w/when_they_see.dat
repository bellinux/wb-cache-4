Later Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs Meredith that Lou underwent surgery and was discharged. He's asked to see her to apologize, but Meredith refuses. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) helps her prepare for a visit with her children. On arriving they are terrified <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> their mother in that condition and leave. Meredith has a panic attack, and Penny steps up to help, removing the wires holding her jaw shut. Jackson reprimands Penny for jeopardising the healing process.|$|E
5|$|The distant {{vision of}} a frog is better than its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> an {{intruder}} or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen. When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended. Whether a frog sees in colour is debatable {{but it has been}} shown that it responds positively to blue light, perhaps because that colour is associated with bodies of water that can provide refuge when the frog feels threatened.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} set two million years ago. The {{inhabitants}} of the planet Krikkit built a race of androids called the Krikkitmen to wipe out all life in the universe. They were stopped by the Time Lords, who trapped Krikkit within a temporal prison. A group of Krikkitmen which escaped the Time Lords' sentence are trying to reassemble the components of a key which can free Krikkit—components which happen to resemble elements of the Earth game of cricket, itself actually {{a reflection of the}} ancient war. The Doctor and Sarah stumble upon this plot <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> the Krikkitmen steal the Ashes during a test match at Lords. They then travel to the planet Bethselamin to foil {{the next step in the}} Krikkitmen's quest.|$|E
5|$|The work {{ends with}} the {{following}} words: Fichte and the powerful men who have inherited his ideals, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> children, think: 'Here is material that I can manipulate'... All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; just as we teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, so we should teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
5|$|Kenneth {{takes some}} time off from his page duties to {{volunteer}} at an animal shelter. He claims his time on a pig farm {{will allow him to}} not emotionally connect with the dogs being held there, but he quickly names all of the dogs and adopts the many dogs scheduled to be euthanized that day. Kenneth asks for someone at TGS to adopt the dogs and Tracy quickly brings them all to Liz's apartment to continue annoying her. Liz and Tracy go to Jack to finally resolve their conflict. Jack decides that, because Liz ruined Tracy's life with her book, Tracy should be given the right to ruin her life, and he orders Liz to sign over her life rights to Tracy. Jack tells Liz a story about an accident he had ice climbing, falling into a crevasse. He broke his leg and was unable to climb upwards to escape, but by going deeper down into the crevasse he found a path out. Liz applies this story to her situation with Tracy and stops resisting him, instead suggesting that Tracy make a pornographic film based on her life. Tracy agrees and moves out of Liz's apartment. In addition, Jenna and Liz resolve their issues <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> two adult stars acting out a scene of Jenna (Caitlin Fowler) and Liz (Savanna Samson) apologizing to one another.|$|E

40|$|In two studies, {{children}} between 5 and 10 {{years of age}} were asked to reach to grasp an object without sight of the hand during the movement. The oldest children and adults were faster <b>when</b> <b>they</b> could <b>see</b> the hand and increased maximum grip aperture <b>when</b> <b>they</b> could not <b>see</b> the hand. The 10 -year-olds were less able to integrate grasp and lift than adults <b>when</b> <b>they</b> could <b>see</b> their hands. Children aged 5 and 6 showed no increase in movement time <b>when</b> <b>they</b> could not <b>see</b> the hand and did not adapt maximum grip aperture to lack of sight. These effects remained when children were encouraged to reach for and lift the target as quickly as possible. The results indicate that younger children did not give preference to vision in the control of prehension, while older children used visual feedback to improve efficiency. Dependence on sight of the hand for the control of prehension does not simply decrease with age, {{but it may be}} integrated into an anticipatory control strategy where it contributes to the efficiency of control...|$|R

25|$|A study {{dedicated}} to investigating the thin ideal internalization {{as a factor}} of bulimia nervosa is Thompson's and Stice's research. The aim of their {{study was to investigate}} how and to what degree does media affect the thin ideal internalization. Thompson and Stice used randomized experiments (more specifically programs) {{dedicated to}} teaching young women how to be more critical when it comes to media, in order to reduce thin ideal internalization. The results showed that by creating more awareness of the media's control of the societal ideal of attractiveness, the thin ideal internalization significantly dropped. In other words, less thin ideal images portrayed by the media resulted in less thin ideal internalization. Therefore, Thompson and Stice concluded that media affected greatly the thin ideal internalization. Papies showed {{that it is not the}} thin ideal itself, but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels. People that associate themselves with thin models get in a positive attitude <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> thin models and people that associate with overweight get in a negative attitude <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> thin models. Moreover, it can be taught to associate with thinner people.|$|E
25|$|The plains zebra is {{a highly}} social species, forming harems with a single stallion, several mares and their recent offspring; there are also {{bachelor}} groups. Groups may come together to form herds. The animals keep watch for predators rather than attempting to hide; they bark or snort <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> a predator, and the harem stallion attacks predators to defend his harem. The species population is stable and not endangered, though some populations such as in Tanzania have declined sharply.|$|E
25|$|The Bank of America's website is one {{of several}} that ask users to select a {{personal}} image (marketed as SiteKey), and display this user-selected image with any forms that request a password.

However, several studies suggest that few users refrain from entering their passwords when images are absent.
