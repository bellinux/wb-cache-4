Because of this, Finkelstein repeatedly asserts that fraudulent claims were made on Switzerland, while accounts and assets in the US and Israel were ignored. Payments were made to the <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> and real survivors lost out.|$|E

The plan gained the approval of all three governments, but caused considerable controversy within the Jewish community of Poland, {{on the grounds that}} it played into the hands of anti-Semites. In particular, the fact that the 'evacuation plan' had the approval of the Polish government was taken by many Polish Jews as indicating Jabotinsky had gained the endorsement of what they considered to be the <b>wrong</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{begins with}} a {{discussion}} of 'the elementary moral distinction'. It then considers lives and <b>wrongs,</b> <b>people</b> and faults, fault-anticipating wrongs, and the fault principle. It argues that moral philosophy has lost sight of the need to rely on the deservedness of punishment to explain punishment's meanings and consequences. In the process it has lost sight of the need to explain, {{in a way that does}} not depend on punishment's meanings or consequences, why the only actions that deserve to be punished are both wrongful and blameworthy (two different and only very obliquely related properties) ...|$|R

25|$|Bakunin {{argues that}} oppressors receive {{authority}} from religion. Religious {{people are in}} many cases obedient to the priests, because many religious people believe that the statements of priests are based on direct divine revelation or scripture. The obedience to divine revelation or scripture is considered as the ethical criteria by many religious people, because God is considered as the omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Therefore, each statement which is considered derived from an infallible God cannot be criticized by humans. According to this religious way of thinking, humans cannot know by themselves what is just, but that only God decides what is good or <b>wrong.</b> <b>People</b> who disobey the “messengers of God” are threatened with punishment in hell.|$|E
25|$|In {{part the}} Treaty {{was an attempt}} to {{establish}} a system of property rights for land with the Crown controlling and overseeing land sale to prevent abuse and initially this worked well and the Governor had the sole right to buy and sell land from the Māori. Māori were eager to sell land, and settlers eager to buy. The Crown was supposed to mediate the process to ensure that the true owners were properly identified (difficult for tribally owned land) and fairly compensated, {{by the standards of the}} time. In particular, the Governor had the responsibility to protect Māori interests. Governor Grey set out to buy large tracts of Māori land in advance of settlement at low prices, later selling it to settlers at higher prices and using the difference to develop land access (roads and bridges). Donald McLean acted as Grey's intermediary and negotiator, and as early as 1840 was aware that Māori had no concept of the sale of land in British sense. Soon Māori became disillusioned and less willing to sell, while the Crown came under increasing pressure from settlers wishing to buy. Consequently, government land agents were involved in a number of dubious land purchases, agreements were sometimes negotiated with only one owner of tribally owned land and in some cases land was purchased from the <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> altogether. Eventually this led to the New Zealand Wars which culminated in the confiscation of a large part of the Waikato and Taranaki.|$|E
500|$|In 1919, aged sixteen, Richardson took a post as office {{boy with}} the Brighton branch of the Liverpool and Victoria {{insurance}} company. The pay, ten shillings a week, was attractive, but office life was not; he lacked concentration, frequently posting documents to the <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> as well as engaging in pranks that alarmed his superiors. [...] His paternal grandmother died and left him £500, which, he later said, transformed his life. He resigned from the office post, {{just in time to}} avoid being dismissed, and enrolled at the Brighton School of Art. His studies there convinced him that he lacked creativity, and that his drawing skills were not good enough.|$|E

McGee said that his path into drug and alcohol abuse began when he started to hang out with [...] "the <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> - drinking, partying."

[...] Parker also described the ending of the episode as [...] "a bloodbath, (which) is what a good zombie movie should be". [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first South Park episode Parker and Stone felt unsatisfied with once production was complete. Parker said, [...] "We were pretty bummed out, and we kind of thought, well, we're going to have a bad episode go on the air, and hopefully it won't alienate too many people, and we'll try to get our viewers back for Thanksgiving.

The RUC and army arrested 342 Irish nationalists, but key Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) members had been tipped off and 104 of those arrested were released when it emerged they had no paramilitary connections. Those behind Operation Demetrius were accused of bungling, by arresting many of the <b>wrong</b> <b>people</b> and using out-of-date information. Following nationalist protests, some Ulster loyalists were also arrested. By 1972, there were 924 internees {{and by the end}} of internment on 5 December 1975, 1,981 people had been detained; 1,874 (94.6%) of whom were Catholic/Irish nationalist and 107 (5.4%) Ulster Protestants/loyalists.|$|E

When Rivers died on 28 March 1966, Amber was determined to keep living as normally as possible. She was visited by New Zealand historian Keith Sinclair who was writing a biography of her father, and twice by interviewers from the BBC. Although she enjoyed discussing politics and world affairs, she felt disillusioned about the socialist hopes of her youth, and supported the Conservatives in the 1970 election.
