5|$|Adam Gutschmidt, {{reviewing}} the event for Online Onslaught, gave {{a rating of}} one-quarter star for the Nightstick on a Pole match and one-half star each for the High Energy vs. The Headshrinkers match and the Yokozuna vs. Virgil match. He enjoyed the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, although he was disappointed by its lack of buildup prior to the event. He also felt that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect match <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> until the ending got out of control. Pro Wrestling Torch columnist agreed, stating that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the best and that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect bout was also enjoyable, but he recommended fast-forwarding {{through the rest of}} the show.|$|E
5|$|Food was {{in short}} supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, with rations {{inadequate}} to meet nutritional needs. The retreating armies had burned the crops {{and much of the}} remainder was sent back to the Reich. In Germany itself, food rations had to be cut in 1942. In his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, Hermann Göring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway. The 1942 harvest <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|There {{were more}} {{concerns}} about Clannad being similar to Air. When Nagisa's scenario was being written, {{there were some}} disputes concerning {{the length of her}} scenario, and thus putting too much focus on the main heroine. Some were concerned that having a single prominent character with a unique storyline would be too much like how Air was structured with the overall focus on Misuzu Kamio. Takahiro Baba, the company president of VisualArt's, is even noted as suggesting to minimize the differences between the other characters' scenarios, but this was ultimately ignored since Maeda thought the game's evaluation by players would not decrease on account of the scenarios being vastly different, and thought the end result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one.</b> Maeda was concerned that the After Story arc, mainly a continuation of Nagisa's scenario, would eclipse the entire game's scenario, much like what happened with Air according to Maeda. In order to prevent the same thing happening in Clannad, Maeda focused on making {{the first half of the}} story, the School Life arc, just as enjoyable by making it long and heart-breaking. Clannad is Key's second longest work, as reported by Yūto Tonokawa where he stated that Clannad is about 4,000 words fewer than Key's 2008 game Little Busters! Ecstasy.|$|E

25|$|Centuries by Barrington (his first Test hundred) and Dexter {{ensured that}} England {{made a big}} score. Alexander took five catches. In response, West Indies were 102/3, but then a mammoth fourth wicket {{partnership}} of 399 (still the record for that wicket for West Indies against all countries) by Sobers and Worrell took them into a first innings lead. In the circumstances, Trueman's analysis <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one.</b> West Indies had scored at under {{two and a half}} runs per over, and by the time that they declared England only had to bat for 140 minutes in their second innings. Allen for England, and Scarlett and Watson for West Indies, made their Test debuts. Statham was unfit, Moss playing in his stead.|$|E
25|$|The {{score to}} Double Indemnity was {{composed}} by Miklós Rózsa, whose work on Wilder's previous film, Five Graves to Cairo, {{had been his}} first real Hollywood engagement for a major studio. Wilder had praised that work and promised to use Rózsa on his next film. Wilder had {{the idea of using}} a restless string fugue (like the opening to Franz Schubert's Unfinished Symphony) to reflect the conspiratorial activities of Walter and Phyllis against her husband which Rózsa felt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> (and the Symphony is actually used with a very melodramatic effect in the scene with Lola and Walter in the hill above Hollywood Bowl, 1:23–1:26). As work progressed, Wilder's enthusiasm about Rózsa's score only grew, but the studio's Musical Director, Louis Lipstone, was of a different mind; he and Wilder had previously clashed over some post-production cuts he had made to the Five Graves score which created problems with the music's continuity and logic. Now the two were coming to loggerheads again.|$|E
25|$|After his {{situation}} had become hopeless at Camden, Steele gave up all thoughts of uniting with Banks on the Red River in a further campaign to take Shreveport {{and realized that}} he had to save his army. The battle of Jenkins' Ferry showed that Steele's force indeed was in danger while it was at Camden and southwest of the Saline River. Steele's decision to retreat to Little Rock therefore <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one.</b> Banks in turn had to give up any hope of renewing his campaign against Shreveport. His major problems in renewing the campaign actually did not include an insufficient number of men, however, because he was reinforced in late April by forces under Major-General John McClernand. Banks had logistical problems and would not have gunboat transport and support because of Porter’s inability to operate in the unusually low water of the Red River during that spring and summer. In fact, Banks had to protect Porter’s fleet at Alexandria, Louisiana until it could be freed from the Red River on May 13 before he could move in any direction.|$|E

[...] Cambridge passed the finishing post with a lead of four-and-a-half lengths, in a winning time of 21 minutes 37 seconds, the slowest winning time since the 1898 race.

While calling Veronica [...] "not likable at all" [...] in the episode, he praised {{the second half of}} the episode, particularly the final sequence involving a drugged Veronica. He wrote, [...] "Veronica Mars seems to slowly be getting back on track. There are still some problems to be sure, but this week's episode <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> and most notably, built towards some very strong scenes in the second half." [...] Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, was also positive towards the episode, writing [...] "This was good! I liked all of the scenes of Piz sleeping on the floor. And as much as it freaks me out to see Veronica in harm's way (I shouldn't be watching TV, apparently), I appreciated the forward momentum in this plotline."

500|$|Longchamp died in January 1197, at Poitiers, {{while on}} a {{diplomatic}} mission to Rome for Richard, and was buried at the abbey of Le Pin. Much of the information on his career comes from people hostile to him, for example, Gerald of Wales called Longchamp that [...] "monster with many heads". The historian Austin Lane Poole says that Gerald described Longchamp as more like an ape than a man. Longchamp was reportedly a cultured and well-educated man. He was supported by others among his contemporaries, including Pope Clement III, who, when he appointed Longchamp legate, wrote that he did so {{at the urging of}} the English bishops. When he was one of four men named bishop in 1189, medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes wrote that the four new bishops were [...] "men of no little virtue and fame". Historian John Gillingham wrote that Longchamp's [...] "record of his life in politics and administration <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> spoiled only by his failure in 1191".|$|E
500|$|... "Grace, Replaced" [...] {{brought in}} 12.9million American viewers upon its {{original}} broadcast in the United States, {{and making it}} the seventh highest-rated show {{during the week of}} April 5–11, 1999. Originally, Will & Grace aired on Mondays, but due to insufficient viewership, NBC decided to move the program to Tuesdays at 9:30p.m., which was a success as viewers tuned in. The network then changed the time slot from Tuesdays to Thursdays at 8:30p.m., between Friends and Frasier, with this episode becoming a success as it attracted its highest audience ratings of the season. The previous episode, [...] "Secrets and Lays", was watched by 9.6million viewers. Many believed this decision <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> with a contributor of The Buffalo News commenting that the time slot change suggested that NBC felt that Will & Grace had a better chance of becoming a success than the current sitcom Jesse. In a report in The Star-Ledger it said that the decision of Will & Grace airing on Thursdays was a good benefit on behalf of NBC as the program was [...] "the only watchable comedy".|$|E
500|$|In {{a report}} on {{municipal}} wireless networks by The Wall Street Journal, Minneapolis's was singled out as being [...] "a success story", with the publication explaining {{that the concept of}} having the city as the anchor tenant <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one.</b> The article cited the wireless network in Philadelphia that was being set up around the same time that Minneapolis's was, but was being run and built by EarthLink, the other finalist in the bidding process to select a network for Minneapolis. EarthLink had relinquished control of its partially complete network in 2008, in part due to a low subscription rate of only 5,000 customers in May of that year. [...] Minneapolis, meanwhile, had 10,000 subscribers, and the network was nearing completion. In reference to the variety of stalled or failed wireless projects across the country, PC World cited USI Wireless as [...] "the only firm that got the numbers and engineering to add up for them so far." [...] A 2009 article in Computerworld noted that [...] "Minneapolis {{is one of the few}} large cities that has deployed Wi-Fi successfully." [...] The wireless network was tested in December 2007 by wireless testing firm Novarum, and was found to be the fastest metro wireless internet network in America.|$|E

500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former team owner Eddie Jordan, Sebastian Vettel described the race {{as one of}} his best ever, calling it [...] "a great day; we had a really great weekend". He also revealed that his drink bottle had failed halfway into the race, causing him to become thirsty as drivers lose two to three litres in sweat during the Singapore race. Second placed Daniel Ricciardo said he felt that an undercut, overtaking Vettel by pitting earlier might have been possible {{had it not been for}} the safety car periods. Kimi Räikkönen expressed surprise at his performance, considering that he had struggled with the handling of the car both in qualifying and the race. Speaking about the track intruder, Sebastian Vettel stated at the post-race press conference that he [...] "saw him taking a picture" [...] and continued: [...] "I hope it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one</b> at least. I hope it was in focus! Yeah, pretty crazy, we approach that corner at around 280–290 klicks so, I don't know, I wouldn't cross the track if I was him.

500|$|Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said, Broke' was an {{incredibly}} brisk episode that covered {{a lot of}} ground, so it worked as a good capstone on the whole Michael-leaving-the-company plot." [...] She also said although the plot arc <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>one,</b> she looked forward to future episodes focusing more on the Dunder Mifflin supporting cast. Rick Porter of Zap2it praised the episode, but {{expressed concern that the}} show would grow more stale now that Michael, Pam and Ryan were back to their old jobs at Dunder Mifflin; Porter particularly complimented the new aspects of the Charles Miner character presented in [...] "Broke", including his interaction with David and his exasperation with Dwight. Dan Hopper of Best Week Ever praised the episode and Michael's shrewdness, but also expressed worry that the quality of future episodes would dip now that Dunder Mifflin was back to normal. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club said of the episode, [...] "Elba's stint on The Office went out on a high note. I'll miss his joyless scold of a middle manager but it's nice to have the gang reunited." [...] Rabin also said the moment when Charles fails to listen when Dwight learns Michael's company is broke [...] "rang a little false", but praised the episode as a whole. Meghan Carlson of BuddyTV said she enjoyed seeing Michael so victorious at the end, and said, [...] "as far as ends getting tied off cleanly, 'Broke' was an inspired episode, full of tension, suspense, and yes, humor." ...|$|E
