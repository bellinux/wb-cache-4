40|$|AbstractIn {{four-stroke}} apparent motion displays, pattern elements oscillate {{between two}} adjacent positions and synchronously reverse in contrast, but appear to move unidirectionally. For example, if rightward shifts preserve contrast but leftward shifts reverse contrast, consistent rightward motion is seen. In conventional first-order displays, elements reverse in luminance contrast (e. g. light elements become dark, and vice-versa). The resulting perception {{can be explained}} by responses in elementary motion detectors tuned to spatio–temporal orientation. Second-order motion displays contain texture-defined elements, and {{there is some evidence that}} they excite second-order motion detectors that extract spatio–temporal orientation following the application of a non-linear ‘texture-grabbing’ transform by the visual system. We generated a variety of second-order four-stroke displays, containing texture-contrast reversals instead of luminance contrast reversals, and used their effectiveness as a diagnostic test for the presence of various forms of non-linear transform in the second-order motion system. Displays containing only forward or only reversed phi motion sequences were also tested. Displays defined by variation in luminance, contrast, orientation, and size were effective. Displays defined by variation in motion, dynamism, and stereo were partially or <b>wholly</b> ineffective. Results <b>obtained</b> with contrast-reversing and four-stroke displays indicate that only relatively simple non-linear transforms (involving spatial filtering and rectification) are available during second-order energy-based motion analysis...|$|R

The study was conducted in factorial experiment in the form of 4 × 4 by using a complete randomized design (CRD), which consists of two factors. The first factor is the application of fertilizer NPKMg with 4 levels, namely: M 0 : Without Fertilizer NPKMg, M 1 : Fertilizer NPKMg 4 g/polybag/week, M 2 : Fertilizer NPKMg 5 g/polybag/weeks, M 3 : Fertilizer NPKMg 6 g/polybag/week. The second factor is the interval application of Complementary Liquid Fertilizer with 4 levels, namely: F 0 : Without Complementary Liquid Fertilizer, F 1 : 10 days, F 2 : 20 days, F 3 : 30 days. Such experiments are 16 treatment and each treatment was repeated 3 times so that there are 48 units experiment. Each experimental unit consisted of two plants so <b>wholly</b> <b>obtained</b> 96 plants.

30|$|According to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Rules of Origin, when a good is {{produced}} {{by more than one}} country, the country of origin is the “country where the last substantial transformation has been carried out”. Although WTO member countries agreed that for goods not <b>wholly</b> <b>obtained</b> in one country the criterion for determining the country of origin is the last substantial transformation, the detailed rules for conferring the originating status may vary from country to country when a product is manufactured partially or entirely from non-original (foreign) material. For the same product, the country of origin may be the country where the primary material was produced or where the final processing was carried out, depending on the rules of origin of the importing country. For example, if shrimps are raised in country A and then shelled and frozen in country B, the country of origin of shelled and frozen shrimps is country A under the laws of the USA (USA 2004) because there is no substantial transformation in country B. In contrast, the country of origin of shelled and frozen shrimps is country B according to the regulations of the People’s Republic of China, which has rules for recognising a substantial transformation in country B (The Regulation of the People’s Republic of China on the Rules of Origin for the Goods Imported and Exported 2004; China’s General Administration of Customs 2004).|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the mechanical properties of ultra-thin coatings has {{become more and more}} important because of the increasing number of applications using such films. However, an accurate mechanical testing of coatings with a thickness down to some nanometers is still a challenge, despite the improvements of existing measurement techniques. Nanoindentation is an often used mechanical nanoprobe. Using the conventional test method with a sharp Berkovich indenter, the problem of the influence of the substrate on the results arises with decreasing film thickness. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to measure the modulus of films with a thickness less than 100 - 200 nm. The problem can be overcome by using spheri cal indenters in combination with an analytical solution for the Hertzian contact of coated systems. It allows a separation of film and substrate properties from the load-displacement curve of the compound. Indentation measurements were done at a 44 nm TiN film and at diamondlike carbon coatings in the thickness range between 4. 3 nm and 125 nm on Si substrates. Several corrections were applied to <b>obtain</b> <b>wholly</b> elastic force-displacement curves with high accuracy. It is shown in more detail how zero point and thermal drift corrections are used to obtain statistical depth errors below 0. 2 nm. Laser-acoustic measurements based on ultra sonic surface waves were chosen as second method, which also measures the Youngs modulus in this thickness range. Although the indentation technique is a local probe and the laser-acoustic technique gives an integrated value for a surface range of some millimetres, the results agree well for the investigated samples. In contrast, it was impossible to get the correct Youngs modulus results by co nventional indentation measurements with Berkovich indenter, even for ultra-low loads...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} two ancient models {{of the relation between}} self-understanding and friendship. Here ‘self-understanding’ stands primarily for the understanding that our understanding has of itself. ‘Friendship’ stands for positive human relations in general. I argue in this dissertation that the model that I call Platonic conceives of self-understanding as possible only through and in friendship. ‘Friendship’, in this model, is the cooperation by which two intellects aim to comprehend each other and so themselves. I argue that the second, Stoic, model allows the self-understanding mind such intrinsic completion that it constitutes all that is valuable, including even the primary case of what they call ‘friendship’. This is an attempt to reconstruct some significant lines of thought in Stoic and Platonic philosophy, but not an exhaustive description of everything there is to be said about the topic of self-understanding and the topic of friendship in Platonic dialogues and in Stoic thought. Chapter one of this dissertation is about Plato’s Charmides. This dialogue develops a puzzle about the possibility of an understanding of understanding. I argue that a central element of this puzzle is the characterisation of understanding as something that is to a certain degree undetermined if we isolate it from its object. At the same time, something is a proper object of understanding only if it is something determined. As a result, understanding, by itself, is not a proper object for itself, and so an understanding of understanding turns out to be impossible. In chapter two I argue that the Platonic Alcibiades offers a way in which understanding of understanding is possible after all. It is developed in the famous image of two eyes that look into each other and see themselves there. This stands as an analogy for the possibility that souls can get to know themselves through another. I argue that, through the language and theoretical framework of this analogy, its author conceptualises our power to understand as able to grasp that it is something essentially directed towards something else. It can do this in an interaction with another power to understand in which the result of their cognitive activities is something more than the mere sum of their separate cognitive activities. This interaction, this friendship, is therefore essential to our understanding of ourselves as understanding beings. A <b>wholly</b> different situation <b>obtains</b> in the Stoic model. In Stoic thought, we are constituted by a part of inert matter and a divine part that is quintessentially active. This last, divine, part is responsible for our being the way we are. Through an analysis of Stoic metaphysics I argue that this active part is also able to act on itself. In this way, there is no ontological bar to the possibility that our understanding understands itself, as I argue in chapter three. At the same time, this activity preempts the need for others to intervene to make such self-understanding possible. This raises the question whether a perfectly rational person would have a need for others at all, in Stoic thought. The fourth chapter discusses the role of this understanding – that also understands itself – with respect to other rational beings. Its focus is on the Stoic redefinition of friendship that makes it apply, in the first instance, to our understanding itself, rather than to any external bond between people. At the same time, as emerges from this chapter, the Stoics see perfect rationality as a condition for having any use for others at all. An overall aim of this analysis is to show that the two models’ different ontological characterisations of the human power to understand have their correlates in different assessments of the need for others in the process of perfecting it...|$|R

More recently, non-preferential rules of origin are also being used for protectionist purpose. It is such protectionist adaptation {{of the rules of}} origin that prompted the WTO to launch the HWP to evolve common rules of origin for all countries. The present study is a critique of the harmonization work programme. The central objective of the ARO and also the HWP is to ensure that the rules of origin are employed without/ or with least trade distorting effects. But, as our study shows, it would be too optimistic to expect such an outcome from the HWP. On the contrary, even if it is successfully completed, the HWP is likely to leave considerable scope for misuse of rules of origin for protectionist purpose. Further, the new multilateral regime, even if it succeeds in establishing semblance of an order in the arena of rules of origin, is likely to have unequal effects on members. The moot question is as to whether the adopted harmonised rules match the trading interests of the developing nations. The picture emerging from our analysis of outstanding disputes is not very encouraging for the developing countries. They belong mainly to the traditional areas of western protectionism against developing countries. The fear that the developed countries are trying to manipulate rules of origin to compensate for the loss of tariff and other conventional barriers, therefore, cannot be ruled out.

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} benefits of Duty-Free and Quota-Free Market (DFQF) access initiatives of the Republic of Korea for least developed countries (LDCs), which {{have been in place}} since 1 January 2008. Following a brief introduction on the background of this initiative, this paper examines the exports profile of LDCs, reviews the DFQF scheme of the Republic of Korea, and assesses the potential benefits of the DFQF scheme for LDCs as well as Bangladesh. The export profile of LDCs shows that the share of those countries in world exports in recent years has increased; this can be attributed to price increases for petroleum constituting a major share of LDC total exports. The Republic of Korea is the tenth largest destination of LDC exports, which indicates that the DFQF initiatives of the Republic of Korea for LDCs will {{have a positive impact on}} LDC exports. The DFQF scheme of the Republic of Korea covers 6, 967 tariff lines, representing about 59 per cent of the all tariff lines of its Customs Schedule. There are at least 25 chapters where product coverage within the chapter is very low, notably below 10 per cent. These include garments, made-up textiles, and major agricultural products including fisheries. Among the DFQF lines, 1, 464 lines are duty-free on a most-favoured nation (MFN) basis. Hence, LDCs enjoy tariff preferences on 5, 503 tariff lines, while the average margin of preference on these lines is 7. 89 per cent. The margin of preferences in most cases is either 6 per cent or 8 per cent. In order to enjoy the preference granted under the scheme, the products should be <b>wholly</b> <b>obtained,</b> or should have at least 50 per cent value addition. Analysis also reveals that the DFQF scheme covers 36. 1 per cent of LDCs’ export to the Republic of Korea in 2007, keeping 64. 9 per cent of current LDC exports to that country outside the purview of preferential treatment. Only three major export items from LDCs – copper cathodes, raw tobacco and plywood – enjoy -free access. Bangladesh, Congo, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malawi, Myanmar, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia are likely to benefit from duty-free access for these items. The Republic of Korea is the seventh-largest destination for Bangladesh exports. Bangladesh enjoys preferential access to the Republic of Korea under the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA). DFQF access for LDCs adds 5, 471 tariff lines for Bangladesh under preferential access. However, analysis shows that the additional lines cover only 4. 63 per cent of Bangladesh’s exports to the Republic of Korea in 2007. However, there are important apparel articles in the scheme that may yield benefits for Bangladesh. APTA continues to remain attractive to Bangladesh because of higher trade coverage and more relaxed rules of origin. Nevertheless, the DFQF scheme currently offered by the Republic of Korea is a milestone for the developing countries’ initiative for LDCs, and one that is likely to lead to other countries coming up with similar initiatives. In time, the Republic of Korea is likely to incrementally increase the product coverage, which will lead to higher trade coverage and more favourable rules of origin, and will yield significant benefits for LDCs. least developed countries, Bangladesh, Korea, market access,...|$|E
