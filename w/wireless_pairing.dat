40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{advances}} in micro-fluidic techniques for environmental applications have brought wide opportunities for improving of {{the capacity to}} monitor water quality. However, the development of fully integrated micro-fluidic devices capable of performing complex functions requires the integration of mico-valve with appropriate performance, since they are essential tools for the control and manipulation of flows in micro-channels. [1] The incorporation of ionic liquids within responsive gel matrices (ionogels) produces hybrid materials with many advantages over conventional materials. Depending on the ionic liquid, ionogels give the possibility of tuning several micro-valve actuation times and so independently control liquid flows within the channels under a common illumination source. [2] The undeniable advantage of these materials arise {{from the use of}} non invasive, non-contact stimuli such as light, offering improvements in versatility during manifold fabrication, and control of the actuation mechanism. Here we present an attractive approach for water quality analysis, nitrite determination, based on photo-switchable ionogel actuators wherein the micro-valve opening/closing mechanism is controlled by simply applying localised white light irradiation using optical fibres.

40|$|Increased {{demand for}} {{improved}} water management is driving need for water quality monitoring systems with greatly improved price/performance characteristics. This work presents the {{first use of}} <b>wireless</b> <b>paired</b> emitter detector diode device (PEDD) as an optical sensor for colorimetric analysis of water quality in a Lab-on-a-disc device format. The instrument detector involves using two light emitting diodes (LEDs), which act as both a light source and photo detector (Fig. 1 a.). In comparison to the more commonly used method of coupling a LED to a photodiode, this technique achieves excellent sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, with very low cost fabrication and electronics. Furthermore, its low power consumption, increasing spectral range coverage, excellent intensity and efficiency, small size, ease of fabrication and simplicity of the PEDD make it a perfect optical detector for colorimetric assays [1]. In addition, the device is ideally suited for integration with microfluidic platforms based on the centrifugal Lab-on-a-Disc concept, in which detector difficulties can arise due to the high rotation speed typically used in this approach [2]. In this work the calibration of the system using bromocresol purple (BCP) is demonstrated. Concentration ranges were examined in parallel using UV-Vis spectroscopy as control, and the PEDD system. Similar limits of detection (ca. 2. 5 x 10 - 4 M, Fig. 1 b.) were obtained in both cases. However, the PEDD system presented a linear trend over {{a wider range of}} concentrations. The experiments demonstrate the potential for the wireless PEDD to be a versatile and cheap alternative optical detector system for water quality monitoring in microfluidic applications. ...|$|R

Unfortunately, the wireless communication among vehicles is vulnerable to security threats that may lead to very serious safety hazards. In this work, we propose a viable solution for coping with Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Conventionally, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is utilized for a secure communication with the pre-certified public key. However, a secure vehicle-to-vehicle communication requires additional means of verification in order to avoid impersonation attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes to certify both the public key and out-of-band sense-able static attributes to enable mutual authentication of the communicating vehicles. Vehicle owners are bound to preprocess (periodically) a certificate for both a public key and a list of fixed unchangeable attributes of the vehicle. Furthermore, the proposed approach is shown to be adaptable with regards to the existing authentication protocols. We illustrate the security verification of the proposed protocol using a detailed proof in Spi calculus. Comment: Accepted in Wireless Networks June 2015, 4 figure...|$|R

Increased demand for improved water management is a driving need for water quality monitoring systems with greatly improved price/performance characteristics. For a successful water treatment, rapid and reliable information on the sampling site are crucial. Furthermore, this information needs to be available in real time for any course of action to be implemented efficiently. In our laboratories, we believe that “Wireless Sensor Networks” is the key to obtain such monitoring capabilities. My project is focused on the development of novel chemo/bio-sensors based on functional materials integrated in micro-fluidic manifolds for environmental applications. These platforms should content a reliable sensing capability with low power wireless communication and remote control of the instrument status. In addition, the activity of the device, such as sampling, analysis, communication and power need to be integrated in the micro-fluidic platform. Special attention is given to the generation and control of liquid flow within the micro-channels using new materials that exhibit biomimetic behaviour [1]. I am using, in particular, stimuli-responsive gels that are of great interest as functional materials within micro-fluidic systems, since their actuation can be controlled remotely without physical contact (light or magnet), allowing for fast response times and versatility of fabrication.

40|$|In a world full {{of mobile}} and smart devices, enabled to {{communicate}} with each other over <b>wireless</b> channels, secure <b>pairing</b> of two devices is of prime importance. The main threat is the so-called Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, where an attacker inserts it-self into the pairing protocol and impersonates one of the legitimate parties.

40|$|Sparse code {{multiple}} access (SCMA) {{is a new}} frequency domain non-orthogonal multiple-access technique which can improve spectral efficiency of wireless radio access. With SCMA, different incoming data streams are directly mapped to codewords of different multi-dimensional cookbooks, where each codeword represents a spread transmission layer. Multiple SCMA layers share the same time-frequency resources of OFDMA. The sparsity of codewords makes the near-optimal detection feasible through iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). Such low complexity of multi-layer detection allows excessive codeword overloading in which the dimension of multiplexed layers exceeds the dimension of codewords. Optimization of overloading factor along with modulation-coding levels of layers provides a more flexible and efficient link-adaptation mechanism. On the other hand, the signal spreading feature of SCMA can improve link-adaptation {{as a result of}} less colored interference.

In this dissertation, we present Mobile Music Touch (MMT), a <b>wireless</b> glove <b>paired</b> with a computing device, such as a laptop, smart phone, or MP 3 player. The MMT system plays a song, while also "tapping" the fingers using vibration motors to indicate the correct finger to use to play the song on a piano keyboard. Learning a new skill or activity without active focus, an idea called Passive Haptic Learning(PHL) may allow an individual to learn one skill through their sense of touch while performing another, unrelated activity. Most rehabilitation activities are active in nature, requiring the focused participation of the injured person. Passive rehabilitation is the idea that some technologies and activities may bring about beneficial changes without the active engagement of the injured person. In order to study the concepts of PHL and PHR, we propose the Mobile Music Touch (MMT) system. We show that using passive rehabilitation in conjunction with the active rehabilitation of piano playing will bring about a greater degree of improvement in the hands than that achieved using only active rehabilitation. This dissertation research makes three unique contributions. First, we demonstrate that Passive Haptic Learning (PHL) using just the sense of touch is feasible and provides a form of learning and reinforcement of learned skills and tasks. Second, we identify the attributes and design features of a glove suited for long term wear by persons who use a manual wheelchair for mobility.

40|$|We {{examine the}} problem of {{minimizing}} feedbacks in reliable <b>wireless</b> broadcasting, by <b>pairing</b> rateless coding with extreme value theory. Our key observation is that, in a broadcast environment, this problem resolves into estimating {{the maximum number of}} packets dropped among many receivers rather than for each individual receiver. With rateless codes, this estimation relates to the number of redundant transmissions needed at the source in order for all receivers to correctly decode a message with high probability. We develop and analyze two new data dissemination protocols, called Random Sampling (RS) and Full Sampling with Limited Feedback (FSLF), based on the moment and maximum likelihood estimators in extreme value theory. Both protocols rely on a single-round learning phase, requiring the transmission of a few feedback packets from a small subset of receivers. With fixed overhead, we show that FSLF has the desirable property of becoming more accurate as the receivers’s population gets larger. Our protocols are channel agnostic, in that they do not require a-priori knowledge of (i. i. d.) packet loss probabilities, which may vary among receivers. We provide simulations and an improved full-scale implementation of the Rateless Deluge over-the-air programming protocol on sensor motes as a demonstration of the practical benefits of our protocols, which translate into about 30 % latency and energy consumption savings. Further, we apply our protocols to real time oblivious (RT) rateless codes in broadcast settings. Through simulations, we demonstrate a 100 -fold reduction in the amount o...|$|R
40|$|The Channel {{allocation}} {{method is}} an Cooperative Asynchronous multichannel MAC which introduces an Distributed Information Sharing (DISH) {{to be used}} in a distributed flavor of control-plane cooperation, as a new approach to wireless protocol design and then apply it to multichannel medium access control(MAC) to solve the MCC problem. The basic idea is to allow nodes to share control information with each other such that nodes can make more informed decisions in communication. Medium access control (MAC) protocols play a major role to create a wireless communication infrastructure. In <b>Wireless</b> network, transmitter-receiver <b>pairs</b> make independent decisions, which are often suboptimal due to insufficient knowledge about the communication environment. So, the new concept DISH is introduced and overcomes the problem occurred in the MAC protocol. The DISH concept avoids collision and re-transmission among nodes. The notion of control-plane cooperation augments the conventional understanding of cooperation, which sits at the data plane as a data relaying mechanism. In a multichannel network, DISH allows neighboring nodes to notify transmitter-receiver pairs of channel conflicts and deaf terminals to prevent collisions and retransmissions. Based on this, we design a single-radio cooperative asynchronous multichannel MAC protocol called CAM-MAC. When the CAM-MAC is used in illustration purposes, we choose a specific set of parameters for CAM-MAC.

Micro-Total-Analysis-Systems (mTAS) provide a route to the generation of analytical instruments that can be operated in remote locations, enabling in-situ water analysis. In this paper we present the development and fabrication of a Lab-on-a-Disc multiparameter water quality monitoring system. The micro-fluidic centrifugal platform (CD) offers many advantages over standard Lab-on-a-chip such as the elimination of large power supplies and external pumps. Depending on the design, the CD is applied for the point-of-care detection of different parameters in real samples.

40|$|Efficient {{use of a}} {{wireless}} network requires that transmissions be grouped into feasible sets, where feasibility means that each transmission can be successfully decoded {{in spite of the}} interference caused by simultaneous transmissions. Feasibility is most closely modeled by a signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) formula, which unfortunately is conceptually complicated, being an asymmetric, cumulative, many-to-one relationship. We re-examine how well graphs can capture wireless receptions as encoded in SINR relationships, placing them in a framework {{in order to understand the}} limits of such modelling. We seek for each <b>wireless</b> instance a <b>pair</b> of graphs that provide upper and lower bounds on the feasibility relation, while aiming to minimize the gap between the two graphs. The cost of a graph formulation is the worst gap over all instances, and the price of (graph) abstraction is the smallest cost of a graph formulation. We propose a family of conflict graphs that is parameterized by a non-decreasing sub-linear function, and show that with a judicious choice of functions, the graphs can capture feasibility with a cost of O(^* Δ), where Δ is the ratio between the longest and the shortest link length. This holds on the plane and more generally in doubling metrics. We use this to give greatly improved O(^* Δ) -approximation for fundamental link scheduling problems with arbitrary power control. We explore the limits of graph representations and find that our upper bound is tight: the price of graph abstraction is Ω(^* Δ).

40|$|In this manuscript, we {{consider}} the problems of channel assignment in wireless networks and data migration in heterogeneous storage systems. We show that a soft edge coloring approach to both problems gives rigorous approximation guarantees. In the channel assignment problem arising in <b>wireless</b> networks a <b>pair</b> of edges incident to a vertex {{are said to be}} conflicting if the channels assigned to them are the same. Our goal is to assign channels (color edges) so that the number of conflicts is minimized. The problem is NP-hard by a reduction from Edge coloring and we present two combinatorial algorithms for this case. The first algorithm is based on a distributed greedy method and gives a solution with at most 2 (1 - 1 /k) |E| more conflicts than the optimal solution. The approximation ratio if the second algorithm is 1 + |V|/|E|, which gives a (1 + o(1)) -factor for dense graphs and is the best possible unless P = NP. We also consider the data migration problem in heterogeneous storage systems. In such systems, data layouts may need to be reconfigured over time for load balancing or in the event of system failure/upgrades. It is critical to migrate data to their target locations as quickly as possible to obtain the best performance of the system. Most of the previous results on data migration assume that each storage node can perform only one data transfer at a time. However, storage devices tend to have heterogeneous capabilities as devices may be added over time due to storage demand increase. We develop algorithms to minimize the data migration time. We show {{that it is possible to}} find an optimal migration schedule when all c_v's are even. Furthermore, though the problem is NP-hard in general, we give an efficient soft edge coloring algorithm that offers a rigorous (1 + o(1)) -approximation guarantee...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the {{interference}} scheduling problem, one {{is given a}} set of n communication requests described by source–destination pairs of nodes from a metric space. The nodes correspond to devices in a <b>wireless</b> network. Each <b>pair</b> must be assigned a power level and a color such that the pairs in each color class can communicate simultaneously at the specified power levels. The feasibility of simultaneous communication within a color class is {{defined in terms of}} the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) that compares the strength of a signal at a receiver to the sum of the strengths of other signals. The objective is to minimize the number of colors as this corresponds to the time needed to schedule all requests. We introduce an instance-based measure of interference, denoted by I, that enables us to improve on previous results for {{the interference}} scheduling problem. We prove the upper and lower bounds in terms of I on the number of steps needed for scheduling a set of requests. For general power assignments, we prove a lower bound of Ω(I/(logΔlogn)) steps, where Δ denotes the aspect ratio of the metric. When restricting to the two-dimensional Euclidean space (as in the previous work) the bound improves to Ω(I/logΔ). Alternatively, when restricting to linear power assignments, the lower bound improves even to Ω(I). The lower bounds are complemented by an efficient algorithm computing a schedule for linear power assignments using only O(Ilogn) steps. A more sophisticated algorithm computes a schedule using even only O(I+log 2 n) steps. For dense instances in the two-dimensional Euclidean space, this gives a constant factor approximation for scheduling under linear power assignments, which shows that the price for using linear (and, hence, energy-efficient) power assignments is bounded by a factor of O(logΔ). In addition, we extend these results for single-hop scheduling to multi-hop scheduling and combined scheduling and routing problems, where our analysis generalizes the previous results towards general metrics and improves on the previous approximation factors...|$|R
