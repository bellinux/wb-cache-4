5|$|According to 20th Century Fox accounts, however, by April 1980 {{when the}} film had earned a {{reported}} $100million at the box office, after advertising, distribution fees, penalties and other costs were deducted, it was still recorded as having 'lost' $2.4million. This <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> example of Hollywood creative accounting and was much criticised. However, by August, Fox had started saying the film made $4 million in profit.|$|E
5|$|Another {{impact was}} the {{competition}} with Canada that Australia and New Zealand had with Irish immigration. The increasing Irish immigration <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> economic boon by these antipodean countries. One {{of the reasons}} for the increase was due to many Irish deciding against emigrating to the warring nations of North America.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20thcentury, the {{difficulty}} of navigating the Columbia <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades. The dredging and dam building that followed would permanently alter the river, disrupting its natural flow but also providing electricity, irrigation, navigability and other benefits to the region.|$|E
50|$|Schumpeterian rent <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of {{economic}} rent, although Schumpeterian rent may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> incentive towards greater economic inefficiency.|$|R
50|$|Observe {{also that}} a {{necessity}} measure can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lower probability and a possibility measure can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> upper probability.|$|R
50|$|Independence can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{special kind}} of {{conditional}} independence, since probability can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kind of conditional probability given no events.|$|R
5|$|One reason {{senators}} {{were reluctant}} to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically {{in much of the}} nation. Additionally, a President Wade <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> obstacle to Grant's ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Rodney So'oialo {{was made}} {{stand-in}} captain {{and started the}} TriNations with a win and two losses. McCaw returned for the fourth game and the All Blacks won the remaining three matches to retain the TriNations title and Bledisloe Cup. McCaw <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> inspiration after his return from injury, with Henry rating his performance in the 19–0 win in South Africa (the first time the South Africans had been kept scoreless on home soil in 105 years) as his best so far for the All Blacks.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{refused to}} yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil {{prepared for what}} <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> imminent conflict. PedroII was {{the main reason for}} Brazil's resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> amount of matter 2. <b>A</b> hole can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> region of space 3. <b>A</b> building can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> place 4. A biological organ can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aggregate of molecules 5. An association can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group of people 6. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies. It can be stated as follows: Ontological Distinction Principle: Classes corresponding to different ident...|$|R
50|$|After WWII {{women were}} {{discouraged}} from entering into engineering. During the war, their efforts <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> patriotic duty. After the war, women in engineering <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> abnormality.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> bicone can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{polyhedral}} {{limiting case}} of an n-gonal bipyramid where n approaches infinity. It can also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dual of <b>a</b> cylinder <b>as</b> <b>an</b> infinite-side prism.|$|R
5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice Alice Hicks (January 2, 1919– October 21, 1979) was an American {{engineer}}, {{the first}} woman engineer to be hired by Western Electric, and both co-founder and {{first president of the}} Society of Women Engineers. Despite entering the field at a time where engineering <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> inappropriate career for a woman, Hicks held a variety of leadership positions and eventually became the owner of an engineering firm. During her time there, Hicks developed a gas density switch that would be used in the U.S. space program, including the Apollo moon landing missions.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into his}} {{freshman}} season, Allen {{was selected to}} the Preseason All-Atlantic 10 Rookie Team. He <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> answer for Temple's rebounding and interior scoring struggles from the previous 12-18 season. In his first college basketball game, Allen scored eight points and grabbed nine rebounds in a loss to #7 Tennessee. From November18 through December9,2007, he scored in double figures in six consecutive games. On February10,2008, Allen's season-high 20points led Temple to an 80-70 overtime victory over the UMass Minutemen. Allen was benched in the February17 game against Dayton due to missing a study assignment.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{statement}} can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{support of}} the harmony between the teachings and Chán. The second statement can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> support of a [...] "special transmission outside the teachings".|$|R
50|$|In some areas, the {{bullhead}} <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> desirable quarry, for its fighting qualities exceed its size. In other areas, it <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nuisance fish {{due to its}} efficient bait-stealing qualities.|$|R
50|$|Toad <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> zombie, {{along with}} several {{other members of the}} zombie Freedom Force chasing after the still living Blob. They succeed, <b>as</b> he <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> zombie in Dead Days.|$|R
5|$|In December 1962, Combat Development Command (CDC) {{drafted a}} Qualitative Material Requirement (QMR) for an interim, {{commercial}} off-the-shelf (COTS) aircraft, with a 140-knot (161mph, 259km/h) cruise speed and a 1,500-pound (680kg) payload. This <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt by Army officials, anticipating {{the potential of}} the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter. However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Mesopotamia, Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the Babylonians, <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> arrow aiming towards Orion, {{while the}} {{southern}} stars of Canis Major {{and a part}} of Puppis were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the Three Stars Each tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled MUL.APIN, the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and the bow with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil. Ninurta was linked to the later deity Marduk, who was said to have slain the ocean goddess Tiamat with a great bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow and arrow depiction with that of a dog.|$|E
5|$|Olds was {{assigned}} to command the 71st Fighter Squadron, which was soon detached from the 1st FG to the Air Defense Command and based at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport in Pennsylvania. As a result, he missed service in the Korean War despite repeated applications for a combat assignment. Discouraged and {{at odds with the}} Air Force, in which he <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> iconoclast, Olds reportedly {{was in the process of}} resigning when he was talked out of it by a mentor, Maj Gen Frederic H. Smith, Jr., who brought him to work at Eastern Air Defense Command headquarters at Stewart AFB.|$|E

50|$|Dom Peters <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shining {{example for}} all inner-city {{children}} {{wanting to get}} into professional sport after coming through the Broncos youth system. He <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> highly promising winger when injury-free.|$|R
5000|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {4/2} antiprism; with {4/2} being a tetragram, a {{compound}} of two dual digons, and the tetrahedron <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> digonal antiprism, this can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> compound of two digonal antiprisms.|$|R
5|$|The Way I See It was {{released}} by Columbia Records on September 16, 2008, and was initially overlooked by consumers. It sold steadily and spent 41 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart, reaching sales of 282,000 copies in the United States by May 2011. It also performed well in European countries such as France, where it charted for 51 weeks. The Way I See It received generally positive reviews from critics and <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time. It also garnered Saadiq a newer, more diverse audience as he toured extensively {{in support of the}} album, performing concerts in the US, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} pneumonectomy for lung cancer {{was performed in}} 1933. Palliative radiotherapy has been used since the 1940s. Radical radiotherapy, initially used in the 1950s, {{was an attempt to}} use larger radiation doses in patients with relatively early-stage lung cancer, but who were otherwise unfit for surgery. In 1997, continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> improvement over conventional radical radiotherapy. With small-cell lung carcinoma, initial attempts in the 1960s at surgical resection and radical radiotherapy were unsuccessful. In the 1970s, successful chemotherapy regimens were developed.|$|E
5|$|The move <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{effort by}} the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains {{as to whether or}} not these airspace violations were a necessity, as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do so. Still, many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs.|$|E
50|$|As the {{displacement}} can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mechanical analogue of electric charge, the absement can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mechanical analogue of the time-integrated charge, a quantity useful for modelling {{some types of}} memory elements.|$|R
5000|$|Cashmere Ramada and Shelley Oceans {{appeared}} in the Neil's Puppet Dreams episode [...] "Dream Bump." [...] Cashmere Ramada <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dancer while Shelly Oceans <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> drag queen (performed by Allan Trautman).|$|R
30|$|As already {{explained}} in [12], RS can also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of non-orthogonal multi-user transmission. Indeed, in its simplest form, the common message in RS can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> non-orthogonal layer added onto the private layers.|$|R
5|$|The third error {{enumerated}} by Peter the Venerable {{was that}} the Petrobrusians “command the sacred crosses to be broken in pieces and burned, because that form or instrument by which Christ was so dreadfully tortured, so cruelly slain, is not worthy of any adoration, or veneration or supplication, but for the avenging of his torments and death it should be treated with unseemly dishonor, cut in pieces with swords, burnt in fire.” This <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> iconoclastic heresy and as acts of sacrilege by the medieval Church, {{as well as by}} Catholics to this day.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a similar}} {{opposition}} during the 1799 election of {{delegates to the}} Buenos Aires Cabildo: Castelli was elected as third Regidor, but was rejected by merchants associated with the port of Cádiz. The conflict lasted a year, until the prominent local merchant Cornelio Saavedra wrote a memorandum recommending Castelli. Viceroy Avilés finally confirmed him in office by royal decree, in May 1800. Castelli, however, rejected the post because of his high workload in the Consulate. This <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> insult by peninsular merchants such as Martín de Álzaga, who was influential in the Cabildo.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{intervention}} of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked. There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by Lenin's New Economic Policy, which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks. While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after {{the chaos of the}} war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mineowners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours.|$|E
5000|$|On January 3, 2017, Bramnick {{announced}} that he would not run for New Jersey governor in 2017, <b>as</b> he <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential frontrunner for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Bramnick <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential 2018 Senate candidate against Sen. Robert Menendez.|$|R
50|$|The crossed square cupola may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{part of some}} uniform polyhedra. For example, {{the great}} cubicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> six crossed square cupolae {{connected}} at their triangular faces, while the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> blend of six cupolae. Additionally, the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> octagrammic prism with the octagrams excavated with crossed square cupolae, similarly to how the rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> octagonal prism with the octagons augmented with square cupolae. Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron. To this may be added the great rhombihexahedron, as the exclusive or of {{all three of these}} octagrammic prisms which may be used to construct the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R
5000|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{equilateral}} hexagonal tiling {{with each}} hexagon divided into 12 triangles {{from the center}} point.
