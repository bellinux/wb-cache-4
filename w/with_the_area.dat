5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 16.

The disturbance crossed southern Florida, and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development. It tracked slowly westward at 5mph (7km/h), and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230miles (370km) south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham as a {{settlement}} {{dates from the}} Anglo-Saxon era. The city's name comes from the Old English Beormingahām, meaning the home or settlement of the Beormingas – indicating that Birmingham {{was established in the}} 6th or early 7th century as the primary settlement of an Anglian tribal grouping and regio of that name. Despite this early importance, {{by the time of the}} Domesday Book of 1086 the manor of Birmingham was one of the poorest and least populated in Warwickshire, valued at only 20 shillings, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> of the modern city divided between the counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire.|$|E

The LaVérendrye group buried a plate near the site of modern-day Pierre, claiming the region for France as part of greater Louisiana. in 1762 the entire region became part of the Spanish Louisiana until 1802. By the early 19th century, the Sioux had largely replaced the Arikara as the dominant group in the area.|$|E

5|$|By the 1950s, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> around Woking by {{this time}} heavily populated, rental income from the LNC's land {{holdings}} was an extremely valuable asset, and in May 1955 the Alliance Property Company launched a hostile takeover bid {{with the aim of}} using the cemetery's land for property development. The bid failed, but prompted the LNC to secure the passing of the London Necropolis Act 1956, allowing the sale of all remaining surplus land. A new company, the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company, was founded to oversee the disposal of the remaining unsold lands as well as the cemetery reserve, finally formally recognising that Brookwood Cemetery would never expand beyond its original boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by a friend, {{she went}} to Paris to become a writer but had little success. While in Paris Eberhardt met the widow of Marquis de Morès. Although deMorès was {{reportedly}} murdered by Tuareg tribesmen in the Sahara, {{no one had been}} arrested. When his widow learned that Eberhardt was familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> where deMorès died, she hired her to investigate his murder. The job benefited Eberhardt, who was destitute and longed to return to the Sahara. She returned to Algeria in July 1900, settling in El Oued. According to Sahara expert R. V. C. Bodley, Eberhardt made little effort to investigate deMorès' death; Bodley considered this due to a combination of the unwillingness of the French to co-operate in an investigation and Eberhardt's fatalism rather than deliberate dishonesty. Word eventually got back to the deMorès widow about Eberhardt's lackluster investigation, and she subsequently cut off her funding.|$|E

5|$|In 1862 Troy {{suffered}} {{another major}} fire, {{the worst in}} its history.

As before, the city rebuilt quickly, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months from the ashes of its predecessor. The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.|$|E
5|$|Testing was, however, able to {{continue}} in the meantime, as Platt-LePage had re-negotiated the XR-1 contract to cover a second flight-test aircraft. Built to a revised and improved version of the XR-1's design and designated XR-1A, the second aircraft had flown {{for the first time in}} May 1943. The XR-1A featured a revised cockpit covering compared to that of the XR-1, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> of glazing being increased for improved visibility, and the pilot and observer's positions being reversed, the pilot now seated in the rear cockpit. During flight testing the XR-1A was found superior in flight performance to the XR-1; however, the controls were still proving troublesome, although the worst of the bugs did seem to have been worked out.|$|E
5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal. John Betjeman, who was well-acquainted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man {{and fell in love}} with him. When she could no longer bear living without him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the sandbank grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E

Owing to the popularity of the market, parking is heavily restricted, limited to occasional parking metered spaces along the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} a British outpost in Singapore seemed {{initially}} in doubt as the Dutch government soon protested to Britain for violating the Netherlands' sphere of influence. But as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 cemented the status of Singapore as a British possession, carving up the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> north of the Straits of Malacca, including Singapore, falling under Britain's sphere of influence. In 1826, Singapore was grouped by the British East India Company together with Penang and Malacca to form the Straits Settlements, administered by the British East India Company. In 1830, the Straits Settlements became a residency, or subdivision, of the Presidency of Bengal in British India.|$|E
