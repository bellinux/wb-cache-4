5|$|Some {{critics have}} noted {{similarities}} between names in Septimus Heap {{and those in}} Harry Potter, such as Petroc Trelawney (Jenna's pet rock) and Sybill Trelawney (a professor in Harry Potter); also both series feature Boggarts (which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape-shifters in Harry Potter). In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is {{nothing at all to}} do with Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> over the air. Think: why would Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly logical... And as for Boggarts, they've been around here in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example. They're not really like either Sage's or Rowling's creatures, but pre-exist either of them.|$|E
