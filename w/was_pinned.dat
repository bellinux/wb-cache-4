5|$|Cena made a {{surprise}} return {{as the final}} participant of the Royal Rumble match, winning the match, and the traditional WrestleMania title shot, by last eliminating Triple H. Instead of waiting until WrestleMania, the title shot was cashed in against then WWE Champion Randy Orton at February's No Way Out pay-per-view in a match where Cena won by disqualification, resulting in him not getting the championship. The night after No Way Out, Cena was placed back into WrestleMania XXIV's WWE Championship match, making it a triple threat match also involving Triple H, during which he <b>was</b> <b>pinned</b> by Orton. At Backlash, Cena failed to regain the title in a fatal four-way elimination match, in which he <b>was</b> <b>pinned</b> by Orton. Triple H won the title during that match, during which Cena eliminated JBL, renewing their feud from 2005. Cena defeated JBL at Judgment Day and then at One Night Stand in a First Blood match. JBL, however, defeated him in a New York City Parking Lot Brawl at The Great American Bash in July. Cena also failed to regain the WWE Championship from Triple H at Night of Champions.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded France. By that time, the BEF {{consisted}} of 10 infantry divisions in three corps, a tank brigade and a Royal Air Force detachment of around 500 aircraft. The BEF <b>was</b> <b>pinned</b> by a German diversionary attack through Belgium and then isolated {{by the main}} attack that came through the Ardennes forest. Well-equipped and highly mobile Panzer divisions of the Wehrmacht overran the French and then British prepared defences. There was some fierce fighting, however being dwarfed by the German land forces most of the BEF withdrew to a small area around the French port of Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match at}} Victory Road to air live on PPV was a twenty-man Gauntlet match, {{consisting}} of wrestlers who compete in TNA's X Division. In this particular match, wrestlers were eliminated by being thrown {{over the top}} rope {{and down to the}} floor until there were two left in the ring. Those two men had a standard match until one <b>was</b> <b>pinned</b> or made to submit. The final two participants were Kazarian and Héctor Garza. Kazarian tried to pin Garza with a Cradle, but Garza countered the maneuver with a roll-up for the win.|$|E

A {{partially}} pinned unit may break its own pin by capturing the pinning piece; however, a partial <b>pin</b> can still <b>be</b> advantageous to the pinning player, for instance if the queen <b>is</b> <b>pinned</b> by a rook or bishop, and the <b>pinning</b> piece <b>is</b> defended, so that capturing {{it with the}} queen would lose material.

If a {{champion}} <b>was</b> <b>pinned</b> by another competitor, then they lost their championship in the encounter. Mondo ended up pinning Flash to win the Iron Man Championship in the bout. On July 13, 2002 at CZW's Deja Vu, Flash and Pain fought to a double pinfall for the CZW Iron Man and World Heavyweight Championships, which Pain held.

Thus, South Vietnamese attempts to stage an effective counter-attack were quickly blunted by the combined Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces in Quảng Ngãi Province. Recognising that he no longer has the manpower to mount a counter-attack, General Nhut ordered his troops to abandon Tra Bong and Son Ha, and concentrate his units in Tam Kỳ and Chu Lai instead.|$|E

When he learned that it was fake, he dumped her publicly on Raw when they were supposed to renew their wedding vows. Stephanie aligned with Jericho afterward, but she was forced to leave after losing a triple threat match on Raw the night after WrestleMania when she <b>was</b> <b>pinned</b> by Triple H.

The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by Vandegrift. By nightfall, the Japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon, killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving. On 20 September, a patrol from Edson's Raiders encountered stragglers from Kawaguchi's retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them.|$|E

On his own account, Martinez led two assaults, firing into the Japanese foxholes and occasionally stopping to urge on his comrades. His example inspired the men of his unit to follow. Martinez {{was shot in the head}} as he approached one final foxhole after the second assault, dying of the wound the following day. Because of his actions the pass was taken, and its capture was an important preliminary to the end of organized hostile resistance. Martinez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

After the first down, Rix fumbled the ball, recovered it, and was sacked by the Tech defense at the State nine-yard line. Two long rushing plays made up the lost yardage, and State earned a first down at their 27-yard line. From there, Rix completed a 44-yard pass to Javon Walker for a first down at the Tech 29-yard line. In the final seconds of the quarter, Rix attempted a touchdown pass, but the ball fell incomplete. With one quarter elapsed, Virginia Tech led, 30.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} on the Muslim left wing which Yazid commanded was considerably more serious. Whilst the Muslim right wing enjoyed assistance from the mobile guard, the left wing did not and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun, with soldiers retreating towards base camps. Here the Byzantines had broken through the corps. The testudo formation that Gregory's army had adopted moved slowly but also had a good defense. Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed. Despite stiff resistance, the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps {{and for a moment}} Vahan's plan appeared to be succeeding. The centre of the Muslim army <b>was</b> <b>pinned</b> down and its flanks had been pushed back. However, neither flank had broken, though their morale was severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|Corporal Angel Mendez (1946–1967) {{was among}} the many men who volunteered to join the Marine Corps right {{after graduating from high}} school. He was {{assigned}} to Company F, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division on March 16, 1967, and conducting a search and destroy mission with his company when his company came under attack from a Viet Cong battalion. Half of a platoon <b>was</b> <b>pinned</b> down under enemy fire, and Mendez volunteered to lead a squad to assist the pinned-down Marines in returning to friendly lines with their two dead and two seriously wounded. Mendez exposed himself and opened fire on the enemy. His platoon commander, Lieutenant Ronald Castille, was seriously wounded and he fell, unable to move. Mendez shielded him with his body as he applied a dressing to the wound, he picked up the lieutenant and started to carry him to friendly lines, which were more than seventy-five meters away. Mendez was hit in the shoulder, yet he chose to act as rear man and he continued to shield his lieutenant with his own body until he was mortally wounded. Mendez was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross and promoted to sergeant.|$|E
5|$|Following Armageddon, Orton {{entered the}} 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, {{but he was}} {{eliminated}} by Rey Mysterio.

In the weeks preceding No Way Out, Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, {{in an attempt to}} gain villain heat. Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005. Orton won at No Way Out, earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle. On April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton <b>was</b> <b>pinned</b> by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.|$|E
