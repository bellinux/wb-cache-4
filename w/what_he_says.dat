5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in many ways, {{in part because}} Poe's sincerity in the work is questionable. It has been {{considered}} prophetically scientific, intuitively romantic, and even calculatingly ironic. Lacking scientific proof, Poe {{said it was not}} his goal to prove <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> to be true, but to convince through suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|That night Quatermass {{travels with}} {{journalist}} Hugh Conrad to the prefab town where they meet with construction workers {{who say that}} work has been suspended for all except the 'zombies' ('marked' people). They claim that the meteorites are only over-shots from the plant after one of them lands in a pub. These recent meteorites are falling in hundreds and being collected by special guard teams {{then returned to the}} plant. Quatermass steals a guard's uniform from a lorry to gain entry to the plant. As he does this Conrad returns to the pub to telephone his newspaper and reveal everything about the secret alien invasion, but he becomes 'marked' before he can finish. The construction workers, however, hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> and decide to take action. Meanwhile, Quatermass is inside a pressure dome, where he sees guards putting meteorites into the tanks of poisonous slime that killed Ward, where together, in the recreated atmosphere of a moon of Saturn, they combine and grow into the first of the enormous ammonid alien creatures.|$|E

25|$|Cauchy {{makes some}} general remarks about {{functions}} in Chapter I, Section 1 of his Analyse algébrique (1821). From <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> there, {{it is clear}} that he normally regards a function as being defined by an analytic expression (if it is explicit) or by an equation or a system of equations (if it is implicit); where he differs from his predecessors is that he is prepared to consider the possibility that a function may be defined only for a restricted range of the independent variable.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} part of Scouting education is the personal example of the leader. The Scout is impressed by the leader because of his age, his knowledge, and his position as a leader. If the leader is popular, leadership {{will be seen as}} an attractive goal, and the Scout will follow the example of the leader. The Scoutmaster living the Scout law will have more influence than one who simply talks about it. In the boys' eyes it is what a man does that counts and not so much <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says.</b>|$|E
25|$|In these lectures, Newman denounced various anti-Catholic utterances. These {{included}} {{those of}} the Maria Monk, the allegation of cells under his own Oratory on Hagley Road, Birmingham and those of Giacinto Achilli. Newman emphasises the importance of responding to Achilli: For how, Brothers of the Oratory, can we possibly believe a man like this , in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> about persons and facts, and conversations, and events, when he is of the stamp of Maria Monk, of Jeffreys, and of Teodore, and of others who have had their hour, and then been dropped by the indignation or the shame of mankind.|$|E

25|$|The dialect {{was also}} popularized by the comic {{magazine}} Viz, where the dialect is often conveyed phonetically by unusual spellings within the comic strips. Viz magazine {{was founded on}} Tyneside by two locals, Chris Donald and his brother Simon. The Steve Coogan-helmed BBC comedy I'm Alan Partridge featured a Geordie named Michael (Simon Greenall) as the primary supporting character and de facto best friend of the eponymous hero, despite Partridge's referring to Michael at one point as 'just the Work Geordie' and having great difficulty understanding <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> The movie Goal!, which stars Kuno Becker and Alessandro Nivola (and also sees a cameo of Brian Johnson) prominently exposes the Newcastle football club, as well as exposing the Geordies and their dialect.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} of Swedenborg's theology was {{laid down in}} Arcana Cœlestia (Heavenly Mysteries), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In {{a significant portion of}} that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> is the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in Apocalypse Revealed.) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the creation myth was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to Jesus Christ, and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of Genesis and Exodus.|$|E
