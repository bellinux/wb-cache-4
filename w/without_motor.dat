Unlike Minolta's motor-in-body approach, this design located the motor within the lens. New, more compact motor designs meant that both focus and aperture could be driven electrically <b>without</b> <b>motor</b> bulges in the lens.

50|$|Epidural opioids {{can produce}} {{analgesia}} <b>without</b> <b>motor</b> or sympathetic blockade. Lipid soluble opioids {{stay in the}} cerebrospinal fluid {{for a long time}} and hence give a longer supply of analgesia. However, in this case, the onset of analgesia is delayed. The lipophilicity of an opioid is determined by its octanol-buffer partition coefficient. The concentration of an opioid in the spinal cord is determined by the net difference between its rate of uptake and distribution in the vascular and subarachinoid spaces.|$|E

40|$|Comparison {{of health}} related {{quality of life}} of primary school deaf {{children}} with and <b>without</b> <b>motor</b> impairment Venkadesan Rajendran*, Finita Glory Roy Objective: To compare the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of primary school-age deaf children with or <b>without</b> <b>motor</b> impairment to that of typically developing peers. Methods: This study was a prospective, cross sectional study. With age-matched controls, 100 children were analyzed in each of the following three categories: normal hearing, hearing impaired <b>without</b> <b>motor</b> impairment, and hearing impairment with motor impairment. The Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) version 4. 0 was used to assess the HRQOL. Results: Hearing impairment along with motor impairment in children is associated with significantly increased proportions of suboptimal levels of function and significantly lower HRQOL. Children with hearing impairment and no motor impairment had significantly lower scores in the emotional health and school function domains of the PedsQL than children with normal hearing, but {{there was no significant difference}} in the physical and social health domain scores. Children with hearing impairment and motor impairment showed significantly lower scores in all domains of the PedsQL compared to children with normal hearing. Scores in all four domains of the PedsQL differed between children with hearing impairment and no motor impairment and children with hearing impairment and motor impairment. Conclusion: These findings indicate that children with hearing impairment, both with and <b>without</b> <b>motor</b> impairment, have a diminished health-related quality of life. 1...|$|E
