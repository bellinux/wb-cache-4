5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E

The 2004 Institute of Medicine report committee recommended that while it supported [...] "targeted research that focuses on better understanding the disease of autism, from a public health perspective the committee does not consider a significant investment in studies of the theoretical vaccine-autism connection to be useful at this time." [...] Alison Singer, a senior executive of Autism Speaks, resigned from the group in 2009 {{in a dispute over}} whether to fund more research on links between vaccination and autism, saying, [...] "There isn't an unlimited pot of money, and every dollar spent looking where we know the answer isn't is one less dollar we have to spend where <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> new answers." ...|$|E
500|$|Dr. Helmut F. Landsberg, {{a climate}} {{scientist}} {{with the federal}} Weather Bureau, predicted in 1963 that the Northeastern and Great Lakes regions could anticipate a major smog event every three years due to the confluence of weather events and trends like growing population, industrialization, and increased emissions from cars and central heating. In early 1966, Dr. Walter Orr Roberts—director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research—warned of the imminent threat of a smog event {{with the potential to}} kill as many as 10,000 people. Roberts identified Los Angeles or New York City as the cities most vulnerable to a large-scale lethal smog in the United States, and London, Hamburg, or Santiago as other the most vulnerable internationally. Asked if [...] "many" [...] American cities were vulnerable to a disaster smog event, Roberts replied, [...] "Yes. I have been worried that we would wake up some morning to an unusual meteorological situation that prevented the air from circulating and that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> thousands of people dead {{as the result of the}} air they were forced to breathe in that smog situation." ...|$|E

500|$|Homer's {{inclusion}} in many Simpsons publications, toys, and other merchandise {{is evidence of}} his enduring popularity. The Homer Book, about Homer's personality and attributes, was released in 2004 and is commercially available. It {{has been described as}} [...] "an entertaining little book for occasional reading" [...] and was listed as one of [...] "the most interesting books of 2004" [...] by The Chattanoogan. Other merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, bobblehead dolls, mugs, alarm clocks, jigsaw puzzles, Chia Pets, and clothing such as slippers, T-shirts, baseball caps, and boxer shorts. Homer has appeared in commercials for Coke, 1-800-COLLECT, Burger King, Butterfinger, C.C. Lemon, Church's Chicken, Domino's Pizza, Intel, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Ramada Inn, Subway and T.G.I. Friday's. In 2004, Homer starred in a MasterCard Priceless commercial that aired during Super Bowl XXXVIII. In 2001, Kelloggs launched a brand of cereal called [...] "Homer's Cinnamon Donut Cereal", which was available for a limited time. In June 2009, Dutch automotive navigation systems manufacturer TomTom announced that Homer would be added to its downloadable GPS voice lineup. Homer's voice, recorded by Dan Castellaneta, features several in-character comments such as [...] "Take the third right. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> an ice cream truck!

2500|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{suggests that the}} nocebo effect of acupuncture is clinically relevant and {{that the rate of}} adverse events may be a gauge of the nocebo effect. According to the 2014 Miller's Anesthesia book, [...] "when compared with placebo, acupuncture treatment has proven efficacy for relieving pain". A 2012 meta-analysis conducted by the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration found [...] "relatively modest" [...] efficiency of acupuncture (in comparison to sham) for the treatment of four different types of chronic pain (back and neck pain, knee osteoarthritis, chronic headache, and shoulder pain) and on that basis concluded that it [...] "is more than a placebo" [...] and a reasonable referral option. Commenting on this meta-analysis, both Edzard Ernst and David Colquhoun said the results were of negligible clinical significance. Edzard Ernst later stated that [...] "I fear that, once we manage to eliminate this bias [...] … <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> that the effects of acupuncture exclusively are a placebo response." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 4, 2010, U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar {{called a}} meeting of {{principal}} parties to resolve remaining issues after the National Park Service ruled that Nantucket Sound is eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its cultural and spiritual significance to two Native American tribes. [...] "After several years of review, {{it is now time}} to move the Cape Wind proposal to a final decision point. That is why I am gathering the principal parties together next week to consider the findings of the Keeper and to discuss how <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> a common-sense agreement on actions that could be taken to minimize and mitigate Cape Wind’s potential impacts on historic and cultural resources. [...] I am hopeful that an agreement among the parties can be reached by March1. If an agreement among the parties can’t be reached, I will be prepared to take the steps necessary to bring the permit process to conclusion. The public, the parties, and the permit applicants deserve certainty and resolution." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard was {{interested}} in aesthetics, and is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "poet-philosopher" [...] because of the passionate way in which he approached philosophy. But he is often said to be interested in showing the inadequacy of a life lived entirely in the aesthetic level. Aesthetic life is defined in numerous different ways in Kierkegaard's authorship, including a life defined by intellectual enjoyment, sensuous desire, and an inclination to interpret oneself as if one were [...] "on stage." [...] There are many degrees of this aesthetic existence and a single definition is thus difficult to offer. At bottom, one might see the purely unreflective lifestyle. At the top, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> those lives which are lived in a reflective, independent, critical and socially apathetic way. But many interpreters of Kierkegaard believe that most people live in the least reflective sort of aesthetic stage, their lives and activities guided by everyday tasks and concerns. Fewer aesthetically guided people are the reflective sort. Whether such people know it or not, their lives will inevitably lead to complete despair. Kierkegaard's author A is an example of an individual living the aesthetic life.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Thierry Nguyen {{scored the}} PC version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "well-meaning but {{ultimately}} flawed." [...] He too disliked Billy's levels, especially the platforming sections. He concluded [...] "Call of Juarez {{is a game}} we wanted to like, as it has most of the requisite elements that we {{look for in a}} Western. It's just that the really sloppy platforming and box-moving, which take up a good chunk of the game, puts a big damper on any joy that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> in shooting up bandits and cowboys." [...] Sterling McGarvey also scored the Xbox 360 version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "yet another Tex-Mex shooter that seems to have been made by a bunch of guys who've watched a few too many Westerns but haven't figured out how to get the ambience and authenticity of the historical period down." [...] He praised the shooting mechanics, but concluded [...] "For the most part, Call of Juarez has taken two core ideas and melded them into a game. [...] There will be inevitable comparisons to Neversoft's GUN, but CoJ feels much more a next-gen version of the lackluster Dead Man's Hand than anything else." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Molyneux {{explains}} {{in his article}} Emin Matters, that her work revolves around class, sex and art itself. He writes that, [...] "What she does do is present herself as culturally working class…She makes no attempt to engage in 'intellectual art speak' but sticks to unaffected everyday language," [...] employing a strategy that doesn't place her in authority over her viewers or peers. However, her class background contradicts this tactic of equal understanding. Emin's mother until age seven owned a hotel in Margate, but bankruptcy and poverty ensued only when she broke up with Emin's father. While she may use street language, swear words, grammatical errors and misspellings to convey a primarily middle-class female experience, Emin now functions as a boss of her own art business and exists within the elite upper class. Her relationship with sex is a major theme and aspect of her work. Feminist writers have reviewed Emin's pieces as containing, [...] "…no element of eroticism or titillation…unlike in Botticelli, Renoir or Klimt. Nor is it sexual fantasy or dreams, as <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> in surrealism, or {{the sex of the}} brothel featured so heavily in late 19th-century French art. It is real, everyday sex—as experienced by her, of course, but also by millions of other people".|$|E

3000|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate those factors underlying music listening in different situations. Firstly, as everyday listening situations vary, it seems appropriate to attempt to characterize these differences in terms of Mehrabian and Russell’s PAD framework. It similarly seems appropriate to attempt to address responses to these situations in terms of those theories outlined above. Specifically, as Berlyne’s theory attempts to explain all aesthetic responses, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> expect to <b>find</b> an inverted-U relationship between ratings of pleasure and arousal assigned to the listening situation itself. Similarly, given the arguments above concerning the importance of choice, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> expect to <b>find</b> a positive relationship between ratings of pleasure and dominance assigned to the listening situations.
