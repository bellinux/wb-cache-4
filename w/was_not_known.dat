5|$|A third son, William Hemings, {{enlisted in}} the regular Union Army as a white man. Madison's last known male-line descendant, William never married and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> to have had children. He died in 1910 in a veterans' hospital.|$|E
5|$|Despite his wealth, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> for {{a lavish}} life. His court {{of about a}} hundred people <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not even have a single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes {{that much of the}} historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.|$|E
5|$|End Georgie Ratterman {{was under}} {{treatment}} by a stomach specialist {{as the result}} of trouble supposedly caused by over-exertion during his confinement in a German prison during World War I. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> if he could still play.|$|E

50|$|The tree <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> to {{have ever}} flowered, thus {{propagation}} is by cuttings only. The variety <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> to <b>be</b> in commerce in Serbia or elsewhere.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> which {{submarine}} had sunk Irish Oak. The survivors knew only {{that it was not}} U-650. In the House of Commons Sir William Davidson called for a formal protest, because Irish Oak had not warned the convoy, and Douglas Lloyd Savory called for an end of coal exports to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Before the Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> {{to be an}} earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude 1.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, {{but at least one}} earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, Natural Resources Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone.|$|E
5|$|Bosh {{is noted}} for his leadership. When {{he was the}} leader of the Raptors, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> for being vocal on the court, preferring to {{maintain}} his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic. However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who make bad calls on the court. Throughout his career, comparisons have been made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier, but the structural nature of this membrane <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known.</b> Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick.|$|E
5|$|Enrico Fermi {{and a team}} of {{scientists}} at the University of Rome reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934. Fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned it in his Nobel Lecture in 1938. The sample was actually a mixture of barium, krypton, and other elements, but this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> at the time. Nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. The mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} first nationally {{telecast}} bulletin about the shooting was made by Kathleen Sullivan {{as part of a}} standard newscast on Cable News Network; Sullivan reported that Lennon had been shot but his condition <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> {{at the time of the}} bulletin. NBC-TV momentarily broke into its East Coast feed of The Best of Carson for its bulletin of Lennon's death before returning in the middle of a comedy piece being performed by Johnny Carson.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> how to {{identify}} whether a given set is large or small in general. As a result, there are many sets which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> to <b>be</b> either large or small.|$|R

50|$|Roe v Minister of Health 1954 When {{the danger}} of an act <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> (e.g. working with Asbestos prior to knowing it was dangerous) or the {{precautions}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> and it <b>is</b> reasonable <b>not</b> to <b>know</b> about them, no duty can exist to provide such precaution.|$|R
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> at {{the time}} which {{submarine}} had sunk Irish Oak, only {{that it was not}} U-650. Irish Shipping Limited was negotiating a lease of the SS Wolverine from the United States. The U.S. State Department intervened, asking why Ireland had not protested to Germany for the sinking.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{thatched}} {{houses in}} Little Thetford {{was destroyed by}} fire. Reported in the Cambridge Chronicle 6 November 1930, {{the cause of the}} fire at the c.13th-century six-room building <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known.</b> Fireworks were being discharged {{at the other end of}} the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which were apparently made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, and pouring water on its thatched roof.|$|E
5|$|Tkach did {{not have}} the charismatic {{personality}} of his predecessor. Unlike Armstrong, who kept a strong hold of the reins, Tkach delegated many tasks, including the presentation of the church-supported television broadcast, The World Tomorrow and the authoring of articles and booklets produced by the church. Although Tkach <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> as a theologian, and made no claims as such, eventually he was to have profound impact on the theological foundations of the WCG.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> if Jacob Nielsen and Stig Andersen Hvide {{took part}} in the battle but it is known they were a part of the fleet; but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> if the whole fleet attacked.|$|R
50|$|For general N, the Euclidean Steiner tree {{problem is}} NP-hard, and hence it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> whether an optimal {{solution}} {{can be found}} by using a polynomial-time algorithm. However, there is a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for Euclidean Steiner trees, i.e., a near-optimal solution {{can be found in}} polynomial time. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> whether the Euclidean Steiner tree problem is NP-complete, since membership to the complexity class NP <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> whether nq <b>is</b> {{an integer}} for any {{positive}} integer n and positive non-integer rational q. Particularly, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> whether the positive {{root of the}} equation 4x = 2 is a rational number.|$|R
5|$|Unburnt bone can be tested; it is usual to date {{it using}} collagen, the protein {{fraction}} that remains after washing away the bone's structural material. Hydroxyproline, {{one of the}} constituent amino acids in bone, was {{once thought to be}} a reliable indicator as it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> to occur except in bone, but it has since been detected in groundwater.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} modern period, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> whether light {{travelled}} instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks, Muslim scholars, and classical European scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation {{of the speed of}} light. Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity concluded that the speed of light is constant regardless of one's frame of reference. Since then, scientists have provided increasingly accurate measurements.|$|E
5|$|An archbishopric in Mercia {{would also}} {{reinforce}} the kingdom's independence and free it from ecclesiastical dependence on Canterbury {{in the kingdom}} of Kent, which Offa had recently brought under Mercian control. Jænberht supported the Kentish king Egbert II, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> as a firm supporter of Offa's; an archbishop at Canterbury who was either indifferent or in active opposition to Offa would be an impediment to Offa's ability to establish overlordship of Kent and other areas of England. By elevating another archbishop, Offa would reduce the political power of the archbishops of Canterbury. Elevation of a bishopric to an archbishopric was not unprecedented; in 735 the papacy had elevated another Anglo-Saxon bishopric to an archbishopric, when Ecgbert became the first Archbishop of York.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> whether Sospes <b>was</b> married, or who his spouse {{may have}} been. A Lucius Caesennius Antoninus was suffect consul in 128; it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> if he <b>was</b> Sospes' son or the {{grandson}} of his brother.|$|R

5|$|As {{the summit}} closed on 28 September 1970, hours after escorting the last Arab leader to leave, Nasser {{suffered}} a heart attack. He was immediately transported to his house, where his physicians tended to him. Nasser died several hours later, around 6:00p.m. Heikal, Sadat, and Nasser's wife Tahia were at his deathbed. According to his doctor, al-Sawi Habibi, Nasser's likely {{cause of death was}} arteriosclerosis, varicose veins, and complications from long-standing diabetes. Nasser was a heavy smoker with a family history of heart disease—two of his brothers died in their fifties from the same condition. The state of Nasser's health <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> to the public prior to his death. He had previously suffered heart attacks in 1966 and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Allied landing, Imperial Japanese Army forces in the Admiralties {{consisted}} of the 51st Transport Regiment under Colonel Yoshio Ezaki, who was also the overall garrison commander; 2ndBattalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment; 1stBattalion, 229th Infantry Regiment; and elements of the IJN's 14th Naval Base Force. Allied G-2 had identified the presence of all these units in the Admiralties, though their designation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> in all instances. While the 1stBattalion, 229thInfantry Regiment was a veteran of several campaigns, it was short of equipment and lacked its battalion artillery guns. The 2ndBattalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment was led by reserve officers who had seen action in China, but most of its enlisted men were recalled reservists who had not previously been in battle.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} though the {{chemical}} {{nature of what}} exactly in the blood conferred this protection <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>known.</b> In a few decades to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, precipitin and agglutinin. That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E
