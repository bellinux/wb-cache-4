5|$|Till {{arrived in}} Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955. On August 24, he and cousin Curtis Jones skipped church where his great-uncle Mose Wright was preaching and joined some local boys {{as they went}} to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to buy candy. The {{teenagers}} were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. Carolyn <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> store that day; her sister-in-law was {{in the rear of}} the store watching children. Jones left Till with the other boys while Jones played checkers across the street.|$|E
25|$|The {{killing spree}} began on April 8, 1992 {{with the murder}} of 26-year-old Payless ShoeSource manager Robin Fuldauer in Indianapolis. She <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> store when she was shot, having been murdered {{sometime}} between 1:30 and 2:00p.m.|$|E
25|$|Doug Walters {{went to the}} wicket when Australia's total {{stood at}} 4/192 just before tea and played his shots to such telling effect that, by the time stumps arrived, he had scored 103...He opened the dressing-room door, expecting a flood of {{congratulations}} from his fellow players on the brilliance of his stroke play. His team mates, however, had anticipated Walters' expectations and were hidden in the shower room. Ian Chappell, the Aussie skipper, <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room, hunched over a newspaper crossword. Chappell looked up as Walters entered, well ahead of his fellow batsmen. 'What {{the hell are you}} doing back here? I told you not to get out tonight'...|$|E

25|$|Of {{the twenty}} {{who survived the}} sinking, only one was a female. Anna Boecker was a shy, quiet maid in the {{employment}} of an elderly lady, travelling with her employer to Southampton. In the panic and confusion of the collision she had been unable to save her employer. She joined the terrified crush of passengers lowered into the first lifeboat. When it capsized under the sheer weight of numbers, Anna ended up in the ocean. All the others from her lifeboat clambered back onto the sinking ship. Anna <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treacherous sea until the survivors in the second lifeboat spotted her foundering in the water and pulled her up to safety.|$|E
500|$|Led by league MVP Tittle, {{who passed}} for over 3,000yards and 36 touchdowns, the Giants had an 11–3 record in 1963. They set what remains the NFL's {{record for most}} points in a 14-game season by scoring 448. They {{advanced}} to face the Chicago Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field, New York's defense played well, but Chicago's newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times (including one returned for a score) and injured Tittle {{in the first half}} (though he finished the game). Several Giants players including linebacker Huff pleaded with Sherman to replace the hobbled Tittle, who the players felt was pressing and committing too many turnovers, from playing the second half. Sherman however, had little alternative. [...] "The old man kept saying 'I can do it. I feel a little better'" [...] Sherman recalled. [...] "We had a young quarterback (Glynn Griffing), he had gone to get married a couple of weeks earlier but failed to come back in the days he said he would. We couldn't use him." [...] The Giants defense, led by Hall of Famer Huff, held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat. New York had a chance to take a 14–0 lead in the first quarter but wide receiver Del Shofner dropped a potential touchdown in the end zone, a drop he said in 2010, that he feels would have won the Giants the game. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end zone—ball right into my hands, nobody around me—and I dropped the ball...as good a defense as we had that year, I don't think the Berar would have ever come back from being down 14–0." [...] On the next play, Tittle threw an interception to Chicago linebacker Larry Morris, which he returned to the New York five-yard line. Two plays later, the Bears tied the game.|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday 1 September 1955, Bunton was {{critically}} injured {{when his}} car crashed into three gum trees eleven {{miles north of}} Gawler, South Australia. He <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car, and was treated at the scene for severe head injuries, a punctured lung, a fractured collarbone, fractured ribs and shock. On the Saturday morning he rallied slightly to encourage his son Haydn Jr. in an important match for [...] that day. [...] "Go out and do your best, son." [...] Bunton was declared dead {{on the night of}} Monday 5 September at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. He was buried at North Road Cemetery in Nailsworth, South Australia.|$|E

2500|$|On April 14, 2008, Anthony {{was arrested}} on {{suspicion}} of driving under the influence, after being pulled over on southbound Interstate 25 at 20th Street in Denver for weaving through lanes and not dimming his lights. Police spokesperson Detective Sharon Hahn said Anthony, who <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car, failed a series of sobriety tests. He was ticketed and then released at police headquarters to a [...] "sober responsible party." [...] A court date was set for May 14. The Nuggets suspended Anthony for two games due to the arrest. On June 24, 2008, Anthony pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while ability-impaired. The original sentence of driving while under the influence was dropped, and he was subsequently sentenced to one year of probation, 24 {{hours of community service}} and US$1,000 in court costs and fines.|$|E
2500|$|Piepoli {{continued}} {{to pull the}} Simoni group through the descent from the Agnello {{and the beginning of}} the Iozard climb, absorbing Riblon in the process. Le Boulanger <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front of the race as the ascent of the Iozard began, 3 minutes ahead of Simoni's group. With [...] left in the climb, Piepoli broke away from the group he had been pacing, in a move to see who could match his acceleration. Di Luca and Schleck quickly made the bridge, with Simoni holding their wheels, but Cunego and Garzelli did not react as quickly and had to expend more energy to stay with the leaders. Later, Garzelli was dropped by this group's pace, and lost 2 minutes to them at the finish line. This group caught Le Boulanger [...] before the summit of the Iozard.|$|E
2500|$|By far, the 445th's most tragic {{mission is}} {{the attack on}} Kassel of 27 September 1944. In cloud, the {{navigator}} of the lead bomber miscalculated and the 35 planes left the bomber stream of the 2d Air Division and proceeded to Göttingen some [...] from the primary target. [...] After the bomb run, the group <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skies and was attacked from the rear by an estimated 150 Luftwaffe planes, resulting in the most concentrated air battle in history. The Luftwaffe unit was a Sturmgruppe, a special unit intended to attack bombers by flying in tight formations of up to ten fighters in line abreast. This was intended to break the bomber formation at a single pass. The 361st Fighter Group intervened, preventing complete destruction of the Group. Twenty-nine German and 25 American planes went down in a [...] radius. Only four 445th planes {{made it back to}} the base – two crashing in France, one in Belgium, another at RAF Old Buckenham. [...] Two landed at RAF Manston. Only one of the 35 attacking aircraft was fit to fly next day, but 445th sent 10 planes to the same target, Kassel.|$|E

2500|$|Early in 1827 Fraser was {{appointed}} to accompany Captain (later Admiral Sir) James Stirling on the Swan River expedition of 1827, an expedition to explore the Swan River {{on the west coast}} of Australia, and assess its suitability as a site for a new British settlement. [...] The expedition arrived in the area on board HMS Success on 4 March. After surveying the coastal waters off the Swan, Stirling and Fraser briefly reconnoitred the lower reaches of the River on the 7th. [...] The following day, Stirling led a party of 18 men in two boats, in exploring up the Swan River. With Stirling and Frederick Garling, Fraser climbed Mount Eliza, becoming the first Europeans to do so. [...] At the present-day site of Perth, Stirling named a feature near Heirisson Island Point Fraser in Fraser's honour, and about a mile upstream Fraser discovered a fresh water brook and lagoon that were named Clause's Brook and Clause's Lagoon respectively, in honour of fellow explorer Frederick Clause. [...] The party camped at Clause's Brook, and the following morning three Noongars approached Fraser while he <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> camp, angrily gesturing for him to leave.|$|E
2500|$|Eastwood was not {{initially}} {{pleased with the}} script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach, and said to Leone, [...] "In the first film I <b>was</b> <b>alone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry". As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accepting the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, another Ferrari and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), Eastwood was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the William Morris Agency and Irving Leonard, who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on the actor. Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career and {{he was forced to}} sack her as his business manager via a letter sent by Frank Wells. For some time after, Eastwood's publicity was handled by Jerry Pam of Gutman and Pam. Throughout filming, Eastwood regularly socialized with actor Franco Nero, who was filming Texas, Adios at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Former inmate Leon [...] "Whitey" [...] Thompson, {{who worked}} as a guide at Alcatraz for many years and later visited it {{regularly}} before his death in 2005, believed that Alcatraz Island is haunted and has stated that [...] "he could feel it" [...] while he was incarcerated there. [...] He later believed the prison to be [...] "damned", and often had the sense of being watched by spirits. During his time in the prison, Thompson was friendly with an inmate named Johnny Haus, a big Texan. He last saw him on 25 October 1962 when he left Alcatraz and knew he'd never see Haus again. One day in the 1980s when Thompson <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cellhouse waiting for visitors to arrive for a tour, he claimed to have seen a large dark figure {{at the end of the}} [...] "Michigan Avenue" [...] corridor. [...] He saw the apparition walk around the corner and out of sight. Thompson rushed to the end of the corridor, but nobody was there. He believed the ghost to be that of Haus, by the way he walked and the feeling which the figure gave off. [...] Afterwards, Thompson said [...] "I don't care what anybody says, that was Johnny Haus".|$|E

2500|$|Haider died of {{injuries}} {{from a car}} crash at Lambichl in Köttmannsdorf near Klagenfurt, {{in the state of}} Carinthia, {{in the early hours of}} 11 October 2008. He had been on his way to celebrate his mother's 90th birthday. Police reported that the Volkswagen Phaeton that Haider had been driving came off the road, rolled down an embankment and overturned, causing him [...] "severe head and chest injuries". Haider was on his way from Stadtkraemer, a gay bar in Klagenfurt, where he had been drinking, according to a testimonial from the public prosecutor after his death. He had also allegedly been meeting with [...] a young man after having previously quarreled with Stefan Petzner that same evening. He <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government car and no other vehicles were involved. At the time of the crash, Haider's car was travelling at 142km/h (88mph) or faster, more than twice the legal speed limit of 70km/h (43mph) for that part of the Loiblpass road. An initial investigation uncovered no signs of foul play, and conspiracy theories about the death have been strongly rejected by the Austrian police. Haider's widow denies that her husband was gay, and questions the official account of the accident. Haider's blood alcohol level at the time of the crash was 1.8mg/l, more than three times the legal limit of 0.5mg/l. This fact was noted by both Haider's spokesman and the state prosecutor. The director general of the Carinthian administration declared that in case the Governor had been intoxicated the State would have the right to recourse.|$|E
