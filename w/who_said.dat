Meyer later got to meet the band, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that they were “stoked” to be referenced in a Simpsons episode.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{shared a}} story about Billy Lovelady for No More Silence: An Oral History of the Assassination of President Kennedy (1998). Lovelady had {{contacted}} Altgens {{and asked him to}} deliver a copy of the first photograph along Elm Street. Altgens was met instead by Lovelady's wife, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> her husband would never agree to be interviewed. The couple had moved several times, but they were still being harassed by people who wanted the shirt Lovelady was wearing when Kennedy was shot.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it was an}} open trial, the 500-page {{indictment}} was {{not made}} public. Media representatives petitioned for its release, but it was denied by judge Viriato Manuel Pinheiro de Lima, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> it would affect witnesses' thoughts and testimony. The prosecution charged Ao with having received {{millions of dollars in}} kickbacks for contracts, including those for the dome constructed for the 2005 East Asian Games, the Venetian and the Galaxy StarWorld Hotel, from Ho Meng-fai, Chairman of San Meng Fai Engineering and Construction Company.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} proposal {{would keep the}} existing station open but with many services calling only at a new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away.|$|E
5|$|Another {{lawsuit was}} filed by a South Carolina {{resident}} <b>who</b> <b>said</b> he was accosted by Baron Cohen (as Borat) {{in the bathroom}} {{at a restaurant in}} downtown Columbia, with the actor allegedly making comments regarding the individual's genitals, without signing any legal waiver. The lawsuit also sought to have the footage excluded from any DVD releases and removed from Internet video sites.|$|E
5|$|As {{the series}} wound down, Telefe {{considered}} a theatrical version for the 2013 summer season. It {{would have been}} similar to a 2010 version by the producers of Valientes, but the cast had other commitments. Telefe then asked series creator Sebastian Ortega to make a film. Negotiations were confirmed by producer Pablo Culell, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that although Underground produces television series it can also produce stage plays and films.|$|E

5|$|Chaired {{by former}} TD Anne Colley, this working group {{included}} GLEN, {{the gay rights}} lobby organisation, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> they expected a recommendation for civil marriage. The group facilitated a conference on the topic in May 2006, as input to its reports which was attended by experts from other countries which have introduced civil unions and same-sex marriage. During his speech, McDowell was interrupted {{by members of the}} Ancient Order of Hibernians opposed to the Government plans.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{currently}} {{portrayed as}} an underachiever, Bart was actually very happy and looking forward {{about going to}} school.

The following month, at the first Canadian conference on psychokinesis, {{he was one of}} 21 scientists who tested claims by Matthew Manning, a Cambridgeshire teenager <b>who</b> <b>said</b> he had psychokinetic abilities; Josephson apparently told a reporter that he believed Manning's powers were a new kind of energy. He later withdrew or corrected the statement.|$|E
5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty.|$|E
5|$|Just {{ahead of}} the opening match of the 2016–17 season, Ranieri cautioned against {{excessive}} hope of City retaining the title arguing that the other clubs now understood Leicester's break tactics. His principle objective, as last season, was to avoid relegation. He also warned against overconfidence against relegation favourites – by implication, their next opponents, newly promoted Hull City. His view on Leicester's chances were shared by Gary Lineker, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that N'Golo Kanté, who left the club during the summer to join Chelsea, had been Leicester's most important player and essential to Ranieri's system.|$|E

5|$|Lord Lane, then Lord Chief Justice of England, {{dismissed}} the applications on 13 December 1988, arguing of Raghip {{that the jury}} had had ample opportunity to form its own opinion of him. Amnesty International criticised the decision, pointing to the problems with confessions made {{in the absence of}} a lawyer, and was criticized in turn by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> Amnesty had abandoned its impartiality.|$|E
5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, <b>who</b> <b>said</b> that it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E
