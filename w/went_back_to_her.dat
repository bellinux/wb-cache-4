According to the family's records, Sudirman– named by his uncle– was born on a pon Sunday {{in the month of}} Maulud in the Javanese calendar; the Indonesian {{government}} later established 24 January 1916 as Sudirman's birthday. As Cokrosunaryo was in a better financial situation, he adopted Sudirman and gave him the title Raden, reserved for Javanese nobility; however, Sudirman was not told that Cokrosunaryo was not his birth father until he was eighteen. When Cokrosunaryo retired from his position as chief in late 1916, Sudirman went with the family to Manggisan, Cilacap, where he was raised. In Cilacap Karsid and Siyem had another son, Muhammad Samingan. Karsid died when Sudirman was six, at which time Siyem left the boys with her brother-in-law and <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> village at Parakan Onje, Ajibarang.|$|E

500|$|More than 1,000 viewers {{complained to}} ITV {{and more than}} 2,000 to Ofcom when, in week 5 of the live shows, Cole refused to vote off either act in the bottom two (Cohen and Waissel) and {{was not allowed to}} vote last and force a deadlock. A {{spokesperson}} for The X Factor explained: [...] "A judge can abstain from placing a vote. [...] made it clear that she would not send anyone home and therefore abstained from voting. [...] <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to clarify {{that it was going to}} go to a majority vote if she did that.
