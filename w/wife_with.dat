As he walks into his home, he sees his <b>wife</b> <b>with</b> their son and daughter (fully grown) and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Solomon apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton and Burch, along with the 1853 publication of Northup's slave narrative memoir, Twelve Years a Slave. The memoir describes his role in the abolitionist movement, and the mystery surrounding details of his death and burial. Patsey and Solomon never met again.|$|E
5|$|Atkins {{was arrested}} in November 2011 for {{allegedly}} trying to smother his <b>wife</b> <b>with</b> a pillow, while his 10-year-old son watched. He was released on $2,500 bail three hours after the arrest, and was ordered by the Williamson County, Tennessee court to take an anger assessment which found no need for any further action. The altercation was disputed by Atkins' lawyer, who stated that it was purely verbal. Atkins filed for divorce within 24 hours of the alleged assault. The divorce was settled in late-September 2012.

5|$|Coward's most {{enduring}} {{work from the}} war years was the hugely successful black comedy Blithe Spirit (1941), about a novelist who researches the occult and hires a medium. A séance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second <b>wife.</b> <b>With</b> 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a 1945 film, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in Blithe Spirit, alternating the piece with his comedy Present Laughter and his working-class drama This Happy Breed.|$|E
40|$|Studies to {{evaluate}} the effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS, passive smoking) often use nonsmoking <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> smoking discordant husbands. To see whether there were differences in exposures and behavior patterns among never-smoked <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> never-smoked vs ever-smoked husbands, the life-history profiles of 136 ever-married women with mean age of 59 were analyzed on 97 quantifiable variables. Overall, the results demonstrated that <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> never-smoked husbands had 'healthier' lifestyles than <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> smoking husbands. The former were better off in terms of socio-economic status, more conscientious housewives, ate better diets, and had better indices of family cohesiveness. They also fared better in variables that reflected health status with lower frequencies of the following: miscarriages/abortions, inhaling through the mouth, chronic cough, and chest X-rays. The differences were usually largest when comparing wives of never-smoked vs heavily smoking (> 20 cigarettes/day) husbands. The results indicate some correlates of passive smoking that can act as important confounders when evaluating health risks among families with smoking husbands. passive smoking Chinese lung cancer environmental tobacco smoke heart disease...|$|R

40|$|This is a sociolinguistic {{study on}} the chastisement {{strategies}} used by husbands and <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> higher and lower education levels to their spouses. This research aims to discover the influence of education levels and gender of husbands and wives {{on the use of}} chastisement strategies. This is a descriptive quantitative study and the source is taken from 40 married couples divided into 4 groups: 20 husbands with higher education levels, 20 <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> lower education levels, 20 husbands with lower education levels, and 20 <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> higher education levels. The instrument used is a role-play situation, in which husbands and wives are put in a situation where they must chastise their spouses. In order to get good results, the interviewers must catch the chastisement responses and evoke the respondents? emotion. By recording, transcribing, classifying, tabulating, calculating, and then analyzing each of the chastisement utterances, the tendency of each person in expressing chastisements is discovered. This research finds the fact that husbands/wives with higher education levels chastise more direct than their lower education levels counterparts may imply education levels though not significant, but an important factor in affecting the use of chastisement strategies. This research also finds the fact that although husbands have higher or lower education levels than their wives, they chastise more direct than their counterparts may mean gender is an important factor. Furthermore, there is fact that <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> higher and lower education levels have similarity that they both tend to use indirect chastisement strategies than their husbands may imply that gender still an important factor in affecting the use of chastisement. In the findings, criticism (direct) is the mostly used chastisement strategy especially for husbands and <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> higher education levels and husbands with lower education levels while <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> lower education levels tend to use giving reason/ explanation (indirect) ...|$|R

For this success, he was rewarded by Michael VIII with the whole island as a fief, and a noble Greek <b>wife</b> <b>with</b> a rich dowry. In turn, Licario pledged to provide 200 knights to the Emperor.

Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the more striking in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides. Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E

40|$|From {{epidemiologic}} {{studies in}} several countries, passive smoking {{has been associated}} with increased risk for lung cancer, respiratory diseases, and coronary heart disease. Since the relative risks derived from those studies are weak, i. e. relative risk less than two, we investigated whether poorer diets and less healthy lifestyles might act as confounders and be correlated with having a smoking husband on a cross-cultural basis. Characteristics of never-smoked <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> or without smoking husbands were compared between 530 women from Hong Kong, 13, 047 from Japan, 87 from Sweden, and 144 from the U. S. In all four sites, <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> smoking husbands generally ate less healthy diets. They had a tendency to eat more fried food but less fruit than <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> nonsmoking husbands. Other healthy traits, e. g. avoiding obesity, dietary cholesterol and alcohol, or taking vitamins and participating in preventive screening were also less prevalent among <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> smoking husbands. These patterns suggest that never-smoked <b>wives</b> <b>with</b> smoking husbands tend to share the same less healthy dietary traits characteristic of smokers, and to have dietary habits associated with increased risk for lung cancer and heart disease in their societies. These results emphasize the need {{to take into account the}} potential confounding effects of diet and lifestyle in studies evaluating the health effects of passive smoking, especially since it is known that the current prevalence rates of smoking among men is indirectly associated with social class and education in affluent urban societies. passive smoking diet lifestyle Chinese Japan Sweden USA lung cancer heart disease...|$|R
