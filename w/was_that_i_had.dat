25|$|Such {{moments in}} life are just as memorable as when one is {{appointed}} to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> finished my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very precious to me.|$|E
500|$|To all the praise, Youngblood responded, [...] "I don't {{consider}} myself tough, I {{consider myself}} a nut {{for some of the}} things I did". Youngblood concluded, [...] "I wasn’t the biggest guy, I certainly wasn’t the strongest and I wasn’t the fastest either. [...] But I think one of my biggest assets <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an undeniable determination to be the best that has ever {{put his hand on the}} ground, I had a genuine desire to be great." ...|$|E
500|$|A small copy of {{the ring}} was made for Victoria, who wrote in a letter, [...] "The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put the ring on the wrong finger, and the {{consequence}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the greatest difficulty {{to take it off}} again, which I at last did with great pain". In fact, the ring had been sized to fit the queen's little finger instead of her ring finger due to a misunderstanding by the jewellers. It was left to the Crown upon her death in 1901 and is on display at the Tower of London.|$|E

500|$|... "Listen to the Rain on the Roof" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Marc Cherry and series writer Jeff Greenstein and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to keep going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned you have to go back to square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged. He added: [...] "And I'm going to work much harder to criss-cross all the women's stories so that their lives bump up against each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Larrys {{sales were}} very poor at first, with only 4,000 copies sold upon its release. Some resellers refused {{to handle the}} game, while others refused to {{advertise}} it, and one refused to list the game on its list of best sellers. A Sierra employee quit and a potential employee refused to work on Larry. Lowe stated, [...] "My initial reaction <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> wasted six months of my life." [...] Word-of-mouth spread quickly, however, and by the year's end, the game became a commercial success, selling over 250,000 copies. It sold over 300,000 units in total. According to Sierra's marketing director John Williams, [...] "Obviously lots of retailers were selling lots of Leisure Suit Larry, but {{no one wanted to}} admit it". It also became widely pirated, including in the Soviet Union. According to Lowe, a film adaptation was considered and he was flown to Hollywood to demonstrate the game in person. Footage from the game was used in the 1990 music video for Sailor's song [...] "The Secretary". Sierra received what Williams described as a [...] "deluge" [...] of mail opposing its release of Larry after he wrote a series of articles for Computer Gaming World discussing his company and the industry's views on adult software. However, a significant number of the game's players were women. Leisure Suit Larrys success resulted {{in a long line of}} sequels and spin-off titles.|$|E
2500|$|San Diego Republican mayor Jerry Sanders testified how he transitioned from {{believing that}} {{domestic}} partnership was an ideal compromise to believing that same-sex marriage was fundamental. [...] "What hit me <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been prejudiced", he explained. During cross-examination, {{he agreed with}} the defendants that not all {{people who voted for}} Proposition 8 were [...] "bigots", but that he believed their vote was [...] "grounded in prejudice".|$|E

2500|$|Anger has {{finished}} writing Hollywood Babylon III, {{but has not}} yet published it, fearing severe legal repercussions if he did so. Of this he has stated that [...] "The main reason I didn't bring it out <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a whole section on Tom Cruise and the Scientologists. I'm not {{a friend of the}} Scientologists." [...] Despite withholding legal action against the highly critical 2015 film Going Clear, the Church of Scientology was known on earlier occasions to heavily sue those making accusations against them.|$|E
2500|$|... "What {{they had}} against us <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken {{classes at the}} Actors Lab in Hollywood {{where some of the}} {{teachers}} were from the Group Theater and therefore suspect, and we had been members of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, an organization in support of World [...] War II to which almost all of Hollywood's writers belonged. It was ridiculous, but it was very real, and there was nothing we could do about it. We took a larger mortgage on the house and started writing a play, but we didn't work in films for almost two years." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1985, {{there was}} a {{considerable}} amount of conflicts between band members. Lead singer Joey Ramone {{went so far as to}} withdraw from the writing process despite being a vital part of it on previous records. Joey recalled, [...] "I'd had it with the Ramones. 'Mental Hell' is about that. Part of it came from breaking up with [...] Angela. The other part of it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> really had it with the band." [...] In later interviews, however, Joey stated that it was not the conflict that made him stop writing, but rather he had [...] "ideas on the backburner." [...] Bassist Dee Dee Ramone said lead guitarist Johnny Ramone was the reason for much of the stress, supposedly not wanting to do songs Joey would write for multiple reasons. Dee Dee related: [...] "Joey will present a great tune and Johnny won't do it because it's this or it's that. 'I'm not going to play minor chords. I'm not going to play lead. I'm not going to come to England.' For God's sake! That's why Joey gotta do his solo album." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{is one of}} the 'catawampus' things. The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> quarrelled with Irene Howard--or she quarrelled with me--or, no, we both quarrelled.|$|R

2500|$|The Brave Story {{film was}} {{nominated}} for [...] "Animation of the Year" [...] at the 2007 Japanese Academy Awards. John Li from MovieXclusive commends the film for its animation, saying [...] "pleasing soft pastel colors and the occasional computer animation is still refreshing and pleasant to look at". Mark Schilling of The Japan Times compares Wataru to Doraemons Nobita. He compares [...] "the [...] "quest for five jewels" [...] motif" [...] to the Dragon Ball series and The Chronicles of Narnia. John Smith from Impuse Gamer commends the film for its [...] "beautiful animation techniques and some great sound sequences". Mania.com's Chris Beveridge commends the Blu-ray Disc version of Brave Story for being [...] "very expansive in its use of the surround channels during some of the action sequences". He also commends the film for its visual quality saying, [...] "on our 50" [...] set at 720p, the only [...] "problems" [...] I could find <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to be six inches (152mm) from the screen {{and looking at the}} pixels {{to see some of the}} shiftiness in the animation in the scenes where dark blues and blacks mix". Mania.com's Dani Moure compares the film's [...] "old-fashioned" [...] character designs to Studio Ghibli's. Anime News Network's Brian Hanson criticises the film as [...] "being one of the worst-looking big-budget anime films of recent memory, the story is a mash of bizarre coincidences held together haphazardly by forced and annoying bouts of exposition, with irritating and one-dimensional characters chirping throughout".|$|E

60|$|Long {{afterwards}} I {{saw more}} clearly {{how well it}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> obeyed my mother's bidding.|$|E
60|$|But one reason, perhaps, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{anticipated}} {{a narrative}} quite different; something agreeing with my previous surmises.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought the}} best thing to say <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{suspected}} as much from the first. Therefore I said so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seen it!" [...] echoed Robin, [...] "how <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never by word or look {{given the}} {{slightest}} indication to any one, {{of the state}} of my feelings." ...|$|R

60|$|Thus did I earn a great {{reputation}} very cheaply, {{for really}} <b>I</b> could not <b>have</b> taken those cattle; also <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>I</b> done {{so they would}} have brought me bad luck.
