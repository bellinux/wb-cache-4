From this usage, in palaeography, a colon is a clause or group of clauses written as a line in a manuscript.In the punctuation system devised by Aristophanes of Byzantium in the 3rd century BC, the end of such a clause was thought to occasion a medium-length breath and was marked by a middot [...] (This was only intermittently used, but eventually revived as the ano teleia, the modern Greek semicolon.)

What does it mean to read around the text (a concept bor- rowed from Italo Calvino) ? This formulation of the question forces us to take seriously the framework of reading and other factors, which tend to be marginalized.

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} how selected texts by J. G. Ballard—Crash (1973), Concrete Island (1974) and High‐Rise 1975) —and Kurt Vonnegut—Player Piano (1952), Slaughterhouse‐Five(1969) and Galápagos (1985) —can {{be considered in}} terms of theoretical stances derived from posthumanism. By analysing representations of the ‘human’ in relation to both the ‘machine’ and the ‘evolutionary human animal’, this thesis illustrates {{the emergence of the}} posthuman subject. In addition, by recognising the intersection between posthumanism and evolutionary theory, a wider project of this thesis involves demonstrating how the use of various theoretical approaches, from the ‘humanities’ and the ‘sciences’, contributes to the formation of a ‘posthumanities’ approach to literature. J. G. Ballard and Kurt Vonnegut consistently present fictional scenarios in which the lines between ‘human’, ‘machine’ and ‘evolutionary animal’ are disrupted and blurred. Depictions assume various triangulations and configurations: from the protagonist Ballard’s auto‐eroticism, to the characters of High‐Rise conflating boundaries between the ‘human’ and the evolutionary animal that is conveyed as a constituent of human identity, as well as between the machinic environment and the human inhabitant. Further,comparable configurations characterise Vonnegut’s texts: Player Piano’s Paul Proteus’ war against the machine is superimposed by human affiliation with the machine, and the castaway characters of Galápagos are stranded by evolutionary forces that displace human authority and control to the uttermost limit. Each of these instances contributes to the effective intervention of posthumanist thinking <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> utilisation of evolutionary concepts derived from contemporaneous publications circulating in the cultural and scientific sphere highlights the usefulness of acknowledging sources from beyond the remit of traditional literary studies’ methodologies <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> <b>texts.</b> <b>The</b> triangulation between literature, posthumanism and evolutionary theory results in a reconfigured methodological approach to fictional texts: the posthumanities...|$|R

40|$|Background: Research {{suggests}} that storybook reading promotes language development {{and that there}} is a relationship between maternal affective responses in relation to infant affect and language development. The purpose of this study is to relate maternal paralinguistic and verbal behaviour during storybook reading to maternal mood state. Method: Mothers (n= 32) reporting depressed mood (as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) were matched on age of baby (mean age = 6 months, mean age = 10 months), sex of baby, educational status of mother and parity with 32 non-depressed mothers. They were video- and audio-taped in their homes while reading a picture-book to their infants. Maternal textual and extra-textual utterances were transcribed and analysed in terms of mean length utterance (MLU), fundamental frequency and pitch modulation. Results: There was an interaction between psychological well being and age group with regard to MLU for text read. Non-depressed mothers had a smaller MLU for younger babies in comparison with older babies, while depressed mothers showed no difference in their MLU. There was a main effect of psychological well being with depressed mothers speaking with a higher mean pitch and more modulations in their pitch, in comparison with non-depressed mothers. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction of the psychological well being of the mother and the mean fundamental frequency used <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> and when speaking to their child during the picture-book session. Conclusions: These differences in maternal speech indicate that mothers who are depressed are less attuned to their infants which might force the infant into self-regulatory patterns that eventually compromise the child's development...|$|E

40|$|Students {{in history}} classes often hear the phrase “think like an {{historian}} ” {{but most of}} them do not really know what this means. In history classes students receive opportunities to work with primary source documents, much like the way historians would, but many students do not use the critical reading skills necessary to enhance their learning of the content. These critical reading skills used by historians, called heuristics, help them to determine contradictions and patterns in the documents they read (Nokes, Dole, & Hacker, 2007). One heuristics skill in particular, sourcing, helps historians to analyze and evaluate the source of the document. Shanahan and Shanahan (2008) have studied the way professionals in the field read text and have found that historians, specifically, focus on the author or source <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> The purpose for this is because the try to “figure out what story a particular author wanted to tell”; as they read they are {{aware of the fact that}} the text is an interpretation of historical events rather than the actual truth (Shanahan and Shanahan, 2008, p. 50).

40|$|Fantasy {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in sexual activities. This article investigates (erotic) fantasy from a literary text perspective according to Song of Songs in the Christian Bible. The Song, according to many commentaries, starts with a reference to sex in Canticle 1 : 2, �Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine�. Although the word sex is not mentioned in the Song, it is referred to and implied a number of times in the deep structure of the text. The fantasies of this most beautiful woman (beauty, a secondary motif in the Song that is complementary to the main theme of love) are part of the rhetoric of the poet (probably a woman) to convince the reader about the enjoyment and beauty of erotic love. These could most likely stimulate erotic fantasies <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> Part of the poet�s rhetoric {{is the way in which}} she describes this most beautiful woman and her most attractive lover using metaphors, allusions, symbols and similes to evoke all sorts of imaginations and fantasies in the mind of the reader to complement the erotic fantasies of the reader. The investigation of the composition and �lived experiences� (spiritualities) of erotic fantasies is approached from the perceptions of how the entanglement of the reader in the text augments fantasies, how the dynamic interaction between the text of Song of Songs and the reader involves the reader in the fantasies and spiritualities of the protagonists and the poet, how the lived experiences of the composed images and erotic fantasies in the text of the Song grip and involve the reader in the text and finally how the use or application of human senses in fantasies can intensify the lived experiences of fantasies. This research points out how God�s love and concern for his creatures are present as revealed in the relationship between two lovers. His love and concern are clearly visible in the enjoyment and pleasure given by God to humans in his creation which the lovers find in each other. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This research challenges the traditional discourse about sexuality for an enrichment of it. In the article the disciplines of theology, physiology, psychology and spirituality unite to include the entire person in sexual activities. The potential results would end up in a greater enjoyment of making love. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses the formation, {{function and}} portrayal {{of language and}} the subject in the narrative cycle The Thirtieth Year (Das dreißigste Jahr) by the Austrian writer Ingeborg Bachmann (1926 - 1973), {{in light of the}} theories brought forward by the poststructural movement. The traditional outlook on the subject is one that regards it as being autonomous. This autonomy is challenged by the narrative cycle: the analysis shows, how subjects are constructed by a web of interconnecting discourses. In fact, the very qualities from which the subject forms its identity are conferred by the other, which forbids any notion of reflecting on the subject in an autonomous manner. The narratives demonstrate, how the subject will always find itself in an indefinite process of becoming, a process which solicits a different approach, i. e. a change of consciousness for its acknowledgement - one which offers the subject a space to probe its own becoming. Subsequently, this different method of acknowledgement is also confined to the given order. The re-imagining, which the different subjects perform throughout the narrative cycle, show, that Bachmann's subjects are neither fully predestined, nor are they fully autonomous. Although agency is outlined by the given order, the subject is still able to re-evaluate its agency in previously unmediated ways. This shows that ways of existing are not as unalterable as suggested by the given structures. By re -assessing all approaches of autonomous agency, this narrative cycle sensitises the reader to structures that form the subject, and possible ways in which it is thereby oppressed. The narratives expose the mechanisms that form socially recognisable subjects and, more importantly, give voice to those subjects, who find themselves {{on the periphery of the}} normative majority. To do so, the dissertation employs theories, which have been categorised as 'poststructural. ' These theories lend themselves well to disclosing the repressive character of governing norms and to problematize attempts to universalise certain paradigms. For instance, the assumption that language constitutes identity of the subject, amongst other factors, is re-evaluated in the sense that language and discourse, in fact, restrict and limit the subject in its quest for identity. Bachmann's later works (i. e. Malina (1971), Simultan (1970), Der Fall Franza (1978)) have been the subject of poststructural scrutiny, especially from a feminist perspective. The narrative cycle The Thirtieth Year, however, has received little attention by theorists employing poststructural means of analysis. The dissertation therefore sets out to show that valuable insights can be gained <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> from a poststructural perspective...|$|E

40|$|The last 100 {{years have}} seen biblical studies {{practically}} dominated by diachronic/historical methodologies, Amos studies have {{a long tradition of}} being read within a diachronic framework. The result of this has been an unfortunate fragmentation of the text. Within the last 40 years or so there has been a resurgence of literary studies that treat the text wholistically. Nevertheless, in research that has been done in literary studies a divergence with regard to the structure of the book as well as the function and meaning of some of its units still exists. For this reason it is necessary to approach the problem from a fresh perspective. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the literary unity of Amos 3 - 6. In my work I show not only the legitimacy, but also the superiority of a synchronic reading of Amos 3 - 6 <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> as a whole. The book of Amos enjoys perhaps the most scholarly interest among all of the twelve prophets, which has resulted in a large body of secondary literature. Within the book of Amos, chapters 3 - 6 provide a closed unit which contains the major message of the book. For this reason, these four chapters afford a suitable text to apply my reading as well as a platform on which to dialogue with secondary sources. The methodology used in this thesis is a close reading of the present form of the Masoretic Text. A major part of the work is structural analysis. Through the analysis I was able to identify meaningful units that I used for my reading of the text. In this reading I looked at keywords and semantic fields, themes, repetition, parallelism, imagery, speakers and addressees, rhetorical techniques and the overall flow of the text. In my study I have shown how Amos 3 - 6 should be divided into three independent yet closely related units: Amos 3 : 1 - 15; 4 : 1 - 13 and 5 : 1 - 6 : 14. Recognition of the structure and craftsmanship of the text draws out the singular message of Amos 3 - 6; that Israel could no longer avoid Yahweh’s judgment for their oppression of the poor. Even if my main conclusion is similar both to scholars who work in diachronic as well as synchronic studies, my conclusion treats the entirety of Amos 3 - 6 and concludes that all units within it are vital to the whole and contribute to this message of judgment. My thesis offers a solution to the fragmentary text resultant from diachronic methods as well as a corrective to synchronic readings that inadequately structure the book, resulting in an unsatisfactory overall picture of the structure and meaning of Amos 3 - 6.

Even though Roman Catholic versions of the Bible are themselves not free of interpolations and glosses, perhaps no translator of the Bible was ever as wanton and unapologetic about his changes to the text as Luther, as recorded in his famous exchange with Emser in 1530.68 In fact, as Luther makes clear in this exchange, the aim of his translation is not to restore a more original reading, but, through introducing the possibility of differing interpretations of the same text, to contest the traditional authority of the church. 69 But Luther was aware that once the possibility of contesting {{the meaning of the}} received text is admitted there is no end to the process, and that is why in the very next line following this line, that is, after the line “for of playing the master and the critic there is nowadays neither measure nor end,” he added: “And let every man be warned against other copies [that is, other than his own].” In other words, he saw that the question of the correct reading ultimately comes to an end only with a decision in favor of one text over another: {{it is a question of}} which text one finally recognizes as authoritative. The introduction of the possibility of different readings of the text, then, does not so much eliminate the question of authority as it serves, rather, to create a fluxing configuration out of which a new authority may arise. 70 In a similar vein, when German Indologists from the nineteenth century onwards contested the normative form of the Bhagavadgītā, they did so not in order to arrive at a more stable, more accurate reading of the text (one clearly does not enhance confidence in a text by casting doubt on its readings) but precisely to create a situation of uncertainty, in which established authorities might be discarded for new ones. By massively destabilizing the transmission of the text (as Luther in his time before them had done with the Bible), Indologists created a different source of intellectual and institutional authority, and thus what they did was political through and through. At the latest when a reader reads the Bhagavadgītā she will collapse the many potential readings of the text to one. 71 Thus, she will not trouble too much whether the reading is hatvārthakāmāṁs tu gurūn ihaiva or na tv arthakāmas tu gurun nihatya. As long as both yield an acceptable sense, she will select one, because she is ultimately interested in using the text for self-reflection and self-transformation, that is to say, in an ethical relation. It is only the Protestant who, thinking he is saved sola fide (by faith alone), can endure in the face of an infinity of readings. But this infinity is a bad infinity. It indicates the apotheosis of subjectivity, but a subjectivity dirempt of all humanity, even in the minimal form of a concern for the self. It is an empty placeholder, even though the academic and critic may pride himself, thinking he is superior to the “naïve” reader, who always makes a choice <b>when</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> Hovering between damnation and faith, the Indologist, like Luther, cannot choose, or, rather, he chooses not to choose, thus keeping faith open as a possibility. Pasquali’s words, “with regard to recensio, philologia profana is still, without knowing it, a tributary of philologia sacra,” 72 thus still hold true, even if perhaps in a sense different from the one the author originally intended.|$|E
5000|$|The {{corresponding}} {{quotation from}} Zhang Hua's text is placed {{to the right}} of each scene. The scroll before us fits into a tradition of didactic imagery established in the Han Dynasty and influenced by the great philosopher Confucius. <b>When</b> you <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> alongside <b>the</b> images, you realise that there's a deep message being communicated here. Confucius had the idea that everyone in society has a proper role and place, and if they follow that, then a very healthy and effective society is ensured. Now that message must have been especially important {{at the time that the}} poem that this scroll is based on was written, and at the time it was painted, because these were times of social chaos. So what the message is, is that the woman, even one with great beauty, must always evince humility, she must always abide by rules, and never forget her position in relationship to her husband and family; and by doing so, she is a positive and active force in promoting social order.

5000|$|Schabowski had {{not been}} on hand <b>when</b> Krenz <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> earlier in <b>the</b> day to several Politbüro members during a {{cigarette}} break at that day's Central Committee plenum, nor had he been there when it was discussed before the full committee. However, he felt comfortable discussing it at the press conference; he later said that all one needed {{to do in order}} to conduct a press conference was be able to speak German and read a text without mistakes. Accordingly, he <b>read</b> <b>the</b> note aloud at the end of the press conference. One of the reporters asked when the regulations would come into effect. Schabowski assumed it would be the same day based on the wording of the note, and replied after a few seconds' pause: [...] "As far as I know — effective immediately, without delay." [...] (Das tritt nach meiner Kenntnis … ist das sofort … unverzüglich.) [...] Accounts differ on who asked that question. Both Riccardo Ehrman, the Berlin correspondent of the ANSA news agency, and German tabloid reporter Peter Brinkmann were sitting on the front row at the press conference, and claimed to have asked when the regulations would come into force. According to author and historian Victor Sebestyen, however, it was NBC's Tom Brokaw who asked the question.|$|R
60|$|WISE. I {{have thought}} so indeed, {{and that for}} this reason. We see that this disease is entailed, as I may say, to this most beastly sin, {{nor is there any}} disease so entailed to any other sin as this to this. That this is the sin to which the strange {{punishment}} is entailed, you will easily perceive <b>when</b> you <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> 'I made a covenant with mine eyes,' said Job, 'why then should I think upon a maid? For what portion of God is there,' for that sin, 'from above, and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?' And then he answers himself: 'Is not destruction to the wicked, and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?' This strange punishment is the pox. Also, I think that this foul disease is that which Solomon intends when he saith, speaking of this unclean and beastly creature, 'A wound and dishonour shall he get, and his reproach shall not be wiped away' (Prov 6:33). A punishment Job calls it; a wound and dishonour Solomon calls it; and they both do set it as a remark upon this sin; Job calling it a 'strange punishment,' and Solomon a 'reproach that shall not be wiped away,' from them that are common in it.|$|R

The results show failures {{in the use of}} appropriatestrategies to solve some activities, which can be attributed to a fragmented <b>reading</b> of <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> to difficulties inidentifying the most important information, to a lack of coherence in the answers given in the activities and todifficulties to relate the ideas of <b>the</b> <b>text</b> with their prior knowledge. We also notice a lack of explanation of thestudents´ comprehension difficulties in the questions they asked. The analysis has allowed us to propose some actionsthat could reverse these problems...|$|R
