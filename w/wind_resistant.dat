5000|$|The first field {{jacket was}} based on a {{civilian}} jacket suggested by Major General James K. Parsons, for whom it was unofficially named. Unlike the service coat, the material for the jacket was more <b>wind</b> and water <b>resistant.</b> A further reason for adopting a field jacket made of a different material was that shortages of wool were expected. [...] The jacket could be worn with both winter (OD wool) and summer (khaki chino) uniforms as well as fatigue uniforms. The Olive Drab Cotton Field Jacket was standardized and adopted in June 1940 for use by all members of the US Army for wear with both the winter and summer service uniforms.

50|$|Melton cloth is {{traditionally}} made of wool and is woven in a twill form. It is thick, due to having been well fulled, which {{gives it a}} felt-like smooth surface. It is napped and very closely sheared. Meltons are similar to Mackinaw cloth. It is a very solid cloth in which the twill weave pattern is completely concealed due to the finishing processes. Because of its dense, quasi-felted texture it frays minimally or not at all. It is hard wearing and <b>wind</b> and weather <b>resistant.</b> Its main use is for heavy outer garments and coats and for blankets. In lighter weights melton cloth {{is traditionally}} used for lining the underside of jacket collars. It {{was developed in the}} Leicestershire town of Melton Mowbray, from which it derives its name. This town is the traditional centre of English fox-hunting, and black and scarlet hunting coats are traditionally made from melton cloth, due to its weatherproof qualities. In England not only is melton used for the scarlet hunting coat, an iconic symbol of the upper-class elite, but it is also used in black for the donkey jacket, an iconic symbol of the working class labouring man. Both uses rely on its weatherproof qualities.|$|R
40|$|Standard fog {{collectors}} {{can be a}} {{great help}} to provide drinking water in isolated areas or those with a low infrastructure. This is proved by the success of several projects, conducted in different countries around the world. Different factors influence the efficiency of fog harvesting. To reach a high yield of collected fog water first suitable locations that show a lot of fog accumulation need to be found. As important as the location is the reliability of the collectors that will be used. They have to be adjustable to the <b>wind</b> direction and <b>resistant</b> against strong <b>winds.</b> They need to be in a good condition and their meshes should be tensed well. The existing systems used for fog harvesting have some weak points. These points have to do with their construction, materials and organizational matters and can lead to a soon ending of a relief project. Fog collectors of the type “DropNet ” could be an alternative. The aim of the concept is to create a lightweight construction that is in first place resistant against very strong winds and that provides the mesh with the required tension. Other important subjects are the transportation of the devices, the set-up and the dealing with different local conditions, like landscape and soil properties. Another important subject is the integration of fog collectors in the environment and the increase of acceptance in the population considering design factors...|$|R

50|$|In {{favourable}} conditions, notably a moist, well-drained soil, {{the tree}} can {{grow at a}} rate of almost one metre per year. Trials by the Northern Arizona University http://www.for.nau.edu/cms/content/view/512/706/ found that it is not very tolerant of a hot, arid environment although its leaves sustain comparatively little scorch damage. In trials in southern England conducted by Butterfly Conservation, the tree was found to be intolerant of ponding overwinter. 'Sapporo Autumn Gold' was first introduced to the UK by technology company Pitney Bowes as part of its 'Elms Across Europe' campaign. The company supplied the cultivar to schools, parks and gardens throughout the UK and Europe. The tree remains popular in continental Europe but does not assimilate well in the countryside. In trials in France by Cemagref at Nogent-sur-Vernisson, Loiret, it was found to grow too vigorously in hedgerow conditions, eclipsing neighbouring shrubs and consequently creating gaps.

50|$|Rather than {{a single}} herb, Imphepho is a number of herbs (around 250 species) from the Helichrysum genus. The Helichrysum species used as Imphepho grow abundantly in South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho but {{especially}} around coastal areas apart from the largely arid Northern Cape province. The plants grow abundantly in gardens and in the wild, for this reason most Imphepho is wild harvested and commercial cultivation in South Africa is unknown. Helichrysum species used as Imphepho are hardy and adaptable, they can grow {{in a wide variety}} of soil types, are drought resistant, <b>wind</b> <b>resistant</b> and can survive light frost. The seeds are wind dispersed. Little preference is shown for specific types of Imphepho, amongst traditional healers, local availability seems more important than a preference for a particular species. There is little evidence for medicinal properties being stronger in certain Helichrysum species and for ritual purposes they are all treated as exactly the same.For medicinal and ritual purposes, mainly the fresh, or more often dried, areal parts of the plant are used, less commonly the roots.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, Lee began {{constructing}} the home, {{which was a}} white-painted concrete structure. He purchased a barge to transport supplies for the building. The house consisted of six stout, interconnected dome structures, which made up the rooms of the house, and some of which had two levels. It was 2,400 square feet and featured three bedrooms and three bathrooms. Lee's daughter Jane Maples recalled the construction:“Building it was the fun part for my dad, but he also loved the seclusion of living on the island; fishing, shelling and watching the weather. He loved inventing things. He invented a heat source for under the floors of our house and had an invention that would bring logs in and drop them on the fireplace that came through the wall of our den. Kids loved him. He was just fun to be around; a really adventurous guy way before his time."She also recalled to Florida Weekly:“My dad thought the corners of rooms were wasted space as were {{the corners of the}} ceiling. He thought the dome ceiling gave the feeling of openness. He was right. The rooms felt very large and open.”Before erecting the Cape Romano structure, he built a full-scale model on land he owned in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The Tennessee dome house is still standing. Lee was known for engaging in his own projects, and designed the house to run on solar power and be self-sustaining. The concrete walls were made out of sand from the island. Gutters were installed which drained rainwater into a large tank, which purified the water, and then pumped it into all the home's sinks, baths and showers, and water-consuming appliances. The house's domes themselves were not only aesthetic but practical as well, their sturdy concrete walls and rounded tops providing superior hurricane protection. The house was completed in 1982, and was valued at 1.5 million. The floors were tile and carpet, the walls painted white, and the rooms had large windows on all sides. Mike Morgan, Bob Lee's grandson, said about the house's sustainability:“My grandfather designed it so that when the rain would hit the domes, all the rainwater and the morning dew would wash down into a gutter system that he built around the domes. That would all lead into a 23,000 gallon cistern under the center dome. The water would run through filters and that’s what we would use for showers and dishwashing; things like that. The house was totally self-sustaining. He had several solar panels for power along with backup generators if it was cloudy for several days. The Solar systems were installed by Dell Jones, a solar contractor in Ft. Myers. The Amcor Solon 120 liter thermosyphon solar water heater provided the hot water, the photovoltaic system was a hybrid system with a gasoline generator, a large 24 volt lead acid battery with hydro caps (catalytic converters) and Arco solar modules. The refrigerator was a SunFrost high efficiency refrigerator run by the 24 volt battery bank. The inverter was a combination of the older Vanner and a new Trace Engineering inverter installed by Dell. In addition upgrading the appliance loads Dell installed the new lighting, at the time was state of the art compact fluorescent lamps.” The home was originally built as a vacation house for Bob Lee his wife, Margaret and their children, including a daughter, Jane. Jane Maples, née Lee, told Coastal Breeze News about the local attention and controversy the house attracted during its early years. “I can remember one time, we went to the drug store on Marco and some people in the row behind me were saying, ‘Have you been by those dome houses?’ And the other one said, ‘Yeah, but I hear they guard that with machine guns!’ Somehow it got a reputation of being a scary place.”Two years after its completion, in 1984, the Lee sold the house to another family. After that family's financial situation declined, the Lees repossessed the home in 1987, after which point it became the family's primary residence. Bob and Margaret Lee lived there, Jane, their adult daughter, her daughter, and Mike Morgan, their grandson, lived their during the early 1990s. Jane remembered those years:“My daughter turned one while we were living there. then, it was totally different. There were two other homes; one on stilts and a pyramid-shaped house. They had horses, dogs and turkeys. How they got a horse out there, I’ll never know!”They renovated the interior, and stayed there until 1992. That year was marked by Hurricane Andrew, which left barely a scratch on the sturdy home's walls and foundations, but utterly destroyed the interior. Mike Morgan, the grandson, noted:“Andrew didn’t do a ton of damage, really. The main structure’s design is very high <b>wind</b> <b>resistant</b> because there’s no sharp edges or flat surfaces for the wind to catch on. That was another thought process that my grandfather had when he built them. But the windows, obviously were not, so that was the main damage.”Before the storm, there were three homes on Caxambas Island, including the Lee residence. The other two, one, a house on stilts, and the other, a pyramid house, fared worse in the hurricane. Neither are still standing, although the hurricane was not the final blow. The Lee family abandoned the home in 1992 as it was no longer habitable.|$|E
