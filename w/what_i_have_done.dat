But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> already.|$|E
500|$|In December 2014, {{the two-year}} {{anniversary of the}} attack, {{referring}} {{to a woman who}} was raped in an Uber cab, the parents remarked to the press that not much had changed: [...] "Nothing in India has changed since December 16, 2012. All promises and statements made by our leaders and ministers {{have turned out to be}} shallow. Our suffering gives them their moment in limelight. My daughter asks me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> to get her justice. She asks what am I doing so that many more like her get justice and I wake up to realise how helpless and trivial I am..." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} two months, Christian and his forces {{struggled}} to establish themselves on Tubuai. They began to construct a large moated enclosure—called [...] "Fort George", after the British king—to provide a secure fortress against attack by land or sea. Christian attempted to form friendly relations with the local chiefs, but his party was unwelcome. There were persistent clashes with the native population, mainly over property and women, culminating in a pitched battle in which 66 islanders were killed and many wounded. Discontent was rising among the Bounty party, and Christian sensed that his authority was slipping. He called a meeting to discuss future plans and offered a free vote. Eight remained loyal to Christian, the hard core of the active mutineers, but sixteen wished to return to Tahiti and take their chances there. Christian accepted this decision; after depositing the majority at Tahiti, he would [...] "run before the wind, and... land upon the first island the ship drives. After <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> I cannot remain at Tahiti".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Blair {{expressed}} {{frustration that}} Carmella {{had become a}} [...] "very tortured, depressive character {{and there was no}} {{light at the end of}} the tunnel." [...] She described the role, which went through enormous transformations, as being one that had pushed her acting abilities. Blair's pleas to the show producers to let the down-on-luck Carmella be up-beat again were rejected. In June 2008, the actress confirmed her plans to leave the series when her contract expired. Speaking of her decision to leave, Blair said: [...] "I made the decision in December [...] I am eager to try new things and go to a place where people have no idea <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> I want to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't as a performer." [...] Producers confirmed they did not intend to kill her character off, as they hoped for her to return again in the future. A spokesperson for the programme's broadcaster, Network Ten, stated: [...] "Obviously, we've loved having Natalie on the show all these years and we're really sad to see her go [...] and hope to see her on Ramsay Street again one day in the future." [...] Blair later admitted she was surprised at her rise popularity whilst playing Carmella.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Armstrong agonised over his decision to go into armament production. He once said: [...] "If I thought that war would be fomented, or the interests of humanity suffer, by <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> I would greatly regret it. I have no such apprehension." [...] He also said: [...] "It is our province, as engineers to make the forces of matter obedient to the will of man; those who use the means we supply must be responsible for their legitimate application." ...|$|E

He said, [...] "I find it a little dispiriting, after a whole career's worth of work dedicated to improving care for people {{at the end of}} life, that now I'm 'advocating euthanasia panels.'" [...] Emanuel spent his career opposing euthanasia and received multiple awards for his efforts to improve end of life care. Emanuel said, [...] "It is incredible how much one's reputation can be besmirched and taken out of context" [...] and [...] "No one who has read <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for 25 years would come to the conclusions that have been put out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, Grey {{participated in}} the Guest Reading Program at Emerson Elementary School in Compton, California. Reportedly, her {{involvement}} in such activity was first denied to the media by school officials. Parents were upset that a former pornographic actress would read to their children {{as part of an}} education program. She responded to the controversy by stating, [...] "I believe education is a universal right. I committed to this program with the understanding that people would have their own opinions about <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> who I am, and what I represent." [...] Grey also appeared on the American talk show The View, where she explained that she thought the parents should have been given prior notice of the identity of anyone who did guest reading, and that if parents had objected to her, she would not have done it.|$|E
