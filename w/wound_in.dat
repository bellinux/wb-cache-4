5|$|In {{some parts}} of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, {{especially}} army ants, are used as surgical sutures. The wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes the edges of the <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound. The large heads of the dinergates (soldiers) of the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes are also used by native surgeons in closing wounds.|$|E

On July 7, 1917, Innis received a serious shrapnel <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in England.|$|E
5|$|Jacob is {{approached}} by a distressed Michael Newman, the man who treated his <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> a medevac helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Paul’s burning car. Newman tells a story of having been a chemist with the Army’s chemical warfare division in Saigon. He designed “the Ladder”, a drug that massively increased aggression, taking people straight to their most primal urges. To test its effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob’s unit – causing them to turn on {{each other in a}} homicidal frenzy. The revelation causes Jacob to fully remember the moment he was attacked in Vietnam, where it is revealed that a fellow American soldier bayoneted him.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{the priest}} tells Chen {{to visit a}} lunatic beggar at the marketplace, should she wish to revive her husband. The madman treats her with disrespect by {{continuously}} demeaning her, but she takes it in her stride and patiently pleads with him for help. Finally, he coughs out some phlegm and makes her swallow it. The beggar makes his leave and Chen is left feeling deeply ashamed. Back home, during funeral preparations, the phlegm hardens gradually and rises from Chen's stomach to her throat. Ultimately she disgorges a throbbing heart, which she places into the gaping <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> Wang's chest; slowly, his life is restored.|$|E

5|$|After a {{month with}} his new wife, Sing {{returned}} to the trenches in France in August 1917, but was in very poor health due to his battle wounds {{and the effects of}} gas poisoning. It is not clear whether he operated as a sniper on the Western Front, but in September 1917, he led a unit in the Battle of Polygon Wood in counter-sniper operations. For this action, he was awarded the Oorlogskruis (Belgian Croix de Guerre) in 1918, and was also recommended for the Military Medal—but never received it. In November 1917, he was confined to hospital again due to problems with his previously wounded leg. In mid-February 1918, he was hospitalised due to a gunshot <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> the back. Sing suffered lung disease from his exposure to gas, and it soon brought his military career to an end.|$|E
5|$|Between March and June 1944 Raithel {{commanded}} his regiment during {{several major}} operations, including {{what may have}} been the largest anti-Partisan sweep of the war, Operation Maibaum (Maypole). He was promoted to SS-Standartenführer (colonel) on 1 April 1944. Raithel led his regiment well, resulting in a serious <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> June 1944. On 11 June 1944, he was recommended for an award of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross citing his leadership and courage while commanding the regiment, but it was not approved. While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia between March and August 1944, the 13th SS Division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb civilians in the security zone.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{was born}} in England but was sent to Hanover in his {{adolescence}} for his education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces near Tournai against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial <b>wound.</b> <b>In</b> 1799, he was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale. Although his marriage in 1815 to the twice-widowed Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz met with the disapproval of his mother, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, it proved a happy one. By 1817, King George III had only one legitimate grandchild, Princess Charlotte of Wales, and when she died in childbirth, Ernest was the senior son to be both married and not estranged from his wife. This gave him some prospect of succeeding to the British throne. However, both of his unmarried older brothers quickly married, and King George's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, fathered the eventual British monarch, Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Gellibrand was {{disappointed}} at not being appointed AA & QMG, but Bridges was unimpressed with Gellibrand's staff work. He felt that Gellibrand had mishandled the move of the 2nd Infantry Brigade to Cape Helles, where it {{participated in the}} First Battle of Krithia. He also expected Gellibrand to organise a proper officers' mess at Gallipoli and was annoyed at the poor quality of what Gellibrand had scrounged from ships' canteen supplies. Gellibrand might have even been dismissed by Bridges but fate intervened. On 1 May Gellibrand {{was wounded in the}} ankle by shrapnel. Then, on 11 May, while laughing at two men whose water bottles had been holed, he received a severe <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> his right shoulder and was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS Gascon. While it was still anchored off Anzac Cove, Bridges was wounded on 15 May and brought on board the same ship (and to the same bed, Gellibrand was moved out of the way), where Bridges died on 18 May 1915.|$|E
5|$|He {{believed}} {{that he and his}} men had secured Dai Do and wasn't expecting a sudden massive counterattack by the NVA. Company G took cover in the village cemetery and the fight raged through the night. The next morning, the bodies of more than three hundred enemy soldiers lay near their positions. Vargas's battalion commander arrived on the scene and ordered a renewed assault on the village. He carried to safety a Marine whose arm had been severed, and when the soldier pleaded for his arm, Vargas went back and found it. When the battalion commander, fighting like any other rifleman, was shot in the back three times, Vargas dragged him a hundred yards to an evacuation point, firing at the enemy as he went with an AK-47 he had picked up on the battlefield. By {{the end of the third}} day of battle, the North Vietnamese retreated and Vargas finally allowed himself to be treated for a bullet <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> his side and shrapnel from mortar blasts.|$|E
5|$|In 1672 Churchill {{was posted}} to sea again, and on 28 May {{fought against the}} Dutch navy in the Battle of Solebay (Southwold Bay), on the Suffolk coast. He was {{possibly}} aboard the Duke of York's flagship, the Prince, which was crippled in the action. Shortly thereafter, Churchill was promoted (above the resentful head of his lieutenant) to a captaincy in the Duke of York's Admiralty Regiment. The following year Churchill gained a commendation at the Siege of Maastricht when the young captain distinguished himself {{as part of the}} 30-man forlorn hope, successfully capturing and defending part of the fortress. During this incident Churchill is credited with saving the Duke of Monmouth's life, receiving a slight <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> the process but gaining further praise from a grateful House of Stuart, as well as recognition from the House of Bourbon. King LouisXIV in person commended the deed, from which time forward bore Churchill an enviable reputation for physical courage, as well as earning the high regard of the common soldier.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war he enlisted as {{an officer in the}} 2nd Royal Bavarian Reserve Infantry and was posted to the front line in Flanders, where he suffered a serious <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> October 1914. Hitler served as a Gefreiter in the same regiment and in the summer of 1916, Hess briefly became Hitler's commanding officer. He sustained another serious wound the following October and was sent to Germany to recuperate. Hess was well regarded as a soldier and was decorated several times, receiving the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class as well as the Bavarian Military Order of Merit. In 1918 he was promoted to Lieutenant and in 1934 he was awarded the Honour Cross of the World War 1914/1918.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
5|$|Seydlitz {{rejoined the}} King in 1758 and on 25 August, at the Battle of Zorndorf, Seydlitz's cavalry again secured the victory. He led thirty-six squadrons into {{a mass of}} Russian cavalry mingled with infantry. This charge broke the Russian right wing and sent them running for the woods. At the Prussian debacle at Hochkirch, on 14 October 1758, he covered the Prussian retreat with 108 squadrons, and in the {{disaster}} of Kunersdorf, on 12 August 1759, he received another severe <b>wound</b> <b>in</b> a hopeless attempt to storm a hill held by the Russians; his 8th Cuirassiers {{was one of the}} few intact regiments at the end of the battle. While recuperating in Berlin, he helped organize a defense of the city during the Austro-Russian raid (October 1760). Although he was unable to prevent the Russians from briefly occupying the city, Frederick later praised Seydlitz for his conduct.|$|E
