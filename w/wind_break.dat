60|$|Such a {{hurricane}} Felix {{had never before}} experienced. Its energy was awful. Round the palm-trees the wind played a frantic and capricious devil's dance. It pirouetted about the atoll in the mad glee of unconsciousness. Here and there it cleared lanes, hundreds of yards in length, among the forest-trees and the cocoanut plantations. The noise of snapping and falling trunks rang thick on the air. At times the cyclone would swoop down from above upon the swaying stem of some tall and stately palm that bent like grass before the <b>wind,</b> <b>break</b> it off short with a roar at the bottom, and lay it low at once upon the ground, with a crash like thunder. In other places, little playful whirlwinds seemed to descend from the sky in the very midst of the dense brushwood, where they cleared circular patches, strewn thick under foot with trunks and branches in their titanic sport, and yet left unhurt all about the surrounding forest. Then again a special cyclone of gigantic proportions would advance, as it were, in a single column against one stem of a clump, whirl round it spirally like a lightning flash, and, deserting it for another, leave it still standing, but turned and twisted like a screw by the irresistible force of its invisible fingers. The storm-god, said Toko, was dancing with the palm-trees. The sight was awful. Such destructive energy Felix had never even imagined before. No wonder the savages all round beheld in it the personal wrath of some mighty spirit.|$|E

40|$|Stratosphere {{circulation}} {{is important}} to interpret abundances of photo-chemically produced compounds like ozone that we aim to observe to assess habitability of exoplanets. We thus investigate a tidally locked ExoEarth scenario for TRAPPIST- 1 b, TRAPPIST- 1 d, Proxima Centauri b and GJ 667 C f with a simplified 3 D atmosphere model and for different stratospheric <b>wind</b> <b>breaking</b> assumptions. These planets are representatives for different circulation regimes for orbital periods: P_orb= 1 - 100 days. The circulation of exoplanets with P_orb≤ 25 days can be dominated by the standing tropical Rossby wave in the troposphere {{and also in the}} stratosphere: It leads to a strong equatorial eastward wind jet and to 'Anti-Brewer-Dobson'-circulation that confines air masses to the stratospheric equatorial region. Thus, the distribution of photo-chemically produced species and aerosols may be limited to an 'equatorial transport belt'. In contrast, planets with P_orb> 25 days, like GJ 667 C f, exhibit efficient thermally driven circulation in the stratosphere that allows for a day side-wide distribution of air masses. The influence of the standing tropical Rossby waves on tidally locked ExoEarths with P_orb≤ 25 days can, however, be circumvented with deep stratospheric <b>wind</b> <b>breaking</b> alone - allowing for equator-to-pole transport like on Earth. For planets with 3 ≤ P_orb≤ 6 days, the extratropical Rossby wave acts as an additional safe-guard against the tropical Rossby wave in case of shallow <b>wind</b> <b>breaking.</b> Therefore, TRAPPIST- 1 d is less prone to have an equatorial transport belt in the stratosphere than Proxima Centauri b. Even our Earth model shows an equatorial wind jet, if stratosphere <b>wind</b> <b>breaking</b> is inefficient. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

50|$|Kentuck Knob is a one-story {{dwelling}} {{situated on}} Chestnut Ridge, the western-most ridge of Pennsylvania’s Allegheny Mountains. The house {{stands at the}} end of a driveway south of Pennsylvania State Route 2010. The home is recessed into the southern side of Kentuck Knob’s 2050 ft peak with a mountainous 79 acre surrounding it that originally composed a farm. The Hagans, I.N. and Bernardine, planted much of the hilltop property with tree seedlings to provide both privacy and a <b>wind</b> <b>break.</b> The mountain summit offers a sweeping view of the Youghiogheny River gorge as well as surrounding hills and farmland.

50|$|Hart built a Regency styled villa on {{the site}} in 1847.

Hart increased {{the size of the}} farm to 250 acres by purchasing the adjacent properties (66 acres: Koheranui No. 2 in 1846); he raised cattle for beef and dairy purposes as well as cultivating wheat and barley. As well as <b>wind</b> <b>break</b> trees, orchards and other agricultural plantings, Hart planted a number of exotic specimen trees {{on the site}} including what is now the largest hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) in New Zealand, and several Morton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla), including the largest example in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|The Stevenston Canal of 1772 was {{the first}} {{commercial}} canal in Scotland. The canal was just over two miles long, had no locks, was twelve feet wide and had a depth of four feet, with much of its cut following the old course of the River Garnock, {{a relic of the}} days when Ardeer was an island. The Master Gott or drain is thought to be the last remaining vestige. Coal was carried on barges and the waste was dumped along the route to act as a <b>wind</b> <b>break,</b> blown sand being a recurring problem. The water supply came from a dam on the Stevenston Burn. The Ardeer Quarry that produced Stevenston Stone exported to Ireland from Saltcoats Harbour almost certainly used the canal for transporting its stone output.|$|E
50|$|Wind speeds {{are often}} lower in cities than the {{countryside}} because the buildings act as barriers (<b>wind</b> <b>breaks).</b> On the other hand, long streets with tall buildings {{can act as}} wind tunnels - winds funnelled down the street - and can be gusty as winds are channelled round buildings (eddying).|$|R
40|$|This paper explores how {{conceptions of}} safety in visions and {{strategies}} for public space {{in the city of}} Gothenburg result in measures aimed at reducing the visibility of certain behaviors that causes feelings of insecurity in parts of the population. In Gothenburg one such measure has been to build <b>wind</b> <b>breaks</b> intended for alcohol and drug users placed in the city’s marginal spaces. In this article I have focused on two cases where this particular measure has been carried out, namely the city districts Angered and Frölunda. By analyzing public documents and narratives of public officials through the orienting concepts of ordered-/appropriated space, inclusion/exclusion and borders I have identified three diagnostic frames that are being used in descriptions of problems associated with the visibility of drug and alcohol abuse in public spaces {{as well as in the}} process of formulating measures to solve these problems. These frames concern the appropriation of public space, threatful behavior and a wish to cherish the children and are to a varying extent represented in the decision processes that resulted in the <b>wind</b> <b>breaks</b> being built in Angered and Frölunda. The <b>wind</b> <b>breaks</b> are indicators of the apparent gap between vision and practice regarding the openness of public space, and also symbolizes the exclusion of marginalized parts of the population in the negotiations regarding the appropriate use of public space...|$|R
