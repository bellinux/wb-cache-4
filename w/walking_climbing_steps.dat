40|$|FUNCTIONAL LIMITATION IS AN IN-termediate {{state on}} a trajectoryfrom health to {{physical}} disabil-ity. 1 Mobility limitation (ie, dif-ficulty <b>walking</b> and <b>climbing</b> <b>steps)</b> {{is of particular}} interest because it is com-mon, is strongly related to major health outcomes, and may represent a stage in the disablement process amenable to in-tervention. Approximately 34 % of the US population 70 years and older re-port walking limitations, ie, difficulty walking a quarter mile (0. 4 km). Those reporting such difficulty are at nearly 4 times the risk of nursing home place-ment and 3 times the risk of death over 2 years compared with those report-ing no difficulty. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{supplemental}} {{symptom of}} the head bobbing is a presence of ataxia. Several patients were reported as having difficulty <b>walking,</b> running, and <b>climbing</b> <b>steps</b> because of the bobbing. It {{is likely that the}} constant bobbing has interrupted the patient’s ability to balance which requires input from several sources including the vestibular, ocular, somatosensory, and motor systems. Although the nature of these movements is physical, their source is neurological, generally stemming from a dysfunction of parts of the nervous system which control motor function.|$|R
30|$|As censuses {{traditionally}} {{collect data}} on a large variety of topics, they are ill-suited for in-depth observation. Therefore, the censuses which {{have in the past}} collected data on health (such as the UK, Belgium, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) restrict the questions on health to a very small number, mainly focused on disability. For example, the Belgian 2001 census contained seven questions, one on subjective health, three on disability due to chronic disease and three on informal care for the disabled. On a worldwide basis, an effort has been made since 2001 to collect internationally comparable disability data through the UN’s Washington Group on Disability Statistics. The latter has made recommendations for a shortlist of questions to be included in censuses or surveys in order to measure disability consistently worldwide (Mitra 2013). The shortlist includes six questions—five on functional limitations (limitations in seeing, hearing, <b>walking</b> or <b>climbing</b> <b>steps,</b> concentrating, and communicating) and one on self-care (limitation in showering or dressing).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{investigations into}} {{the development of a}} versatile scansorial mobile robot and real-time realisation of a control system for different configurations of the robot namely <b>climbing</b> mode, <b>walking</b> mode and steering mode. The mobile robot comprises of a hybrid leg and wheel mechanism with innovative design that enables it to interchange its configuration to perform the specific tasks of pole climbing in <b>climbing</b> mode, <b>walking</b> and <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> in <b>walking</b> mode, and skid steering and inclined slope climbing in steering mode. The motivation of this research is due to the surrounding environment which is not always structured for exploration or navigation missions, and thus poses significant difficulty for the robot to manoeuvre and accomplish the intended task. Hence, the development of versatile scansorial robot with a flexible and interchangeable configuration can provide a broad range of applications and locomotion system and to achieve the mission objective successfully. The robot design consists of four arms/legs with wheel attached at each end-effector and has two link manipulation capability. In climbing mode, the arms are configured as grippers to grip the pole and wheels accelerate to ascend or descend. The climbing angle is monitored to retain the level of the robot while <b>climbing.</b> However, in <b>walking</b> mode, the arms are configured as legs and the wheels are disabled. By implementing a periodic walking gait, the robot is capable of performing stable <b>walking</b> and <b>step</b> <b>climbing.</b> In steering mode, the arms are configured as suspension and the wheels are used for manoeuvring. In this mode, the skid steering system is used to enable the robot perform the turn. The versatile scansorial robot’s configurations and locomotion capabilities are assessed experimentally in real time implementation using the physical prototype. The experiments provided demonstrate the versatility of the robot and successfully fulfill the aims and objectives of the research...|$|R
40|$|It is hard {{to imagine}} any {{functional}} routine that does not involve some motor activity. Whether playing a game at home with friends, dining in a restaurant, or stapling newsletters in an office, participation involves numerous motor skills. Although motor skills traditionally have been viewed in relation to the normal motor development of a young child, it is useful to consider the functions that motor skills serve. For example, in the routines we just listed, people use motor skills to travel from one geographic location to another. This may involve <b>walking,</b> <b>climbing</b> the <b>steps</b> of a bus, or driving a car. Once at the home, restaurant, or office, the participants use mobility skills to walk between rooms and between areas within rooms. Then they assume and maintain positions that are functional for the activity. They probably sit to eat, but might sit or stand to staple. The functional positioning for the game depends upon whether they are playing cards, croquet, or Twister. Finally, they participate in the core of the activity, which requires motor skills to visually scan and gaze at materials, to manipulate materials, and to eat. Even performing the simplest of the embedded social and communication skills involves some type of motor kills (e. g., smiling when greeted, pointing to a choice). When we think about the ways we typically perform these functional routines, it seems that participation requires an extensive repertoire of sophisticated motor skills. If we concentrate on the functions that motor skills serve in the activities, however, we can see many more possibilities. We know that the mobility function of walking can b...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies in western {{countries}} have shown that respiratory and physical rehabilitation of patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) only has a minimal effect on respiratory function but can significantly improve physical capacity. The aim of our study was to apply these methods to patients in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. We treated 38 patients (20 women) who had bronchial asthma (n = 14) or COPD (n = 24). These ambulatory patients were treated in two different hospitals in Kinshasa, the university hospital and the general hospital, three times per week for twelve weeks. The patients were treated with kinestherapy and inhaled bronchodilator drugs (salbutamol, and/or ipratropium bromide with a boreal nebulizer) as well as bronchial hygiene and performed breathing exercises on a Bodyguard Ergometer 990 with <b>walking,</b> running and <b>climbing</b> <b>steps</b> until exhaustion. After the rehabilitation program FEV 1 increased from 1. 37 ± 0. 62 (50 % expected) to 1. 54 ± 0. 69 (56 % expected) (p < 0. 01). The same trend was observed for walking distance (from 644 ± 459 m to 1213 ± 569 m, p < 0. 001) and for maximal power developed on the cycloergometer (from 45 ± 20 w to 73 ± 37 w, p < 0. 001). In contrast, the maximal work load performed during <b>climbing</b> <b>steps</b> (from 106 ± 44 w to 115 ± 23 w) did not improve significantly. COPD patients improved their FEV 1 significantly compared with asthma patients. Our study show that pulmonary rehabilitation increase the level of spontaneous physical activity.

50|$|Originally, {{a simple}} cruise climb {{was used by}} pilots.
