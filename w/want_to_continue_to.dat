5|$|The Partisan Prohibitions were {{repealed}} {{during the}} Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in 184 AD, {{largely because the}} court did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> alienate {{a significant portion of the}} gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions. The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue (d.184 AD) and Zhang Lu (d.216 AD), respectively. Zhang Lu's rebellion, in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, was not quelled until 215 AD. Zhang Jue's massive rebellion across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings. Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated, many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority.|$|E
5|$|In early 1964, David Warburton of Roberts & Vinter, an {{established}} publisher, {{heard from the}} printer of Science Fantasy and New Worlds that the magazines were going to fold shortly. Warburton decided that having a respectable magazine would help him in getting good distribution for Roberts & Vinter's books: Science Fantasy and New Worlds both had distribution arrangements with the two main British newsagents of the time, John Menzies and W.H. Smith. Carnell did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> edit the magazines in addition to New Writings in SF, and recommended Moorcock to Warburton; Kyril Bonfiglioli, an Oxford art dealer who {{was a friend of}} Brian Aldiss, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose New Worlds, and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of Science Fantasy. Roberts & Vinter changed the format from digest to paperback, and the first issue under Bonfiglioli's control was number 65, dated June–July 1964. The schedule was initially somewhat irregular, with each issue dated with two months even when two issues were only a month apart—for example, June–July 1964 was followed by July–August 1964. From March 1965 a regular monthly schedule was begun.|$|E

I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> help women." [...] She published three more articles in the Guardian and began work on a new book, Writing America: How Novelists Invented and Gendered a Nation, on the role of novelists such as Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner in the development of American political and cultural identity, which was left unfinished when she died.|$|E
500|$|When Michael Moorcock, who by {{this time}} had begun selling stories to Carnell, heard of the plans to cease {{publication}} of New Worlds and Science Fantasy, {{he wrote a letter}} that appeared in issue 141 lamenting the loss to the British science fiction field of both the magazines and Carnell himself. [...] Carnell did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> edit the magazines in addition to New Writings in SF, and recommended Moorcock to Warburton. Kyril Bonfiglioli, an Oxford art dealer who was a friend of Brian Aldiss, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose New Worlds, and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of Science Fantasy. Moorcock wanted to switch to a large format, and showed Warburton a dummy issue he had made up, but Warburton insisted on a paperback format in order to fit in with the other titles they were producing, though he agreed to revisit the format in the future if sales improved. [...] The first issue under Moorcock's control was number 142, dated May/June 1964. [...] The schedule was initially bimonthly, but at the start of 1965 it returned to a stable monthly schedule.|$|E

2500|$|Facing up to 3.5 {{years in}} {{military}} prison and dismissal from the Army, on December 15 Lakin changed tack {{and stated that}} he was wrong to question the president's qualifications through his military service. [...] He requested that the jury allow him to continue {{his career in the}} military ("I don't want it to end this way, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> serve"), and that he would now undertake his deployment if he could, even with his concerns about the president unaddressed. [...] The defense brought witnesses before the court to testify on Lakin's behalf, describing the accused as a [...] "compassionate physician" [...] who always volunteered to help when needed. [...] The prosecution introduced the officer that was deployed in Lakin's stead, who testified alongside his wife about how the last-minute deployment affected their lives.|$|E

During 2005 she spoke in approval of President George W. Bush's proposals to give financial aid to the Palestinian Authority in both the proposed supplemental and in the 2006 budgets. She said [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> focus on making sure that... the policy coming from Washington continues to encourage and support and nurture the peace process. In [...] first four years, {{there was a lack}} of leadership coming from the administration.

In a July 31, 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren, Palin was asked about states' rights as they pertained to same-sex marriage, to which Palin responded, [...] "I believe that states have that constitutional right {{to make decisions about}} a variety of issues, {{but when it comes to}} some very fundamental, very cornerstone aspects of our society, of our culture, I personally would love to see a national dialogue about what will America continue to define as marriage. As a former Governor, I say let the states decide that, and that's where I would be, if I were in national office. I'd be saying let the states decide. And if you see, Greta, and pay attention to where the states have gone with this particular issue and the votes of the people, overwhelmingly the people within the states have said they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> define marriage as one man and one woman, as the Muslims do, Orthodox Jews do, nondenominational Christians do, faith-practicing Catholics do.

2500|$|Meanwhile, in 2002, CJON-TV (known as [...] "NTV") in St. John's {{dropped its}} 38-year CTV {{affiliation}} after the network attempted to alter its affiliation agreement {{in a way}} that Newfoundland Broadcasting found unfair. [...] Since joining CTV, CJON had aired the base network schedule essentially for free since CTV paid it for the airtime. The station then bought additional CTV programming and sold all advertising. However, CTV tried to make CJON pay for the base schedule as well, with no possibility of airtime payments. It also increased the fees for additional CTV programming beyond what CJON claimed it could pay. Newfoundland Broadcasting also did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> carry CTV's national advertising during these programs. At the start of the 2002-03 season, CJON became an independent station and dropped most CTV programming except for national newscasts; in exchange, it provides news coverage of Newfoundland and Labrador events to CTV. In recent years, all of CTV's non-news programming has disappeared from the station, and since then virtually all primetime programs aired on that station are from rival Global. CTV does not currently have a de facto affiliate in that province, with most Newfoundlanders having to rely on cable and satellite (usually from CTV Atlantic) for its programming.|$|E
