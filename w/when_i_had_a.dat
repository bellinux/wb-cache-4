I wanted to play the records and say 'I {{am not going to}} destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E
500|$|Shankly's village {{team was}} called the Glenbuck Cherrypickers, a name {{probably}} derived from the 11th Hussars (the [...] "Cherry Pickers"), but Shankly said: [...] "the club was near extinction <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> trial and I never actually played for them". Shankly, aged 18, then played part of the 1931–32 season for Cronberry Eglinton, about 12 miles from Glenbuck. He used to cycle {{to and from the}} ground. Cronberry were in the Cumnock & District League. Although Shankly had less than one full season at Cronberry, he acknowledged his debt to Scottish Junior Football as he [...] "learnt a lot", mainly by listening to older players and especially his brothers.|$|E
500|$|The box set's {{release was}} {{confirmed}} on Wainwright's official site on March 21, 2011. Only 3,000 copies were produced for worldwide distribution. Box sets were sold for £150 in the United Kingdom, €170 throughout Europe, and were available as imports in the United States for $350. As {{part of the}} marketing strategy to promote the collection and concert series, Universal Music Catalogue developed a [...] "treasure hunt" [...] video for YouTube where visitors identified clues, and navigated links within a collage of Wainwright's music videos. According to Wainwright, the rarities box set was a [...] "little Rufus blast" [...] before he began work on his next pop album. Wainwright also said the following of the collection: [...] "There's my old demos, {{a lot of them}} were recorded in Montreal... <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very, very different voice, I kind of sounded like a little old man. There's that and there's a lot of fabulous collaborations with my mother, my father and some other great artists." [...] Wainwright had originally intended to call the box set The Rufus Cycle. After being told the title was [...] "too sophisticated", he went with House of Rufus, partly inspired by Lady Gaga's Haus of Gaga. Wainwright claimed the box set's release shortly after his father's (Loudon Wainwright III) box set 40 Odd Years was [...] "totally serendipitous".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} design and {{development}} {{phase of the}} Macintosh 128K, Wozniak had heavy influence over the project until 1981.

2500|$|Peppino's brother Giovanni {{declared}} {{before the}} Italian Antimafia Commission: [...] "It seemed that Badalamenti was well liked by the carabinieri {{as he was}} calm, reliable, and always liked a chat. It almost {{felt like he was}} doing them a favour in that nothing ever happened in Cinisi, it was a quiet little town. If anything, we were subversives who made nuisances of ourselves. This was what the carabinieri thought. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to speak to one of them – something which didn't happen often because I didn't really trust them – I realised that it was a widely held belief that Tano Badalamenti was a gentleman and it was us who were the trouble-makers." [...] "I often used to see them walking arm in arm with Tano Badalamenti and his henchmen. You can't have faith in the institutions when you see the police arm in arm with mafiosi." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Theme from Caged Heat 1985" [...] : All Hail the King, Drew Pearce {{created a}} fictional CBS 1980s {{television}} pilot titled Caged Heat (starring Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery character), and Feige encouraged him [...] "to go off. The {{whole purpose of}} Trevor is to go off the rails." [...] Feige and Marvel subsequently suggested that Pearce create a full title sequence for the pilot. Feige's love of film soundtracks [...] "started <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> little tape recorder and I would tape the themes to Simon and Simon and The A-Team and play it back, and those were all Mike Post", so Pearce contacted Post about using one of his old themes for the sequence. Because Post had sold the rights {{to all of the}} themes he had written, and felt that none of them fit the [...] "Russian Magnum P.I." [...] tone that Pearce was aiming for anyway, he offered to write a new theme specifically for the project. Post recorded the theme music on the same equipment he used for his iconic 1980s series' themes.|$|E

2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E
