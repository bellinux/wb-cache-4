2500|$|Some day, I hope {{we shall}} {{know the real}} motives behind the mysterious conduct of the steel {{industry}} in this tragic incident. [...] Some day, perhaps <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> why this strike was dragged out for 53 days only to be settled on substantially the same wage and price terms which the companies could have had nearly four months ago.|$|E
2500|$|Paul {{goes on to}} {{describe}} how believers should live. Christians are no longer under the law, that is, no longer bound by the law of Moses, but under the grace of God, see Law and grace. We {{do not need to}} live under the law because to the extent our minds have been renewed, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> [...] "almost instinctively" [...] what God wants of us. The law then provides an [...] "objective standard" [...] for judging progress in the [...] "lifelong process" [...] of our mind's renewal.|$|E
2500|$|On November 9, 1912, Carlisle was to {{meet the}} U.S. Military Academy in a game at West Point, New York, {{between two of the}} top teams in the country. Pop Warner spoke to his team: [...] "Your fathers and your grandfathers," [...] Warner began, [...] "are the ones who fought their fathers. These men playing against you today are soldiers. They are the Long Knives. You are Indians. Tonight, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> if you are warriors." [...] That {{dramatic}} evening Carlisle routed Army 27-6. That game, played just 22 years after the last Army battle with the Lakota/Sioux at the Wounded Knee, not only featured Jim Thorpe, but nine future generals including a linebacker named Dwight D. Eisenhower. [...] "It was an exquisitely apt piece of national theater: a contest between Indians and soldiers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{describing}} the transformation rules, we may introduce a metalanguage symbol [...] It {{is basically a}} convenient shorthand for saying [...] "infer that". The format is , in which [...] is a (possibly empty) set of formulas called premises, and [...] is a formula called conclusion. The transformation rule [...] means that if every proposition in [...] is a theorem (or has the same truth value as the axioms), then [...] is also a theorem. Note that considering the following rule Conjunction introduction, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> whenever [...] {{has more than one}} formula, we can always safely reduce it into one formula using conjunction. So for short, from that time on we may represent [...] as one formula instead of a set. Another omission for convenience is when [...] is an empty set, in which case [...] may not appear.|$|E

50|$|A simple example best {{illustrates}} the concept.

30|$|The {{profusion of}} colors and {{materials}} deepen this question: they cause indefinable emotions, being {{a result of the}} relationship of the object with oneself. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> always need the experience to understand emotions that cannot be reduced to concepts.

6000|$|... "Yes. You must {{remember}} that WE don't take heirs quite as much into account as {{you do in the}} old country. The loss of the MAN, and how to replace HIM, is much more to us than the disposal of his property.

6000|$|... "We can remedy that," [...] {{declared}} Uncle John.

6000|$|But, declining the altercation which Lady Binks seemed {{disposed}} to enter into, she replied, with good-humour, [...] "Well, dearest Rachel, {{we will not}} pull caps about this man--nay, I think your good opinion of him gives him new value in my eyes. That is always the way with us, my good friend!

40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor`s {{thesis is}} to explore {{possibilities}} of solving time-, frequency analysis a their combination time-frequency analysis by different methods for example Fourier transform a Wavelet transform.

5|$|The film {{ends with}} Abraham's narration, {{examining}} {{the life that}} Silk has led, and he questions whether the consequences she faced from her actions were justified or not.

I will write a note, address it to her and leave {{it on the table}} where she will see it as she enters the door. You and I will be in the dining-room {{concealed}} by the portières. In that note I'll say that I have fled from her forever with an affinity who understands the needs of my artistic soul as she never did.

6000|$|... "We {{will have}} them all in bed by eight o'clock, Veronica, and they will go cheerfully, as if they liked it, or <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> the reason why. We will make them say their prayers. Between ourselves, Veronica, I don't believe they always do. And no reading in bed, and no final glass of whisky toddy, or any {{nonsense}} of that sort. An Abernethy biscuit and perhaps if they are good a jujube, and then 'Good night,' and down with their head on the pillow. And no calling out, and no pretending they have got a pain in their tummy and creeping downstairs in their night-shirts and clamouring for brandy. We {{will be up to}} all their tricks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Lumley," [...] said I, at length, [...] "your first {{suggestion}} I {{meet with}} the reply that the consent of parents is not ignored among Indians, and that Waboose's mother is an Indian of so high-minded and refined a nature--partly acquired, no doubt, from her husband--that she will never consent to give her daughter to such a man; such a brute, I might say, considering what he attempted. As to Waboose herself, her father's gentle nature in her secures her from such a misfortune; and as to her being carried off--well, I don't think any savages would be bold enough to try to carry off anything from the grip of Peter Macnab, {{and when we get}} her back here <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> how to look after her." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{consider}} the functions M(n), the maximum exponent of any prime power dividing n and m(n), the minimum exponent of any prime power dividing n.
