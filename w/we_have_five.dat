[...] Under the {{management}} of John Pemberton, the side were seeking to replicate {{the success of the}} previous season when they had reached the final of the FA Youth Cup final. [...] Shorn of a number of key players (who had either graduated to the first team or left the club), the team completed a solid but unspectacular season. [...] Results fluctuated with impressive victories over the likes of Everton, Bolton and Sunderland being mixed with heavy defeats to Leeds United, Coventry City and West Ham United. [...] Eventually finishing fifth (out of ten teams) in their division, manager John Pemberton described the season as [...] "another successful one for everyone associated with the Academy. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>five</b> players becoming professionals who will all be linking up with the first team next season {{and that is what we}} are judged on – producing players." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the shooting, {{recordings}} of police radio communications during the event were {{released by the}} Snohomish County Police Staff and Auxiliary Services Center after requests for public records. A timeline was also provided by Marysville police spokesman Robb Lamoureux. According to the timeline and recordings, an anonymous 9-1-1 caller, using a cellphone, first alerted police to the shooting. The school resource officer was the first law enforcement officer {{to make contact with}} the victims, arriving at the scene a minute after the first 9-1-1 call was received. He immediately reported that a fire alarm was going off and that there were students and staff evacuating from the building. A dispatcher then informed him about a report of a possible shooting in the cafeteria. The officer responded, [...] "Ocean 12, it's confirmed. We have a shooter. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>five</b> down." [...] He later said, [...] "Shooter is DOA [...] We have got apparently four [...] " [...] Soon afterward, he said, [...] "Ocean 12, I need aid here. I have two that are still breathing and alive. Looks like I have three possibly deceased." [...] The first paramedics arrived on the scene ten minutes after the first radio dispatch.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, we also classified our selected occupations into low-skilled and high-skilled jobs.

If she adopts the former alternative I have to arrange some plan to carry her off and to get out of the country, an operation in which I foresee no little difficulty. Of course if we are caught my life is forfeited, there is no question about that. The question for us to consider is how we are to set about to carry out our respective plans." ...|$|E

60|$|The moon's {{distance}} from the earth is, in round numbers, 240,000 miles. If we desire to ascertain how near, apparently, a lens would bring the satellite (or any distant object), we, of course, have but to divide the distance by the magnifying or, more strictly, by the space-penetrating power of the glass. Mr. L. makes his lens have a power of 42,000 times. By this divide 240,000 (the moon's real distance), and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>five</b> miles and five sevenths, as the apparent distance. No animal at all could be seen so far; much less the minute points particularized in the story. Mr. L. speaks about Sir John Herschel's perceiving flowers (the Papaver rheas, etc.), and even detecting the color and {{the shape of the}} eyes of small birds. Shortly before, too, he has himself observed that the lens would not render perceptible objects of less than eighteen inches in diameter; but even this, as I have said, is giving the glass by far too great power. It may be observed, in passing, that this prodigious glass {{is said to have been}} molded at the glasshouse of Messrs. Hartley and Grant, in Dumbarton; but Messrs. H. and G.'s establishment had ceased operations for many years previous to the publication of the hoax.|$|E

But do you suppose {{that it can be}} so, unless every man among us use his utmost exertions to forward the success of the enterprise? Never, sir,--never; and, for me, I say so everywhere.

And the first question I ask of anyone who applies to me for a place is, Are you insured or a shareholder in the West Diddlesex? the second, Have you a good character? And if the first question is answered in the negative, I say to the party coming to me, Then be a shareholder before you ask for a place in my household.
