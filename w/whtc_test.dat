40|$|A {{promising}} SCR-only {{solution is}} presented to meet post- 2010 NOx emission targets for heavy duty applications. The proposed concept {{is based on an}} engine from a EURO IV SCR application, which is considered optimal with respect to fuel economy and costs. The addition of advanced SCR after treatment comprising a standard and a close-coupled SCR catalyst offers a feasible emission solution, especially suited for EURO VI. In this paper, results of a simulation study are presented. This study concentrates on optimizing SCR deNOx performance. Simulation results of cold start FTP and <b>WHTC</b> <b>test</b> cycles are presented to demonstrate the potential of the close-coupled SCR concept. Comparison with measured engine out emissions of an EGR engine shows that a close-coupled SCR catalyst potentially has NOx reduction performance as good as EGR. Practical issues regarding the use of an SCR catalyst in closecoupled position will be addressed, as well as engine and exhaust layout. For comparison, the requirements of a US 2010 /EURO VI compliant high EGR engine are discussed: base engine design, heat rejection, fuel injection equipment, turbo charging and fuel economy. From this study, it is concluded that the SCR-only approach leads to a less expensive engine design with better fuel economy and lower PM emissions. © 2009 SAE International...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the considerations regarding a city bus combustion engine performanceparameters in dynamic type approval tests and in real operating conditions when servicing an urban bus line. A {{comparison of the}} designated engine operating time shares with respect to load and crankshaft rotational speed was made. The analysis included the ETC and <b>WHTC</b> <b>tests,</b> which showed significant discrepancies in the work areas of internal combustion engines in these test when compared to actual driving conditions. The details of the type approval tests used and the method of their denormalization for the drive unit were presented. The vehicle used for this research was an eighteen meter city bus equipped with a CI engine with a displacement of 9. 2 dm 3. The latest PEMS mobile equipment technology was used to conduct the road measurements. This allowed the emission indicators for CO, HC, NOx and PM to be determined, including specific emissions. The obtained values were then compared with the Euro V limits. The analysis of the test results was supplemented with the calculation of fuel consumption using the carbonbalance method...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} five in total candidate PEMS-PM systems at diesel exhaust PM levels spanning from 20 mg/kWh (Euro V) to post DPF. The different emission levels were simulated {{by means of a}} DPF/bypass configuration. The PEMS-PM systems evaluated included Horiba’s On Board System with Transient PM measurement (OBS-TRPM), AVL’s Micro Soot Sensor (MSS) and Gravimetric Filter Box (GFB), Control Sistem’s micro Particulate Sampling System (m-PSS), Sensors Portable Particulate Measurement Device (PPMD) and Dekati’s Mass Monitor (DMM). The work focused on the effect of sampling time on the performance of the PEMS-PM instrumentation. To this end, repeated <b>WHTC</b> <b>tests</b> were performed with PM samples taken over a single WHTC but also over three consecutive test cycles. Teflon filters exhibited superior performance from TX 40 and Quartz filters, showing little dependence on the sampling time {{and at the same time}} resulting in better agreement between the reference instrumentation and the candidate PEMS-PM systems. The study also {{evaluated the}} performance of the real time sensors following some revisions and modifications considered by the manufacturers in response to the findings of the previous (phase 2) campaign. The experimental results verified the improved performance of the revised instrumentation but also revealed some areas for further improvements. JRC. DDG. F. 9 -Sustainable Transport (Ispra...|$|R
40|$|Two major trends can be {{identified}} for powertrain control in the next decade. The legislation will more and more focus on in-use emissions. Together with the global trend to reduce the CO 2 emissions, this will lead to an integral drive train approach. To develop and validate this integral drive train approach, {{the need for a}} new chapter in powertrain testing arises. The climatic-altitude chamber, suited for heavy vehicles, serves a wide variety of testing needs. Ambient temperature can be controlled between â 45 °C and + 55 °C and ambient pressure can be reduced up to a level found at an altitude to 4000 meters. The chamber's dynamometers enable transient testing of heavy-duty engines and vehicles and the chamber is equipped with a comprehensive array of emission measurement capabilities, working under extreme conditions. With the final design of the chamber, three types of powertrain test set-ups are possible: Engine tests Engine in vehicle tests (engine speed versus torque cycles, e. g. <b>WHTC</b> simulation) Vehicle <b>tests</b> for road and non-road applications (real-world emission and performance) By testing the complete vehicle under varying ambient conditions, the interactions between subsystems can be studied and the robustness of products can be enhanced. With this tool, development, pre-calibration and performance evaluation of powertrain control systems is performed in a reliable and efficient test environment. To deal with the increasing complexity of powertrains and optimize overall performance, model-based control will become the standard in the coming decade. In that case, advanced models that accurately predict the powertrain performance under real-life conditions can be developed and validated using this facility. The availability of accurate models opens the route to model-based calibration and advanced diagnostics and optimal control based on models embedded in the controller.
