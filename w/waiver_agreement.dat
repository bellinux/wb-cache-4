25|$|The New Zealand Government {{has signed}} {{bilateral}} visa <b>waiver</b> <b>agreements</b> {{with a number}} of the individual countries who are Schengen signatories, which allow New Zealand citizens to spend up to three months in the relevant country, without reference to time spent in other Schengen signatory states.

25|$|European Commission {{proposed}} a visa-free travel for 16 island nations in 2012.

The island nations in question are Caribbean island nations – Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago, and Pacific island nations – Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. The list was expanded in 2013 with Colombia, Peru and the United Arab Emirates. Most of these countries already provide visa-free or visa on arrival access in some form to the EU citizens.|$|R

40|$|In {{many ways}} Britain and Germany share similar {{profiles}} as arms producers. But their policy on both import and export offsets are quite different. This chapter argues that only {{by considering the}} historical and cultural backgrounds to their procurement and arms export policies can their offset policy choices be fully understood. While Britain reluctantly accepts the existence of offsets to counteract imperfect markets (but tries to seek <b>waiver</b> <b>agreements,</b> especially in Europe), Germany {{has been able to}} use offsets creatively not only to develop its own industry but also to become a significant exporter. The chapter suggests that British attachment to competitive procurement and its strong export promotion network explain its relative dislike of offsets, while the historical background of the German defense industry has given it certain qualities that enable it to cope far more successfully with offsets. © 2004 Editorial matter, selection, and introduction Jurgen Brauer & J.

40|$|The recent {{judicial}} {{enforcement of}} class <b>waivers</b> in arbitration <b>agreements</b> has generated ample {{debate over the}} exact reach of these decisions and their effects {{on the future of}} collective action for consumers and employees. In AT 2 ̆ 6 T Mobility v. Concepcion, a 5 - 4 majority of the Supreme Court majority held that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempted state laws prohibiting companies from incorporating class action <b>waivers</b> into arbitration <b>agreements.</b> The Court upheld such waivers {{on the grounds that they}} are consistent with the language and underlying purpose of the FAA. Most courts across the country have since reinforced the strong federal policy favoring arbitration. This, in turn, has made it more difficult for employees—most of whom do not enjoy the benefit of union representation and must therefore arbitrate their claims as individuals—from engaging in class proceedings. Faced with this dire judicial landscape, employees must turn to Congress to limit the scope of compulsory arbitration and secure recognition of the right to class proceedings. This Note advocates for legislative reform of federal arbitration law. Specifically, it argues for an amendment to the FAA that invalidates class waivers in mandatory arbitration agreements and applies only in employment disputes. Such a reform would help preserve important employee protections under federal labor law and would allow nonunion workers, in particular, to fully exercise their fundamental right to collective action...|$|R

40|$|A {{sentencing}} appellate waiver is {{a criminal}} defendant’s promise not to appeal her sentence. These provisions routinely appear in federal defendants’ plea agreements. With a few narrow exceptions, a knowing and voluntary sentencing appellate waiver bars a defendant from appealing all issues within the waiver’s scope. Using models of judicial behavior and empirical studies, this Article argues that the inclusion of sentencing appellate <b>waivers</b> in plea <b>agreements</b> creates bargaining inefficiencies and removes important incentives from the sentencing process. As a solution, the Article proposes that sentencing appellate waivers should {{take the form of}} separate post-sentencing agreements...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the sharing}} economy has pervaded {{the life of}} the consumer, {{challenging}} the regulatory and business status quo. Despite the pluralistic messages of many sharing economy companies, racial discrimination is a growing problem on peer-to-peer networks such as Uber and Airbnb. Victims of discrimination, however, have encountered an even greater opponent: class action <b>waivers</b> in arbitration <b>agreements,</b> which are omnipresent in sharing economy company contracts. Due to the inherent tie between class action and civil rights, racial discrimination claims in the sharing economy are held hostage by individual arbitration agreements. This Note argues that without action by Congress or a regulatory agency, such waivers threaten future civil rights enforcement...|$|R
