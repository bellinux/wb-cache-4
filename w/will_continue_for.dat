5|$|P. exclamans {{take several}} {{countermeasures}} against invasions. If the wasps detect an intruder they will violently bite and sting the location where the C. iphitalis moth has passed by. This will cause vibrations {{inside of the}} nest and the wasps inside will become alarmed and will move around jerkily. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} parasite dance. This <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> up to 10 hours after the moth has been detected. If the moth is found it will be eaten immediately. However, this is not likely to happen. The moth lays its eggs in the nest, and when they hatch, they will take over the nest. As a result, many wasp pupae are aborted. This is commonly seen in the late summer when the moth is most abundant.|$|E

25|$|But the Hamadeh counter-attacked, helped most {{probably}} by local people from Bsharri and Hasroun.

In 1763, the ambitious Emir Youssef Al Shihabi (ruled afterwards Mount Lebanon from 1770 to 1789) installed in the Jbeil region and being himself in conflict with the Hamadeh, profited from the difficulties of the Bourgeois Sheikhs and maneuvered to take from them the collection of taxes in Jebbet Bsharri.

The fight with the Hamadeh <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>for</b> 12 years. It will lead to their eviction from the whole region and to their final defeat in 1772.
