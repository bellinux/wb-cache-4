25|$|Nottinghamshire, captained for {{the first}} time by William Sime, drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost Bill Voce early in the season to {{retirement}} and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer Harry <b>Winrow</b> who took 56 championship wickets. <b>Winrow</b> was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946. Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at Trent Bridge in Nottingham for their thirteen home matches.|$|E

60|$|But else than these, no sign {{of death}} was seen {{throughout}} the isle. Did men in Odo live for aye? Was Ponce de Leon's fountain there? For near and far, you saw no ranks and files of graves, no generations harvested in <b>winrows.</b> In Odo, no hard-hearted nabob slept beneath a gentle epitaph; no requiescat-in-pace mocked a sinner damned; no memento-mori admonished men to live while yet they might. Here Death hid his skull; and hid it in the sea, the common sepulcher of Odo. Not dust to dust, but dust to brine; not hearses but canoes. For all who died upon that isle were carried out beyond the outer reef, and there were buried with their sires' sires. Hence came the thought, that of gusty nights, when round the isles, and high toward heaven, flew the white reef's rack and foam, that then and there, kept chattering watch and ward, the myriads that were ocean- tombed.|$|R
6000|$|Now Sylvia saw new pictures, for, leaving {{all traces}} of the city behind them, they went swiftly countryward. Sometimes by hayfields, each an idyl in itself, with white-sleeved mowers all arow; the {{pleasant}} sound of whetted scythes; great loads rumbling up lanes, with brown-faced children shouting atop; rosy girls raising fragrant <b>winrows</b> or bringing water for thirsty sweethearts leaning on their rakes. Often they saw ancient farm-houses with mossy roofs, and long well-sweeps suggestive of fresh draughts, and the drip of brimming pitchers; orchards and cornfields rustling on either hand, and grandmotherly caps at the narrow windows, or stout matrons tending babies in the doorway as they watched smaller selves playing keep house under the [...] "laylocks" [...] by the wall. Villages, like white flocks, slept on the hillsides; martinbox schoolhouses appeared here and there, astir with busy voices, alive with wistful eyes; and more than once they came upon little mermen bathing, who dived with sudden splashes, like a squad of turtles tumbling off a sunny rock.|$|R
60|$|Everybody {{rose and}} stood while he sang, and their faces glowed {{and their eyes}} burned; and the tears came and flowed down their cheeks and their forms began to sway unconsciously to the swing of the song, and their bosoms to heave and pant; and moanings broke out, and deep ejaculations; and when the last verse was reached, and Roland lay dying, all alone, with {{his face to the}} field and to his slain, lying there in heaps and <b>winrows,</b> and took off and held up his {{gauntlet}} to God with his failing hand, and breathed his beautiful prayer with his paling pips, all burst out in sobs and wailings. But when the final great note died out and the song was done, they all flung themselves in a body at the singer, stark mad with love of him and love of France and pride in her great deeds and old renown, and smothered him with their embracings; but Joan was there first, hugged close to his breast, and covering his face with idolatrous kisses.|$|R

60|$|I {{wonder if}} there is a stage that still runs between Lowell and Concord, past meadow walls, and under the caressing boughs of way-side elms, and through the bird-haunted gloom of {{woodland}} roads, in the freshness of the summer morning? By a blessed chance I found that there was such a stage in 1860, and I took it from my hotel, instead of going back to Boston and up to Concord as I must have had to do by train. The journey gave me the intimacy of the New England country as I could have had it in no other fashion, {{and for the first time}} I saw it in all the summer sweetness which I have often steeped my soul in since. The meadows were newly mown, and the air was fragrant with the grass, stretching in long <b>winrows</b> among the brown bowlders, or capped with canvas in the little haycocks it had been gathered into the day before. I was fresh from the affluent farms of the Western Reserve, and this care of the grass touched me with a rude pity, which I also bestowed on the meagre fields of corn and wheat; but still the land was lovelier than any I had ever seen, with its old farmhouses, and brambled gray stone walls, its stony hillsides, its staggering orchards, its wooded tops, and its thick-brackened valleys. From West to East the difference was as great as I afterwards found it from America to Europe, and my impression of something quaint and strange was no keener when I saw Old England the next year than when I saw New England now. I had imagined the landscape bare of trees, and I was astonished to find it almost as full of them as at home, though they all looked very little, as they well might to eyes used to the primeval forests of Ohio. The road ran through them from time to time, and took their coolness on its smooth hard reaches, and then issued again in the glisten of the open fields.|$|R

50|$|The {{laboratory}} in Scotland was successful and Taylor was invited by Toothill {{to set up}} an electronics laboratory at Ferranti Canada, which later merged with Packard, becoming Ferranti-Packard. Taylor took some members from the UK with him but also employed many local talented individuals, who would eventually produce DATAR headed up by British Scientist Dr Arthur Porter. Although DATAR wasn't without its difficulties, Tom Cranston, Fred Longstaff and Taylor developed and built a Trackball as part of the display system. This was the origins of the computer mouse which couldn't be patented as DATAR was meant to be secret. After DATAR funding ceased Arthur Porter left for an academic position, leaving Taylor the stressful job of finding work to keep their engineers usefully employed. Times ahead were tough, but Taylor still managed patents relating to letter sorting machines and an air bearing drum for use with the world's first computerised airline reservation system, ReserVec for Air Canada. During the 1960s Taylor worked on vehicle detection for road traffic management with Frank Paine and A.L. Stelmach. Vardalas explains in some detail that in the 1960s Taylor had an idea that superconductors would be useful for power companies in reducing power losses associated with electricity generation and employed Dr David Atherton to commence research on this. It eventually became clear that the funding required to take this research from small scale laboratory experiments to commercial development would put Ferranti Packard out of their depth and much of this research didn't translate into commercial success. Vardalas goes on to suggest that Display Technology saved the day when Taylor {{came up with the idea}} of displaying information by means of a fixed array of dots, by way of a Flip-disc-display these were used in the stock exchanges and airports around the world. Taylor and Donald <b>Winrow</b> both made massive contributions with several patents as the principal idea evolved.|$|E
