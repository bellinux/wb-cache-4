50|$|Elodea canadensis, {{sometimes}} called American or Canadian <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> or pond weed, is widely {{known as the}} generic <b>water</b> <b>weed.</b> The use of these names causes it {{to be confused with}} similar-looking plants, like Brazilian elodea (Egeria densa) or hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata). American <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> is an attractive aquarium plant and is a good substitute for Brazilian elodea. It can be used for science experiments in classrooms demonstrating how plants use carbon dioxide with the usage of bromothymol blue.|$|R
40|$|Macrophyte {{growth is}} {{extensive}} in the iconic chalk streams that {{are concentrated in}} southern and eastern England. Widespread and frequent <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> is undertaken to maintain their key functions (e. g. flood water conveyance and maintenance of viable fisheries). In this study, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted to quantify coincident physico-chemical responses (instream and riparian) that result from <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> and to discuss their potential implications. Three weed cuts were monitored at a site on the River Lambourn (The CEH River Lambourn Observatory) and major instream and riparian impacts were observed. Measurements clearly demonstrated how <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> enhanced flood flow conveyance, reduced water levels (river and wetland), increased river velocities, and mobilised suspended sediment (with associated chemicals) and reduced the capacity for its retention within the river channel. Potential implications in relation to flood risk, water resources, downstream water quality, instream and riparian ecology, amenity value of the river, and wetland greenhouse gas emissions were considered. Provided the major influence of macrophytes on instream and riparian environments is fully understood then the manipulation of macrophytes represents an effective management tool that demonstrates the great potential of working with nature...|$|R

30|$|The {{production}} of biomass briquettes from water hyacinth is recommended. This could help alleviate the challenges posed by this <b>water</b> <b>weed.</b> Successful commercialisation of the briquettes {{can lead to}} increased incomes, job creation and improved environmental management. The use of briquettes may help reduce the prevalence of the <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> in aquatic bodies and also help reduce the intensive use of wood fuel which usually leads to deforestation.|$|R
5000|$|An {{aquatic weed}} harvester, {{also known as}} a water mower, mowing boat and <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> boat, is an aquatic machine {{specifically}} designed for inland watercourse management to cut and harvest underwater weeds, reeds and other aquatic plant life. The action of removing aquatic plant life in such a manner has been referred to as [...] "aquatic harvesting".|$|R

30|$|The {{abundance}} of {{the rapidly growing}} hyacinth <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> presents both environmental challenges and opportunities. It is envisaged that water hyacinth is a potential biomass material {{for the production of}} briquettes because of its high growth yield and availability in large amounts throughout the year. The present research investigates the potential use of water hyacinth from nearby watercourses as biomass material for making briquettes. The calorific value of the <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> briquettes will be compared to other briquette samples made from other leaf species.|$|R
40|$|Weeds cause {{substantive}} yield {{losses in}} rainfed rice, particularly direct-seeded rice (DSR). Two field experiments {{were conducted in}} 2005 in north-east Thailand {{to examine the effects}} of cutting date and timing of fertilizer application on suppressed weed, growth and yield of DSR. Treatments consisted of two fertilizer applications to the main plots (top-dressing at the date of cutting and 15 days after cutting; DAC) and four cutting dates of the sub-plots. Rice and <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> was performed at 30, 45, 60 and 75 days after seeding (DAS), compared with an untreated control. Cutting resulted in a higher growth rate and improved grain yield of rice compared to the untreated control. <b>Weed</b> <b>cutting</b> at 60 DAS resulted in the greatest leaf area index, which contributed to the maximum number of tiller as well as maximum plant dry mass when observed at 30 DAC. Lower densities and dry weights of weeds at 30 DAC were observed when cutting was done 60 DAS, resulting in a higher grain yield than the other cutting dates. Timing of fertilizer application had no significant effect on the density and dry weight of grasses and broad-leaved weeds, but did have a significant affected on, resulting in the lowest density of sedges at 45 DAC was observed with fertilizer applied at cutting date. Rice grain yield was higher with top-dressing of fertilizer at 15 DAC than with fertilizer applied at cutting date. The cutting treatments resulted in higher net incomes than the untreated control. These results indicate that rice and <b>weed</b> <b>cutting</b> at an appropriate growth stage is an alternative method to chemical weed control for DSR in rainfed riceland. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
50|$|The American <b>water</b> <b>weed</b> lives entirely {{underwater}} {{with the}} exception of small white flowers which bloom at the surface and are attached to the plant by delicate stalks. It produces winter buds from the stem tips that overwinter on the lake bottom. It also often overwinters as an evergreen plant in mild climates. In the fall, leafy stalks will detach from the parent plant, float away, root, and start new plants. This is the American <b>water</b> <b>weed's</b> most important method of spreading, while seed production plays a relatively minor role.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to water volume retention, floating solar plants provide additional water quality benefits, of particular benefit to potable water infrastructure management.
