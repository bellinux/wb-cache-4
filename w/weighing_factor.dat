40|$|DE 102006047197 B 3 UPAB: 20080306 NOVELTY - The device has a weigher (10) for {{weighing}} sub-band signal with a <b>weighing</b> <b>factor</b> (C-k) that is specified for the sub-band signal around a subband-signal (11) {{to hold a}} weight. A corrected determinator (12) is provided for calculating a correction term. The correction term determinator calculates the correction term under application of another sub-band signal (X-l) and under application of another <b>weighing</b> <b>factor</b> (C-l), which is provided for the other sub-band signal. The other <b>weighing</b> <b>factor</b> is different from <b>weighing</b> <b>factor</b> and a combiner (13) for combining the weighted sub-band signal. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for processing a real sub-band signal (2) an analysis filter bank has a mechanism for producing multiple sub-band signals from a time-discrete signal (3) a synthesis filter bank (4) a method for filtering a time-discrete signal (5) a method for synthesizing a signal (6) a computer program has a program code for execution of the method. USE - Device for processing a realistic sub-band signal of multiple realistic sub-band signals, particularly audio or video signals, which are the representation of realistic time discrete signals that are produced by an analysis filter bank. ADVANTAGE - The corrected determinator is provided for calculating a correction term. The correction term determinator calculates the correction term under application of another sub-band signal and under application of another <b>weighing</b> <b>factor,</b> which is provided for the other sub-band signal. The other <b>weighing</b> <b>factor</b> is different from <b>weighing</b> <b>factor</b> and a combiner for combining the weighted sub-band signal, and thus ensures an efficient and highly qualitative processing of signals...|$|E
