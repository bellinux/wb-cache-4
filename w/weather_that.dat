5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting {{in the development of}} a subtropical depression on October7. Upon formation, the system consisted of a very broad subtropical low, as well as a poorly defined surface circulation. As the subtropical depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the subtropical depression intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> {{had absorbed}} a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Two-E. It became a tropical storm the next day. After peaking on June 9, with a pressure of 997mb, steering currents collapsed and Boris stalled out in the ocean between two ridges of high pressure. Shear increased, and the cyclone weakened to a depression on June 10. The next day, Boris degenerated into a remnant low. The remnant drifted east and then southeast before dissipating on June 12.|$|E

5|$|The Rivers Agency {{concluded}} that the flooding was an extreme event, caused by <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> resulted in widespread flooding across Northern Ireland. The amount {{of water in the}} rivers exceeded the capacity of the flood defences and the natural river banks.

5|$|The area of {{disturbed}} <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> {{would soon}} become Chantal {{began in a}} large envelope of low pressure {{on the morning of}} September 10. The disturbed weather, nested off the coast of Bermuda, was one of the remnants of an old frontal trough that had extended from Hispaniola to the central north Atlantic Ocean. This particular area of disturbed weather become part of the northeast portion of a low-pressure system. On September 10, a reconnaissance aircraft found sustained winds of 30mph (50km/h) and a 1010millibar (29.83inHg) pressure reading. This reading indicated the system developed into the fifth tropical depression of the 1983 season.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Lester was a weak {{tropical}} storm that paralleled the Mexican coastline in October 2004. The 16th tropical cyclone and 12th named storm of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season, Lester originated {{from an area}} of disturbed <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> persisted southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. After organizing, the system was designated as a tropical depression on October 11. The depression was upgraded to a {{tropical storm}} the next day, and moved northwestward, just off the Mexican coastline. Due to the interaction with land among other factors, the storm degenerated on October 13. The storm dropped locally heavy rainfall, which caused minor flooding and mudslides. No fatalities or significant damage were reported.|$|E

5|$|Along the San Francisco peninsula, {{gaps in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, one {{south of}} San Bruno Mountain and another in Crystal Springs, allow oceanic weather into the {{interior}} and causing a cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even {{as far south as}} San Jose. This weather pattern is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north of the Golden Gate strait, two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin Headlands, with the cooling affect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> travels through the Golden Gate strait, and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez Strait funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, causing a cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south.|$|E
5|$|Famines became {{common in}} {{northern}} China {{in the early}} 17th century because of unusually dry and cold <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event {{now known as the}} Little Ice Age. Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility. The central government, starved of resources, could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing an unknown but large number of people. The deadliest earthquake of all time, the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556, occurred during the Jiajing Emperor's reign, killing approximately 830,000 people.|$|E
5|$|From {{the initial}} {{planning}} stages, proponents and opponents {{speculated that the}} large size of the reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon. Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, {{and most of the}} reports hypothesized an effect similar to the <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> occurs around Great Slave Lake and Lake Baikal, both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of lake-effect snow. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused the land around the lake to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.|$|E
50|$|Spheroidal {{weathering}} {{is a form}} {{of chemical}} <b>weathering</b> <b>that</b> affects jointed bedrock and results in the formation of concentric or spherical layers of highly decayed rock within <b>weathered</b> bedrock <b>that</b> is known as saprolite. When saprolite is exposed by physical erosion, these concentric layers peel (spall) off as concentric shells much like the layers of a peeled onion. Within saprolite, spheroidal weathering often creates rounded boulders, known as corestones or woolsack, of relatively unweathered rock. Spheroidal weathering is also called onion skin weathering, concentric weathering, spherical weathering, or woolsack weathering.|$|R

5|$|In 1263 {{the dispute}} with the Scottish king over the Hebrides induced Haakon to {{undertake}} an expedition to the islands. Having learned in 1262 that Scottish nobles had raided the Hebrides and that Alexander III planned to conquer the islands, Haakon went on an expedition with his formidable leidang fleet of at least 120 ships in 1263, having become accustomed to negotiating backed by an intimidating fleet. The fleet left Bergen in July, and reached Shetland and Orkney in August where {{they were joined by}} chieftains from the Hebrides and Man. Negotiations were started by Alexander following Norwegian landings on the Scottish mainland, but were purposely prolonged by the Scots. Having waited until September/October for <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> caused trouble for Haakon's fleet, a clash occurred between a smaller Norwegian force and a Scottish division at the Battle of Largs. Although inconclusive and of a limited impact, Haakon withdrew to Orkney for the winter. A delegation of Irish kings invited Haakon to help them rid Ireland of English settlers as High King of Ireland, but this was apparently rejected against Haakon's wish.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Hammond {{increased}} his first-class wicket total to 47, and scored 1,781 runs {{at an average}} of 42.40. Although he remained a key batsman for Gloucestershire, both his aggregate and average fell, at least partly due to wet <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> often led to difficult batting conditions. In the three Tests against New Zealand, their first in England, he made an attacking century in the second Test, England's only victory. He did not pass fifty {{in the rest of the}} series, ending the victorious campaign with 169 runs {{at an average of}} 56.33. In 1932, Hammond was appointed vice-captain of Gloucestershire, but it was noted in Wisden that he sometimes failed to inspire his team. Hammond himself felt unable, as a new captain, to take the same risks that Lyon had done. He scored 2,528 runs (average 56.17), including his then highest score of 264, and his first hundred for the Players against the Gentlemen. He also took 53 wickets.|$|E
5|$|Late on December 2, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{started to}} monitor {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> was located within the South Pacific convergence zone to the northwest of Apia, Samoa. Located beneath an anticyclone, the system maintained deep convection near its elongated but well-defined circulation center. Early the next day, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, (RSMC Nadi), started to monitor the area of disturbed weather as Tropical Depression 04F. Over the next two days, the depression moved towards the west, conditions surrounding the depression barely changed {{and as a result}} the depression steadily intensified. Early on December 5, the system had convective bands spiraling into and wrapping tightly around the low level circulation center. As a result of this, the JTWC started advisories on Tropical Cyclone 05P, with winds equivalent to a tropical storm. At 0200UTC, RSMC Nadi reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it as Daman. During that day Daman passed over Rotuma island while gradually intensifying further.|$|E

It is found growing at the base of both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in peat moss beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common. They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, and are more abundant in <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> is warm and humid.|$|E
5|$|On 15 December, {{this plan}} was {{worked out with}} the help of the Luftwaffe′s Jagd-Geschwaderkommodore, among them Gotthard Handrick (Jagdabschnittsführer Mittelrhein; Fighter Sector Leader Middle Rhein), Walter Grabmann and Karl Hentschel, commanders of 3. and 5. Jagddivision respectively. It was {{originally}} scheduled to support the Battle of the Bulge, the German Army′s offensive, which began 16 December 1944. However, the same bad <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> prevented the RAF and USAAF from supporting their own ground forces also prevented the Luftwaffe from carrying out the operation. It was therefore not launched until 1 January 1945. By this time, the German Army had lost momentum owing to Allied resistance and clearing weather, which allowed Allied Air Forces to operate. The German Army attempted to restart the attack by launching Operation Northwind (Unternehmen Nordwind). The Luftwaffe was to support this offensive through Bodenplatte.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, the US Navy {{started to}} monitor {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} <b>weather</b> <b>that</b> was located about 720km (480mi), {{to the east of}} Honiara in the Solomon Islands. During that day, TCWC Nadi started to monitor the system as a tropical depression as the system moved southeast towards Fiji. Over the next couple of days, the depression continued to move southeast towards Fiji and gradually developed further. On December 15, the NPMOC initiated advisories on the depression and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 04P, while it was located about 110km (70mi) to the northeast of Labasa, Fiji. Later that day, the NPMOC reported that the system had become a tropical storm and reached its peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 65km/h (40mph), as it affected several Fijian islands including Vanua Levu and Thikombia. During December 16, the cyclone continued to move towards the southeast and started to affect Tonga before the NPMOC issued their final warning on the system as it had weakened into a tropical depression. During the next day, the depression moved into TCWC Wellingtons area of responsibility and was subsequently declared extratropical.|$|E
