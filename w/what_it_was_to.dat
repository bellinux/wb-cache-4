5|$|The charismatic {{movement}} {{forced a}} reevaluation of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be Pentecostal. The Assemblies of God understood Spirit baptism {{in the context}} of baptistic evangelical theology and, by the 1950s, emphasized certain doctrines and practices as requisite for Spirit baptism. Charismatics challenged these views by claiming to receive Holy Spirit baptism outside of this context (such as remaining in liturgical churches, failing to reject sacramental theologies, and not adopting Pentecostal taboos on dancing, drinking, smoking, etc.). On the local level, Assemblies of God churches were influenced by the charismatic movement. Some charismatics left their original churches and joined less formal Assemblies of God congregations. In addition, the contemporary decreased emphasis on traditional Pentecostal taboos in the AG is in part attributable to the charismatic movement, which accelerated a trend already in existence.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical {{approach}} to painting revolutionized {{the potential for}} all Contemporary art that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making {{a work of art}} was as important as the work of art itself. Like Pablo Picasso's innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near {{the turn of the century}} via Cubism and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as Navaho sand paintings, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art, Pollock redefined <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—the placing of unstretched raw canvas on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery—essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.|$|E

He was an accomplished Arabist, perfecting several Arabic dialects of both the Maghreb and the Middle East. He believed in the importance of bringing together different, but related, regions, whether in the Arabic- speaking world or in the Mediterranean, as {{can be seen from the}} titles of two of his books, De l'Euphrate a l'Atlas ("From the Euphrates to the Atlas", 1978) and Memoires des deux rives ("Recollections from Both Shores of the Mediterranean", 1989), the latter described by Ernest Gellner, as 'a splendid account of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be a pied-noir slowly converted to anti-colonialism'.

Moreover, on our present understanding of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a “reasonable ” field, the standard energy conditions are violated classically. Thus the singularity theorems are unavailable for classical GR.

With a feminist perspective, she explored {{the story of the}} defenseless girl and the dynamics of the individuals involved in her sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Biographer Roberta M. Hooks wrote, [...] "Quite apart from any feminist polemics, The Basement can stand alone as an intensely felt and movingly written study of the problems of cruelty and submission." [...] Millett said of the motivation of the perpetrator: [...] "It {{is the story of the}} suppression of women.
