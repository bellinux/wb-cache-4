500|$|At Franz Joseph's request, Zita and her {{children}} left their residence at Hetzendorf and moved into a suite of rooms at Schönbrunn Palace. Here, Zita spent many hours with the old Emperor on both formal and informal occasions, where Franz Joseph confided in her his fears for the future. Emperor Franz Joseph died of bronchitis and pneumonia {{at the age of}} 86 on 21 November 1916. [...] "I remember the dear plump figure of Prince Lobkowitz going up to my husband," [...] Zita later recounted, [...] "and, with tears in his eyes, making {{the sign of the cross}} on Charles's forehead. As he did so he said, 'May God bless Your Majesty.' It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had heard the Imperial title used to us." ...|$|E
500|$|The band became {{associated}} with the International Space Year (ISY), designated as 1992 by the United Nations to promote peaceful and collaborative space exploration, when Linnell and Flansburgh were searching the NASA Archive Center for appropriate photographs and visual materials for the album artwork. Staff members at the NASA facility took notice of the duo and inquired about their research. Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> ever heard of that, but they said because we were a band going to be touring {{around the world in}} 1992 they wondered if we wanted to be spokesband for the ISY. So we said why not?" ...|$|E
500|$|García Márquez was {{inspired}} to write a dictator novel when he witnessed the flight of Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez. He shares, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had seen a dictator fall in Latin America." [...] García Márquez began writing Autumn of the Patriarch (El otoño del patriarca) in 1968 {{and said it was}} finished in 1971; however, he continued to embellish the dictator novel until 1975 when it was published in Spain. According to García Márquez, the novel is a [...] "poem on the solitude of power" [...] as it follows the life of an eternal dictator known as the General. The novel is developed through a series of anecdotes related {{to the life of the}} General, which do not appear in chronological order. Although the exact location of the story is not pin-pointed in the novel, the imaginary country is situated somewhere in the Caribbean.|$|E

5000|$|This game <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Cardinal {{defeated}} the Bruins at the Rose Bowl since 1996. [...] This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> shutout UCLA had {{suffered in the}} twenty-first century, since a 17-0 loss to California on October 16, 1999. [...] This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> Stanford had achieved a road shutout against an opponent since 1974. [...] This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> since 1941 that Stanford shutout UCLA.|$|R
50|$|The 21st Academy Awards {{features}} numerous <b>firsts.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> a non-Hollywood production won Best Picture, Hamlet.

500|$|It {{would be}} January 1997 until the band {{would be able}} to wrap up {{sessions}} for Dude Ranch, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording. For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to [...] "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound-effects machine. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor's drum tracks for several songs. Hoppus recalled [...] "I remember when we finished Dude Ranch I was so proud. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> could take the time and whatever to make a good record." [...] Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard. [...] "When we were in there mixing, the A person would come by," [...] remembered Cameron. [...] "I don't think the band really knew what they had but certainly the label knew they had so many good songs on the record." [...] DeLonge remembered it differently: [...] " [...] fucking hated pop-punk. They {{wanted nothing to do with}} it. They were into Pavement or whatever." [...] After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|On his approach, Cohen {{said that}} he refused to {{consider}} making the film PG-13: [...] "The first thing I said was, 'If you want me, I'm making an R-rated movie. I don't {{want to deal with}} sex and make it, like, for 13-year-olds.' The film took 23 days to shoot. Discussing its micro-budget, Lopez stated: [...] "You know what, we put all four million dollars in front of the camera! We all shared one trailer, we had no craft service, it wasn't that type of luxury movie set, let's say." [...] She also found that the limited budget and filming period was [...] "super intense", saying: [...] "I never had done a film like that in my career. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> did that, but it was very liberating as an artist because it made me realize I can make whatever movie I want like this." [...] On filming sex scenes, Guzman said [...] "that was the time in the film when I was the most uncomfortable. We had to choreograph every piece... It was the most unsexy-really-sexy scene that you'll see on screen." [...] Filming took place throughout fall 2013 in Los Angeles. In December 2013, the film received permit to shoot in Placerita Canyon, Newhall. Some of the remaining scenes were also filmed in April 2014.|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> sort of jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks {{in a way we}} hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Avalanche Software {{started working}} with Marvel Entertainment, after it was {{acquired}} by Disney in 2009, about developing a game featuring Marvel superheroes, in 2011. The conception of the game started immediately after the acquisition, as Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroess executive producer, John Vignocchi commented [...] "As soon as the acquisition happened we started having conversations about Marvel. I giggle that I know the date, because I checked in via Foursquare at Marvel. So that's how I knew, that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> sat down with Joe Quesada." [...] Avalanche developed a demo in October 2013, which featured the Marvel superhero Iron Man flying through a rudimentary city. The demo was later {{released to the public}} almost a year later.|$|E
2500|$|Side B {{begins with}} one of the band's only {{politically}} based songs, [...] "My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)" [...] The lyrics comprised Joey, Dee Dee, and Beauviour's feelings while watching US President Ronald Reagan visit military cemetery in Bitburg, West Germany to pay tribute to the victims of Nazism. In an interview with East Coast Rocker, Joey explained: [...] "What Reagan did was fucked up. Everybody told him not to go, all his people told him not to go, and he went anyway. How can you fuckin' forgive the Holocaust? How can you say, 'Oh well, it's OK now?' That's crazy!" [...] Dee Dee also asserted that Johnny had made the band seem right winged. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> could make a statement to show we weren't prejudiced," [...] he explained. [...] "We'd just had these skinheads at or gigs, punks walking around wearing swastikas." [...] Johnny disliked the song and {{went so far as to}} never play the song live, saying Reagan was his favorite president of his lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{signed to}} Interscope Records, and in June 1994 {{used the money}} {{acquired}} from their recording contract to relocate from Brookfield to Fort Collins, Colorado, where Alvarez had lived {{as a child and}} where drummer Bill Stevenson's girlfriend lived. [...] "We moved to Fort Collins {{with the advent of the}} major label because we finally had enough money to live like normal people after all those years", Alvarez later said. [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had ever lived in separate residences. At the time I was actually married, which was a new one for the band to deal with, and everyone’s moving in their different circles, but we kept touring and making records." [...] "Los Angeles was too big. Brookfield was too small. This is just right", he said in 1995. [...] "When we lived in Brookfield and wanted to do a local gig, we'd have to drive two hours to Columbia or six hours to St. Louis. It's a lot easier here, and the kids are real cool. So I think we'll stay." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1979, <b>the</b> village <b>was</b> victorious in Group 1B, with a plot made by Yedda Pinheiro, {{talking about}} the golden years of Carlos Machado.

2500|$|Puciato later {{commented on}} the act saying; “It was {{early in the day}} and as most people, you kind of get that out of the way early in the day but I never did. I made a point to hold onto it. And you know the turtle, the {{malicious}} turtle, was pretty easy to fire that fucker right out of the hole. There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So {{it was kind of a}} combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E

60|$|Before the chests {{were quite}} empty, {{we had a}} grand washing in the stream of our best raiment, {{for the purpose of}} looking tidy, and visiting the European chapel in the village.

6000|$|We faced {{one another}} with little of the mask of surprise.

60|$|By {{one of the}} {{striking}} coincidences {{that it is hard}} to believe are accidents, it happened that as we mounted outside the Manor a buggy came around one corner of the house, and with a feeling akin to consternation we turned to regard its occupant. A hired man held the reins, but beside him, wrapped in a fur coat although the day was warm, sat Colonel Carrington, a shivering, huddled object propped against the backboard. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had seen him, and the sight troubled us, for the few weeks had made great changes in the ruler of Carrington.|$|E

60|$|And {{truly the}} war would have done all these things {{had it not been}} for the socialists. A secret meeting of the Western leaders was held in our four tiny rooms in Pell Street. Here was first {{considered}} the stand the socialists were to take. It was not the first time we had put our foot down upon war,* but it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had done so in the United States. After our secret meeting we got in touch with the national organization, and soon our code cables were passing back and forth across the Atlantic between us and the International Bureau.|$|E
60|$|One of the interludes, and {{a lovely}} one, was {{given over to}} {{gathering}} the hay {{from one of the}} wild meadows to the north of us. Another was the threshing from the shock on the rented farm. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had seen this done and it interested us keenly. A great many teams were necessary and the crew of men was correspondingly large. Uncle David was again the thresher with a fine new separator, and I would have enjoyed the season with almost perfect contentment {{had it not been for}} the fact that I was detailed to hold sacks for Daddy Fairbanks who was the measurer.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} {{everything}} was ready; {{the boat was}} lowered and brought to the gangway; and the captain was helped on deck by the mate and steward. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had seen him {{in more than two}} weeks, and he was greatly altered. As if anxious to elude every eye, a broad-brimmed Payata hat was pulled down over his brow; so that his face was only visible when the brim flapped aside. By a sling, rigged from the main-yard, the cook and Bembo now assisted in lowering him into the boat. As he went moaning over the side, he must have heard the whispered maledictions of his crew.|$|E
