25|$|The 1950-51 side under Freddie Brown...was full of inexperienced {{players and}} we paid the penalty. I'm sure {{if we had}} {{selected}} one or two solid players such as Jack Robertson, Dennis Brookes, Jack Ikin and Bill Edrich we would have won the Ashes - in spite of once again being caught on a glue-pot at Brisbane. Two Tests were lost by a very small margin and <b>we</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> last. In addition Denis Compton was a complete failure in the Tests, scoring only 53 runs in four matches. In spite of the critics the bowling proved adequate and Freddie Brown did a grand job {{in view of the}} shortcomings of the side. To me the annoying part was that we had players in England who could have won the series for us.|$|E

500|$|Both teams {{valued the}} competition, despite some {{commentators}} being dismissive of the match's importance. CSKA captain Sergei Ignashevich underlined his team's determined mood: [...] "We know their players {{are very strong}} because they won the Champions League. But we are not thinking about individuals. We will only worry about ourselves and not them." [...] Likewise Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was equally determined to be successful: [...] "This {{is the opportunity to}} win another trophy. When you play against good teams you have to do your best. I am not thinking about the past and that <b>we</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> Champions League." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferguson {{was delighted}} in how his team coped with the pitchside temperatures: [...] "You {{had to be}} down there to {{appreciate}} it. I was told it was 41 degrees on the pitch – I know I was roasting just watching them." [...] When asked about Howard's positioning for Arsenal's equaliser, he replied: [...] "Tim wanted three in the wall and he will learn from that. This isn't America." [...] Silvestre denied suggestions that the win gave United a psychological edge over Arsenal: [...] "This is still a pre-season game. <b>We</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> Premiership title with a strong run {{at the end of}} last season." [...] Howard was unsure whether he would displace Barthez in the first team for a prolonged run – [...] "that's not my decision", though continued [...] "We have four great goalkeepers and we're looking to have a good battle all season long." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and <b>we</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> rally.|$|E

500|$|During {{the twentieth}} century Emmeline Pankhurst's value to the {{movement}} for women's suffrage was debated passionately, and no consensus was achieved. Her daughters Sylvia and Christabel weighed in with books, scornful and laudatory respectively, about {{their time in the}} struggle. Sylvia's 1931 book The Suffrage Movement describes her mother's political shift {{at the start of the}} First World War as the beginning of a betrayal of her family (especially her father) and the movement. It set the tone for much of the socialist and activist history written about the WSPU and particularly solidified Emmeline Pankhurst's reputation as an unreasonable autocrat. Christabel's [...] "Unshackled: The Story of How <b>We</b> <b>Won</b> <b>the</b> Vote," [...] released in 1959, paints her mother as generous and selfless to a fault, offering herself completely to the most noble causes. It provided a sympathetic counterpart to Sylvia's attacks and continued the polarised discussion; detached and objective assessment has rarely been a part of Pankhurst scholarship.|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fifth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus commented, [...] "I think finally, finally after pulling this off Jimmie {{will get the}} respect that he deserves. Knowing {{what we had to}} do— come down here and beat them— and we beat them." [...] Hamlin, the points leader before the race, described his disappointment by saying, [...] "I’m disappointed. Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances but we had a great year. <b>We</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us." [...] Harvick, who finished third in points, stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and <b>we</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. We are very happy to win, but we do not want to stop here. We want to keep improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League, which is our aim now." ...|$|E

500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... My junior year in college, I had what I thought was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. <b>We</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.|$|E
500|$|Milan were {{regarded}} as favourites and their team included many players who had experienced success in the competition. The most notable was captain Paolo Maldini, who had won the competition four times previously, all with Milan, and Clarence Seedorf who had won the competition three times with three different clubs. Liverpool had been considered underdogs throughout the competition, but had beaten more favoured opposition, including Juventus and Chelsea, to reach the final. Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez acknowledged this: [...] "Maybe Milan are favourites, but we have confidence, and we can win". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger felt Liverpool would win the match: [...] "I fancy Liverpool as Milan look jaded physically and certainly mentally, by losing the [...] title, I think they {{have never had a}} better chance than now to beat Milan." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was not so optimistic, stating that the Liverpool side were not as good as the one that had won the 2001 UEFA Cup Final: [...] "No disrespect to the squad we have got now but it is obvious we are not as strong as we were when <b>we</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> UEFA Cup in 2001. Back then we had a settled team and that season when we went into games against Barcelona and Roma, we always felt we were as good as them." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, McCall signed for Scottish club Rangers for £1.2 million. Rangers had just won their third {{successive}} Scottish Premier Division title. Under newly appointed manager Walter Smith, McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's nine successive Scottish league titles. In his first season at Ibrox, Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in 1992–93, winning both cups 2–1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league. McCall also enjoyed European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the UEFA Champions League 1992–93 final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners Olympique de Marseille. Citing the reason for their success as the spirit which Smith instilled in the team, McCall later said: [...] "It was an incredible season. <b>We</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> domestic Treble, we went 44 games unbeaten {{and we did not}} lose a single game in Europe. And, though we said we would do it again next year, we all knew it was unrepeatable." [...] In 1993–94, Rangers added another Scottish League Cup title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the Scottish Cup to Dundee United, surprisingly being denied a second successive treble. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of Motherwell, but they failed to reach the final of either of the domestic cups. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals Celtic, in 1995–96, Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated Hearts 5–1. His Rangers side again pushed Celtic into second place in 1996–97 and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in 1997–98 they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by two points {{on the final day of}} the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final defeat to Hearts as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.|$|E
