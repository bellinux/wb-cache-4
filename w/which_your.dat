25|$|Until the 20th century, Islamic law granted Muslim women certain legal rights, such as {{the right}} to own {{property}} received as Mahr (brideprice) at her marriage. However, Islamic law does not grant non-Muslim women the same legal rights as the few it did grant Muslim women. Sharia recognizes the basic inequality between master and women slave, between free women and slave women, between Believers and non-Believers, as well as their unequal rights. Sharia authorized the institution of slavery, using the words abd (slave) and the phrase ma malakat aymanukum ("that <b>which</b> <b>your</b> right hand owns") to refer to women slaves, seized as captives of war. Under Islamic law, Muslim men could have sexual relations with female captives and slaves.|$|E

25|$|The {{mainstream}} view is {{that the}} Quran accepts the institution of slavery. It may be noted that the word 'abd' (slave) is rarely used, being more commonly replaced by some periphrasis such as ma malakat aymanukum ("that <b>which</b> <b>your</b> right hands own"). However the meaning and translation of this term has been disputed. W.G. Clarence-Smith has highlighted {{the point of view of}} Ghulam Ahmed Pervez on this issue, who argued that the term is used in the past-tense in the Quran, thus signalling only those individuals who were already enslaved at the dawn of Islam. This slight change in tense is significant, as it allowed G.A. Parwez to argue that slavery was never compatible with the commandments of the Quran and is in fact outlawed by Quranic Law.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the single campaign is {{a number of different}} battle scenarios, in <b>which</b> <b>your</b> pre-selected force will combat a number of enemy forces. Winning the scenario will award the player gold. Between battles the game switches to a map of the area, with the location of their army denoted by a figure of their champion. The player is then able to select his or her army and move to another location. This will bring up a force selection screen, and the player will then have to select a limited number of troops and heroes to play the next scenario with. Although the campaign is for the most part linear, there are also optional side quests, which although mostly unrelated to the main story will usually result in the heroes acquiring additional gold, troops or equipment {{that can be used in}} the campaign. As well as traditional large scale battles there are also Duel scenarios in which a hero character of your choice will enter straight into a duel with an enemy champion, with victory of either champion immediately ending the scenario.|$|E

Rota, unhappy with that plan, wrote an original motif (with echoes of the [...] "Larghetto" [...] from Dvořák's Opus 22 Serenade for Strings in E major [...] ) with rhythmic lines matched to Corelli's piece that synchronize with Gelsomina's movements with the trumpet and Il Matto's with the violin.|$|E

The Marquis of São Vicente, then President of the Council of Ministers, suggested to the Emperor that republicans be forbidden to enter into public service, a practice then common in monarchies. Pedro II answered, [...] "Mr. São Vicente, allow the nation to govern itself and decide whatever [...] they want." [...] The President reprimanded the monarch, [...] "Your Majesty does not have a right to think in that way. The Monarchy is a constitutional doctrine <b>which</b> <b>Your</b> Majesty swore to maintain; it is not incarnate in the person of Your Majesty." [...] But the Emperor did not care and simply answered: [...] "Well, if the Brazilians do not want me as their Emperor, I shall become a teacher instead!" ...|$|E
500|$|John S. Barbour Jr. of the Piedmont’s Culpeper County was {{the first}} Unionist to break away into the secessionist camp.

500|$|One analyst {{said that}} the {{settlement}} was likely to mute his public pronouncements and lawsuits against the company. However, upon the game's 2008 release, Thompson called Grand Theft Auto IV [...] "the gravest assault upon children in this country since polio," [...] and asked Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to [...] "pursue and file criminal charges against [...] Target and Best Buy". He also {{sent a letter to}} Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick's attorney, addressed to Zelnick's mother, in which Thompson accused her son of [...] "doing everything he possibly can to sell as many copies of GTA: IV to teen boys in the United States, a country in <b>which</b> <b>your</b> son claims you raised him to be a 'a Boy Scout'. ... More like the Hitler Youth, I would say." [...] On May 1, 2008 Thompson appeared on the CNN Headline News program Glenn Beck, asserting that the game's sexual content made its sale to minors illegal, and that he was working with law enforcement to have criminal prosecutions brought. Thompson also {{filed a complaint with the}} Chicago Transit Authority about poster ads for the game at Chicago, Illinois bus stops.|$|E
500|$|Having succeeded Anderson at Louisville, Sherman now had {{principal}} military {{responsibility for}} Kentucky, a border {{state in which}} Confederate troops held Columbus and Bowling Green and were present near the Cumberland Gap. [...] He became exceedingly pessimistic about the outlook for his command and he complained frequently to Washington, D.C. about shortages while providing exaggerated estimates {{of the strength of}} the rebel forces. [...] Critical press reports appeared about him after an October visit to Louisville by the secretary of war, Simon Cameron, and in early November 1861 Sherman insisted that he be relieved. [...] He was promptly replaced by Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell and transferred to St. Louis, Missouri. [...] In December, he was put on leave by Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, commander of the Department of the Missouri, who considered him unfit for duty. [...] Sherman went to Lancaster, Ohio, to recuperate. [...] While he was at home, his wife Ellen wrote to his brother, Senator John Sherman, seeking advice. [...] She complained of [...] "that melancholy insanity to <b>which</b> <b>your</b> family is subject".

500|$|Todd {{found the}} pack's {{difficulty}} to be [...] "wildly careening" [...] and stated, [...] "Some battles are amazingly easy. You can soar through many scraps in moments, with your party carving up the opposition {{before you can}} tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... There {{are more than a}} couple of moments in the game in <b>which</b> <b>your</b> party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can even think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait till you see how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E

500|$|Even by the {{standards}} of the British Army, the Regiment (and the 1st Battalion in particular) seems to have gained a reputation during the First World War for profane language. When the 1st Battalion was relieved in the front line following its defence of Delville Wood in September 1916, one of the advanced posts was missed out by mistake. The Lance-Corporal in command, suspecting something was amiss, sent a man back to the front-line trench to investigate. The soldier realised he was at some risk of being shot by his own side, and so [...] "when he had crawled within shouting distance he enquired politely but firmly what —— bastards were holding that —— trench. The 9th East Surreys, who were the troops thus addressed, recognised the North Stafford idiom and let him in unhurt". Bernard Martin, who served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 1st Battalion, records another incident which probably took place in 1917, when (very unusually) the battalion was addressed at a church parade by a general, who railed against [...] "the disgusting word many of you utter every time you speak. ... I tell you again this indecent word is not to be used any longer. It is so common amongst you that it has become the shameful nickname by <b>which</b> <b>your</b> battalion is known throughout my Division".
