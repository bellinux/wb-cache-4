We're {{really looking forward to}} it as {{there are going to be}} lots of costume changes.

Daybreaker balances all three <b>with</b> <b>pretty</b> much perfect dexterity." [...] Raziq Rauf writing for the BBC praised the band for the album's musical diversity with its use of electronic songs like album-opener [...] "The Bitter End" [...] and the band's use of technicality and melody in songs. He summarised the album by saying, [...] "Daybreaker is a great album. It’ll go down as one of Architects’ finest worksit’s certainly their most well-rounded release to date." [...] Big Cheese writer Paul Hagen praised the album's lyrical content, saying, [...] "Socially turbulent times seems to produce the best music and if bands can keep channelling genuine anger into their art, {{there are going to be}} some more really great albums released over the next few years".|$|E

500|$|The canons were seldom {{used for}} the {{intended}} purpose. However, {{they were used to}} provide gun salute every year {{on the occasion of the}} birthday of Kamehameha III. Another notable daily event at the fort was the beating of the drums at dusk by guards as a signal (a curfew) to the sailors on land to go back to their ships. This practice is recorded in detail by Jones as: [...] "Seamen are obliged to be clear of the beach at drumbeat—eight o'clock in the evening. [...] No person is allowed to remain on shore over night, unless furnished with a proper pass by the captain of the port; and any one found on the beach, or in the town, with no pass, after the proper time, is marched to the calboose, where he is kept in confinement till morning, and then muleted in a pretty round sum for breaking the laws. [...] This is generally paid by the captain, and afterward, <b>with</b> <b>pretty</b> good interest, deducted from Jack's pay." ...|$|E
500|$|Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic {{wondered}} how [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] isn't a Black Eyed Peas song, and further commented that [...] "for every ill-advised will.i.am guest spot ... there’s an out-of-left field flute ... solo that actually works." [...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times considered the song"one unfortunate collaboration," [...] while saying Spears [...] "herself could beat [...] in a rap battle." [...] Similarly, Eric R. Danton of the Hartford Courant deemed the [...] "banal" [...] song as [...] "characteristically vapid, with a refrain that quickly progresses from inane to annoying." [...] Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail wrote that [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is a [...] "verseless tune", and commented that [...] " [...] {{thought it would}} be fun to make [...] sound like Rihanna" [...] on the song. Braulio Lorentz of Billboard Brasil said that [...] "even will.i.am can't save [...] " [...] with [...] "Big Fat Bass". The Idolator staff noted that the song has [...] "all the strengths and weaknesses of your average Black Eyed Peas tune — it’s catchy but repetitive, danceable <b>with</b> <b>pretty</b> inconsequential lyrics, and has the potential to become annoying if played too frequently." ...|$|E
500|$|Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times {{said that}} the program {{delivered}} what she described as a [...] "blood bath," [...] and Aaron Rutzkoff of The Wall Street Journal further analyzed that the episode followed a dark and frenetic convention [...] "with flare." [...] The Washington Post commentator Jen Chaney opined that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] evoked elements of various films of George Romero, {{as well as the}} historical epic film Gone with the Wind (1939). Writing for Paste, Josh Jackson issued the episode an 8.8 out of 10 rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. [...] "'Beside the Dying Fire' wasted no time getting straight to the action, assuming a season’s worth of character development was more than enough." [...] The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan echoed synonymous sentiments, ultimately declaring that the telecast was the best since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye." [...] Ryan summated: [...] "The first two acts of The Walking Dead Season 2 finale were full of excitement, honest to God suspense and characters who came up <b>with</b> <b>pretty</b> decent plans on the fly. When the braaaains finally hit the fan at Hershel Greene's farm, my pulse quickened and I found myself wondering and even caring about the survival of characters who'd done little more than irritate me for weeks."

500|$|Murdock {{begins the}} season {{wearing a black}} costume (called the [...] "vigilante outfit" [...] by production), {{inspired}} by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller's The Man Without Fear, rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops. Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications. On the design process, DeKnight revealed that [...] "we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented {{with a lot of}} different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right." [...] DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the [...] "real-world" [...] of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit. Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to [...] "look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up <b>with</b> <b>pretty</b> practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store." [...] Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that [...] "really conform to his head" [...] but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{objected to}} the show's usage of {{violence}} by dressing it <b>with</b> <b>pretty</b> photography. Others complained that the show relied more on visual aspects and music than on coherent stories and fully drawn characters. Civic leaders in Miami have also {{objected to the}} show's airing of the city's crime problems all across America. Most civic leaders, however, have been placated due to the show's estimated contribution of $1 million per episode to the city's economy and boosting tourism to Miami. Gerald S. Arenberg of the National Association of Chiefs of Police criticized the show's glamorous depiction of vice squads, saying [...] "no real vice cops chase drug dealers in a Ferrari while wearing $600 suits. More often than not, they're {{holed up in a}} crummy room somewhere, wearing jeans with holes in them, watching some beat-up warehouse in a godforsaken part of town through a pair of dented binoculars".|$|E

[...] "t's not that X3 is a bad game, or that it isn't fun - it just isn't done."

2500|$|Harold Lowe {{was born}} in Eglwys Rhos, Conwy, [...] Wales on 21 November 1882, the fourth of eight children, born to George and Harriet Lowe. His father had ambitions {{for him to be}} apprenticed to a {{successful}} Liverpool businessman, but Harold Lowe was determined to go to sea. At 14, he ran away from his home in Barmouth where he had attended school and joined the Merchant Navy, serving along the West African Coast. Lowe started as a Ship's Boy aboard the Welsh coastal schooners as he worked to attain his certifications. In 1906, he passed his certification and gained his second mate's certificate, then in 1908, he attained his first mate's certificate. By the time he started with the White Star Line, in 1911, he had gained his Master's certificate and, in his own words, [...] "experience <b>with</b> <b>pretty</b> well every ship afloat – the different classes of ships afloat – from the schooner to the square-rigged sailing vessel, and from that to steamships, and of all sizes." [...] He served as third officer on White Star's the Belgic and the Tropic before being transferred to the Titanic as Fifth Officer in 1912. Despite his numerous years at sea, however, the maiden voyage of the Titanic was to be his first transatlantic crossing.|$|E
2500|$|Black's oral {{arguments}} were heard June 5, 2008, by {{a three-judge panel}} of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Andrew Frey argued that Black and his co-defendants did not steal from Hollinger when they authorized individual non-competition payments. Frey asserted that the monies were [...] "management fees" [...] and that Hollinger International shareholders were not hurt by the payments. Appeals judge Richard Posner said, [...] "The bulk of the evidence [...] has to do <b>with</b> <b>pretty</b> naked fraud." [...] Posner was skeptical about defense arguments that Black did not obstruct justice by removing boxes from his Toronto office, commenting, [...] "The timing was bizarre, {{the removal of the}} documents {{in the middle of an}} investigation." [...] Three weeks later, on June 25, 2008, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions. and rejected all of the arguments raised by the defense. The circuit court found that [...] "the evidence established a conventional fraud, that is, a theft of money or other property from Hollinger by misrepresentations and misleading omissions..." [...] The panel affirmed the jury's findings stating that, [...] "It is not as if Black had merely been using his power as controlling shareholder to elect a rubber-stamp board of directors or to approve a merger favorable to him at the expense of the minority shareholders ... He was acting in his capacity as the CEO of Hollinger when he ordered (Mark) Kipnis to draft the covenants not to compete and when he duped the audit committee and submitted a false 10-K." [...] Black, for his part, maintained the form in question was simply improperly, and not falsely, submitted.|$|E
