Subsequently, Sheet Steel officers agreed on July 13, 1901 to recognize the union at 18 of the company's 23 nonunion plants. But AA president T.J. Shaffer rejected the deal; after having demanded the unionization of every Sheet Steel plant, he would not be satisfied with anything less. A meeting between Morgan and Shaffer (accompanied by AA secretary John Williams) resulted in an additional <b>wage</b> <b>agreement.</b> But this <b>wage</b> <b>agreement,</b> which covered only the existing unionized plants, was rejected by the AA executive board.|$|E

30|$|In Germany, {{industrial}} relations {{used to be}} dominated by collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> between industry wide unions and employers’ associations. This system has become less stable, mainly due to increasing competition from “outsiders”—firms and unions outside the industry-wide agreement. Recent developments such as firm’s abandonment of collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> (“Tarifflucht”) or increasing competition between (or plurality of) different <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> (“Tarifkonkurrenz” or “Tarifpluralität”) have become important topics in the ongoing debate on the future of German labour market institutions. This development is reflected by changes to laws and new fields of government action. For instance, minimum wage laws have recently been introduced for some sectors, and the Law on Collective <b>Wage</b> <b>Agreements</b> (“Tarifvertragsgesetz”) has been amended.|$|R

25|$|At {{a meeting}} on August 3, 1901, Morgan refused to renegotiate the <b>wage</b> <b>agreement.</b> It had been agreed to by Shaffer and Williams, and he {{considered}} it binding. The AA executive board ordered Shaffer to call a strike, to begin on August 10. The strike was crushed. At several plants, workers refused to turn out at all. Union members in Illinois and Pennsylvania turned out in small numbers. Unionized facilities at the National Steel and National Tube subsidiaries turned out almost to a man, but the overall effect on U.S. Steel was too weak. Strikebreakers were pouring into plants by the thousands, and shuttered works were reopening. Shaffer appealed to Samuel Gompers, asking for American Federation of Labor support and the calling of a national labor conference to make the strike the federation's main issue. Gompers refused.|$|E

A three-year <b>wage</b> <b>agreement</b> was reached with the trade unions to keep costs down, and the company raised additional capital in an initial public offering and subsequent listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 10 January 1994. After the listing, Braganza retained 69% of the company. On 1 April, service frequencies increased on the Oslo–Bergen route and the airline introduced direct flights from Oslo to Tromsø and Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes, later supplemented with direct services to Bodø. The following two years, Braathens SAFE also introduced scheduled international flights to Rome, as well as summer routes to Jersey and Nice. However, Braathens SAFE terminated their routes from Bergen to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, making the passengers switch planes in Trondheim. Braathens signed agreements with many of Norway's large companies in 1995 in exchange for large discounts.|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} empirical {{evidence for the}} economic rationality of wage rigidities. Theoretically wage rigidities can result from contracts, implicit contracts, from efficiency wages and from insider-outsider behaviour. Based on a survey of 801 firms strong support has been found for explanations based on collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> and on efficency wages as well. Collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> and implicit contracts are important reasons for wage rigidities for the low skilled.

Certain of united political backing and almost universal public support, Palmer obtained an injunction on October 31 and 400,000 coal workers struck the next day. He claimed the President authorized the action, following a meeting with the severely ill President in the presence of his doctor. Palmer also asserted that the entire Cabinet had backed his request for an injunction. That infuriated Secretary of Labor Wilson who had opposed Palmer's plan and supported Gompers' view of the President's promises when the Act was under consideration. The rift between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor was never healed, which had consequences the next year when Palmer's attempts to deport radicals were frustrated by the Department of Labor.|$|E

Using establishment data from the German employment statistics, the paper demonstrates that the divergence between <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> and effective <b>wages</b> is probably not a consequence of a massive escape from collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements,</b> or the intense use of opt-out clauses in such agreements in East Germany.

But in a surprise vote, Teamster members rejected the new <b>wage</b> <b>agreement</b> 94,086 to 13,082—easily reaching the two-thirds majority necessarily to reject a contract under the Teamster constitution.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the importance of}} wage staggering and wage leadership in the Austrian system of collective bargaining. Collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> in Austria generally remain valid for one year and are staggered; the highest concentrations of new agreements {{can be found in}} the months of January, May and November each year. The relevant literature describes Austrian wage bargaining as a system of wage leadership, with the agreement reached by the metal workers, which usually goes into effect in early November of each year, setting a precedent for <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> reached by other sectors in the ensuing months. Through an analysis of detailed individual series from the Index of Agreed Minimum Wages, it is actually possible to provide empirical evidence for the existence of wage leadership. The results also show that the wage-leading metal sector is substantially more sensitive to macroeconomic forecasts than the other sectors are. This phenomenon and the rapid transmission to the sectors that follow are probably key reasons why empirical evidence of high real wage flexibility has been found in Austria. staggered wage contracts, wage leadership, collective <b>wage</b> <b>agreements,</b> Austria...|$|R

40|$|Material Abstract This thesis reconsiders the 3 rd century A.

D. 235 and 305. The importance of this research {{is that this is a}} period that is typically described as a time of crisis and inflation. This research therefore explores how private <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> and rates responded to the debasement of the Alexandrian tetradrachm between A. D. 235 and the reforms of Aurelian in 274 / 5; it then examines private viticulture-labour and general labour agreements to determine how <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> responded to the reforms of Aurelian in A. D. 274 / 5, and the changes to currency that occurred between A. D. 274 / 5 and A. D. 299. Private labour agreements between A. D. 300 and 305 are then examined {{to determine if there}} is any evidence for inflation, and to establish how wages responded to the A. D. Edict of Maximum Prices. Finally the research examines wheat prices between A. D. 235 and 305 to determine how these prices responded to the changes in the currency and the buying power of labourer wages during the study period. 	The results will demonstrate that between A. D. 235 and A. D. 274 / 5 private <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> did not increase in response to the debasement of the Alexandrian tetradrachm. They will also demonstrate that between A. D. 274 / 5 and A. D. 299 the reforms of Aurelian saw a doubling in value of the tetradrachm, and that wages remained stable reflecting this doubling until c. A. D 286. The results will then show that the introduction of the nummus saw the continued use of older debased tetradrachms, and that this necessitated the upward revaluation of the nummus to ensure its use as a replacement to the tetradrachm. Moreover the revaluation reduced the number of nummi paid in <b>wage</b> <b>agreements</b> to mid 3 rd century rates both in terms of the coins, and the amount of silver exchanged. Finally the research will demonstrate that wheat prices per artaba reflected the revaluation of the currency, and not inflation; and that prices remained stable until A. D. 305...|$|R
