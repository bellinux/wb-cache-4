5|$|Reyes' numerology {{theories}} {{do not go}} down well at the FBI, but {{the pattern}} of the killings, when viewed on a map, seem to line up as the number six (6). After looking at the pictures of the victims, Scully realizes that the pattern on the victims was not three circles, but instead, three sixes, the mark of the devil. Meanwhile, Wayno has several additional run-ins with the mysterious man, <b>who</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> give cryptic advice.|$|E
5|$|Commander T'Pol and Commander Tucker remain captives of Paxton, <b>who</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> {{broadcast}} his {{demand on}} all channels and frequencies. Paxton's action has an unsettling {{effect on the}} interspecies conference since {{it is clear that}} not all humans support it. On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner to learn that the child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian gene therapy to treat himself). Seeking to fine-tune their attack, Paxton then threatens T'Pol to force Tucker to optimize the targeting system of the array.|$|E

Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Karen Filippelli exploit Dwight's paranoia, and pretend that Jim was bitten by the bat and {{is turning into}} a vampire. Jim calls animal control, but Dwight insists on catching the bat himself even after 5:00 passes and the other employees go home, save Meredith <b>who</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> hide in the breakroom for fear of the bat. Dwight eventually catches the bat with a garbage bag after it lands on Meredith's head.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th century, {{the castle}} became {{increasingly}} valued for its hunting facilities {{rather than its}} military defences. It fell into disrepair and, despite {{the construction of new}} living quarters and service facilities, {{by the middle of the}} 16th century it was derelict. Henry VIII sold the property to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, and most of the castle buildings were demolished. It was not until the 19th century, when Mary and Fulke Greville Howard inherited the property, that the castle was renovated and restored. Victorian scholars examined the site, and it was opened to the public. In 1958 the castle passed into the custody of the state, which carried out further stabilisation work and a programme of archaeological investigation. In 1998 English Heritage passed the management of the site back to its current owner, Baron Howard of Rising, <b>who</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> operate the castle as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{has made}} a name for himself working on X-Files—unexplained cases which may be paranormal in origin. He is {{appointed}} a partner in these investigations—Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)—with his superiors hoping that she will be able to debunk and discredit his work. Their first case together is the investigation of possible abductions in Oregon, which falters when their evidence is destroyed in a fire. A later case, involving the disappearance of a United States Air Force test pilot, sees the introduction of secretive informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin), <b>who</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> provide the agents sensitive information. This help is supplemented by conspiracy theorist group The Lone Gunmen, who are contacted for help in a further abduction case. Deep Throat is soon killed, however, when he helps the agents uncover details of a government human cloning program, and the X-Files unit is closed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., Agent Fox Mulder appears {{before an}} FBI panel {{regarding}} {{his experiences in}} Antarctica. Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that he and Scully have been denied reassignment to the division. Mulder goes to his former basement office, {{only to discover that}} Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) have been assigned to the X-Files. Going against orders, Mulder and Scully track down an escaped alien in Phoenix, Arizona while Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) gives chase. Mulder and Scully eventually discover that Cigarette Smoking Man has been using Gibson Praise to locate the creature. Scully brings Gibson to the hospital, where it is determined that he has the alien virus in his blood. Later, Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection.

5|$|The season four premiere {{introduces}} {{several new}} interns, {{to be trained}} under Meredith, Yang, Karev, Stevens, and eventually O'Malley. Among them are Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul) <b>who</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> make appearances, and Dr. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) who formed a friendship with Meredith while the two were in college. Harris is fired in the fifth season, due to not actually having a medical degree, and departs the show immediately after. Meredith and Shepherd's relationship reaches a toll, and the two separate, leading Shepherd to entertaining a relationship with Rose (Lauren Stamile), a nurse. Rose appears frequently until season five, when Derek and Meredith decide to rekindle their flame. Throughout the fifth season, Stevens experiences full-out hallucinations of Duquette, signaling that she is ill, and once she is lucid, he departs, marking his final appearance. Following the announcement of her relationship with Robbins, Callie's father Carlos Torres (Hector Elizondo) initially contests his daughter's concurrence in homosexuality, but eventually accepts it, and he reappears several times throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., Mulder appears {{before an}} FBI panel {{regarding}} {{his experiences in}} Antarctica, but is later denied reassignment to the X-Files division: Mulder and Scully {{have been replaced by}} Spender and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers).

Davis) reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Fowley forcibly takes Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to a Centers for Disease Control facility at Fort Marlene. Meanwhile, the Syndicate rendezvous at a check point, preparing to be taken away by the Colonists, who are prepping for invasion. However, they are met by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandra—save The Smoking Man and Fowley, who escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E
5|$|The game's opening sees Ringford {{holding the}} Cauldron and its {{controlling}} ring Titrel, having been given Titrel by Ingway {{as part of}} his vengeance against Odin. Elfaria is ultimately killed by Odin, who takes Titrel from her. Velvet steals it in turn and gives it to the dragon Wagner, hoping that this would prevent the Cauldron being used. Her lover Cornelius is meanwhile changed into a Pooka by Ingway and thrown into the Netherworld, escaping with the aid of his grandfather Gallon. He learns that the people of Valentine share his curse, and is embroiled in both the Pookas' efforts to collect wish-granting coins to reverse their condition and his attempts to save Velvet from danger. The Three Wise Men are attempting to fulfill the prophecies of the Armageddon — all but one Wise Man are killed {{during the course of the}} story, while the third Beldor is afflicted with the Pooka's curse and gains subsequent immortality. Cornelius rescues Velvet from their clutches, and despite his fears she reaffirms her love for him in his new form. Several characters also encounter King Valentine, <b>who</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> be tormented by memories of murdering Velvet's mother in a rage — {{as part of his}} scheme to trigger the Armageddon, he hatches the dragon Leventhan.|$|E
