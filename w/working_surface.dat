For the apex seals, the choice of materials has evolved along with the experience gained, from carbon alloys, to steel, ferrotic, and other materials. The combination between housing plating and apex and side seals materials was determined experimentally, to obtain the best duration of both seals and housing cover. For the shaft, steel alloys with little deformation on load are preferred, the use of Maraging steel has been proposed for this.|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation on blood, saliva, semen, and naked DNA samples for preventing DNA cross-contamination on <b>working</b> <b>surfaces</b> in laboratories. Methods Blood, saliva, semen, and DNA isolated from buccal swab samples were obtained from a single male donor and applied to the laboratory <b>working</b> <b>surfaces.</b> UVC radiation was applied to these diluted and undiluted samples with or without previous decontamination of the <b>working</b> <b>surfaces</b> with 10 % sodium hypochlorite and 20 % ethanol. Genomic DNA was extracted using Chelex. After quantification, DNA was amplified using the AmpFlSTR® NGM™ PCR Amplification Kit. We tested and statistically analyzed DNA concentration, UVC dose, sample volume, radiation time, the number of correctly detected alleles on genetic loci, {{and the number of}} correctly detected alleles in four groups in which 16 loci were divided. Results When <b>working</b> <b>surfaces</b> were not decontaminated and were treated only with UVC radiation in the laboratory, the genetic profile for naked DNA could not be obtained after 2 minutes of UVC radiation and for saliva after 54 hours. For blood and semen, a partial genetic profile was obtained even after 250 hours of UVC radiation in the laminar. When <b>working</b> <b>surfaces</b> were decontaminated with 10 % sodium hypochlorite and 20 % ethanol, genetic profile could not be obtained for naked DNA after 2 minutes, for saliva after 4 hours, for blood after 16 hours, and for semen after 8 hours of UVC radiation in the laboratory. Conclusion It is recommended to carefully and thoroughly clean <b>working</b> <b>surfaces</b> with 10 % sodium hypochlorite and 20 % ethanol followed by minimal 16 -hour UVC exposure (dose approximately 4380 mJ/cm 2) for complete and successful decontamination...|$|R

The design of composite frames has been developed for performing exact centering of lenses at assembly for the various options of their deployment in the frames.

2500|$|Problems arose during {{research}} in the 1950s and 1960s. For a while, engineers were faced with what they called [...] "chatter marks" [...] and [...] "devil's scratch" [...] in the inner epitrochoid surface. They discovered that the cause was the apex seals reaching a resonating vibration, and the problem was solved by reducing the thickness and weight of apex seals. Scratches disappeared after the introduction of more compatible materials for seals and housing coatings. Another early problem was the build-up of cracks in the stator surface near the plug hole, which was eliminated by installing the spark plugs in a separate metal insert/ copper sleeve in the housing, instead of plug being screwed directly into the block housing. Toyota found that substituting a glow-plug for the leading site spark plug improved low rpm, part load, specific fuel consumption by 7%, and also emissions and idle. A later alternative solution to spark plug boss cooling was provided with a variable coolant velocity scheme for water-cooled rotaries, which has had widespread use, being patented by Curtiss-Wright, with the last-listed for better air-cooled engine spark plug boss cooling. These approaches did not require a high-conductivity copper insert, but did not preclude its use. Ford tested a rotary engine with the plugs placed in the side plates, {{instead of the usual}} placement in the housing <b>working</b> <b>surface</b> ( [...] , 1978).|$|E

In this paper, we present an analytic model describing the effect of a toroidal magnetic field on the internal <b>working</b> <b>surfaces</b> that result from a variability in the ejection velocity. We find that for parameters appropriate for HH jets the forces associated with the magnetic field dominate over the gas pressure force within the <b>working</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Depending on the ram pressure radial cross section of the jet, the magnetic field can produce a strong axial pinch, or, alternatively, a broadening of the internal <b>working</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We check the validity of the analytic model with axisymmetric numerical simulations of variable, magnetized jets.
