In particular, chromium dioxide has a half-metal characteristic that holds the potential for reducing the heat produced from reading or writing memory bits. To reliably control the motion of domain walls, CrO 2 nanowires are created with geometric anisotropy that acts as a potential well to ”pin” domain walls to fixed sites. Each wire was grown using selective-area growth to avoid the creation of random pinning sites from crystal disorder. This process is sensitive to many different factors {{in the creation of the}} SiO 2 mask. Different effects can interfere with each other, including the proximity effect from electron beam lithography and a sensitivity to the levels of oxygen in the doped SiO 2. This thesis presents methods of correction for individual effects, as well as initial results of domain wall mechanics in CrO 2 nanowires.

The work presented here aims to combine established &# 039;top-down&# 039; device processing with &# 039;bottom-up&# 039; engineered cluster assembly. Conducting cluster deposition and standard optical fabrication techniques have been used to produce wires on a textured (V-grooved) substrate. The lengths of the <b>wires</b> (<b>ranging</b> from 2 µm to 1 mm) are defined simply by the separation of NiCr/Au contacts. The deposited nanoparticles range in size from 20 - 100 nm and in principle define the width of the nanowire. In-situ conductance measurement allows precise control of the deposition process and the onset of conduction in the wire is readily monitored as a function of deposition time. The effectiveness of the surface templating technique is demonstrated by SEM and AFM imaging carried out after deposition. The surface coverage is seen to vary from 100 % at the apexes of the V-grooves used to promote growth of the wire. Self assembly of the nanoparticles leads to completion of a wire between the pre-formed contacts with no possibility of a parasitic conduction path.

X-ray diffraction and image analysis techniques were used to quantify the degree of vertical orientation of the microwires. The degree of vertical alignment and the minimum field strength required for alignment were evaluated {{as a function of the}} wire length, coating thickness, magnetic history, and substrate surface properties. Nearly 100 % of 100 μm long, 2 μm diameter, Si microwires that had been coated with 300 nm of Ni could be vertically aligned by a 300 G magnetic field. For <b>wires</b> <b>ranging</b> from 40 to 60 μm in length, as the length of the wire increased, a higher degree of alignment was observed at lower field strengths, consistent with an increase in the available magnetic torque. Microwires that had been exposed to a magnetic sweep up to 300 G remained magnetized and, therefore, aligned more readily during subsequent magnetic field alignment sweeps. Alignment of the Ni-coated Si microwires occurred at lower field strengths on hydrophilic Si substrates than on hydrophobic Si substrates.

40|$|International audienceBackground and purpose: Pore density (PD), surface metal {{coverage}} (SMC) and {{the number}} of wires are all different parameters which can influence the efficacy of a flow disruptor/diverter. Nevertheless, the relative importance of a parameter to induce intra-aneurysmal blood stasis is still poorly evaluated. Therefore, comparison between devices based on a unique value is not reliable. The aim {{of this study was to}} propose a new bench top parameter (the pressure reduction coefficient (PRC;)) in order to assess the global haemodynamic effect of each flow diverter/disruptor to slow flow. Methods: Eight devices were tested in vitro during three different flow conditions. For the eight devices, the PRC was computed at different volumetric flow rates to characterise flow reduction. Comparison was made with SMC, PD {{and the number}} of wires. Results: The PRC obtained for flow disruptors was on average 1. 5 times more efficient in reducing flow compared to flow diverters. PD (mm 2) ranged from 24 to 38 for flow diverters and did not independently correlate with the PRC. The SMC of flow diverters ranged from 25 % to 70 %, and ranged from 20 % to 100 % for flow disruptors, without independent correlation to the PRC.

The modulation transfer function (MTF) of the DBT projections was measured with a 1 mm thick steel edge, showing a strong anisotropy (30 - 40 % lower MTF 0. 5 frequencies in the tube travel direction). The in-plane MTF 0. 5, measured with a 25 mum tungsten <b>wire,</b> <b>ranges</b> from 1. 3 to 1. 8 lp/mm in the tube-travel direction and between 2. 4 and 3. 7 lp/mm in the chest wall-nipple.

In-depth resolution of the planes, via the full width at half maximum (FWHM) from the point spread function of a 25 mum tungsten wire, is not only influenced by angular range and yields 1. 3 - 4. 6 mm among systems. The artifact spread function from 1 mm diameter tungsten beads depends mainly on angular range, yielding two tendencies whether large (FWHM is 4. 5 mm) or small (FWHM is 10 mm) angular range is used.
