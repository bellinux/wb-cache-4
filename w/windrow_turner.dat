50|$|To {{properly}} use {{a compost}} <b>windrow</b> <b>turner,</b> it is ideal to compost {{on a hard}} surfaced pad. Heavy-duty compost windrow turners allow the user to obtain optimum results with the aerobic hot composting process. By using four wheel drive or tracks the <b>windrow</b> <b>turner</b> is capable of turning compost in windrows located in remote locations. With a self-trailering option this allows the compost <b>windrow</b> <b>turner</b> to convert itself into a trailer to be pulled by a semi-truck tractor. These two options combined allow the compost <b>windrow</b> <b>turner</b> to be easily hauled anywhere and to work compost windrows in muddy and wet locations.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of composting of grape pomace in strip compost piles. The three variants of compost piles formed from grape pomace and vegetables waste, wood chips and mature in varying proportions were tested. Turning of piles was performed using <b>windrow</b> <b>turner</b> PKS 2. 8, in which the achieved performance was monitored. On the performance of <b>windrow</b> <b>turner</b> has a significant influence also cross section or width and height of turning piles and the bulk density of ingredients including their moisture. In evaluating, {{attention has been paid to}} assessment of selected parameters (temperature, moisture content) of the composting process. From the viewpoint of temperature course, the highest temperature reached at the piles in Var. I (64. 1 °C) and Var. II (55. 3 °C). Moisture of compost piles in the individual variants did not differ significantly and ranged between 25 – 35 %...|$|E

5000|$|Compost <b>windrow</b> <b>turners</b> were {{developed}} to produce compost {{on a large scale}} by Fletcher Sims Jr. of Canyon, Texas [...] They are traditionally a large machine that straddles a windrow of 4 feet (1.25 meters) or more high, by as much as 12 feet (3.5 meters) across. Although smaller machines exist for small windrows, most operations use large machines for volume production. Turners drive through the windrow at a slow rate of forward movement. They have a steel drum with paddles that are rapidly turning. As the turner moves through the windrow, fresh air (oxygen) is injected into the compost by the drum/paddle assembly, and waste gases produced by bacterial decomposition are vented. The oxygen feeds the aerobic bacteria and thus speeds the composting process.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} compost production yields as {{a percent}} of raw product mix using poultry litter, poultry processing plant dissolved air flotation skimmings, sawdust, wood chips and ground yard debris. Three different mixes were used and identified as Mixes 1, 2 and 3. Mixes 1 and 2 were produced using windrows and a <b>windrow</b> <b>turner</b> and Mix 3 was made using a covered in-channel compost turner. Mixes 1 and 2 were poultry litter compost with a screened mass yield of 80 and 77 percent, respectively. Mix 3 was a dissolved air flotation compost with a screened mass yield of 40 percent. Results from plant experiments show poultry litter compost can be used successfully in potting mixes for poinsettia and chrysanthemum production. A compost produced from dissolved air flotation skimmings, a poultry processing waste, can be used in field corn production but had little influence in the production of soybeans. Zntroduction Compost facility managers need to understand the amount of compost produced from a given amount of ingredients or yield they will have for sale. Bench-scale laborator...|$|E
40|$|The main wet {{market in}} Selangor i. e. Selangor Wholesale Market has a daily {{generation}} of 15 tonnes of organic waste which was disposed {{off into a}} sanitary landfill, approximately 8 km away from the market. When the landfill ceased its operation, transportation and landfilling cost escalated to approximately USD 20 (RM 80) per tonne from USD 10 (RM 35). The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the possibility of converting the organic component of the wet market waste into organic fertilizer through a large-scale composting. Fruits and vegetables were shredded into 5 cm to 7 cm and mixed with goat manure at a ratio of 3 : 1. Daily mixing was conducted using a specially manufactured <b>windrow</b> <b>turner</b> during the first week of composting to remove excess moisture. The temperature profile obtained indicated an increase from 400 C to 700 C after approximately 2 weeks of the compost set –up. The compost generated has a C/N value of 17. 6 with a reduction of 50 % while P was at 0. 692 mg/kg. The K and Mg content were 0. 52 mg/kg and 0. 45 mg/kg, respectively. The success of the study indicates the possibility to convert the organic component of the wet market waste into compost with approximately 60 % volume reduction...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversion}} of biodegradable waste from landfill is of key importance {{in developing a}} sustainable waste strategy {{for the next decade}} and beyond. The proliferation of waste treatment technologies such as mechanical biological treatment, anaerobic digestion and composting will be paramount in achieving this strategic goal. Composting plant is one of the end technology, which is widely used in waste processing of the biodegradable waste. These wastes originate from the maintenance of green areas in the cities and the municipalities and from the separatelly collected biodegradable waste from the citizens. There is also possible to process other biodegradable materials whose origin may be in other technologies of waste management at the composting plant. The most commonly used technology of composting is windrow system. Technological operations, which are necessary for the proper conduct of the composting process, may have negative influence on the environment in the immediate vicinity of composting plant. As pollutants we can mark particular odor and microorganisms. The largest group of microorganisms in the monitored air were psychrophilic and mesophilic bacteria and microscopic thermotolerant fungi. The amount of thermophillic actinomycetes ranged from 10 to 84. 000 CFU∙m− 3 (colony forming units per m 3). Furthermore, it was confirmed that the maximum air contamination has been found during aeration of <b>windrow</b> by compost <b>turner</b> and during the sieving of the mature compost. For each indicator, the increase in concentrations due to the turning of compost windrow as compared to the background concentration obtained in natural environments and upwind of composting plants was determined. At a distance of 150 [*]m from the composting plant, only low numbers of indicator organisms at a regular occurrence in the air has been found...|$|R
