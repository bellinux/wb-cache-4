5|$|Port Austin is the {{location}} of the historical northern terminus of US25. Through town, M-25 turns north along Lake Street and runs concurrently with the northern end of M-53. The highway turns westward on Port Austin Road along the lake where M-53 terminates; this is also the point where the M-25 signage changes from northbound to westbound. West of town, M-25 turns south along the Saginaw Bay and meets Port Crescent State Park. From here south west, M-25 hugs the bay and its miles of beaches. North of Caseville is the Albert E. Sleeper State Park. Through Caseville, M-25 uses Main Street and passes the city beach off State Street. McKinley is home to the Scenic Golf & Country Club and <b>Wild</b> <b>Fowl</b> Bay. M-25 follows the shore of <b>Wild</b> <b>Fowl</b> Bay, a smaller bay off Saginaw Bay, to the city of Bay Port and the western terminus of M-142 on Fairhaven a smaller community south of Bay Port. From here south, the road is called Unionville Road and turns inland to Sebewaing.|$|E

The area between the <b>Wild</b> <b>Fowl</b> Pond and former Deer Paddock {{on the east side}} of the park, situated across the East Drive from the Menagerie, was chosen as the site for the new zoo. Architect Embury designed a half circle of six brick buildings centered on a seal pool.

Marketplace vendors sold meat from domesticated animals such as goats, sheep, pigs and fowl as well as exotic meat including partridge, hare, <b>wild</b> <b>fowl</b> and boar. People found indoor amusement by attending wrestling matches (Kusti) or watching animals fight such as cock fights and ram fights or by gambling. Horse racing was a popular outdoor past time. In addition to these leisurely activities, festivals and fairs were frequent and entertainment by traveling troupes of acrobats, dancers, dramatists and musicians was often provided.|$|E

50|$|At some point, {{it became}} {{customary}} for game pies {{to be served}} cold. An enormous game pie was made for the Earl of Sefton {{in the first part}} of the 19th century to be presented to the corporation of Liverpool.

The meats were first cooked, then cooled with ice and placed in a huge pastry shell with a crust, which was further cooked for three hours. After pouring a hot aspic sauce into the pie through a funnel, it was allowed to cool again for two days before being served cold. The 1845 cookbook The practical cook, English and foreign describes similar game pies of chickens, pigeons, partridges, hares, rabbits, pheasants, gray plovers, grouse, <b>wild</b> <b>fowls</b> or small birds, which may have slices of ham added. With all of these, calf's foot jelly or the bone of a knuckle of veal stewed down to a jelly was added to form aspic when the pie was cooled.
