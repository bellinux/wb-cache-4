40|$|Background. Any {{decrease}} in friction between orthodontic <b>wire</b> and <b>bracket</b> can accelerate tooth {{movement in the}} sliding technique and result in better control of anchorage. This study was carried out to evaluate frictional forces by coating orthodontic <b>wires</b> and porcelain <b>brackets</b> with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO). Methods. In this in vitro study, we evaluated a combination of 120 samples of 0. 019 × 0. 025 stainless steel (SS) orthodontic wires and 22 mil system edgewise porcelain brackets with and without spherical zinc oxide nanoparticles. Spherical ZnO nanoparticles were deposited on <b>wires</b> and <b>brackets</b> by immersing them in ethanol solution and SEM (scanning electron microscope) evaluation confirmed {{the presence of the}} ZnO coating. The frictional forces were calculated between the <b>wires</b> and <b>brackets</b> in four groups: group ZZ (coated <b>wire</b> and <b>bracket),</b> group OO (uncoated <b>wire</b> and <b>bracket),</b> group ZO (coated <b>wire</b> and uncoated <b>bracket)</b> and group OZ (uncoated <b>wire</b> and coated <b>bracket).</b> Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for data analysis. Results. The frictional force in ZZ (3. 07 ± 0. 4 N) was the highest (P < 0. 05), and OZ (2. 18 ± 0. 5 N) had the lowest amount of friction (P < 0. 05) among the groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} frictional forces between the ZO and OO groups (2. 65 ± 0. 2 and 2. 70 ± 0. 2 N, respectively). Conclusion. Coating of porcelain bracket surfaces with ZnO nanoparticles can decrease friction in the sliding technique, and wire coating combined with bracket coating is not recommended due to its effect on friction...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} friction coefficient between <b>brackets</b> and <b>wires</b> of different materials under conditions simulating the oral environment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Stainless steel (SS) and titanium-molybdenum alloy (TMA) wires of 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in diameter (American Orthodontics) and polycarbonate bracket (American Orthodontics), ceramic bracket (American Orthodontics), and metal bracket (3 M Unitek) with slots of 0. 022 x 0. 030 -in were used. The friction coefficient was assessed by means of mechanical traction with the system immersed in artificial saliva. The mean roughness of both <b>wire</b> surface and <b>bracket</b> slots was evaluated by using a surface profilometer. RESULTS: The system using TMA <b>wire</b> and polycarbonate <b>bracket</b> had the highest roughness (p< 0. 05).

50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} used {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles, endodontic files in root canal therapy, metal posts in root canal-treated teeth, temporary crowns and crowns for deciduous teeth, and arch <b>wires</b> and <b>brackets</b> in orthodontics. The surgical stainless steel alloys (e.g., 316 low-carbon steel) have also been used in some of the early dental implants.|$|R
30|$|Among {{different}} fixed orthodontic appliances, wires {{could play}} a significant role in enamel demineralization because they are present throughout the period of orthodontic treatment. Areas of contact between the <b>wire</b> and <b>brackets</b> provide a unique environment that impedes proper access to tooth surfaces for cleaning. In a study done by Eliades et al. [4], it was seen that stainless steel represented the highest critical surface tension and energy and can be expected to have higher plaque retaining capacity.|$|R
30|$|Orthodontics {{has been}} {{developing}} greatly in achieving the desired results both clinically and technically. This is especially so by using new technologies, like stimulation software that can assist in treatment planning and translational products. In addition, continuous modification of <b>wires</b> and <b>brackets</b> {{as a result of}} the biomechanical efficiencies in orthodontics has greatly improved. However, these biomechanical systems may have reached their limit and there is a need to develop new methods to accelerate teeth movement.|$|R
40|$|The use of implant {{anchorage}} has simplified {{orthodontic treatment}} by sparing us {{the need for}} patient compliance and the complexity of treatment.

We thereby present a custom made modified grid help in more accurate placement of temporary anchorage devices and guide the angle of drill penetration. The grid can be placed anywhere in the oral cavity (buccally, palatally, anteriorly or posteriorly) and it can be attached to the main arch <b>wire,</b> <b>bracket</b> or even on unbounded teeth. The measuring reference grid with two vertical guide arms is connected with a horizontal arm that will later be secured to the adjacent bracket at both ends.

30|$|Several {{studies have}} also been carried out to {{elucidate}} the causes and effects of resistance to sliding in the passive configuration. <b>Wire</b> alloy, <b>bracket</b> material, surface modification, and roughness have been investigated[2, 12, 18 – 27], revealing that as the angle between the bracket and the archwire increases, the clearance between the archwire and the bracket slot is reduced. In this situation, binding occurs and in turn influences resistance to sliding, creating an active configuration[15, 28]. The active configuration itself, however, has received considerably less attention.|$|R
30|$|In {{the modern}} straight-wire mechanics, the sliding of the <b>wire</b> through <b>brackets</b> and tubes is {{fundamental}} in achieving the {{alignment of the}} dental arch[1]. A range from 12 % to 60 % of the orthodontic forces applied {{is expected to be}} lost due to resistance to sliding (RS)[2], reducing the amount of forces exerted by fixed appliance. This wide range of variability reduces the predictability of the applied forces; for this reason, {{a better understanding of the}} RS is mandatory in order to apply predictable amount of forces.|$|R
30|$|Fixed {{orthodontic}} <b>wires</b> and <b>brackets</b> {{are made}} of stainless steel (SS) and nickel titanium (NiTi) which consists of chromium, cobalt, nickel, and titanium [1, 2]. All metal components undergo corrosion in the oral environment due to chemical, mechanical, thermal, microbiological, and enzymatic changes leading to release of ions [3]. Electrochemical processes {{play an important role}} in corrosion when two alloys and one medium as the electrolyte are present. The alloy with lower resistance against corrosion acts as the anode and dissolves into the electrolyte, and ions are then released.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the dimensions and surface characteristics of orthodontic <b>wires</b> and <b>bracket</b> slots of different commercial brands. METHODS: Thirty metallic brackets (0. 022 x 0. 028 -in and 0. 022 x 0. 030 -in) were divided in three groups: DYN/ 3 M group = Dyna-Lock, 3 M/Unitek (stainless steel, or SS); STD/MO group = Slim Morelli (SS); and Ni-Free/MO group = Slim Morelli (Ni-Free). The stainless steel wires (0. 019 x 0. 025 in) were divided into two groups: MO group = Morelli; and 3 M group = 3 M/Unitek. The <b>bracket</b> and <b>wire</b> measurements were done by two methods: (a) Surface Electron Microscopy (SEM), and (b) Profile projection. The surface analysis was done qualitatively, based on SEM images and/or by a rugosimeter. The quantitative results were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey's test (p < 0. 05) and Student's t test. RESULTS: A significant difference in the dimensions of slots was observed, and the NiFree/MO group showed the greatest changes when compared to the other groups. The analysis of surface topography of the brackets indicated greater homogeneity of the metallic matrix for DYN/ 3 M and STD/MO groups.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if the type of ligation influences the frictional resistance between stainless steel <b>wire</b> and <b>brackets</b> when the <b>wire</b> is subjected to repeated vertical displacements. Methods: Eight different types of ligation were used to secure a length of stainless steel wire in three stainless steel twin <b>brackets.</b> The <b>wire</b> was subjected to repeated vertical displacements in a simulated extraction space. Eighty per cent of the minimum force required to overcome static friction (F-m) between the <b>wire</b> and <b>brackets</b> {{was applied to the}} wire for eight minutes and any sliding measured. Results: Frictional resistance to sliding was least when stainless steel ligatures twisted in a figure 8 pattern until taut then untwisted one quarter turn were used, and greatest when elastomeric modules in a figure 8 pattern (EM 8) were used. The F-m difference between fully engaged standard and Super Slick elastomeric modules was significantly different (p = 0. 007). The frictional resistance to sliding fell when the wire was secured with either of these two methods and subjected to vertical displacement loads. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of wire movement between these modules.

The resultant tagged image file (TIF) was opened in AnalySIS Pro 3. 1 (Soft Imaging System, Munich, Germany) and the area of EAF was measured. Results: t-Tests demonstrated that: (1) there was no statistically significant difference in EAF between two adhesives when bonding in different quadrants of dentition; and (2) there was no statistically significant difference in EAF between two adhesives overall. Analysis of variance models demonstrated there were no statistically significant differences found regarding the age of the orthodontic specialists, years of clinical experience, and time in performing the bonding.
