40|$|Abstract Introduction Estimates {{indicate}} that West Nile virus infects approximately {{one and a}} half million people in the United States of America. Up to 1 % may develop West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease, in which infected patients develop any combination of meningitis, encephalitis, or acute paralysis. Case presentation A 56 -year-old African-American man presented to our hospital with headache, restlessness, fever, myalgias, decreased appetite, and progressive confusion. A cerebrospinal fluid examination showed mild leukocytosis and an elevated protein level. Testing for routine infections was negative. Brain T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans showed marked enlargement of caudate nuclei and increased intensity within the basal ganglia and thalami. A West Nile virus titer was positive, and serial brain magnetic resonance imaging scans showed resolving abnormalities that paralleled his neurological examination. Conclusion This report is unusual as it portrays the natural history and long-term consequences of <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> <b>meningoencephalitis</b> diagnosed on the basis of serial brain images. </p...|$|E

Micrograph showing {{plasma cells}} in a CSF {{specimen}} from a lumbar puncture Diagnosis: <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> <b>meningoencephalitis</b> with {{acute flaccid paralysis}} and parkinsonism. CSF revealed significant plasmacytosis (plasma cell percent-age, 40 %) and moderate pleocytosis (figure 1). CSF was positive for West Nile virus IgM antibodies by ELISA capture technique, which is pathognomic for diagnosis [1, 2]. CSF studies for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, cryptococci, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Ehrlichia species were per-formed, as well as culture for mycobacteria, and all results were negative. CSF plasmacytosis is distinctly unusual. It {{has been reported in}} patients with multiple myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma but not, to our knowledge, in patients with lung cancer [3]. A recent case series reported 4 cases of West Nile virus encephalitis with striking CSF plasmacytosis [4]. These data, together with the findings for our patient, suggest that, in the presence of an appropriate exposure history, the finding of CSF plasmacytosis in patients with meningitis and/or encephalitis should alert physicians to the possibility of West Nile virus infection. There have also been case reports of CSF plasmacytosis with other viral meningoencephalitidites, such as infections with entero-virus, Coxsackie virus, measles virus, mumps virus, HIV, and herpes zoster virus [5, 6]. However, these infections are only associated with mild CSF plasmacytosis (plasma cell percentage, 1 %– 6 %). CSF plasmacytosis has also been rarely reported in cases of neuroborreliosis, neurosyphilis, tuberculous meningi-tis, and neurocysticercosis [7, 8] Our patient’s fever resolved, and his mental status returned to normal after 2 days.

40|$|The {{mosquito}} Culex quinquefasciatus is a ubiquitous {{species that}} serves as a major vector for <b>west</b> <b>nile</b> <b>virus</b> and lymphatic filariasis. Ingestion of bloodmeal by females triggers a series of physiological processes in the midgut and also exposes them to infection by these pathogens. The bacteria normally harbored in the midgut are known to influence physiology and can also alter the response to various pathogens. The midgut bacteria in female Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes collected over a large geographical area from India was studied. Examination of 16 S ribosomal DNA amplicons from culturable microflora revealed the presence of 83 bacterial species belonging to 31 bacterial genera. All of these species belong to three phyla i. e. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Phylum Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum (37 species), followed by Firmicutes (33 species) and Actinobacteria (13 species). Phylum Proteobacteria, was dominated by members of γ-proteobacteria class. The genus Staphylococcus was the largest genus represented by 11 species whereas Enterobacter was the most prevalent genus and recovered from all the field stations except Leh. Highest bacterial prevalence was observed from Bhuj (22 species) followed by Nagrota (18 species), Masimpur (18 species) and Hathigarh (16 species). Whereas, least species were observed from Leh (8 species). It has been observed that individual mosquito harbor extremely diverse gut bacteria and have very small overlap bacterial taxa in their gut. This variation in midgut microbiota {{may be one of the}} factors responsible for variation in disease transmission rates or vector competence within mosquito population. The present data strongly encourage further investigations to verify the potential role of the detected bacteria in mosquito for the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and <b>west</b> <b>nile</b> <b>virus.</b> To the best of our knowledge this is the first study on midgut microbiota of wild Cx. quinquefasciatus from over a large geographical area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Several {{populations of}} Culex pipiens sensu latu mosquitoes, a vector of mosquito-born flaviviruses such as <b>west</b> <b>nile</b> <b>virus,</b> have {{developed}} resistance to pyrethroids in the United States. To design and then institute resistance monitoring, mitigation, and management strategies, {{knowledge of the}} mechanisms of resistance will be required. Preliminary investigations conducted on Culex pipiens s. l. populations in California and Southern Africa strongly suggest that this resistance is mediated by enzymatic detoxification and/or target-site sensitivity. The aims are to determine permethrin resistance levels in first generation progeny of colonies-collected Culex spp. from various regions of California and evaluate the levels of detoxification enzyme [esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) ] and improve diagnostic Knockdown resistance (kdr) in F 1 progeny of Culex spp. mosquitoes with confirmed permethrin resistance. In this study, mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex were collected at various sites throughout California and tested for esterase, GST, and kdr activities. The esterase, GST, and kdr activities were compared to the corresponding activities found in a pyrethroid-sensitive laboratory strain Culex quinquefasciatus (CQ 1). A correlation was found between elevated esterases activities and kdr assay indicating that further investigation {{should be done to}} figure out the potential role of enzyme detoxification and kdr assay in conceding resistance to pyrethroids class.

40|$|RANTES (CCL 5) is a {{chemokine}} {{expressed by}} many hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types that {{plays an important}} role in homing and migration of effector and memory T cells during acute infections. The RANTES receptor, CCR 5, is a major target of anti-HIV drugs based on blocking viral entry. However, defects in RANTES or RANTES receptors including CCR 5 can compromise immunity to acute infections in animal models and lead to more severe disease in humans infected with <b>west</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> (WNV). In contrast, the role of the RANTES pathway in regulating T cell responses and immunity during chronic infection remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for RANTES in the control of systemic chronic LCMV infection. In RANTES 2 / 2 mice, virus-specific CD 8 T cells had poor cytokine production. These RANTES 2 / 2 CD 8 T cells also expressed higher amounts of inhibitory receptors consistent with more severe exhaustion. Moreover, the cytotoxic ability of CD 8 T cells from RANTES 2 / 2 mice was reduced. Consequently, viral load was higher in the absence of RANTES. The dysfunction of T cells in the absence of RANTES was as severe as CD 8 T cell responses generated in the absence of CD 4 T cell help. Our results demonstrate an important role for RANTES in sustaining CD 8 T cell responses during a systemic chroni...|$|R
40|$|Immune and non-immune rubella sera were {{examined}} in the haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test to evaluate the removal of lipoprotein non-specific inhibitors (NSI) of haemagglutination after kaolin and manganous chloride/heparin treatments. The sera were titrated fresh or after lipoprotein deterioration brought about by ageing the samples at 4 degrees C for various periods of time and by freezing at - 20 degrees C with subsequent thawing. Deterioration was seen as altered electrophoretic mobility while the lipoproteins in treated sera were detected by indicator arboviruses whose haemagglutination {{is known to be}} strongly inhibited by the native macromolecules. After both treatments, notably manganous chloride/heparin, residual NSI activity was detected in deteriorated samples, particularly with group B arboviruses such as Japanese encephalitis and <b>west</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>viruses</b> but generally less so or not at all with the group A arboviruses employed. Absolutely fresh sera are considered highly desirable for rubella virus HAI assay, and it is suggested that the efficiency of lipoprotein NSI removal regardless of treatment protocol could be monitored in parallel HAI tests using carefully chosen indicator arboviruses. This could be done in conjunction with density gradient centrifugation of doubtful sera should ultracentrifuging facilities be available. The suitability of the monitoring procedure would be dependent to some extent on whether certain arboviruses are known to be endemic in a particular area...|$|R
40|$|<b>WEST</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> (WNV) is an {{arbovirus}} of {{the genus}} Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae), which is transmitted and amplified in enzootic cycles between avian hosts and many species of mosquito vectors (Higgs and others 2004). At least 59 mos-quito species {{have been identified as}} vectors for WNV, mainly from the genus Culex, including the common house mos-quito Culex pipiens (Hayes and others 2005). Clinical disease has been described in reptiles, birds and mammals, including human beings, and can range from fever to encephalitis to death (Zeller and Schuffenecker 2004). The virus was first iso-lated from a pyrexic woman in Uganda in 1937 (Smithburn and others 1940) and sporadic outbreaks and human cases have been described in Europe and the Middle East since the 1960 s (Murgue and others 2001). WNV has been classified into two lineages. Lineage 1 viruses have been isolated from Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas and are responsible for most reported cases of neurological disease in human beings and horses (Beasley and others 2004). In contrast, lineage 2 viruses have been found primarily in enzootic cycles in sub-Saharan Africa and typically have not been found to cause human disease. However, recent phylogenetic studies suggest the existence and circulation of at least two and possibly three distinct WNV lineages in central Europe (Bakonyi and others 2006). Horses are particularly susceptible to WNV infection and clinical presentation may include ataxia, muscle tremors, rear limb paresis and recumbency. However, unlike avian species, the viraemia in equids does not reach a level sufficient to infect feeding mosquitoes, therefore they are considered a dead-end host (Castillo-Olivares and Wood 2004).
