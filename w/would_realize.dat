5|$|On {{his return}} to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction. He {{returned}} to Hiram to teach at the Institute, and in 1857 was made its president. He did not see education as a field that <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> his full potential. At Williams, he had become more politically aware in the intensely anti-slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school, and began to consider politics as a career. In 1858, he married Lucretia; they would have seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Soon after the wedding, he formally entered his name to read law at a Cleveland firm, although he did his studying in Hiram. He {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1861.|$|E

25|$|The city began {{auctioning}} {{its enormous}} portfolio of Harlem properties {{to the public}} in 1985. This was intended to improve the community by placing property in the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them. In many cases, the city would even pay to completely renovate a property before selling it (by lottery) below market value. The program was soon beset by scandal—buyers were acquiring houses from the city, then making deals with churches or other charities in which they would inflate the appraised values of the properties and the church or charity would take out federally guaranteed 203(k) mortgage and buy it. The original buyer <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> a profit and the church or charity would default on the mortgage (presumably getting some kind of kickback from the developer). Abandoned shells were left to further deteriorate, and {{about a third of the}} properties sold by the city were tenements which still had tenants, who were left in particularly miserable conditions. These properties, and new restrictions on Harlem mortgages, bedeviled the area's residential real estate market for years.|$|E

25|$|The {{writing and}} {{recording}} sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture were marred by numerous distractions and inconveniences. In November 2003, Dreamworks {{was acquired by}} Universal Music Group for US$100 million, and eventually folded into Geffen Records. The transition period between labels left Rise Against without an A representative, and little acknowledgement from Geffen executives. Guitarist Todd Mohney left the band during the writing sessions, was replaced by Chris Chasse of Reach the Sky. McIlrath noted that the band was nervous about teaching Chasse completely new songs in a short period. Meanwhile, McIlrath was experiencing more personal distractions. Some Rise Against fans accused the band of selling out after signing with Dreamworks. Although McIlrath felt {{that most of the}} fans <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> that the band had not changed upon hearing the album, it still bothered him knowing that some longtime fans now hated the band for switching labels. Additionally, McIlrath's wife, who was seven months pregnant, went into labor {{while he was in the}} vocal booth. The band temporarily moved recording sessions from Vancouver to Chicago so that McIlrath could be with his wife.|$|E

And when it's the guy doing everything she just did in the previous scenes, it becomes all too familiar—which is Beyoncé's point." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{opportunity}} {{to bring back}} the character of Mary Winchester excited Kripke. Though she is a driving force behind the brothers' quest to kill the demon Azazel and is referenced numerous times throughout the first two seasons, her two appearances in the series were very brief. The episode allowed the character to be expanded upon, depicting her as a [...] "really perfect and idyllic mother". However, Kripke felt that Dean <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> something was amiss if he was granted a [...] "perfect dream world", so John Winchester, who died in the second season premiere, remained dead.|$|E

500|$|On {{completing}} this work, Feynman {{was sent}} to the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the Manhattan Project had its uranium enrichment facilities. He aided the engineers there in devising safety procedures for material storage so that criticality accidents could be avoided, especially when enriched uranium came into contact with water, which acted as a neutron moderator. He insisted on giving the rank and file a lecture on nuclear physics so that they <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> the dangers. He explained that while any amount of unenriched uranium could be safely stored, the enriched uranium had to be carefully handled. He developed a series of safety recommendations for the various grades of enrichments. He was told that if the people at Oak Ridge gave him any difficulty with his proposals, he was to inform them that Los Alamos [...] "could not be responsible for their safety otherwise".|$|E
500|$|Turner interviewed flautist John Payne for the book, who had {{sat in on}} {{sessions}} with Van Morrison and later collaborated with him. Payne comments on their work together on the album Astral Weeks, which also included musicians Connie Kay, Warren Smith, Jay Berliner, and Richard Davis: [...] "Ironically, the image you have {{when you listen to}} the album now is of these guys who are all together, and they realise they are creating a monumental work of art. The fact is that it was just another session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth and you <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E
500|$|Matsoukas {{initially}} {{planned the}} music video to visualize Beyoncé winning the contest, where she <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> {{that it was}} meaningless to her.

Speaking to MTV News, Matsoukas elaborated: [...] "We thought it was really important and interesting to break those ideas of what the classic beauty standards would be and {{to do this with}} this beautiful albino woman, I thought was really great. And to show 'Yeah she's not perfect, she doesn't always win and you put your best foot forward and you may still lose.'" [...] The video's ending was originally intended to depict archival footage of American actresses Halle Berry and Vanessa A. Williams, to promote beauty for African-American women. However, Beyoncé sent a note to Matsoukas suggesting that footage from her childhood should be interpolated {{at the end of the}} song in order to connect it to the second music video from the album, [...] "Ghost".|$|E

500|$|In 1906, the {{dilapidated}} {{building was}} purchased by the San Diego Electric Railway Company, owned by prominent San Diego citizen John D. Spreckels (who also owned the Union). In his vision, the house would anchor a number of tourist attractions connected via his railway which <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> his twin goals of developing San Diego into a popular locale and generate revenue for his company. To this end, he hired architect Hazel Wood Waterman to renovate the house to a condition more closely matching descriptions in the novel. The original cupola and balcony was removed because there was none mentioned in the novel, and several doors and windows were moved. Waterman was exacting in her specifications: She wanted the building to look aged as well as have the [...] "charm {{of the work of}} half-skilled Indian hands", although modern conveniences such as electricity and indoor plumbing were included. Upon its completion in 1910, it was marketed as a Ramona-related tourist attraction, and remained popular as such for years to come, drawing 1,632 visitors on one day in 1940.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted that}} Doom 3 {{stuck with a}} similar [...] "run and gun" [...] {{gameplay}} style that was successful with its predecessors, and the game was alternately praised and criticized for this element. Several reviews were critical of a perceived repetitiveness in gameplay after a while. In addition, the game's artificial intelligence was not regarded as particularly challenging, with GameSpot noting that [...] "enemies follow the same sorts of predictable patterns that [...] may remember from previous Doom games" [...] while GameSpy stated the way enemies would spawn to attack the player was [...] "gimmicky"; the reviewer noted that players <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> that picking up a lone armor vest would cause a variety of zombies to emerge from hidden compartments in the dark. In addition, several reviewers noted that the game's methods of conveying the story were [...] "ineffectual", compounded {{by the lack of}} an identity for the player character. Finally, the game's multiplayer was seen as lacking in innovation, with its low player limits and small number of game modes, particularly in contrast to id Software's influential Quake III Arena.|$|E
500|$|The {{dominant}} {{question for}} shale oil production is {{under what conditions}} shale oil is economically viable.

According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation, the cost of producing shale oil at a hypothetical surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, retorting plant, upgrading plant, supporting utilities, and spent oil shale reclamation), would be in a range of $70–95 per barrel ($440–600/m3), adjusted to 2005 values. [...] Assuming a gradual increase in output after the start of commercial production, the analysis projects a gradual reduction in processing costs to $30–40 per barrel ($190–250/m3) after achieving the milestone of [...] The United States Department of Energy estimates that the ex-situ processing would be economic at sustained average world oil prices above $54 per barrel and in-situ processing would be economic at prices above $35 per barrel.

Stan is dressed as Raggedy Andy (since Wendy would be going as Raggedy Ann, thus making a pair), Kyle wears a Chewbacca mask, and Cartman is dressed as Adolf Hitler, much to the fury of Kyle, who is Jewish. A zombified Kenny joins the boys, but they fail to notice {{that he is a}} zombie. At school, Kyle gets more annoyed after {{discovering}} that the other students (as well as Mr. Hat) are also dressed as Chewbacca, while Mr. Garrison is dressed as Marilyn Monroe. Worst of all, Wendy is dressed as Chewbacca; she explains that she changed costumes because they would have looked stupid as the Raggedy couple and she figured Stan <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> it too. A stubborn Kyle decides to make a new costume so he can win the prize, two tons of candy. Both Chef (dressed as Evel Knievel) and Principal Victoria are annoyed to see Cartman dressed as Hitler. Victoria makes him a [...] "ghost" [...] costume but he ends up looking more like a Ku Klux Klan member, which annoys Chef even more. At the contest, which is judged by Tina Yothers, Wendy (despite wearing the same costume as the other students) wins the candy, much to the fury of Kyle, who is now dressed as the Solar System. Stan wins the worst costume and everyone laughs at him, leaving him humiliated.|$|E
500|$|As Christmas approaches, Akeelah {{goes out}} to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but when she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she reminds him of his {{deceased}} daughter Denise. Instead, he gives Akeelah 5,000 flashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia, and feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud, Akeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells {{her that if she}} looked around her, she <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> that she has [...] "50,000 coaches". Akeelah recruits her family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbor Derrick T to prepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to Washington, D.C. with him, along with Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for four of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she invites her. During the competition, Akeelah becomes a crowd favorite. After all the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The two finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's father harshly pressuring him to win. Akeelah attempts to intentionally lose by deliberately misspelling [...] "xanthosis". Dylan, knowing that Akeelah knows this word, intentionally misspells it as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a fair competition, rejecting his father's obsession to win. The two then proceed to spell every word listed by the judges in the hopes of winning the championship together, with Dylan earning a share of it by correctly spelling [...] "logorrhea", much to his father's delight. Akeelah spells the last word on the list, [...] "pulchritude", and the two are declared co-champions amidst a cheering crowd.|$|E
500|$|... "The Baby Shower" [...] {{was first}} {{read by the}} show's cast on November 14, 1990. It was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on November 20. A technique called [...] "Poor Man's Process" [...] was used during the car scene with George and Jerry; one or two crew members would shake the car {{to give the impression that}} it was moving, though it never actually was. Other crew members would move lights around the set to simulate street lights or headlights of other cars. Behind the car, two lights on a wheeled stand were placed to give the impression that there was a car behind it. A cheap plastic sticker was put on Jerry's television screen to give the impression that it was broken. A number of scenes were changed or cut during production of the episode. In early drafts of the script, the episode opened with Kramer telling Jerry about the Russian cable installers. In the first draft of the script Elaine and Jerry <b>would</b> <b>realize</b> ahead of time that the baby shower and the cable installation would take place at the same time. This was changed as the writers felt it would be better left as a surprise. Some dialogue was removed from the scene, as Kramer initially told Jerry Benjamin Franklin would have wanted free cable. Additional dialogue between the baby shower guests regarding turning off men was also cut. The scene in which Mary Cantardi, a woman Jerry went out with once but never called afterwards, makes a scene at the baby shower was not in the original script, but was added during rehearsals to give Seinfeld more involvement in the final scene.|$|E
