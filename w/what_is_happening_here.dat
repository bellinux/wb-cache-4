The birds, such as the starlings in {{the image on the}} right, have no decision-making leader, yet the flock know exactly how to land in a unified way. The need for the group to land overrides deviating intentions by individual birds. The particle model found that the collective shift to landing depends on perturbations that apply to the individual birds, such as where the birds are in the flock. It is behaviour that can be compared with the way that sand avalanches, if it is piled up, before the point at which symmetric and carefully placed grains would avalanche, because the fluctuations become increasingly non-linear.|$|E

5000|$|Caravaggio biographer Peter Robb {{has pointed}} out that the fourth Baptist seems like a psychic mirror-image of the first, with all the signs reversed: the {{brilliant}} morning light which bathed the earlier painting has become harsh and almost lunar in its contrasts, and the vivid green foliage has turned to dry dead brown. There is almost nothing in the way of symbols to identify that this is indeed a religious image, no halo, no sheep, no leather girdle, nothing but the thin reed cross (a reference to Christ's description of John as [...] "a reed shaken by the wind"). The painting demonstrates what Robb calls Caravaggio's [...] "feeling for the drama of the human presence." [...] This adolescent, almost adult, John seems locked in some private world known only to his creator. Caravaggio's conception of the saint as a seated, solitary figure, lacking almost any narrative identity (how do we know this is the Baptist? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>here?)</b> was truly revolutionary. Artists from Giotto to Bellini and beyond had shown the Baptist as an approachable story, a symbol understandable to all; the very idea that a work should express a private world, rather than a common religious and social experience, was radically new.|$|E

One of the [...] "box head people" [...] was a regular contributor to conspiracy theorist David Icke's website forums, who described McGowan as his [...] "tutor".

The elicitation tools {{used in this study}} were specifically designed to trigger descriptions of ongoing events; descriptions for which adult speakers of Dutch would use finite verbs in the second position of the sentence. To give an example of a test-item from the picture book elicitation task: we showed our subjects a series of pictures featuring Cookie Monster and asked them to describe what happened in these pictures. The pictures we showed them depicted the following events: 1) 	Cookie Monster sitting at a table with a glass of lemonade and a few cookies in front of him; 2) 	Cookie Monster eating a cookie; 3) 	Cookie Monster drinking the lemonade; 4) 	Cookie Monster eating another cookie. We introduced the story to the children by showing them the first picture and saying: Look, this is Cookie Monster. He is sitting at the table. And on the table, there is a glass of lemonade and some cookies. Now let’s see what happens next. Then, we showed the next pictures and for each picture asked: <b>What</b> <b>‘s</b> <b>happening</b> <b>here?</b> The test items were designed {{in such a way that}} the child was prompted to produce an assertion containing a topic (the time, place or entity ‘talked about’; in this case the topic entity Cookie Monster), a predicate (a certain state of affairs: the eating/drinking) and a link between these components. Adult speakers of Dutch would, in a case like this, produce constructions with a finite verb; either an auxiliary (1) or a lexical verb (1) in linking position: (1) Koekiemonster is een koekje aan het eten (‘Cookie Monster is eating a cookie’) (2) Koekiemonster eet een koekje		 (‘Cookie Monster eats a cookie’) The children’s responses for these test items were analyzed for the presence or absence of semantic links and for the types of linking elements used, in order to establish an overview of the ways in which these learners mark finiteness.
