It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks <b>went</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over {{the course of the}} 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E

His achievements were not to last long after his disappearance from history in c. 1280, however. In Euboea, Licario's major gain and personal fief, the Byzantine forts were gradually retaken by the Lombards, until they recovered the entire island by 1296.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the local}} {{reputation}} {{and respect for}} Hobbs senior, a local committee formed {{to raise money to}} support his family.

Tom Hayward brought a team of well-known professionals, including several of his Surrey team-mates; the match was a resounding financial success and <b>went</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to easing any financial difficulties for the Hobbs family. Hobbs assumed his father's duties as groundsman at Jesus college in the winter of 1902–03. While working there, one of his colleagues and a friend of his father, F. C. Hutt, got in contact with Hayward to ask him to arrange a trial for Hobbs, with a view to joining Surrey. Consequently, in late 1902, Hayward and Bill Reeves, an Essex cricketer born in Cambridge, bowled at Hobbs on Parker's Piece and he impressed Hayward. Hobbs and Hutt were not certain that anything would come of this, and Hutt wrote to Essex asking for a trial, but the county never replied.|$|E
25|$|Lovat Fraser {{was also}} a noted cricketer. He had played at Merchiston Castle School and {{continued}} to play for his school's old boys side. He was predominantly a bowler (right-arm medium pace). He played his three first-class matches between 1909 and 1913. The first match was on 22 July 1909 when Scotland faced Ireland in Scotland, at North Inch, Perth. Although he was out for a duck in Scotland's first innings, his contribution of 3 wickets in Ireland's first innings, and a five wicket haul in their second <b>went</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> towards Scotland's win by an innings and 132 runs. Three years later {{he was in the}} Scotland side that faced Australia on 11 July 1912. The match was drawn and Fraser once again registered a duck but took a wicket. His final first class match was in a 10 July 1913 encounter with Ireland at the Grange Cricket Club Ground, Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. Although the match was drawn, Fraser hit a first class high of 44 in the first innings and took six wickets over the two innings. In 1919 he again played for Scotland against the Australian Imperial Army and in 1921 against Australia, but neither match was deemed a first class encounter.|$|E

25|$|As of 15 March 2010, Sehwag has {{an average}} of nearly 68 in the first innings of test matches where he has scored 5130 runs, 18 centuries and 12 fifties in 76 matches. In the second innings, his average drops to 31 and has scored 1561 runs, with only one century and 9 fifties in 54 innings. The first and second innings {{difference}} of 37 runs {{is one of the}} highest and indicates a lack of ability in dealing with more difficult batting conditions as the pitch deteriorates. However, his match-saving second-innings 151 against Australia at Adelaide during the 2007–08 Border-Gavaskar series, and a match winning 92 in trying situations at Nagpur during the 2008–09 series, <b>went</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> towards repairing that image. In the 2008 Test series against England, Sehwag {{played a key role in}} the fourth innings of the first Test in Chennai. He amassed 83 runs in 68 balls, which helped India chase down an improbable target of 387 with six wickets to spare. This was the highest successful run chase in India and the fourth highest in Test history. For this effort, Sehwag was adjudged Man of the Match. On 12 August 2011, Sehwag became only the third Indian in history to achieve a king pair (2 golden ducks consecutively) and the 15th player to do that of all time, but weeks later he again scored crucial and aggressive pair of 55 against West Indies.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} agreed that Ensemble re-created the Halo universe's aesthetic well. Gillen said knowledge of the game universe could alleviate some issues of player ignorance regarding units' actions: [...] "It's not just the geek thrill of seeing a Scarab in action—it's that you understand what the Scarab means on the battlefield (trouble)," [...] he wrote. [...] "We know which characters are best against tanks, and which are probably best in special vehicles." [...] Nguyen said that, although the core units meshed well, the inclusion of Ensemble-developed units gave Halo Wars {{the feeling of a}} generic science-fiction title. While giving the game a mixed review, Anderson said that the authentic-looking units and environments <b>went</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to integrating the game {{with the rest of the}} series. Wilcox commented that with the Halo-inspired menu system and Rippy's score, [...] "before the campaign even begins, the message is clear: this is still very much a Halo game." [...] Overall, Halo Wars was judged a fitting final game for Ensemble.|$|E

And in a round 11 victory against North Melbourne, the same journalist wrote that he had the [...] "soundest judgement" [...] of all forwards on the field. Wilson played [...] "excellently" [...] in the Reds' defeat of Carlton the next week; Markwell remarked upon his desire [...] "to annihilate the men in blue".

Markwell observed that Wilson's [...] "judgment and coolness" [...] <b>went</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to Melbourne winning their round 16 encounter with Essendon. Melbourne finished the season in fourth place on the ladder. Though they never seriously challenged for the premiership, it was noted that the club had bad luck through suspension and injury, and when they got their best team on the field they could challenge anyone. In his review of the season, Markwell named Wilson one of Melbourne's best half dozen players.|$|E
