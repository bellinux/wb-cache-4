5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} for lifewhat we call 'pre-biotic chemistry'are abundant in many solar system objects, such as comets, asteroids and icy moons. Biologists believe liquid {{water and energy}} are then needed to actually support life, so it's exciting to find another place where <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> liquid water. But, energy is another matter, and currently, Callisto's ocean is only being heated by radioactive elements, whereas Europa has tidal energy as well, from its greater proximity to Jupiter.|$|E
25|$|Hogan has {{emphasised}} that {{it would}} be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe not to support life.|$|E
25|$|Carrier {{argues in}} his book On the Historicity of Jesus: Why <b>We</b> <b>Might</b> <b>Have</b> Reason for Doubt that there is {{insufficient}} Bayesian probability, that is evidence, {{to believe in the}} existence of Jesus. Furthermore, Carrier argues that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century. He argues that the probability of Jesus' existence is somewhere in the range from 1/3 to 1/12000 depending on the estimates used for the computation.|$|E

25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E
500|$|In a post-race press interview, Sherman said he {{had visited}} Swaps' grave at the Kentucky Derby Museum prior to the Derby and prayed for success. Trainer Dale Romans, who had {{asserted}} that California Chrome had no chance to win, said, [...] "I was very, very wrong... <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> just seen a super horse and a super trainer. You don't fake {{your way to the}} winner's circle at the Kentucky Derby." ...|$|E
500|$|Since the opening, {{the river}} {{improved}} significantly, surpassing original {{expectations for the}} project. An AMEC engineer participating in the firm's studies, Jacques Paynter, said that {{the banks of the}} river had begun widening [...] "at a noticeable pace", with the tidal bore growing closer to its pre-1968 levels: [...] "We were actually anticipating a fairly modest increase in height. It seems to be already exceeding what <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> expected." [...] He noted that an estimated 40,000 gaspereau had returned to the river, and called for more studies to determine the impact of the causeway's opening.|$|E

500|$|The Nintendo DS {{is said to}} have {{influenced}} the Wii's design. Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted, [...] "We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii. We thought about copying the DS's touch-panel interface and even came up with a prototype." [...] The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also stated, [...] " [...] if the DS had flopped, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> taken the Wii back to the drawing board." [...] In June 2011 Nintendo unveiled the prototype of its successor to the Wii, to be known as Wii U.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{differences}} over {{the quality of}} the film, critics were in agreement that the film had drawn attention to von Stauffenberg's cause. It was applauded [...] "both as a history lesson and as a film". Tobias Kniebe of the Süddeutsche Zeitung described the film as [...] "maybe not the masterpiece <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> dreamed of ... but not much less", a sentiment shared by many German critics. The public-service German television channel ZDF called Valkyrie [...] "neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century.... Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film." [...] The newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger reported that any fear that the [...] "myth of the German resistance would be put through a Hollywood filter {{has turned out to be}} wrong and prejudicial".|$|E
500|$|In January 1938, Colonel Stefan Mayer {{directed}} that statistics be compiled for {{a two-week}} period, comparing {{the numbers of}} Enigma messages solved, to Enigma intercepts. [...] The ratio came to 75 percent. [...] "Nor," [...] Marian Rejewski has commented, [...] "were those 75 percent... the limit of our possibilities. [...] With slightly augmented personnel, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> attained about 90 percent... read. [...] But {{a certain amount of}} cipher material... due to faulty transmission or... reception, or to various other causes, always remains unread..." [...] Information obtained from Enigma decryption seems to have been directed from B.S.-4 principally to the German Office of the General Staff's Section II (Intelligence). [...] There, from fall 1935 to mid-April 1939, it was worked up by Major Jan Leśniak, who in April 1939 would turn the German Office over to another officer and himself form a Situation Office intended for wartime service. [...] He would head the Situation Office to and through the September 1939 Campaign.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would make}} no {{difference}} in the result," [...] Beric said; [...] "in so great a mass as this we should be lost, and even if we could make our way to the front, and fall upon the Romans in a solid body, our numbers are too small to decide the issue; but at least <b>we</b> <b>might,</b> <b>had</b> the day gone against us, have drawn off in good order." ...|$|R

500|$|Professor Lamine (KUL), {{a former}} Vlaams Blok member and [...] "advisor" [...] of the party's legal team, {{claimed that the}} party, for {{propaganda}} reasons, purposely undertook a weak defence, in order to lose the case; [...] "For the party leaders, losing was much more interesting. Winning just wasn't an option." [...] Lamine himself had earlier stated that the party should have carried the trial to the European Court of Human Rights, but Vlaams Blok senator Joris Van Hauthem had already stated in 2005, that; [...] "If we had gone to Strasbourg [...] based on procedural arguments, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> had a case. But Lamine already put in a private claim to overturn the Appeals Court verdict, {{on the basis of}} substantive arguments. If Vlaams Belang were to put forth a claim against the verdict as well, at Strasbourg, the Court will bundle both cases. Then we would lose the case for sure. Lamine has thus given us the final blow." ...|$|E
500|$|Louise Nevelson {{has been}} a {{fundamental}} key in the feminist art movement. Credited with triggering the examination of femininity in art, Nevelson challenged the vision of what type of art women would be creating with her dark, monumental, masculine and totem-like artworks. Nevelson believed that art reflected the individual, not [...] "masculine-feminine labels", and chose to take on her role as an artist, not specifically a female artist. Reviews of Nevelson's works in the 1940s wrote her off as just a woman artist. A reviewer of her 1941 exhibition at Nierendorf Gallery stated: [...] "We learned the artist is a woman, in time to check our enthusiasm. Had it been otherwise, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> hailed these sculptural expressions as by surely a great figure among moderns." [...] Another review was similar in its sexism: [...] "Nevelson is a sculptor; she comes from Portland, Maine. You'll deny both these facts and you might even insist Nevelson is a man, when you see her Portraits in Paint, showing this month at the Nierendorf Gallery." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1997, Bruce took Myzery to St.Andrew's Hall. Eminem, then {{an unknown}} local emcee, {{approached}} Bruce and, according to Bruce, {{handed him a}} flyer advertising the release party for the Slim Shady EP. The flyer read, [...] "Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)". Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Bruce said that Eminem explained, [...] "It says 'maybe.' Maybe you will be there; I don't know. That's why I'm asking you right now. You guys comin' to my release party, or what?" [...] Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, [...] "Fuck no, I ain't coming to your party. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have,</b> if you would've asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin' flyer like this." [...] Bruce reported that Eminem attacked the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler first responded by referring to Eminem's alter ego as [...] "Slim Anus" [...] on [...] "85 Bucks An Hour" [...] from Twiztid's 1997 debut, Mostasteless, and later in 1999 releasing a parody of Eminem's [...] "My Name Is" [...] entitled [...] "Slim Anus". Barbs between Insane Clown Posse and Eminem continued until the feud was ended in 2005 by hip hop group D12 and Psychopathic Records.|$|E

500|$|Neither brother married. Wilbur once quipped {{that he did}} {{not have}} time for both a wife and an airplane. Following a brief {{training}} flight he gave to a German pilot in Berlin in June 1911, Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, [...] "When we think what <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose." [...] Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters. Wilbur urged American cities to emulate the European – particularly Parisian – philosophy of apportioning generous public space near every important public building. He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would [...] "come home white".|$|E
500|$|Some {{observers}} thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. James Berardinelli {{questioned the}} [...] "random amount [...] of rubber nipples and camera angle close-ups of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches." [...] Similar to Batman Forever, this primarily included {{the decision to}} add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, [...] "I {{had no idea that}} putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct." [...] Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt [...] "it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual." [...] George Clooney joked, [...] "Joel Schumacher told me we never made another Batman film because Batman was gay". Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying, [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> killed the franchise", and called it [...] "a waste of money".|$|E
500|$|SpaceChem was {{generally}} well received by critics, with an aggregate Metacritic score of 84 out of 100 from its Microsoft Windows release. Quintin Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun said [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> just received {{one of the}} year's best indie games {{in the first week}} of 2011". Gamasutra's Margaret Robertson praised SpaceChems gameplay, contrasting it with other open-ended activities as it offers the opportunity for the player to be as creative as they want to be within the minimal ruleset required of each puzzle. Robertson also found the game to be thrilling, having each puzzle initially appear [...] "so astonishingly dispiriting" [...] to what she had previously learned, but through trial and error coming to a solution that works and giving her the feeling of having [...] "made a creative statement" [...] in her solution. Eurogamer's John Teti praised the means through which the game introduced new mechanics without excessive reliance on tutorials; he commented that [...] "the problems become more daunting" [...] through the addition of new elements and commands, the game [...] "is always more accessible than it looks". Edge said [...] "The triumph of SpaceChem is that overcoming these situations is more a case of inventing a solution than discovering one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{carry me}} with you," [...] said Daisy. [...] "Say, I think it's awful {{to be up}} so high that folks look like fleas.

6000|$|... "I must {{visit him}} some day," [...] said Laura. [...] "Just think! if it hadn't been for him <b>we</b> <b>might</b> never <b>have</b> met, Dave!" [...] And {{she gave her}} brother a tight hug.|$|R
6000|$|... "O dear! Then I am glad {{he is out}} of my house. Really! <b>we</b> <b>might</b> all <b>have</b> {{been murdered}} in our beds!" [...] And the woman held up her thin hands in horror.|$|R

2500|$|Jonathan Davis has {{rejected}} the nu metal label, saying [...] "We're not 'rap rock,' we're not 'nu-metal... <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> invented a new genre of heavy music or rock, but I believe the term 'nu-metal' {{was made up}} for all the bands that followed us.
