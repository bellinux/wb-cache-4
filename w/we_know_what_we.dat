5|$|Morrison {{was known}} for his {{numerous}} books and television programs. He produced 68 popular science articles between 1949 and 1976, ten in issues of Scientific American. He provided the narration and script for Powers of Ten in 1977. With his wife, Phylis, they turned the same material into a coffee table book in 1982. He also appeared as himself in the science documentary film Target...Earth? in 1980. In 1987, PBS aired his six part miniseries, The Ring of Truth: An Inquiry into How <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>We</b> Know, which he also hosted. In addition, he was a columnist and reviewer of books on science for Scientific American starting in 1965.|$|E

500|$|On 10 March 2015, Dontnod {{announced}} {{they had already}} completed the story for a possible sequel, Remember Me 2. Dontnod creative director Jean-Maxime Moris said [...] "We know {{what we would do}} for Remember Me 2. The main story has been written <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would add to the recipe. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would fix. It's a game that's ready to be made, but that decision is Capcom's to make". However, Moris added that Dontnod intended to work on another season of Life Is Strange before proceeding with the sequel to Remember Me. A sequel is reportedly no longer viable with Capcom; Dontnod CEO Oskar Guilbert admitted that while [...] " [...] did OK", only Life Is Stranges unexpected success saved the company from [...] "a very difficult" [...] financial situation.|$|E

[...] Since the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, where Barrichello ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, team orders have been banned in Formula One. Räikkönen {{appeared}} unbothered when asked about Massa's pass: [...] "I mean <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want as a team and that's what we did it. It is normal in these situations." [...] No investigation was undertaken by the stewards at the race. GrandPrix.com played down the incident, saying [...] "Anyone who understands racing understood {{what was going on and}} only the silly people objected." ...|$|E
500|$|Taking Back Sunday {{rented a}} room in Manhattan, sharing it with the Sleeping and writing songs with laptops and guitars. Typically, they arrived at about 10 am; some evenings, Lazzara showed up after the band to write melodies. The group wrote 20 songs before {{discarding}} half, and recorded 14 or 15 demos in their home studio. According to bassist Matt Rubano, Fred Mascherino and Adam Lazzara's lyrics [...] "are coming into a golden age. The tracks are really more rocking and we’re trying some new things, but it’s still us." [...] Like Where You Want to Be, the band pushed themselves to write the best songs they could. For Where You Want to Be the group [...] "didn’t {{spend as much time}} playing together," [...] but for Louder Now [...] "we know each other’s playing. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want and don’t want." ...|$|E

500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> mean by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it.... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display. [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".|$|E

2500|$|The band {{entered the}} studio to record Soul-Crusher only {{three months after the}} release of their {{previous}} album, Psycho-Head Blowout. They decided to recruit Wharton Tiers, who had previously been associated with noise rock bands such as Pussy Galore and Sonic Youth, to produce and engineer the record. This marked the first time White Zombie had worked with a producer on any of their releases. The members of White Zombie claimed to have been more pleased with the production of Soul-Crusher than any other previous recording and praised Tiers for giving them creative freedom during the recording process. However, Sean stated that, [...] "We really do need more direction sometimes. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want, but we're pretty inexperienced in the studio." [...] Rob also expressed his dislike for the way the band sounded, noting that the equipment used in the recording sessions was of poor quality.|$|E

2500|$|The {{growth of}} the {{scientific}} literature in the last 20 years has been unprecedented. For example, the library of medicine now includes {{more than two million}} Neuroscience articles. Anthony Landreth and Alcino Silva have developed a strategy to derive [...] (simplified abstraction) of published articles in Neuroscience that they think could be used to integrate and summarize with more clarity and objectivity what <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are uncertain about and what we do not know in neuroscience. They propose that these maps of research findings would also be invaluable during experiment planning: Understanding more objectively the implications of the millions of neuroscience papers already published would allow neuroscientists to more clearly define what to do next. Landreth and Silva propose that quantitative maps of research findings will be to experiment planning in neuroscience what statistics is to experiment analyses: a tool that will help neuroscientists judge the likelihood that a series of planned experiments will contribute to the research record. As a first step towards the generation of these maps, Landreth and Silva developed a way to classify the many millions of experiments in neuroscience into a small number of categories that are critical for the generation of these maps. To generate these maps, Landreth and Silva also developed a set of algorithms that formalize strategies neuroscientists use to determine the strength of evidence in their fields. [...] These algorithms are used [...] to represent the experiments in networks of causally connected phenomena (i.e., research maps). Pranay Doshi and colleagues in the Silva Lab developed a completely free app (www.ResearchMaps.org) that helps researchers generate these maps. Data from individual research articles is entered into a relational database, and the app can generate maps not only for experimental findings in single research articles, but also for combinations of findings associated with different articles. The user can query the app and tailor-make specific maps that can then be used for experiment planning.|$|E
