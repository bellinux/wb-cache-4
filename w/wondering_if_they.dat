5|$|Moffat {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} the dream split to Nye, who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were real. Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye {{to come up with a}} monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old people as a child, but he made clear that he did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents.|$|E

"The Franciscan Spanish {{fathers are}} {{explaining}} that the King of the Ambassador [...] will soon become the supreme ruler of his country, and that, not only will they become Christians and follow {{the will of the}} church of Rome, but they will also in turn convert the rest of the population. This is why they are requesting the dispatch of a high eclesiastic together with the missionaries. Because of this, many people have been doubting the true purpose of the embassy, and are <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are not looking for some other benefit."

500|$|Reich {{was taught}} at home {{until he was}} 12, when his mother was {{discovered}} {{having an affair with}} his live-in tutor. Reich wrote about the affair in 1920 in his first published paper, [...] "Über einen Fall von Durchbruch der Inzestschranke" [...] ("About a Case of Breaching the Incest Taboo"), presented in the third person as though about a patient. He wrote that he would follow his mother when she went to the tutor's bedroom at night, feeling ashamed and jealous, and <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would kill him if they found out that he knew. He briefly thought of forcing her to have sex with him, on pain of threatening to tell his father. In the end, he did tell his father, and after a protracted period of beatings, his mother committed suicide in 1910, for which Reich blamed himself.|$|E

The owner, Jimmy, agrees, {{but he does not}} wish to pay them with money; instead he gives them a free pop and {{a sandwich}} each day. Miranda, Annemarie, and Colin discover a Fred Flintstone bank in the back of sandwich shop. Colin, wanting {{to see more of the}} bank, is pulled way by Annemarie insisting that Jimmy could find them. The next day, Jimmy fires the three workers, thinking that one of them stole the Flintstone bank, when it was actually the laughing man who stole it.

He [...] thinks she did it because she is African American. This upsets Annemarie greatly and she immediately quits her job.|$|E

McCaughey recalled her parents' difficulty in affording medical treatment: [...] "my brother was a serious asthmatic as a child. I remember my parents {{sitting at the kitchen}} table <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could afford to take [...] to the hospital." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gladstone {{felt that}} this was a deft {{political}} move. Public opinion would be satisfied with [...] "Chinese Gordon" [...] going to the Sudan, but at the same time, Gordon was given such a limited mandate that the evacuation would proceed as planned. The Cabinet felt very uncomfortable with the appointment as they had been pressured by the press to send a man who was opposed to their Sudan policy to take command in the Sudan with the Foreign Secretary Lord Grenville <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had just committed a [...] "gigantic folly". Gordon made a short trip to Brussels to tell Leopold {{that he would not be}} going to the Congo after all, news that enraged the King.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Anthony MacDonnell was a {{successful}} Indian civil servant appointed as administrator in Dublin by Wyndham, on the strict understanding that the permanent post made MacDonnell's role a non-political position. [...] MacDonnell was a Catholic from Mayo, whose appointment left unionists <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been betrayed by London. [...] Nevertheless, having been an experienced and competent implementer of the 1903 Wyndham Land Act, MacDonnell came to be widely seen as a force for moderation. [...] Wyndham was occupied in London with cabinet duties, and so appreciated the implied need for permanent governance. [...] Balfour had already considered Long for the post in January 1905, and to that end [...] consulted both Edward Carson and John Atkinson under pressure from Horace Plunkett and Gerald Balfour, to continue the policy of moderate reform. Due to his Irish connections (both {{his wife and his}} mother were Irish), it was hoped that Long might be more acceptable to Irish Unionists than his predecessor.|$|E

2500|$|Below, in the Duke locker room, the Blue Devils were {{preparing}} for a rematch of the 1990 title game with UNLV in their semifinal. UNLV had won that game by 30 points and had come in undefeated in 1991, with many <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were the best college basketball team ever. When the Carolina-Kansas result news got through, Mike Krzyzewski asked the team if they felt {{it was okay to}} lose since that meant they would do no worse than the Tar Heels, and some nodded. Krzyzewski understood but then added, [...] "Flush it. Let's go kick their ass." [...] Duke then stunned the sports world by defeating UNLV 79–77 and then went one better by beating Kansas 72–65 in the championship game to win its first national title. Chansky writes that one UNC athletic department staffer in Indianapolis was so distraught that he did not leave his hotel room the day after the national championship game, while when Duke arrived back in Durham, Krzyzewski is said to have asked the team at a turnoff to Chapel Hill if the team wanted to cruise down Franklin Street. In the wake of the Final Four, when talking about how close the two rivals came to meeting for the national championship, Krzyzewski said that he never wanted to see it happen because regardless of who won, the pain of losing that game would be unbearable for the defeated school and its fans.|$|E

When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E
