5|$|The <b>Witness</b> <b>is</b> a 3D puzzle {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Thekla, Inc. It was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in January 2016, and later for Xbox One, Nvidia Shield, macOS, and iOS. Inspired by Myst, the game involves the exploration of an open world island filled with natural and man-made structures. The player progresses by solving puzzles, {{which are based on}} interactions with mazes presented on panels around the island or hidden within the environment. The player will have to determine the rules of each puzzle from visual clues and audio recordings scattered around the island.|$|E
5|$|In 561, {{the king}} {{now known as}} Sky Witness {{installed}} a ruler {{at the site of}} Los Alacranes. Sky Witness played a major part in the political events of the Maya region. He became the overlord of the city of Caracol, to the south of Naranjo, which had previously been a vassal of Tikal. In 562, according to a damaged text at Caracol, Sky Witness defeated Tikal itself and sacrificed its king Wak Chan K'awiil, thus ending his branch of the royal dynasty at Tikal. This catastrophic defeat began a 130-year hiatus for Tikal, reflecting an extended period of dominance by Calakmul. This event is used as a marker to divide the Early Classic from the Late Classic. Sky <b>Witness</b> <b>is</b> also mentioned at Okop, a site much further north in Quintana Roo. The last reference to Sky Witness occurs at Caracol and is dated to AD 572. The text is damaged but probably records the death of this powerful king.|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} <b>witness,</b> <b>is</b> challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
25|$|The {{court did}} not err in refusing to order {{production}} of a defense alibi witness, where the defense contended that the <b>witness</b> <b>was</b> under subpoena but no evidence was introduced {{to show that the}} <b>witness</b> <b>was</b> under subpoena, and no evidence was introduced to show the <b>witness</b> <b>was</b> ever served with a subpoena to testify.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{the present}} critics codices [...] and B are the best Alexandrian witnesses, which present the pure Alexandrian text. All other <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> {{classified}} according to whether they preserve the excellent -B line of text. With the primary Alexandrian <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> included [...] and citations of Origen. With the secondary <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> included manuscripts C, L, 33, and the writings of Didymus the Blind.|$|R
5000|$|American Legion posts harassed Witnesses nationwide. For example, on June 27, {{members of}} the American Legion forced Witnesses from a trailer camp in Jackson, Mississippi and escorted them across state lines to Louisiana, where they were [...] "passed from county to county, finally winding up in the {{vicinity}} of Dallas, Texas." [...] A Nebraska <b>Witness</b> <b>was</b> castrated. Little Rock <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> beaten with pipes and screwdrivers. West Virginia <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> forced to drink castor oil and then tied together with police department rope. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> jailed for sedition, distributing literature, holding a parade, and canvassing without a license.|$|R
5|$|Phoenix Wright, a newly-hired defense {{attorney}} at the Fey and Co. law firm, agrees to represent {{his best friend}} Larry Butz, who {{has been charged with}} the murder of his girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, he proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's star <b>witness,</b> <b>is</b> the real murderer. Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office, and her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes her case, facing off against Miles Edgeworth, an equally-talented prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. In a bizarre twist, it is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.|$|E
5|$|While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) {{ensure that}} the <b>witness</b> <b>is</b> safe at the hospital, Olivia takes Peter back to the lab. Peter, {{suffering}} from a headache, takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge. In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter {{in order to help}} him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it, and that this was another step in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go, despite believing that he may not survive, and that when the time comes, they can expect Walter to do it again.|$|E

5000|$|The {{testimony}} of two <b>witnesses</b> <b>is</b> equal in its {{force to the}} {{testimony of}} three or more witnesses. Thus if two witnesses say an event occurred, and one hundred witnesses say it did not occur, the groups of <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> considered to contradict one another, but no more weight {{is given to the}} larger group; other evidence is needed to reach a judgment. If one of the <b>witnesses</b> <b>is</b> disqualified, his entire group is disqualified, even if the other <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> themselves qualified and could present a valid testimony without his assistance.

2500|$|Approximately 80 FBI agents {{conducted}} {{interviews with}} potential witnesses daily. [...] No verbatim {{records of the}} <b>witness</b> interviews <b>were</b> produced; instead, the agents who conducted the interviews wrote summaries that they then submitted. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>were</b> not asked to review or correct the summaries.

60|$|The Recorder {{summed up}} against Elizabeth. He {{steadily}} assumed that Nash was always right, and the neighbours always wrong, {{as to the}} girl's original story. He said nothing of Bennet; the tanner's dog had done for Bennet. He said that, if the Enfield <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> right, the Dorset <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> wilfully perjured. He did not add that, if the Dorset <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> right, the Enfield testifiers were perjured.|$|R
5000|$|The ICTY {{stated that}} no <b>witnesses</b> <b>were</b> murdered during either trial. The {{judgments}} of each trial chamber {{can be found}} on the ICTY's website: www.icty.org.

50|$|The Pharisees posit that false <b>witnesses</b> <b>are</b> {{executed}} if {{the verdict}} is pronounced {{on the basis of}} their testimony—even if not yet actually carried out.

50|$|In its {{original}} meaning, the word martyr, meaning <b>witness,</b> <b>was</b> {{used in the}} secular sphere {{as well as in}} the New Testament of the Bible.

25|$|The Double Jeopardy Clause {{encompasses}} four distinct prohibitions: subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, {{and multiple}} punishment {{in the same}} indictment.

25|$|The {{rules of}} {{evidence}} in sharia courts also maintain a distinctive custom of prioritizing oral testimony. Witnesses, in a sharia court system, must be faithful, that is Muslim. Male Muslim witnesses are deemed more reliable than female Muslim witnesses, and non-Muslim witnesses considered unreliable and receive no priority in a sharia court. In civil cases in some countries, a Muslim woman <b>witness</b> <b>is</b> considered half the worth and reliability than a Muslim man witness. In criminal cases, women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of sharia, such as those found in Hanbali madhhab.|$|E
25|$|In a line {{of cases}} {{beginning}} with Crawford v. Washington, decided in 2004, Thomas has joined with Justice Scalia and several liberals on the court in reasserting {{the importance of the}} Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, by declaring testimonial statements inadmissible at trial unless the <b>witness</b> <b>is</b> unavailable and there has been ample opportunity for cross-examination; however, his decisions in these cases had not always aligned with Scalia's. In his concurring opinion in the 2011 case Michigan v. Bryant, for example, Thomas explains that in deciding whether a statement is testimonial, one must consider the formality of the circumstances in which it was given.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the medical}} considerations, Jehovah Witnesses {{advocate}} that physicians should uphold {{the right of a}} patient to choose what treatments they do or do not accept (though a <b>Witness</b> <b>is</b> subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion). Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects that a patient incurred out {{of his or her own}} requests. However, the point of view that physicians must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France.|$|E
