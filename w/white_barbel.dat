50|$|The <b>White</b> <b>barbel</b> is a mouthbrooder as are {{the other}} members of this family. The female lays {{approximately}} 50 relatively large (15-16 mm diameter) eggs which the male carries in his mouth for about three to four months. During this time the male does not feed and can lose nearly one quarter of his body weight.|$|E
50|$|Galeichthys feliceps, the <b>White</b> <b>barbel,</b> Sea barbel, White baggar or White sea catfish, is {{a species}} of sea catfish found in coastal waters and {{estuaries}} over muddy bottoms at depths of from 1 - 120 metres where they gather in large shoals. They occur from Namibia to South Africa with questionable records of sightings from Madagascar and Mozambique in Africa and the United States of America and Mexico in North America. It is coloured brown, grey or greenish-brown on the upperparts and is paler below. While most grow to a length of 35 cm, some individuals attain a length of 55 cm {{with a record of}} a fish from South Africa weighing 3.8 kg.|$|E
5000|$|This {{particular}} {{species is}} a medium-sized {{member of the}} catfish family. It is typically yellow-olive to slatey-black {{on the back and}} sometimes mottled depending on habitat. The sides are lighter and more yellowish, while the underside of the head and body are bright yellow, yellow white, or bright white. The rear edge of its caudal fin is rounded. The anal fin is much larger than many fish having anywhere between 23 and 27 rays. The yellow bullhead though less common, can be easily distinguished from the brown bullhead and black bullhead by its <b>white</b> <b>barbels</b> or [...] "whiskers". Yellow bullheads are medium-sized bullheads rarely getting larger than 2 lb but can reach up to 6.6 pounds, as documented by the International Game and Fish Association. This species is often misidentified on social media and the Internet. Yellow bullheads range in size from 6 to 18 inches and live up to 7 years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{body color}} is gray to reddish brown on the back, covered with large, scattered, small black spots. [...] The {{underside}} is lighter, with smaller spots. [...] Most {{of the species}} of Synodontis of Lake Tanganyika have a recognizable pattern consisting of dark triangles at the bases {{of all of the}} rayed fins, present in S. tanganyicae, and the back edges of the fins are <b>whiter.</b> The <b>barbels</b> are <b>white.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like {{most of the}} bullheads (and even {{flathead}} catfish), it has a squared tail fin, {{which is}} strikingly different from the forked tail of channel and blue catfish. It is a bottom-rover fish, meaning it is well-adapted for bottom living. It is typically dorsoventrally flattened, and has a slightly humped back. [...] Its color depends on the area where it is taken, but it generally is darker than brown or yellow bullheads. It can be distinguished from a flathead in that the black bullhead's lower lip does not protrude past the upper lip. Distinguishing it from the brown bullhead {{is a bit more}} difficult, depending on the area where it is caught, but a distinguishing detail between the two includes a nearly smooth pectoral spine on the black bullhead with the brown being strongly barbed. The anal fin also has a gray base, and the tail also has a pale bar. Also, the brown bullhead generally has 21 to 24 soft rays through its anal fin as opposed to the black bullhead's 17 to 21. The brown bullhead is also typically mottled brown and green on top instead of the darker black. Both the black and brown bullheads can easily be distinguished from the yellow bullhead as the yellow bullhead has <b>white</b> <b>barbels</b> under its mouth.|$|R
50|$|An adult tadpole madtom is {{typically}} 2 - 3 in, however they have recorded at {{a length of}} 5 in. The tadpole madtom has a dark brown back with a lighter brown color on their sides and a yellow or white stomach. The pelvic and pectoral fins of adults are heavily covered in melanophores responsible for pigmentation, and the dorsal and anal fins contain fewer melanophores. There are also bands of melanophores on both {{the upper and lower}} jaws creating a dark horizontal streak along the side. Chin <b>barbels</b> vary from <b>white</b> to being lightly covered with melanophores. The tadpole madtom possess dark nasal and maxillary <b>barbels</b> and <b>white</b> mandibular <b>barbels.</b> Their adipose fin is completely connected to their large and round caudal fin, and their pectoral fin is not serrated. They possess 6-7 gill rakers; 6-7 dorsal rays; 15-18 anal rays; 7-9 pectoral rays; and 8-10 pelvic rays. The anal fin is of moderate length, but decreases with increasing body length. The tadpole madtoms also possess two pectoral spines through which an anti-predatory venom is transmitted. They have a terminal mouth with numerous small and sharp cardiform teeth. The teeth exist in numerous broad bands across the upper and lower jaw.|$|R
