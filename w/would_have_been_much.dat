5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos on the African continent, and they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
5|$|Both stadia had {{approximately}} east-west alignment: the rugby {{ground to}} the north (Castle Street) end; the National Stadium to the south (Wood Street) end. The original capacity was 65,000 but {{this had to be}} reduced in later years to 53,000 for safety reasons. 11,000 of these were on the East Terrace and the conversion to all-seater stadium would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to 47,500. This capacity <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> less than Twickenham and the other major rugby venues and also less than the demand for tickets to major events.|$|E

5|$|However, pay <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> more {{attractive}} in higher-grade units. The {{top of the}} pay pyramid were the scholae elite cavalry regiments. Next came palatini units, then comitatenses, and finally limitanei. There is little evidence about the pay differentials between grades. But that they were substantial is shown by the example that an actuarius (quartermaster) of a comitatus regiment was paid 50% more than his counterpart in a pseudocomitatensis regiment.|$|E
5|$|The species {{occurs in}} coastal regions of Southwest Australia, from Gingin and Muchea north of Perth south to Augusta and east {{along the south}} coast to Green Range, east of Albany. It also occurs in the Stirling Range, a {{possible}} disjunction; and at Narrogin, a certain and substantial disjunction. Nelson tentatively explains these disjunct populations in terms of natural climate fluctuations: during times of higher rainfall, the distribution of A.obovatus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> more extensive. Reductions in rainfall would cause the distribution to contract, but isolated populations could survive in favourable refugia.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{maintain}} {{that given the}} massive reductions in US military aid to South Vietnam after 1973, any major PAVN offensive was bound to succeed. However, the ARVN's soldiers were hardened veterans, and South Vietnam maintained vast stockpiles of ammunition and equipment (as demonstrated by the massive quantities of war materiel captured by the PAVN when the war ended). The final collapse of the ARVN {{may well have been}} inevitable, but the end <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> bloodier and much longer in coming had the PAVN chosen a more direct, conventional plan of attack. In fact, the most damaging blow of the entire PAVN campaign may have been the crushing psychological blow their skillful and unexpected strategy dealt to the mind of the ARVN's commander-in-chief.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{produced a}} storm surge of 13feet (4m) {{in only one}} hour at Battery Park, a record only broken 191 years later by Hurricane Sandy. Manhattan Island was completely flooded to Canal Street; one hurricane researcher remarked that the storm surge flooding <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> worse, had the hurricane not struck at low tide. However, few deaths were reported in the city, since the flooding affected neighborhoods much less populated than today. The hurricane brought light rainfall as it passed New York City, though strong winds left severe damage across the city. High tides occurred along the Hudson River. Strong waves and winds blew many ships ashore along Long Island. One ship sank, killing 17people. Along Long Island, the winds destroyed several buildings and left crops destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have varied}} interpretations of Marshall's vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall {{as one of}} the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 Time {{magazine}} article. Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidency, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the United States <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> more involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler, which began in the following year. Morison {{and a number of other}} historians claim that Marshall's decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of the presidency would have made World War II much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from office, even temporarily.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{enjoys a}} {{diversity}} of temperate ecologies, incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodlands, and moorland, montane, estuarine, freshwater, oceanic, and tundra landscapes. Approximately 14% of Scotland is wooded, much of it forestry plantations, but prior to human clearing there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> larger areas of boreal Caledonian and broad-leaved forest. Although much reduced, significant remnants of the native Scots Pine woodlands {{can be found in}} places. 17% of Scotland is covered by heather moorland and peatland. Caithness and Sutherland have some {{of the largest and most}} intact areas of blanket bog in the world, supporting a distinctive wildlife community. 75% of Scotland's land is classed as agricultural (including some moorland) with urban areas accounting for around 3% of the total. The number of islands with terrestrial vegetation is nearly 800, about 600 of them lying off the west coast. Scotland has more than 90% of the volume and 70% of the total surface area of fresh water in the United Kingdom. There are more than 30,000 freshwater lochs and 6,600 river systems.|$|E

5|$|The {{interiors}} of most Norfolk churches contain much pre-Reformation graffiti, {{unless they have}} been heavily limewashed or resurfaced. The churches of the Glaven ports in general, and Blakeney in particular, conform to this pattern. St Nicholas has an extensive array of prayers, merchant's marks and other symbols, but is notable for {{the large number of}} depictions of ships, at least 30, heavily concentrated in the nave towards the eastern end of the south aisle. There is a side altar there of unknown dedication, and an empty niche that would have once held the image of a saint. The pillars were painted red in the Middle Ages, and ship images scratched into the soft, chalky stone <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> more conspicuous than they are now. It is likely that the images, mostly of smaller ships, were created as votive offerings by the seafaring inhabitants of the port. The carving of ship graffiti in religious buildings is a tradition in ports going back to the Bronze Age, and has been found across Europe.|$|E

25|$|The {{ties between}} {{forestry}} and farming were mutually beneficial. Farmers supplemented their incomes with earnings from selling their wood, caring for forests, or logging; forestry made many otherwise marginal farms viable. At the same time, farming communities maintained roads and other infrastructure in rural areas, and they provided workers for forest operations. Indeed, without the farming communities in sparsely populated areas, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> {{more difficult to}} continue intensive logging operations and reforestation in many prime forest areas.|$|E

25|$|Paul Krugman {{stated that}} the {{institutions}} built by the New Deal remain the bedrock of the United States economic stability. Against {{the background of the}} 2007–2012 global financial crisis he explained that the financial crises <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> worse if the New Deals Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had not insured most bank deposits and older Americans would have felt much more insecure without Social Security. Libertarian economist Milton Friedman after 1960 attacked Social Security from a free market view stating that it had created welfare dependency.|$|E
25|$|However, as a stock bowler for Nottinghamshire, Staples was an {{essential}} part of their successful team in the 1920s because his long spells of accurate medium-pace bowling allowed speedster Harold Larwood and the physically sensitive Tich Richmond to be more effective through not being overworked. Although on a relatively few occasions his off-break from round the wicket could be quite unplayable, Staples rarely obtained exceptional averages even in helpful summers but {{there is no doubt that}} without his ability to keep more penetrative bowlers fresh Nottinghamshire's bowling <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> less formidable.|$|E
25|$|During John Byrne's {{time on the}} Wonder Woman comic, he insinuated that Artemis {{previously}} {{had an affair with}} the New God Kanto. This fell out of established history as no prior connection of Artemis or the Amazons to Apokolips had been established until Darkseid's invasion of Themyscira shortly after Artemis' death. Because of this the only other time Artemis could have met Kanto would have been before the Banas invaded Paradise Island, leaving Artemis to be between infancy to fourteen years of age. Thus she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> too young to have had a relationship with the grown adult.|$|E

25|$|The Rimé {{movement}} was a 19th-century movement involving the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, {{along with some}} Bon scholars. Having seen how the Gelug institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-1892) and Jamgön Kongtrül (1813-1899) compiled together {{the teachings of the}} Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings. Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> more final. The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the Rinchen Terdzod and the Sheja Dzö.|$|E
25|$|On 5 January 2016, an airstrike by the Saudi-led {{military}} coalition hit the Al Noor Center for Care and Rehabilitation of Blind, in the Safiah {{district of}} Sana'a, the capital's only center, school, and home {{for people with}} visual disabilities. Five people were injured. Human Rights Watch and media reported, if the bomb had exploded, the damage <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> worse. Human Rights Watch blamed both the Saudi-led coalition for hitting civilian targets and the Houthi militants battling the coalition. HRW said Houthi militants were partially to blame for using civilian sites for military purposes. Armed Houthis were stationed near the Al Noor center, putting the students at risk.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{metabolic}} {{rates is}} complicated by the distinction between the rates while resting and while active. In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge herbivorous sauropods may have been on the move so constantly in search of food that their energy expenditure <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.|$|E
