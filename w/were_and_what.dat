[...] The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and antiwar demonstrators with the ideal that they [...] "could work to restructure American society". They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the Women's House of Detention in support of Afeni Shakur, and other radical New Left causes. Four months after they formed, however, the group disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.|$|E

500|$|On many occasions, Usher {{has named}} Michael Jackson as his biggest influence. Usher once told MTV, [...] "He {{influenced}} me {{in so many}} ways, more than just music ..... as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn't be who I am today without Michael Jackson." [...] During the television special '', Usher was able to dance with Michael while performing [...] "You Rock My World". Prince being another main influence, Usher said [...] "every album I’d always do like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he's a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres." [...] In Time magazine's [...] "100 Most Influential People" [...] issue, he explained [...] "I was interested in music {{and trying to find}} a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn't have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be." [...] In addition, he has spoken of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder as great musicians and philanthropists stating that [...] "they figured out what they were as they were going, by inspiration as well...allowing their music to speak to where they <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they had to say". Other musical influences include Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, and Boyz II Men.|$|E
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E

In fact, a Southerner took the first photographs of the war inside Fort Sumter. However, {{as a consequence of the}} war and rampant inflation most were soon out of business. Unfortunately, as war photographs were long regarded with extreme disfavor in the South after the rebellion, most were disposed of.

2500|$|Vocalist/guitarist Alex Gaskarth {{said the}} EP helped the band gain new fans, {{while at the}} same time {{allowing}} them time to progress musically. Gaskarth also said that the group did not want to [...] "feel pressured or rushed" [...] to make an album. Opting to release the EP instead [...] "made the most sense as far as where we <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> we wanted to do". To support its release, the group appeared on a number of Warped Tour dates, as well as touring with Amber Pacific. Gaskarth revealed the band was aiming to enter the recording studio in the winter. In December, the group performed a number of shows. At one of these, they played three new tracks: [...] "Let It Roll", [...] "Dear Maria, Count Me In" [...] and [...] "Remembering Sunday".|$|E
2500|$|ISM activist Richard Purssell testified, [...] "hey began {{demolishing}} one house. We {{gathered around}} {{and called out}} to them {{and went into the}} house, so they backed out. During the entire time they knew who we <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> we were doing, because they didn't shoot at us. We stood in their way and shouted. There were about eight of us in an area about 70 square meters. Suddenly, we saw they turned to a house they had started to demolish before, and I saw Rachel {{standing in the way of}} the front bulldozer." [...] Human-rights activists and Palestinians say that the demolitions had also been accompanied by gunﬁre from Israeli snipers. The director of Rafah's hospital, Dr. Ali Moussa said that 240 Palestinians, including 78 children, had been killed since the Al-Aqsa Intifada began in 2001, [...] "Every night there is shooting at houses in which children are sleeping, without any attacks from Palestinians."

2500|$|Paranormal {{researcher}} John Champion {{writes in}} Skeptical Inquirer Magazine {{that he understands}} why people persist in believing that Queen Mary is haunted when the only evidence given is anecdotes, creepy feelings and shadows. Tourists who {{sign up for the}} haunted tour are given access to normally off-limit areas of the ship, while tours {{of the history of the}} ship are more limited. Champion believes that the owners are doing a disservice to the real history, the people who should be honoured [...] "by remembering who they really <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they actually did". He understands why people report strange occurrences, the ship still creaks and groans, and people's imaginations can get away from them such that they start seeing and hearing all kinds of things, attributing them to the paranormal which they have been primed for. [...] "Ghost stories are fine", concludes Champion [...] "when presented as such. The confusion of science and history with fiction ... gets us further away from the ability to relish in and truly explore our own recent history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ross and Urie {{soon began}} to commit to their laptops the demos they had been {{developing}} and posted three early demos ("Time to Dance," [...] "Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks" [...] and [...] "Camisado") on PureVolume. On a whim, they sent a link to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz via a LiveJournal account. Wentz, who was in Los Angeles at the time {{with the rest of}} Fall Out Boy working on the band's major-label debut, From Under the Cork Tree, drove to Las Vegas to meet with the young, unsigned band. Upon hearing [...] "two to three" [...] songs during band practice, Wentz was impressed and immediately wanted the band to sign to his Fueled by Ramen imprint label Decaydance Records, which made the band the first on the new label. Around December 2004, the group signed to the label. As news broke that Wentz had signed Panic! (who had yet to perform a single live show), fans on the Internet began to bash the group. [...] "Almost right away we {{knew what was going to}} happen," [...] Ross explained in a 2006 interview. [...] "We had two songs online and people were already making assumptions on what kind of band we <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> we were going to sound like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{theory is}} {{suggested}} by Anthony Brian Taylor, who argues simply that Marcus is babbling; [...] "beginning with references to [...] "dream" [...] and [...] "slumber" [...] and ending with one to sleep, the speech is an old man's reverie; shaken by the horrible and totally unexpected spectacle before him, he has succumbed to the senile tendency to drift away and become absorbed in his own thoughts rather than confront the harshness of reality." [...] Jonathan Bate however, sees the speech as more complex, arguing that it attempts to give voice to the indescribable. Bate thus sees it as an illustration of language's ability to [...] "bring back that which has been lost," [...] i.e. Lavinia's beauty and innocence is figuratively returned in {{the beauty of the}} language. Similarly, for Brian Vickers, [...] "these sensual pictorial images are appropriate to Lavinia's beauty now forever destroyed. That is, they serve one of the constant functions of tragedy, to document the metabolé, that tragic contrast between what people once <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they have become." [...] Jacques Berthoud provides another theory, arguing that the speech [...] "exhibits two qualities seldom found together: an unevasive emotional recognition of the horrors of her injuries, and the knowledge that, despite her transformation into a living grave of herself, she remains the person he knows and loves." [...] Thus the speech evokes Marcus' [...] "protective identification" [...] with her. D.J. Palmer feels that the speech is an attempt to rationalise in Marcus' own mind the sheer horror of what he is seeing; ...|$|E

2500|$|If she {{was allowed}} no overt {{political}} role, Eleanor {{was a highly}} intelligent and cultured woman and found other satisfying outlets for her energies. [...] She was an active patroness of literature, maintaining the only royal scriptorium known to have existed {{at the time in}} Northern Europe, with scribes and at least one illuminator to copy books for her. Some of the works produced were apparently vernacular romances and saints' lives, but Eleanor's tastes ranged far more widely than that and were not limited to the products of her own writing office. The number and variety of new works written for her show that her interests were broad and sophisticated. In the 1260s she commissioned the production of the Douce Apocalypse. [...] She has also been credibly linked to the Trinity Apocalypse, although the question of whether she commissioned it, or simply owned an apocalypse which influenced its production, remains a matter of debate. On Crusade in 1272, she had De Re Militari by Vegetius translated for Edward. [...] After she succeeded her mother as countess of Ponthieu in 1279, a romance was written for her about the life of a supposed 9th century count of Ponthieu. She commissioned an Arthurian romance with a Northumbrian theme, possibly for the marriage of the Northumbrian lord John de Vescy, who married a close friend and relation of hers. In the 1280s, Archbishop Peckham wrote a theological work for her to explain what angels <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they did. She almost certainly commissioned the Alphonso Psalter, now in the British Library, and is also suspected to be the commissioner of the Bird Psalter which also bears the arms of Alphonso and his prospective wife. In January 1286 she thanked the abbot of Cerne for lending her a book—possibly a treatise on chess known to have been written at Cerne in the late thirteenth century—and her accounts reveal her in 1290 corresponding with an Oxford master about one of her books. There is also evidence suggesting that she exchanged books with her brother Alfonso X.|$|E
