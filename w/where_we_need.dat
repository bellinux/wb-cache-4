500|$|Contemporary reviews have {{praised the}} episode {{as one of}} the show's best installments. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote that the episode was [...] "funny, it's clever, and it's {{actually}} quite frightening". Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the faux documentary style, likening it to The Blair Witch Project. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and called it [...] "witty, inventive, and intermittently spooky". He argued that the episode was a late-series [...] "gimmick episode" [...] and compared it to the last few seasons of House; although he reasoned that House relied on gimmicks to prop itself up, [...] "X-Cops" [...] is [...] "the work of a creative team which may be running out of ideas, but still has enough gas in the tank to get us <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to go." [...] Furthermore, Handlen felt that the show used the Cops format to the best of its ability, and that many of the scenes were humorous, startling, or a combination of both.|$|E
500|$|Pittsburgh {{traveled}} to Minnesota {{to play the}} Vikings for their third pre-season game. The Steelers's defense held the Vikings early, led by Aaron Smith who had three tackles, including one sack, in the first quarter. The offense failed to score a touchdown, with Rashard Mendenhall fumbling twice. Quarterback Byron Leftwich, who was signed to replace the injured Batch, lead the team with 129yards passing. Jeff Reed accounted {{for all of the}} Steelers' points, kicking four field goals—the final with 4seconds remaining—to give Pittsburgh a 12–10 victory. Entering their final pre-season game the Steelers had selected every starting player except the punter. Carolina tied the game with 1:54remaining in regulation, but rookie Dennis Dixon lead the Steelers on a 47-yard drive, which was capped with Reed kicking the game winning 43-yard field goal as time expired. After the three point victory, Tomlin stated, [...] "It has been a pleasure working with this group guys, but it is that time of year <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to make tough decisions." [...] The Steelers cut 22players on August 30, to bring their roster to the required 53player total.

The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic.
