40|$|International audienceRecent {{communication}} {{standards and}} storage systems (e. g. <b>wireless</b> access, <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> broadcasting or magnetic storage in hard disk drives) uses error correcting codes such as LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) or Turbo-codes to reliably transfer data between source and destination.

In this paper, we present a method that finds a conflict-free memory mapping for any interleaving law and associated parallelism constraint. The proposed approach always complies with the interconnection network topology the designer wants to infer. Moreover, contrary to traditional methods, the resulting architecture is optimized by reducing the cost of network and controller (network and memory controller) architectures. Our approach is compared with state of the art techniques and its interest is shown through the design of parallel interleavers used in different industrial applications such as High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), Multi Band- Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing Ultra-WideBand (MB-OFDM UWB) and a WiMAX application...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{construct}} a near capacity Irregular Turbo Code and to evaluate its performance over Gaussian channel. The methodology used to evaluate and measure the performance of the new design is by simulating the system by developing a software platform using Matlab. The simulation carried out by implementing the system over different modulation schemes, different frame sizes, and different code rates in order to achieve a fair comparison between irregular turbo code and regular Turbo Code. The simulation results showed that the Irregular Turbo Code with 64 QAM modulation is capable of achieving a coding gain of 1. 29 dB over its corresponding Turbo Code for a low Bit Error Rate 10 to 5, when used in a Gaussian noisy channel. Also, the Irregular Turbo Code designed in this paper, utilizes a single recursive Convolution encoder with short frame size of 5012 bits.

40|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) is a multicarrier modulation scheme utilized as a modulation method in high speed wireless and mobile communications {{systems such as}} <b>digital</b> subscriber lines, <b>wireless</b> LANs, <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> broadcasting, WiMAX and other emerging wireless broadband systems, including LTE. However, one major drawback of OFDM is its inherently high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which can cause severe nonlinear distortion when a nonlinear high power amplifier (HPA) is used. High PAPR {{is one of the}} most important implementation challenges in OFDM schemes, because it reduces the efficiency and hence increases the cost of the radio frequency (RF) power amplifier, which {{is one of the most}} expensive components in a radio. This dissertation proposes a novel approach to minimize the impact of PAPR. Most current PAPR reduction techniques aim to minimize PAPR in the transmitter; the work presented here studies PAPR reduction techniques in the receiver and their effects on the performance of OFDM systems. Extensive analysis was performed to compare the performance gain of each reduction technique. The results obtained in different channels such as SISO and MIMO show that the new peak restoration technique achieves a four-fold performance improvement on average in the SISO channel, and it can support other previously published approaches as well. ...|$|R

Design techniques and measured results of a prototype CMOS modulator for broadband PAM and QPSK data formats are presented. The circuit is based on a poly-phase implementation of a traditional all-digital architecture. Reduction in area and power is accomplished by using a digital-to-analog current-division square-root-cosine waveshaping converter. Digital data is applied at the input and a filtered analog waveform is produced at the output,without the need for a standard D/A converter at the back-end.

40|$|Analogue {{wireless}} cameras {{have been}} employed for decades, however {{they have not}} become an universal solution due to their difficulties of set up and use. The main problem is the link robustness which mainly depends on the requirement of a line-of-sight view between transmitter and receiver, a working condition not always possible. Despite the use of tracking antenna system such as the Portable Intelligent Tracking Antenna (PITA [1]), if strong multipath fading occurs (e. g. obstacles between transmitter and receiver) the picture rapidly falls apart. <b>Digital</b> <b>wireless</b> cameras based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation schemes give a valid solution for the above problem. OFDM offers strong multipath protection due to the insertion of the guard interval; in particular, the OFDM-based DVB-T standard has proven to offer excellent performance for the broadcasting of multimedia streams with bit rates over 10 Mbps in difficult terrestrial propagation channels, for fixed and portable applications. However, in typical conditions, the latency needed to compress/decompress a <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> signal at Standard Definition (SD) resolution is {{of the order of}} 15 frames, which corresponds to &#x 2243; 0. 5 sec. This delay introduces a serious problem when wireless and wired cameras have to be interfaced. Cabled cameras do not use compression, because the cable which directly links transmitter and receiver does not impose restrictive bandwidth constraints. Therefore, the only latency that affects a cable cameras link system is the on cable propagation delay, almost not significant, when switching between wired and wireless cameras, the residual latency makes it impossible to achieve the audio-video synchronization, with consequent disagreeable effects. A way to solve this problem is to provide a low delay digital processing scheme based on a video coding algorithm which avoids massive intermediate data storage. The analysis of the last MPEG based coding standards puts in evidence a series of problems which limits the real performance of a low delay MPEG coding system. The first effort of this work is to study the MPEG standard to understand its limit from both the coding delay and implementation complexity points of views. This thesis also investigates an alternative solution based on HERMES codec, a proprietary algorithm which is described implemented and evaluated. HERMES achieves better results than MPEG in terms of latency and implementation complexity, at the price of higher compression ratios, which means high output bit rates. The use of HERMES codec together with an enhanced OFDM system [2] leads to a competitive solution for <b>wireless</b> <b>digital</b> professional <b>video</b> applications...|$|R
