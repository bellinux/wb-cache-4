5|$|Generally films {{produced}} in the Indies dealt with traditional stories or were adapted from existing works. The early films <b>were</b> <b>silent,</b> with Karnadi Anemer Bangkong (Karnadi the Frog Contractor; 1930) generally considered the first talkie; later films would be in Dutch, Malay, or an indigenous language. All were black-and-white.|$|E

City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) were essentially silent films, although they were made with soundtracks consisting of music and sound effects, with talking sequences in the latter film. Chaplin's last five films were all talking pictures. Aside from A Countess From Hong Kong, all of Chaplin's films were photographed in 35mm black-and-white.|$|E

The importance of the Admiralty Islands to the Japanese increased as the result of Allied advances in New Guinea and New Britain which blocked off other air routes.

[...] But, she wrote, this does not relieve Polish Catholics of their duty to oppose the crimes being committed in their country.|$|R

25|$|The first Tarzan movies <b>were</b> <b>silent</b> {{pictures}} {{adapted from}} the original Tarzan novels, which appeared {{within a few years}} of the character's creation. The first actor to portray the adult Tarzan was Elmo Lincoln in 1918's film Tarzan of the Apes. With the advent of talking pictures, a popular Tarzan movie franchise was developed, which lasted from the 1930s through the 1960s. Starting with Tarzan the Ape Man in 1932 through twelve films until 1948, the franchise was anchored by former Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller in the title role. Weissmuller and his immediate successors were enjoined to portray the ape-man as a noble savage speaking broken English, in marked contrast to the cultured aristocrat of Burroughs's novels.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{reaching}} Live Oak, Hurston {{was surprised}} {{not only by}} the gag order the judge in the trial placed on the defense, but by her inability to get residents in town to talk about the case; both blacks and whites <b>were</b> <b>silent.</b> She believed that might have been related to Dr. Adams' alleged involvement as well in Sam McCollum's gambling operation. Her articles were published by the newspaper during the trial. Ruby McCollum was convicted by an all-white, all-male jury, and sentenced to death. Hurston had a special assignment to write a serialized account, The Life Story of Ruby McCollum, over three months in 1953 in the newspaper. Her part was ended abruptly when she and Nunn disagreed about her pay, and she left.|$|E
25|$|On {{receiving}} the proposed Constitution from the Philadelphia Convention, Congress initiated a ratification procedure {{for the proposed}} Constitution which by-passed the sitting state legislatures, going directly {{to the people of}} the country, state by state. Four delegates, James Madison with Edmund Randolph for the Federalists and Patrick Henry with George Mason for the Anti-federalists made most of the speeches of the Convention; 149 of the 170 delegates <b>were</b> <b>silent.</b> An early estimate gave the Federalists seeking ratification a slim margin of 86 to Anti-Federalists rejecting at 80, with four unknowns. Federalists came from the Tidewater and Northern Neck, the Shenandoah Valley and western counties, although the Kentucky counties along the Ohio River feared being abandoned to the Spanish under the new government. The Anti-federalists found strength in the central Piedmont, Southside and southwest counties.|$|E
25|$|The {{motion picture}} mounted a {{challenge}} to the stage. At first, films <b>were</b> <b>silent</b> and presented only limited competition. By the end of the 1920s, films like The Jazz Singer were presented with synchronized sound, and critics wondered if the cinema would replace live theatre altogether. While live vaudeville could not compete with these inexpensive films that featured vaudeville stars and major comedians of the day, other theatre survived. The musicals of the Roaring Twenties, borrowing from vaudeville, music hall and other light entertainments, tended to ignore plot in favor of emphasizing star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs. Florenz Ziegfeld produced annual spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets and elaborate costumes, but there was little to tie the various numbers together. Typical of the 1920s were lighthearted productions such as Sally; Lady Be Good; Sunny; No, No, Nanette; Harlem; Oh, Kay!; and Funny Face. Their books may have been forgettable, but they produced enduring standards from George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Vincent Youmans, and Rodgers and Hart, among others, and Noël Coward, Sigmund Romberg, and Rudolf Friml continued in the vein of Victor Herbert. Clearly, the live theatre survived the invention of cinema.|$|E

25|$|On 5 July, the 339th Squadron {{was pulled}} out of combat and {{returned}} to Johnson AB. Shortly afterwards, the 4th Squadron returned to Okinawa, with the 347th Provisional Group being inactivated {{and control of the}} 68th Squadron being turned over to the 8th Fighter Group. The 339th had been in combat a total of 10 days (26 June–5 July), flying a total of 44 combat sorties for which they had been given no training. The 68th Squadron was left to carry on the battle. Throughout July and August 1950, F-82s from the 68th Squadron attacked enemy trains, vehicles, and numerous buildings, and constantly strafed North Korean troops on the roads. On the night of 27 August, an element of F-82s was patrolling over South Korea over a thick overcast when they received an urgent request for air support from some hard-pressed ground troops. Darkness was approaching when they reached the area and found UN ground troops pinned down by a concentration of mortars. The F-82 pilots made several passes to get set up with the ground controller, {{and as soon as the}} enemy target was pinpointed, the heavily armed aircraft commenced an attack that would last 45 minutes and use up all their ordnance. When the aircraft pulled up for the last time, the mortar positions <b>were</b> <b>silent</b> and ground forces later showed over 300 enemy dead.|$|E

The following day, L.A. again managed to avoid losing three in a row as A. J. Ellis hit a three-run walk-off homer in a 6–3 victory. The Dodgers beat the Astros on May 27, 5–1 behind Chris Capuano who allowed only two hits in seven innings. Jerry Hairston, Jr. had 5 hits in 5 at-bats and backup catcher Matt Treanor homered in the win. The Dodgers bats <b>were</b> <b>silent</b> on Memorial Day as they only scored two runs against Milwaukee Brewers starter Shaun Marcum and lost 3–2. Nathan Eovaldi made his first start for the Dodgers (replacing the injured Ted Lilly) on May 29 and promptly allowed a two-run homer by Ryan Braun {{in the top of the}} 1st, which was all the Brewers needed to defeat the Dodgers 2–1. The Dodgers lost their third straight game (for the first time in the 2012 season) when they fell to the Brewers 6–3 the next day. In only his second day back after spending 15 days on the disabled list, Matt Kemp re-injured his left hamstring while scoring in the 1st inning. After receiving the news that Kemp would likely be out for all of June, the Dodgers meekly lost to the Brewers 6–2 to end the homestand. The series marked the first time the Dodgers were swept in a four-game series at home since 1993 and the first time they were ever swept by the Brewers in any series.|$|E
