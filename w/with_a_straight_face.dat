500|$|Anderson {{sought to}} capture the nostalgic feel of the 1950s. In this effort, he used several themes {{associated}} with the time period, including alien invasion movies, nuclear threats, Cold War paranoia, and optimism in the future. About the time period, Anderson said [...] "it seemed like {{this was a time}} when you could say <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>face,</b> 'I'm fighting for truth, justice and the American way.'" [...] For the characters Anderson was picturing George Reeves's Superman and Noel Neill's Lois Lane as portrayed in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman. One reviewer noted that Anderson's portrayal of Lex Luthor is that of the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths amoral businessman and Batman was more reminiscent of a 1930s-style or a [...] ""-style Batman where he is actively pursued by the police.|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>face</b> and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a}} very polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E
500|$|Rashad {{has also}} {{garnered}} critical acclaim for her performance. Writing for AARP, Allan Fallow wrote that Rashad charmed audiences [...] "with her wholesome brand of comedy." [...] Robert Weintraub of The New York Times hailed Rashad as [...] "America’s mom, dispensing tough love <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>straight</b> <b>face</b> opposite Cosby’s comic mugging". Jason Bailey of Slate wrote that Rashad portrayed her character [...] "majestically", while The Huffington Posts Mlsee Harris praised the actress for playing Clair [...] "with class and poise from 1984 through 1992." [...] Writing {{for the same}} publication, Jennifer Armstrong dubbed Rashad [...] "a great ranter". Nick Hartel of DVD Talk reviewed that she [...] "perfectly ... captures {{some of his best}} caricatures of [...] own wife, Camille." [...] However, Time television critic Richard Zoglin criticized the actress for being [...] "too young by a decade". Rashad has won numerous awards and accolades for her performance over the course of two decades, including two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Although she never won, Randee Dawn of Today felt that Rashad's performances during the show's first and last seasons were most deserving. Dawn elaborated, [...] "While it seems hard to imagine today, in 1984, finding a tough-minded, super smart, middle-class black woman on TV was all but unheard of, much less finding one who could contend with and occasionally upstage a legendary comedian." [...] Following her 1986 nomination, Rashad would remain the last African American actress to be nominated for an Emmy Award in that particular category for 30 years, until 2016. At the 15th People's Choice Awards in 1989, Rashad won in the category of Favorite Female TV Performer. Rashad also won two NAACP Image Awards. Former South African President Nelson Mandela once personally thanked Rashad for her contributions to The Cosby Show, which he claimed to have watched while imprisoned on Robben Island.|$|E

[...] "The movement is a veneer over a certain theological message.

50|$|Sakura Mamiya is {{the heroine}} and narrator of the story. Sakura was {{spirited}} away {{as a little}} girl, but comes back with Tamako's help, and gains {{the ability to see}} ghosts and spiritual beings. Thanks to that, she is the only human to initially see Rinne and not to be scared by Rokumon's demonic appearance. A very calm girl, she does not hesitate to scold Rinne if she thinks he is creating problems for her friends. Also, she tends to let herself get into the mood of things, once coming into a line of old men and women's souls who had lived their lives to the fullest and almost getting onto the wheel of saṃsāra until Rinne rescues her. As the story progresses, it is hinted that Sakura develops romantic feelings for Rinne, even though she doesn't realize it until it is pointed out by Anju. Even though she's calm and collected, Sakura does have a jealous side that rarely makes an appearance. When she is jealous, she acts colder toward Rinne, giving him long stares <b>with</b> <b>a</b> completely <b>straight</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
40|$|The book of Jonah, {{which was}} once read by {{scholars}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> impossibly <b>straight</b> <b>face,</b> is now regularly read as satire. In this article I look at how these satirical readings at once release humour and constrain it, by tailoring humour to a pedagogic purpose and heaping all our laughter upon the prophet's head. Jonah criticism, in Bakhtin's term, has been oppressively monologic, promoting YHWH'S perspective and the religious ideology of the reader, and using Jonah's words merely as evidence of his particularism and selfishness. The prophetic caricature is sinister and the laughter hollow, for Jonah is styled as the clownish Jew, resisting God's universalistic innovations and comically tripping over the truth of Rom. 3 : 29. Arguing that such readings are guilty of the sectarianism and myopia they criticise, I look for more nuanced ways of reading the text. The models I use are parody, dialogism and carnival, and the sources I look at range from the Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer to Herman Melville's Moby Dick. These readings tend to highlight ambiguity and disjuncture {{at the level of}} the word (for example the twisting word) and between the voices of Jonah and God. Read dialogically, I maintain, the book loses its sing-song childish quality and easy morality and becomes a far more interesting, subversive, and genuinely comic text...|$|R

Choudary to make a film under his banner. The project was titled as Vinnukkum Mannukkum <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ensemble cast featuring Vikram, Devayani, Sarathkumar and Kushboo. During the making of the film, Vikram mentioned his displeasure at being a part of the film, claiming that he had arguments with the director for every single shot and that [...] "everything in that film, right from the first shot was wrong. Furthermore, Rajakumaran failed to utilize the call sheets of Sarathkumar and this caused some delay in finishing off the shootings, taking over a year to complete. The film received mixed reviews and became a box office failure, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> critic from The Hindu noting [...] "director Rajakumaran has taken special care in the choice of songs and locations to make the film entertaining.

He did however praise Ruck as [...] "well-cast," [...] and wrote the episode [...] "very nearly managed" [...] to parallel Walter's [...] "desperate measures to the desperate measures of other men also trying to save themselves or their children through science," [...] which the reviewer considers the strongest asset of the show. [...] "There are a lot of great ideas, {{and there are a lot}} of terrible ones, but the show's consistent, rock solid execution keeps it from embarrassing itself too much.

Hanson thought the mystery produced [...] "surprises around every corner". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, explaining he enjoyed the [...] "classic Fringe" [...] opening scene, the [...] "decent acting job" [...] by Ruck, and John Noble's performance; he also thought the script was [...] "very clever as it reveals surprising story elements with innovative tricks". Isler wasn't sure what to make of the Bell-Olivia plot twist however, commenting that [...] "this new William Bell thing is either going to end up as the best plot device of the season, or the cheesiest thing in recent sci-fi history".|$|R
