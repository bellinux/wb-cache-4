5|$|It {{originally}} {{started as}} a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it has retained its current, much shorter route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it {{became the subject of}} much concern for local residents regarding expansion which slowed down any progress for capacity improvement. By the late 2000s, the delays have come and gone and it has emerged as a state route that has been largely modernized to deal <b>with</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1930, an NSB Class Cmb1 diesel {{multiple}} unit was taken into use, {{and the number of}} daily trips increased to four. On days <b>with</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic,</b> it hauled a trailer, which was normally stationed at Sandnes Station. On 10 November 1935, the new Ganddal Station opened, simplifying the stopping at the station. During World War II, the {{multiple unit}}s were disused, and instead the trains were hauled with steam locomotives. From 1 May 1944, the line was converted to standard gauge, and NSB Class 14 multiple units were taken into use, running on wood gas {{until the end of the}} war. In 1945, there were four daily round trips, but at the start of 1946, the number of daily round trips increased to six, and from mid-1946, to ten. From 1947 to 1953, there were eight or nine daily round trips, and from 1953 ten. Class 14 was eventually replaced with NSB Class 86 and NSB Class 87 in 1953. By then, the driving time from Ålgård to Sandnes had been reduced from 38 to 25minutes.|$|E

25|$|If PRT designs {{deliver the}} claimed benefit of being {{substantially}} faster than cars in areas <b>with</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic,</b> simulations suggest that PRT could attract many more car drivers than other public transit systems. Standard mass transit simulations accurately predict that 2% of trips (including cars) will switch to trains. Similar methods predict that 11% to 57% of trips would switch to PRT, depending on its costs and delays.|$|E

25|$|Porous paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas <b>with</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E

500|$|Johnston's {{plan was}} to attack Grant's left, {{separate}} the Union army from its gunboat support and avenue of retreat on the Tennessee River, and drive it west into the swamps of Snake and Owl Creeks, where it could be destroyed. The attack on Grant was originally planned for April 4, but it was delayed forty-eight hours due to a heavy rain storm that turned roads into seas of mud, causing some units {{to get lost in}} the woods and others to grind to a halt faced <b>with</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> jams. [...] It ended up taking Johnston 3 days to move his army just 23 miles. This was a significant setback for the Confederate Army, as the originally scheduled attack would have commenced when Buell's Army of the Ohio was too far away to be of any aid to Grant. [...] Instead, it would happen on the 6th with Buell's army close at hand and able to re-enforce Grant on the second day. [...] Furthermore, the delay left the Confederate Army desperately short of rations. [...] They had issued their troops 5 days of rations just before leaving Corinth, but failure to properly conserve their food intake and the 2-day delay left most troops completely out rations by the time the battle commenced.|$|E
2500|$|The Amtrak 30th Street Parking Garage was {{designed}} by BLT Architects and completed in 2004. This nine-level, double helix garage provides 2,100 parking spaces and glass-enclosed stair tower and elevator to offer views of Philadelphia. [...] The following year (2005) the Arch Street Pedestrian Bridge was completed and designed with contribution from BLT Architects. The Arch Street Pedestrian Bridge provides direct access for pedestrians from 30th Street Station to the parking garage and Cira Centre; this prevents pedestrians from interacting <b>with</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> from PA 3 and I-76.|$|E
2500|$|For much of {{the twentieth}} century, streets were {{designed}} by engineers who were charged only with ensuring smooth motor vehicular traffic flow and not with fostering the other functions of streets. Traffic calming initiatives have grown to consider other design functions as well. For example, {{it has been shown}} that car traffic severely impairs the social and recreational functions of public streets. The Livable Streets study by Donald Appleyard (1981) [...] found that residents of streets with light traffic had, on average, three more friends and twice as many acquaintances as the people on streets <b>with</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> which were otherwise similar in dimensions, income, etc.|$|E
50|$|Länsiväylä {{is perhaps}} the most {{important}} connection between the cities of Helsinki and Espoo. Almost all bus and private car traffic between central Helsinki and southern Espoo (such as the Tapiola and Otaniemi districts) passes along Länsiväylä. Along with the beltways Ring I and Ring III, {{it is one of the}} roads <b>with</b> <b>heaviest</b> <b>traffic</b> in the country. It was constructed as a motorway and compared to the beltways, has been much better suited to <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic.</b> There is an extensive bus rapid transit network in Länsiväylä, using special bus lanes. However there is an underground metro system named Länsimetro under construction, which will replace most buses when completed.|$|R
50|$|Pictograms are {{standard}} on all traffic light controlled crossings. Like some other countries, a flashing red sequence is used prior to steady red to clear pedestrians.

2500|$|Jang's {{invention}} of the water clock saw its infusion throughout the country. [...] Yet, these were very costly, and the cheaper and more manageable alternative came about to be the sundial. [...] Jang, Ichun, Kimjo, and other scientists made Korea's first sundial, Angbu Ilgu (앙부일구/), which meant [...] "pot-shaped sun clock staring at the sky". Angbu Ilgu was bronze in composition, and consisted of a bowl marked with 13 meters to indicate time and four legs jointed by a cross at the base. 7 lines crossed the 13 meters in different curves {{to compensate for the}} seasonal changes of the course of the sun. [...] Angbu Ilgu and other variants, such as the Hyeonju Ilgu (현주일구/) and the Cheonpyeong Ilgu (천평일구/), were implemented in strategic spots, such as the main streets <b>with</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic,</b> so that the people could be well informed of the time. [...] To compensate for the high illiteracy rate among the commoners, 12 shapes of animals, such as mouse, tiger, and cow, were engraved in juxtaposition with the meters. No extant Joseon-dynasty sundials today were made during King Sejong's reign, none known to have survived past Imjin wars (임진왜란).|$|E
2500|$|Most railroads <b>with</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>traffic</b> use {{continuously}} welded rails {{supported by}} sleepers attached via base plates that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between {{the rail and}} the tie plate where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat tie plate in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|E
