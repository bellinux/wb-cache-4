5|$|In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, {{moving about}} 100 miles away to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where his uncle had a barber {{shop in the}} Hotel Conneaut. Around 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the {{itinerary}} for dance bands who worked {{up and down the}} Ohio Valley. Como, Roselle, and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent to come up and sing with his band. Young Como <b>was</b> <b>terrified,</b> but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como's performance that he immediately offered him a job.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Ferdinand and Marie {{moved to}} Cotroceni Palace, {{which had been}} {{extended}} by the Romanian architect Grigore Cerchez, and to which Marie added her own designs. The following year, Ferdinand was struck down with typhoid fever. For days, he was delirious and, despite his doctor's best efforts, came close to dying. During this time, Marie exchanged numerous letters with her family in Britain and <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> {{at the prospect of}} losing her husband. King Carol still had an heir in Prince Carol, whose young age presented issues; thus, the whole family desperately wished for Ferdinand to pull through. Eventually, he did, and he and Marie went to Sinaia, the site of Peleș Castle, for a period of recovery. Nonetheless, the couple was not able to attend celebrations for Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee that summer. During Ferdinand's convalescence, Marie spent most of her time with her two children, taking them on long walks and picking flowers with them. The winter of 1897/1898 was spent with the Russian Imperial family on the French Riviera, where Marie often rode horses, in spite of the low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Finland <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> by the Soviet summer {{offensive}} of 1944 {{that was}} coordinated with D-day in France. In two weeks, the Finns evacuated the southern Karelian Isthmus. Another result was German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop's unexpected June 22 arrival in Helsinki to finally rein Finland into the Axis fold.|$|E

25|$|The plot, {{known as}} Operation Ajax, {{centered}} on convincing Iran's monarch {{to issue a}} decree to dismiss Mossadegh from office, as he had attempted some months earlier. But the Shah <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> to attempt such a dangerously unpopular and legally questionable move, {{and it would take}} much persuasion and many U.S. funded meetings, which included bribing his sister Ashraf with a mink coat and money, to successfully change his mind.|$|E
25|$|In April 1941, when he {{was five}} years old, the Germans {{attacked}} Belgrade and the Luftwaffe bombed his home. His parents fled with him to Hungary. There, {{when he was}} eight years old they tried to hide him in a monastery for safekeeping, warning him to keep secret {{the fact that he was}} Jewish. He <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> the entire time that he would be discovered, but says that after that experience he wasn't afraid of anything.|$|E
25|$|Some {{time after}} his death, Saul had the Witch of Endor conjure Samuel's ghost {{in order to}} predict {{the result of an}} up-coming battle. This passage is {{ascribed}} by textual scholars to the Republican Source. Classical rabbinical sources say that Samuel <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> by the ordeal, having expected to be appearing to face God's judgement, and had therefore brought Moses with him (to the land of the living) as a witness to his adherence to the mitzvot.|$|E

25|$|Ronstadt faced {{considerable}} pressure not {{to record}} What's New or record with Riddle. According to jazz historian Peter Levinson, {{author of the}} book September in the Raina Biography on Nelson Riddle, Joe Smith, president of Elektra Records, <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> that the Riddle album would turn off Ronstadt's rock audience. Ronstadt did not completely turn her back on her rock and roll past, however; the video for the title track featured Danny Kortchmar as the old beau that she bumped into during a rainstorm.|$|E
25|$|Although on {{her return}} to Vienna in August 1862, a lady-in-waiting {{reported}} that “she eats properly, sleeps well, and does not tight-lace any more”, her clothing from this time until her death still measured only 18 1/2 – 19 1/2inches around the waist, which prompted the Prince of Hesse to describe her as “almost inhumanly slender.” She developed a horror of fat women and transmitted this attitude to her youngest daughter, who <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> when, as a little girl, she first met Queen Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Galis {{was born}} in Union City, New Jersey. The child of a poor {{immigrant}} family from the Greek islands of Rhodes and Nisyros, Nick took up boxing in his early years, after his father, George Georgalis, who had also been a boxer in his youth. He was persuaded to give up boxing by his mother, Stella Georgalis, who <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> each time that her son would return home with a new facial injury. As a result, he started playing basketball and attended Union Hill High School in Union City.|$|E

25|$|Job was quiet, brief in words, and {{the only}} sound heard from his lips was the Jesus prayer. For many days and weeks he would retreat into his locked cave, so narrow that entry is difficult, and so small that it was {{impossible}} to sit, stand or lie conveniently. From the long periods of kneeling, his knees were covered with wounds, and wearing knee-marks into the rock floor. His disciple Dosyfey recounts that he saw supernatural light coming from the depths of the cave, shining for two hours onto the opposite side of the church. Dosyfey records that at the sight <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> and fell to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Makeup artists Tom Burman and Bari Dreiband-Burman {{and actor}} Jeffrey Jones {{discussed}} {{the appearance of}} the Dark Overlord character with Huyck and Katz, and developed the character's progressing looks. When Katz's daughter visited the set during the shoot, she <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> by Jones' appearance in makeup. The diner sequence combines practical effects, including squibs and air cannons, with visual effects created by ILM. Sound designer Ben Burtt created the voice of the Dark Overlord by altering Jeffrey Jones' voice as his character transformed. Stop motion effects during the climax were designed by Phil Tippett, who began with a clay model before upgrading to more sophisticated pieces.|$|E
25|$|From 22 July 1940 de Gaulle used 4 Carlton Gardens {{in central}} London as his London headquarters. His family had left Brittany (the other ship which {{left at the}} same time was sunk) and lived for a time at Petts Wood. As his {{daughter}} Anne <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> by The Blitz they moved to Ellesmere in Shropshire, a four-hour journey from London and where de Gaulle was only able to visit them once a month. His wife and daughter also lived for a time in the country at Rodinghead House, Little Gaddesden, in Hertfordshire, 45 kilometres (28 miles) from Central London. De Gaulle lived at the Connaught Hotel in London, then from 1942–44 he lived in Hampstead, North London.|$|E

25|$|Sparhawk-Jones {{struggled}} with depression, like her father, {{and when she}} was not well she burned her paintings, which reduced the number of works available for sale. In 1913, Sparhawk-Jones had a mental breakdown and lived in the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane for three years. The experience was hard on her and she was forever changed. Sparhawk-Jones <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> and lonely at the asylum, and may have been subject to opium or sedative drugs. She moved in with her mother after she was released from the hospital in 1916. Sparhawk-Jones dealt with the losses of her teacher William Merritt Chase, who died in 1916, and Morton Shamburg, who died in 1918. She said that she did not work as an artist for about 12 years.|$|E
25|$|In January 2000, a tip-off to Scotland Yard detectives {{exposed a}} plot to kidnap Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham and hold them at a house in Hampstead, London. The family was then moved to a secret location, but no arrests were made. Later in March 2000, she {{received}} a death threat prior to performing at the Brit Awards with the Spice Girls, and in the show's rehearsal, a red laser light appeared on her chest and she was rushed off stage. After a fire door {{was found to be}} lodged open, it was thought that there had been an assassin there, and Beckham later revealed that she <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> by the experience. In November 2002, five people were arrested after another plot for her kidnap was infiltrated by a tabloid newspaper. All charges were dropped after a witness was deemed unreliable.|$|E
25|$|According to Pasternak, {{during the}} 1937 show trial of General Iona Yakir and Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, the Union of Soviet Writers {{requested}} all members to add {{their names to}} a statement supporting {{the death penalty for}} the defendants. They demanded Pasternak's signature as well, but he refused to give it. Vladimir Stavski, the chairman of the Union, <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> that he would be punished for Pasternak's dissent. The leadership of the Union travelled to Pasternak's dacha at Peredelkino and severely threatened the writer, who refused to sign the statement and returned to his dacha. Hearing this, Zinaida Pasternak, who was pregnant, was terribly upset, accusing him of risking the destruction of their family. Pasternak went to bed. He and Zinaida expected to be arrested that evening. They later learned that an NKVD agent was hiding in the bushes outside their window and wrote down every word they said to each other.|$|E

25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She <b>was</b> <b>terrified</b> that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E
