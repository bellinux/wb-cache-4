40|$|Lower Extremity Exoskeleton {{technology}} has been geared towards benefiting medical and augmentation fields. Functional modularity in exoskeleton design allows practitioners to prescribe exoskeletons which can be geared towards the user's needs and abilities. While most modular knee exoskeleton technology either live {{in the realm of}} medicine or augmentation, a stance assistive knee exoskeleton can benefit both able bodied individuals as well as individuals with decreased quadriceps function or knee weakness. Fully passive systems are lower cost but have limited functionality. Powered systems have diverse functionality but are expensive and large. Microcontroller controlled resistive knees are more functionally diverse than fully passive system, but only provide system resistance to motion and can be expensive. Passive microcontroller controlled systems can lead to a low cost and functionally versatile system. By embedding some of the required functionality into the mechanical hardware of the system, the burden on the microcontrollers and need for sensors is reduced. To determine the required functionality the characteristic behavior of the knee during level walking and stair descent were studied. Characteristics for a stance assistive knee joint exoskeleton are derived using biomechanics data. These characteristics are 1) 	The joint provides resistance to flexion during stance 2) 	The joint does not impede extension during stance 3) 	The joint can enter free mode under load at any knee angle 4) 	The joint has very low impedance / is free while extending and flexing during swingA dual jointed architecture with a clutch connected across one joint and a torque generator connected across the other is developed to mechanically achieve requirements 1 and 4. By requiring the clutch or torque generator to provide resistance in one direction but no impedance in the other, characteristic 2 is achieved. By controlling the locking and unlocking of the clutch, characteristic 3 is achieved. The torque generator and clutch requirements can be fulfilled by several passive mechanical components. Several passive mechanical components were analyzed. It was determined that using a <b>wrap</b> <b>spring</b> clutch as the clutch and using a gas spring as the torque generator provides the required characteristics. This combination requires only a small actuator to lock and unlock the clutch. This combination also allows the restoration of energy during extension after it is stored during the resistance phases. This hardware combination results in a stance assistance knee exoskeleton which is relatively small, light and can further help reduce the metabolic cost associated with wearing an exoskeleton. A simplified controller was implemented to gauge system performance. Additional applications for the hardware architecture are proposed. These applications include use of the knee exoskeleton with a modular hip. The hardware is not limited to use as a knee exoskeleton. It can be used to reduce the erector spinae muscles forces in the back, if it is installed at the user's hip. Experiments are proposed to evaluate the effect of the device on the biological joint torque and user's metabolic cost...|$|E

40|$|Recently, other {{researchers}} have demonstrated that force sensing and control capabilities can be implemented on a robot manipulator {{without the use of}} an explicit force/torque sensor. Instead, a measured flexible, or compliant, mechanism is added to an otherwise rigid joint transmission assembly and the joint forces are determined by measuring the compliant mechanism displacement [Williamson, 1995; Shah, 1997]. This thesis investigates an alternative nonlinearly compliant joint transmission mechanism design that may be used to improve the dexterity of future planetary exploration manipulators. The proposed nonlinear compliant element is based on the concept of a <b>wrapping</b> <b>spring</b> that undergoes a continuous decrease in spring free length and a resulting increase in stiffness for greater displacements. Multiple generations of prototypes were constructed to explore and evaluate mechanism design issues regarding the stiffening profile, the robustness, and the manufacturing, assembly, and integration methods. A four degree-of-freedom robot arm was designed and constructed in conjunction with [Katz, 1999] to demonstrate integration of the proposed elements into a manipulator and to conduc...|$|R

50|$|Early {{mattresses}} {{contained a}} variety of natural materials including straw, feathers or horse hair. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, a typical mattress sold in North America had an innerspring core and cotton batting or fiberfill. Modern mattresses usually contain either an inner spring core or materials such as latex, viscoelastic or other flexible polyurethane foams. Other fill components include insulator pads over the coils that prevent the bed's upholstery layers from cupping down into the innerspring, as well as polyester fiberfill in the bed's top upholstery layers. In 1899 James Marshall introduced the first individually <b>wrapped</b> pocketed <b>spring</b> coil mattress now commonly known as Marshall coils.|$|R
50|$|Weaving {{played a}} {{supporting}} role in Joe Johnston's 2010 remake of the 1941 film The Wolfman, starring Benicio del Toro. Immediately after Wolfman <b>wrapped</b> in <b>spring</b> 2008, he returned home to Australia to film a lead role in the film Last Ride, directed by Glendyn Ivin. In early 2009, Guillermo Del Toro, then director of The Hobbit films, prequels to The Lord of the Rings, confirmed his intent to again cast Weaving as Elrond of Rivendell in a BBC interview. When asked about reprising the role, Weaving replied that he was game, but had not officially been approached. Del Toro eventually left the project; Peter Jackson decided to direct the films himself but Weaving was not officially confirmed in the cast until May 2011.|$|R

The shoot, the filmmaker's longest ever, lasted well over a year (after five months of pre-production), and <b>wrapped</b> in <b>spring</b> 1965, leaving the director, his crew and his actors exhausted. Red Beard premiered in April 1965, becoming the year's highest-grossing Japanese production and the third (and last) Kurosawa film to top the prestigious Kinema Jumpo yearly critics poll. It remains one of Kurosawa's best-known and most-loved works in his native country. Outside Japan, critics have been much more divided. Most commentators concede its technical merits and some praise it as among Kurosawa's best, while others insist that it lacks complexity and genuine narrative power, with still others claiming that it represents a retreat from the artist's previous commitment to social and political change.|$|R
50|$|Wrap-spring clutches: These have a helical spring, {{typically}} wound with square-cross-section wire. These {{were developed}} in the late 19th and early 20th century. In simple form the spring is fastened at {{one end to the}} driven member; its other end is unattached. The spring fits closely around a cylindrical driving member. If the driving member rotates in the direction that would unwind the spring the spring expands minutely and slips although with some drag. Because of this, spring clutches must typically be lubricated with light oil. Rotating the driving member the other way makes the <b>spring</b> <b>wrap</b> itself tightly around the driving surface and the clutch locks up very quickly. The torque required to make a spring clutch slip grows exponentially with the number of turns in the spring, obeying the capstan equation.|$|R
40|$|In {{finite element}} (FE) models knee ligaments can {{represented}} either {{by a group}} of one-dimensional springs, or by three-dimensional continuum elements based on segmentations. Continuum models closer approximate the anatomy, and facilitate ligament <b>wrapping,</b> while <b>spring</b> models are computationally less expensive. The mechanical properties of ligaments can be based on literature, or adjusted specifically for the subject. In the current study we investigated the effect of ligament modelling strategy on the predictive capability of FE models of the human knee joint. The effect of literature-based versus specimen-specific optimized material parameters was evaluated. Experiments were performed on three human cadaver knees, which were modelled in FE models with ligaments represented either using springs, or using continuum representations. In spring representation collateral ligaments were each modelled with three and cruciate ligaments with two single-element bundles. Stiffness parameters and pre-strains were optimized based on laxity tests for both approaches. Validation experiments were conducted to evaluate the outcomes of the FE models. Models (both spring and continuum) with subject-specific properties improved the predicted kinematics and contact outcome parameters. Models incorporating literature-based parameters, and particularly the spring models (with the representations implemented in this study), led to relatively high errors in kinematics and contact pressures. Using a continuum modelling approach resulted in more accurate contact outcome variables than the spring representation with two (cruciate ligaments) and three (collateral ligaments) single-element-bundle representations. However, when the prediction of joint kinematics is of main interest, spring ligament models provide a faster option with acceptable outcome...|$|R

There was also a stab wound {{in the area of}} her collarbone, but that was not determined as the cause of death. It is thought that she may have died while unconscious, as defensive wounds were absent on the hand that was recovered from the body, unlike a similar case in Germany, the Kayhausen Boy, who had a cut on his left hand from an apparent defense attempt. As with most bog bodies, the skin and features are still preserved because of the tannic acid in the marsh water. When Yde Girl was excavated, the diggers accidentally caused a wound to the skull. Only the torso of the girl, the head, the right hand and the feet remain intact today. The rest of her body was not preserved or had been damaged by peat cutting tools.|$|R
25|$|The {{body and}} pin meet at either a spring or hinge. The {{earliest}} design is the spring which provides tension to the pin. The spring could be unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral spring winds around {{in one direction}} only. Unilateral springs are the earliest type, first appearing around the 14th century BC. Bilateral springs that wind around to {{both sides of the}} fibula body, appeared around the 6th century BC. Bilateral springs can be very short, with only one or two revolutions per side, or up to 10cm long. Most bilateral springs are made of one piece of metal and therefore have a spring cord, a piece of wire extending {{from one end of the}} spring to the other. The spring cord can pass in front of or behind the fibulae body. Bilateral <b>springs</b> <b>wrap</b> around a pin or axle. These are usually made of iron even if the rest of the fibula and spring is copper alloy. In the 1st century AD some fibulae had springs that were concealed under a metal cover that was an extension of the fibula body. These are known as covered springs, or hidden springs.|$|R
50|$|After the {{enormous}} success of Three's Company in its short first season in 1977, ABC head Fred Silverman {{was anxious to}} capitalize on the show's success. In early 1977, Silverman approached Fell and Lindley with the subject of doing a spin-off from the show after its first full season <b>wrapped</b> in the <b>spring</b> of 1978. Both actors as well as the Three's Company producers begged off as the show had yet to prove itself for an entire season. However, with the show's continued success in its second season, the idea was brought up again in 1978, this time by Three's Company's own producers as well as new ABC head Tony Thomopolous (Silverman went to NBC). The idea intrigued Lindley, but Fell was extremely reluctant, as he was satisfied with his role on a show that was already a proven hit. Fell feared that a spin-off would be unsuccessful and thus put him out of a good role and job. To alleviate his fears, Three's Company producers contractually promised Fell that they would give the new series a year to prove itself. If the show were to be canceled prior to that time, then he and Lindley would return to Three's Company. A reluctant Fell agreed to the new terms.|$|R

50|$|The chrome-lined, four-groove, 9.27mm caliber barrel {{is pressed}} and {{pinned to the}} frame through a precision-machined ring. The 7 kg recoil <b>spring</b> <b>wraps</b> around and is guided by the barrel. The {{spring-loaded}} trigger guard is pivoted down and swung to either side on the frame, allowing removal of the slide. The front sight is integrally machined into the slide, and a 3-4 mm wide textured strip is engraved {{on top of the}} slide in order to prevent aim-disturbing glare. The rear sight is dovetailed into the slide and multiple heights are available to adjust the impact point. The extractor is of an external spring-loaded type, and features a prominent flange preventing loss if a case should rupture. The breech face is deeply recessed in order to aid in extraction and ejection reliability. The stamped sheet steel slide-lock lever has a tail serving the purpose of ejector. The one-piece, wraparound bakelite or plastic grip is reinforced with steel inserts and has a detent inside the screw bushing preventing unscrewing during firing. The sheet-metal mainspring housed inside the grip panel powers the hammer in both the main and rebound stroke, the trigger and the disconnector, while its lower end is the heel and spring of the magazine catch. The sear spring also serves another function, powering the slide lock lever. Makarov pistol parts seldom break with normal usage, and are easily serviced using few tools.|$|R
5000|$|The SG 540 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, {{selective}} fire {{assault rifle}} that fires from a closed bolt position. SIG designers used a long-stroke piston-driven action (with the recoil <b>spring</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the piston rod itself) and an adjustable gas regulator with three settings: [...] "0"—used to launch rifle grenades, [...] "1"—used in normal operating conditions and [...] "2"—used in extreme environmental conditions {{or in the}} presence of heavy fouling. The firearm is locked into battery by means of a rotating bolt which features two heavy steel locking lugs. The bolt head is rotated by a control cam riding in a helical guide slot machined into the bolt carrier. When a shot is fired, propellant gases from the barrel are fed into the gas cylinder located above the barrel and impart rearward pressure on the piston rod, which drives the bolt carrier back. After a certain amount of free travel built into the system to allow the projectile to depart the barrel, residual gas pressures in the bore drop to a safe level, allowing the breech to be opened. The cam slot in the bolt carrier proceeds to actuate the camming stud in the bolt, rotating the bolt head out of engagement with the locking abutments in the receiver. The spent cartridge casing is extracted by a claw extractor contained in the bolt assembly while a protrusion on one of the internal bolt carrier guide rails in the upper receiver acts as the fixed ejector, removing the casing through a port {{on the right side of}} the receiver housing.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to modeling in finite element analysis (FEA) creased thin-film sheets such as those used for drag sails, as well as modeling the packaging behavior of coilable deployable booms. This is highly advantageous because these deployable space structures are challenging to test on the ground due to their lightweight nature and the effects of gravity and air resistance. Such structures are utilized in the space industry due to their low mass and ability to be packaged into a small volume during their launch into space. It is shown that removing the crease bending stiffness in creased sheets still allows the deployment behavior of a benchmark problem to be captured, including deployment forces and equilibrium configurations. In addition, folding creased sheets from a flat state into a packaged configuration can result in crease crumpling and excessive wrinkling. To avoid this the Momentless Crease Force Folding (MCFF) technique is developed. Further presented is the behavior of tape springs and Tubular Rollable and Coilable (TRAC) booms when coiled to radii greater than their natural bend radius. Under these conditions the booms can form multiple localized folds which may jam during boom deployment. Understanding this behavior is important for extending the use of these booms to large scale space structures such as orbital solar power stations. A useful analytical model is developed determining when the localized folds in a tape spring will bifurcate and is verified against simulation results. Additionally, a numerical model of the wrapping an isotropic tape spring around a hub with a radius greater than the localized fold radii is validated against physical experiments. This model is used to predict trends in the force required to fully <b>wrap</b> a tape <b>spring</b> around a given hub radii. Finally, when examining the coiling and uncoiling behavior of TRAC booms {{it was found that the}} tension force required to keep a TRAC boom tightly coiled is significantly less than the force required to initially coil the boom. </p...|$|R
