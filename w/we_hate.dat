5|$|Richard H. Fallon {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Harvard Magazine, and characterized Freedom for the Thought That <b>We</b> <b>Hate</b> as a clear and captivating background education to U.S. freedom of speech legislation. Fallon praised the author's ability to weave descriptions of historical events into an entertaining account. Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press. She observed that the book forcefully presented the author's admiration of brave judges who had helped to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as a defense against censorship.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That <b>We</b> <b>Hate</b> {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
5|$|Jeremy Waldron {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The New York Review of Books, and was critical of Lewis' broad stance towards freedom of speech with respect to hate speech. Waldron later elaborated this position in his 2012 book The Harm in Hate Speech, in which he devoted an entire chapter to Lewis' book. Waldron emphasized that the problem with an expansive view of free speech is not the harm of hateful thoughts, but rather the negative impact resulting from widespread publication of the thoughts. He questioned whether children of racial groups criticized by widely published hate speech {{would be able to}} succeed in such an environment. Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens analyzed The Harm in Hate Speech and discussed Freedom for the Thought That <b>We</b> <b>Hate,</b> in a review for The New York Review of Books. Justice Stevens recounted Lewis' argument that an acceptance of hate speech is necessary, because attempts to regulate it would cause encroachment upon expression of controversial viewpoints. He pointed out that Lewis and Waldron agreed that Americans have more freedom of speech than citizens of any other country. In his review, Stevens cited the 2011 decision in Snyder v. Phelps as evidence {{that the majority of the}} U.S. Supreme Court supported the right of the people to express hateful views on matters of public importance. Stevens concluded that, although Waldron was unsuccessful in convincing him that legislators should ban all hate speech, The Harm in Hate Speech persuaded him that government leaders should refrain from using such language themselves.|$|E

Simpson trial, {{the mood}} in our city was unsettling, and on our first day of high school, we had only three things in common: <b>we</b> <b>hated</b> school, <b>we</b> <b>hated</b> our teacher, and <b>we</b> <b>hated</b> each other." [...] This is a quote from the {{original}} Freedom Writers. Brought together in the classroom of Erin Gruwell, these students were taught to accept each other and accept themselves.|$|R
500|$|In {{the first}} edition of The Hobbit, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably. In the second edition edits, to reflect the new concept of the ring and its corrupting abilities, Tolkien made Gollum more {{aggressive}} towards Bilbo and distraught at losing the ring. The encounter ends with Gollum's curse, [...] "Thief! Thief, Thief, Baggins! <b>We</b> <b>hates</b> it, <b>we</b> <b>hates</b> it, <b>we</b> <b>hates</b> it forever!" [...] This presages Gollum's portrayal in The Lord of the Rings.|$|R
5000|$|Black novelist James Baldwin (1924-1987) {{grew up in}} Harlem in {{the years}} between the world wars. He wrote, In Harlem.... our ... landlords were Jews, and <b>we</b> <b>hated</b> them. <b>We</b> <b>hated</b> them because they were terrible landlords and did not {{take care of the}} buildings. The grocery store owner was a Jew... The butcher was a Jew and, yes, we {{certainly}} paid more for bad cuts of meat than other New York citizens, and we very often carried insults home along with our meats... and the pawnbroker was a Jew—perhaps <b>we</b> <b>hated</b> him most of all.|$|R

When Ramtanu Lahiri was in the third class (second year, as per today’s concept), the followers of Derozio published a monthly magazine named Athenium. One of the students, Madhab Chandra Mallick, wrote in it, “If there is anything <b>we</b> <b>hate</b> {{from the bottom of}} our heart, it is Hinduism.” Madhab Chandra Mallick was a friend of Ramtanu Lahiri and was later posted as a deputy collector in Krishnanagar.|$|E
500|$|Freedom for the Thought That <b>We</b> <b>Hate</b> {{analyzes}} {{the value of}} freedom of speech and presents an overview of the historical development of rights afforded by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Its title derives from Justice Holmes' admonition, in his dissenting opinion in United States v. Schwimmer (1929), that the First Amendment's guarantees are most worthy of protection in times of fear and upheaval, when calls for suppression of dissent are most strident and superficially appealing. Holmes wrote that [...] "if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other, it is the principle of free thought—not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate." ...|$|E

500|$|Freedom for the Thought That <b>We</b> <b>Hate</b> {{was first}} {{published}} by Basic Books, {{a member of the}} Perseus Books Group, in New York in 2007, with the subtitle, A Biography of the First Amendment. For just the second printing, in both New York and London in 2008, the book's subtitle was simplified to Tales of the First Amendment. [...] That change was reverted for the remaining printings, including the paperback edition in 2009 and a large print edition in 2010. [...] E-book versions were released for the first, third and fourth printings; an audiobook was released with the second printing, and re-released with the fourth. The book has also been translated into Chinese, and was published in Beijing in 2010.|$|E
500|$|Matsui {{had told}} friends {{before going to}} Sugamo Prison that at the IMTFE he planned to defend not only himself but also Japan's wartime conduct as a whole. Matsui insisted that Japan had acted defensively against {{aggression}} by foreign powers and that Japan's war aims were to liberate Asia from Western imperialism. Concerning {{the origins of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War, Matsui called it [...] "a fight between brothers within the 'Asian family'" [...] and stated that the war was fought against the Chinese, not [...] "because <b>we</b> <b>hate</b> them, but on the contrary because we love them too much. It is just the same in a family when an elder brother has taken all that he can stand from his ill-behaved younger brother and has to chastise him in order to make him behave properly." ...|$|E
500|$|Lucas Bros. Moving Co. is an {{animated}} television series created by twins Kenny and Keith Lucas of [...] "The Lucas Brothers", a Brooklyn-based comedy duo. The series, featuring {{the voices of}} the twins as their animated counterparts, originally had them working as installers for a cable company, a job which the Lucas brothers occupied in real life. This idea was scrapped according to Keith, who felt the premise too close to that of The Cleveland Show, another animated series aired by Fox. Kenny insisted that [...] "moving was just more Brooklyn", a sentiment which Keith echoed, thinking that [...] "it would be funny if we were movers because we've never moved a thing in our lives and we're so fucking weak and <b>we</b> <b>hate</b> physical labor". Keith complemented the nature of the premise, finding it to be flexible with any character or setting.|$|E
6000|$|Most {{authors in}} writing of [...] "the merry merry farmer" [...] leave out {{experiences}} like this--they omit {{the mud and}} the dust and the grime, they forget the army worm, the flies, the heat, {{as well as the}} smells and drudgery of the barns. Milking the cows is spoken of in the traditional fashion as a lovely pastoral recreation, when {{as a matter of fact}} it is a tedious job. <b>We</b> all <b>hated</b> it. <b>We</b> saw no poetry in it. <b>We</b> <b>hated</b> it in summer when the mosquitoes bit and the cows slashed us with their tails, and <b>we</b> <b>hated</b> it still more in the winter time when they stood in crowded malodorous stalls.|$|R

500|$|The split-reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1000 {{feet long}} with A Husband's Jealous Wife included, {{was released on}} September 23, 1910. Advertising for the film was a bit mixed {{as to whether or}} not it was a comedy or a drama, stating, [...] "You have no idea as to how marvelously a Thanhouser can twist a story until you see this gripping dra - well, perhaps, it isn't a drama at that - or a comedy even. <b>We</b> <b>hate</b> to tip you off as to WHAT it is. When you see the picture, with its totally unlooked-for climax, you'll know why!" [...] Bowers would later term this as more of the slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser said the company would not produce. The film likely had a wide national release, known advertising theatres include Indiana, and Kansas. The film was also shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. One theater advertisement may have confused this film with another because it lists this film as a western film.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Arwadi in {{particular}} has expressed his belief in Christianity {{that is not a}} religion, but more about faith, as in his opinion most religions are about laws, organizations, rites, and dogmas. In one interview, Jeff clarified that for him personally, faith is something that drives the human life, and, just like diet and exercise, {{does not have to be}} associated with religion whatsoever. When asked to clear up the [...] "confusion" [...] surrounding the band's stance regarding God, Christianity, and religions in general, Jeff responded that his views about religion are [...] "very different than the view in western countries," [...] and further said that [...] "in Indonesia, religion is not an issue of faith nor tradition. It's more the constitutional issue, that means the legal and political ones. I am not anti-religion person, but I do against religion in a political and legal context" [...] and then Jeff added his point on Kekal's stance as a band: [...] "...we are non-conformists, musical anarchists. <b>We</b> <b>hate</b> being trendy and we never try to be the same with the rest of the scene. People can love us or hate us, I don't care." ...|$|E
500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where <b>we</b> <b>hate</b> touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{meaning of}} this is that we must so change in feelings, as no longer to be the same persons. The things that we loved <b>we</b> must <b>hate,</b> and the things that <b>we</b> <b>hated,</b> or at least neglected, we must love. When we feel this change in our hearts, then may we hope that we love and reverence the Great Spirit, and are living under his holy care." ...|$|R

500|$|The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza {{tour with}} Metallica, who {{had insisted on}} Soundgarden's {{appearance}} on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: [...] "We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you {{to come out and}} play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where <b>we</b> <b>hate</b> touring." [...] At the tour's last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction." [...] Cameron later said that Soundgarden was [...] "eaten up by the business". The band released a greatest hits collection entitled A-Sides on November 4, 1997, composed of 17 songs, including the previously-unreleased [...] "Bleed Together," [...] which had been recorded during the Down on the Upside recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|In part, Wilson's {{objections}} {{stemmed from}} dislike of Dmowski personally. One British diplomat stated, [...] "He was a clever man, and clever men are distrusted; he was logical in his political theories and <b>we</b> <b>hate</b> logic; {{and he was}} persistent with a tenacity which was calculated to drive everybody mad." [...] Another area of objection to Dmowski was with his antisemitic remarks, as in a speech he delivered at a dinner organized by the writer G. K. Chesterton, {{that began with the}} words, [...] "My religion came from Jesus Christ, who was murdered by the Jews." [...] When British Prime Minister David Lloyd George criticized Dmowski and the Committee, Dmowski saw this as a result of Lloyd George's representation of Jewish interests. He refused to admit a single Polish Jew to the National Committee, despite support for such a proposal from Paderewski. A number of American and British Jewish organizations campaigned during the war against their governments recognizing the National Committee. Another leading critic of Dmowski was the historian Sir Lewis Namier, a Jew who served as the British Foreign Office's resident expert on Poland during the war, and who claimed to be personally offended by antisemitic remarks made by Dmowski. Namier fought hard against British recognition of Dmowski and [...] "his chauvinist gang". In turn, Dmowski's experiences at that time convinced him of the existence of an international [...] "Judeo-Masonic conspiracy, unfriendly towards Poland and intrasigently hostile to his [...] party." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1975 the {{movement}} was already well established in London and had been growing {{for a number of}} years. Inspired by music from the Velvet Underground, Iggy Pop and early David Bowie at one point the band featured Sid Vicious, Marco Pirroni and Viv Albertine, who later joined the Slits. Following a brief period unofficially managing the New York Dolls, Briton Malcolm McLaren returned to London in May 1975, inspired by the new scene he had witnessed at CBGB. The Kings Road clothing store he co-owned, recently renamed Sex, was building a reputation with its outrageous [...] "anti-fashion". Among those who frequented the shop were members of a band called the Strand, which McLaren had also been managing. In August, the group was seeking a new lead singer. Another Sex habitué, Johnny Rotten, auditioned for and won the job. Adopting a new name, the group played its first gig as the Sex Pistols on November 6, 1975, at Saint Martin's School of Art and soon attracted a small but ardent following. In February 1976, the band received its first significant press coverage; guitarist Steve Jones declared that the Sex Pistols were not so much into music as they were [...] "chaos". The band often provoked its crowds into near-riots. Rotten announced to one audience, [...] "Bet you don't hate us as much as <b>we</b> <b>hate</b> you!" [...] McLaren envisioned the Sex Pistols as central players in a new youth movement, [...] "hard and tough". As described by critic Jon Savage, the band members [...] "embodied an attitude into which McLaren fed a new set of references: late-sixties radical politics, sexual fetish material, pop history,...youth sociology".|$|E
60|$|I lost {{my temper}} at his persistence, and swore to myself. For a time <b>we</b> <b>hated</b> {{one another in}} silence. I drummed with my fingers on the floor between my knees, and gritted the links of my fetters together. Presently I was forced to talk again.|$|R
50|$|I {{just wanted}} to have a really wild all-girl band that was like a gang or something.

We had all the same ideas about bands and life and {{drinking}} and everything.|$|R
5000|$|Not all combatants were {{motivated}} by ideological or political concerns. As Mo Fishman, {{a veteran of the}} battalion, recalled in 2006, [...] "Some men were running away from bad marital or love situations, but what united all of us was that <b>we</b> <b>hated</b> fascism." [...] Anti-fascism, more than any other single factor, is what motivated and united the volunteers of the Lincoln Battalion.|$|R

2500|$|Before {{and after}} their meeting in 2010, players from both schools {{attributed}} {{the importance of}} the game to the negative feelings the programs have for each other. Virginia center Anthony Mihota said [...] "I guess it's because we don't like them very much. Something about them that gets under our skin".
