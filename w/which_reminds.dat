5|$|In New York City, Stephen Strange, an {{acclaimed}} but arrogant neurosurgeon, badly injures {{his hands}} in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange eventually learns of Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained full use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She eventually agrees to train Strange, despite his arrogance, <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> her of Kaecilius.|$|E

25|$|The Vithkuqi {{alphabet}} (1844). From 1824 to 1844, Naum Veqilharxhi {{developed and}} promoted a 33-letter alphabet {{which he had}} printed in an eight-page Albanian spelling book in 1844. This little spelling book was distributed throughout southern Albania, from Korçë to Berat, and was received, as it seems, with {{a good deal of}} enthusiasm. In the following year, 1845, the booklet was augmented to forty-eight pages in a now equally rare second edition entitled Faré i ri abétor shqip per djélm nismetore (A very new Albanian spelling book for elementary schoolboys). However, the resonance of this original alphabet, <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> one at first glance of a type of cursive Armenian, was in fact limited, {{due in part to the}} author's premature death one year later and in part no doubt to financial and technical considerations. In the mid-nineteenth century, when publishing was making great strides even in the Balkans, a script requiring a new font for printing would have resulted in prohibitive costs for any prospective publisher. As such, although reasonably phonetic and confessionally neutral, the Veqilharxhi alphabet never took hold.|$|E
25|$|Carving {{in relief}} is common enough, idols being {{produced}} in many forms. The South African carves {{the handle of}} his spoon perhaps {{in the form of}} a giraffe, and in the round, with each leg cut separately and the four hoofs meeting at the bowl, hardly a comfortable form of handle to hold. The North American Indian shows a wider invention than some nations, the twist in various shapes being a favorite treatment say of pipe stems. The Papuan has quite a style of his own; he uses a scroll of the form familiar in Indian shawls, and in some cases the scroll entwines in a way which faintly suggests the guilloche. The native of New Guinea also employs the scroll for a motive, the flat treatment of <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> one of a similar method in use in Scandinavian countries. The work of the New Zealander is greatly in advance of the average primitive type; he uses a very good scheme of scroll work for decorative purposes, the lines of the scrolls often being enriched with a small pattern in a way reminding one of the familiar Norman treatment, as for example the prows of his canoes. The Maori wood carver sometimes carves not only the barge boards of his house but the gables also, reptilian and grotesque figures being as a rule introduced; the main posts and rafters, too, of the inside receive attention. Unlike the Hindu he has a good idea of decorative proportion, and does not plan his scheme of design on too small a scale.|$|E

25|$|Śrīrāghavapriyādarśanam (Sanskrit: श्रीराघवप्रियादर्शनम्). Viśvāmitra, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa {{arrive in}} Mithilā. Rāma {{is pleased to}} be in the city of Mithilā, but the other kings who have come in Sītā's Svayaṃvara are not pleased about his arrival. The people of Mithilā {{experience}} bliss in seeing Rāma. When Janaka asks Viśvāmitra about the two princes, Viśvāmitra introduces Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Janaka. Janaka takes both princes to his palace and welcomes them. Later Lakṣmaṇa wishes to see the city of Mithilā and Rāma accompanies him. The children of Mithilā take Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa around the city, and embrace Rāma in the end. Early morning on the next day, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa go to the royal garden of Janaka to get flowers for Viśvāmitra's worship. Sītā arrives in the same garden to worship Pārvatī on the day before her Svayaṃvara. Sītā and Rāma see each other for the first time when they come face-to-face in the garden. Rāma tells Lakṣmaṇa about the attraction he feels for Sītā. He tells Lakṣmaṇa that Sītā must be his wife in future, for even in his dreams his mind never longs for the wife of another. Lakṣmaṇa then bows to Sītā, thinking of her as his mother. Sītā worships Rāma in her mind and then departs for her palace after worshipping Pārvatī. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa return to Viśvāmitra and worship him with the flowers from Janaka's royal garden. Rāma tells Viśvāmitra everything about the attraction he felt for Sītā. Viśvāmitra blesses Rāma and goes to sleep. Rāma is awake in the night, admiring the beauty of the moon <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> him of the face of Sītā.|$|E

For Ego and Skinner, Remy and Colette create a variation of ratatouille, <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> an astonished Ego of his mother's cooking. During the meal, the rats are forced to tie up Skinner and a health inspector to prevent them from revealing the rats' involvement in the cooking. When Ego requests to see the chef, Linguini and Colette make him wait until the rest of the diners have left before introducing Remy. Ego is stunned and leaves the restaurant, deep in thought. He writes a positive and thoughtful review for the newspaper the next day, stating that Gusteau's chef (Remy) is [...] "nothing less than the finest chef in France." ...|$|E
500|$|Ocala Star-Banner critic Jon Burlingame {{praised the}} episode for its [...] "smart humor" [...] and stated the show {{could be a}} perfect fit between Cheers and L.A. Law. Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling of Entertainment Weekly reacted very {{positively}} to the episode and praised Alexander's performance in particular, stating [...] "George's profound self-hatred is now in full bloom ('Please, a little respect, for I am Costanza, Lord of the Idiots!'). Kramer's input, meanwhile, remains limited to off-the-wall, often annoying cameos. <b>Which</b> <b>reminds</b> us: Why {{in the world has}} Alexander been denied an Emmy, while Richards has scored two?" [...] Schilling and Flaherty graded the episode with a B+. However, The Kitchener-Waterloo Record critic Bonnie Malleck gave the episode a particular negative review, comparing Seinfeld to It's Garry Shandling's Show, she stated [...] "Seinfeld isn't neurotic enough to be as funny as [...] So, instead of being nervously funny, he's just nervously dull".|$|E

500|$|... "Freakum Dress" [...] was {{conceived}} at Sony Music Studios, in New York City, when Beyoncé enlisted Harris to co-produce for her album B'Day (2006). She and Harrison had previously collaborated on her 2003 single [...] "Crazy in Love". She arranged for Harrison, Sean Garrett and Rodney Jerkins {{to be given}} individual rooms at the studio. In this way, Beyoncé fostered [...] "healthy competition" [...] between the producers by going into each of their rooms and commenting on the [...] "great beats" [...] the others were creating. Roger Friedman of Fox News Channel noted that [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] and [...] "Suga Mama" [...] (2006), Harrison's other contribution to B'Day [...] "fall short of originality but mimic the Chi Lites percussion section [...] yet again", adding, [...] "Harrison is like the Indiana Jones of soul, constantly pulling out forgotten gems of the past for sampling [...] You can't help but think: Thank God someone wrote music {{in the past that}} can be repurposed now." [...] Harrison wrote [...] "Freakum dress to demonstrate how a sassy sartorial item that can help recharge to a relationship", with Beyoncé and Makeba Riddick also contributing In an interview with USA Today, Beyoncé talked about the content [...] "Freakum Dress", stating that an outfit <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> of the best moments in a couple's life, is a necessity for every woman's wardrobe.|$|E
500|$|Although the eponymous Baker {{brothers}} are the default {{stars of the}} film, Susie {{is considered to be}} the film's [...] "centerpiece". Film critic Mike D'angelo, writing for The Dissolve, observed that [...] "the character's name is Susie Diamond, and she's written like a woman named Susie Diamond, and Pfeiffer plays her ... like a woman named Susie Diamond." [...] As a romantic film, The Fabulous Baker Boys focuses on [...] "the unfulfilled longing between" [...] bandmates Susie and Jack. Susie is the only woman capable of changing [...] "the aloof, uncommunicative Jack... by throwing incendiary tantrums and sounding even tougher than he does", slowly inspiring the pianist to change the person he has allowed himself to become. Rolling Stones Peter Travers believes that Susie and Jack bond because both characters are [...] "losers who've sold themselves on the cheap"; Jack is a skilled musician who despises himself for squandering his talent, <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> former escort Susie of herself. Pfeiffer agreed that her character essentially becomes [...] "a mirror image for Jack" [...] although both remain very different individuals. While Jack is depicted as timid and cautious about his decisions, Susie rather [...] "embraces life" [...] instead. An adventurous individual, Susie refuses to do only one thing, including perform, for her entire life. Pfeiffer observed that although her character has spent a significant portion of her life as an escort, she remains less of a [...] "whore" [...] than Jack because she retains her individuality, while Jack [...] "has ceased to be a vital human being." [...] When Susie and Jack have their final argument, the profanity Jack uses actually helps establish Susie as the stronger character, according to Mark R. Hasan of KQEK.com. Susie's nicknames for her bandmates reveal exactly how she feels about both brothers individually; while she refers to Frank as [...] "Egghead" [...] because of his growing bald spot and tendency to act unintelligent at times, she calls Jack simply [...] "Baker" [...] because, in her opinion, [...] "there's really only one Baker brother and he's it." [...] The way Susie teases Frank is reminiscent of how Jack used to treat him several years before she joined the band when he had energy to do it.|$|E

2500|$|In a review, The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "a first-rate novel", stating that [...] "Sethi's prose evokes the comic mislocutions of Jonathan Safran Foer and the vertiginous mania of Zadie Smith. The Wall Street Journal stated that, [...] "Mr. Sethi is {{especially}} alive {{to the emotional}} contours of young love, its modes of courtship, its methods of subterfuge... Mr. Sethi's prose, always lucid, often soars to illuminate the quotidian." [...] Arifa Akbar of The Independent also reviewed the book positively saying, [...] "Sethi's narration is engaging and funny, and although it rambles off into distracted corners at times, it is slickly structured. It takes us from the present day, back across personal and political histories, and returns to a bittersweet ending <b>which</b> <b>reminds</b> us {{of the power of}} making wishes and the miracle of having them, even in part, fulfilled." ...|$|E
