500|$|Eleven {{weeks before}} the Beatles' arrival in the U.S. President JohnF. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The nation was in mourning, in fear, and in disbelief. The {{assassination}} came after a fifteen-year build-up of Cold War tension. The motivation and identity of the assassin would be doubted by many Americans for decades, despite the Warren Commission's issued report in September 1964. As the United States tried to restore a sense of normality, teenagers in particular struggled to cope, as their disbelief began {{to be replaced by}} a personal reaction to what had happened: in school essays, teenagers wrote that [...] "then it became real", and [...] "I was feeling the whole <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to collapse on me", and [...] "I never felt so empty in all my life".|$|E
500|$|The {{final three}} episodes {{of the season}} were [...] "linked in one {{continuous}} story arc," [...] and meant to seem like [...] "you're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel. And usually in a good novel, the last pages [...] compels you forward with {{a new understanding of}} what the subject matter is and you get deeper and you can’t wait to turn that page." [...] The crew wrote the finale before the season was officially renewed, but deigned to leave it unchanged once discovering that a fourth season had been approved. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming that we would be on for Season 4. We never for one second entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] The finale was designed to establish the groundwork by [...] "open a new chapter" [...] for the new season, which included Peter having never existed. Its futuristic storyline was meant to [...] "inform the present of the show with some thematic elements," [...] establishing to viewers that [...] "our <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to break down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Outlining his {{industry}} and climate policies on ABC's 7:30 Program in May 2011, Bob Brown voiced {{support for a}} reduction in subsidies to fossil fuel industries, {{the implementation of a}} price on carbon; a higher level of profit tax on the mining {{industry and}} a phasing out of Australia's coal export industry, saying: [...] "The <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to do that because it is causing massive economic damage down the line through the impact of climate change." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{depositions}} for the case, Trump told {{attorneys in}} December 2007, [...] "My net worth fluctuates, {{and it goes}} {{up and down with}} markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings." [...] Trump clarified, [...] "Yes, even my own feelings as to where the world is, where the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going,</b> and that can change rapidly from day to day. Then you have a September 11th, and you don't feel so good about yourself and you don't feel so good about the world and you don't feel so good about New York City. Then you have a year later, and the city is as hot as a pistol. Even months after that it was a different feeling. So yeah, even my own feelings affect my value to myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, on a {{broadcast}} of The 700 Club, Robertson {{stated that he}} is [...] "adamantly opposed" [...] to the division of Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians. He also stated that Armageddon is [...] "not going to be fought at Megiddo" [...] but will be the [...] "battle of Jerusalem," [...] when [...] "the forces of all nations come together and try to take Jerusalem away from the Jews. Jews {{are not going to}} give up Jerusalem—they shouldn't—and the rest of the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to insist they give it up." [...] Robertson added that Jerusalem is a [...] "spiritual symbol that must not be given away" [...] because [...] "Jesus Christ the Messiah will come down to the part of Jerusalem that the Arabs want," [...] and that's [...] "not good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In which case," [...] said Mrs. Archibald, quickly, [...] "I am {{sure that}} my husband will be very glad to speak to you. But why, may I ask, were you so {{disturbed}} when you came here, just now? You said the <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> wrong." ...|$|R

Now I've got time to be able to start doing things for my own project." [...] Royce da 5'9" [...] appeared on MTV's RapFix, hosted by Calloway, with his group Slaughterhouse, on August 30, 2012, and talked about Eminem's album. Royce confessed: [...] "Marshall is the studio right now, laying the most awesome lyrics in the world.

2500|$|Fantino {{was criticized}} by lawyer Peter Rosenthal {{during the trial}} of {{aboriginal}} activist Shawn Brant. Fantino was criticized for ordering wiretaps of Brant's phone without proper authority and for making provocative comments to Brant during negotiations to end a blockade of the rail line west of Kingston. By way of those illegal wiretaps, Fantino was recorded saying to Brant [...] "You are going to force me to do everything I can; within your community and everywhere else; to destroy your reputation" [...] and [...] "your whole <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to come crashing down" [...] NDP MPP Peter Kormos called for Fantino's resignation accusing him of using [...] "pugnacious and bellicose" [...] rhetoric and for engaging in [...] "Rambo-style policing." [...] In the face of defence motions {{for the police to}} disclose more evidence about their conduct the Crown agreed to drop the most serious charges against Brant in exchange for a plea bargain resulting in a light sentence. Fantino was also criticized {{for his role in the}} Caledonia land dispute after he was accused of sending e-mails to local politicians accusing them of encouraging anti-police rallies by non-Natives.|$|E

Some analysts ventured that the <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{through a period}} of deglobalization and protectionism after years of increasing economic integration.|$|R
60|$|The two {{talked and}} {{agreed that the}} Cemetery was depressing.

6000|$|... "It's strange," [...] he added, [...] "how we {{all have}} that belief when we are {{children}} that the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to burn up!

6000|$|... "There will {{be plenty}} of time for you, Ralph," [...] his mother said smiling.

5000|$|The <b>world</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to suffer}} the most {{dramatic}} change it ever experienced, and that this change {{would not be a}} cataclysm but the complete disruption of the beliefs of man, prompting the establishment of a new faith, capable of harmonizing with science, to prevent science [...] "alone" [...] from leading mankind to madness.|$|R
50|$|The Clyde Valley Regional Plan played {{its part}} in shaping post-war Scotland.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} was to look into {{the state of the art}} of (automatic) {{distribution}} of services in peer-to-peer environments.

6000|$|... "I cannot stand picking {{my words}} {{when the whole}} <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> round with me, and my very brain is on fire. What is it to me what my words are?

6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to be a {{lecturer}} to-day. I'm {{not going to}} analyze the plays of Shaw which I assigned to you. You're supposed to have read them yourselves.

We'd be getting excited over Shaw and Wells. There's something really worth getting excited over.|$|E
6000|$|So that I {{think that}} even if the creeds, from the {{so-called}} [...] "Apostles'" [...] to the so-called [...] "Athanasian," [...] were swept into oblivion; and even if the human race should arrive at the conclusion that, whether a bishop washes a cup or leaves it unwashed, {{is not a matter of}} the least consequence, it will get on very well. The causes which have led to the development of morality in mankind, which have guided or {456} impelled us all the way from the savage to the civilised state, will not cease to operate because a number of ecclesiastical hypotheses turn out to be baseless. And, even if the absurd notion that morality is more the child of speculation than of practical necessity and inherited instinct, had any foundation; if all the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to thieve, murder, and otherwise misconduct itself as soon as it discovers that certain portions of ancient history are mythical; what is the relevance of such arguments to any one who holds by the Agnostic principle? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{signs of}} the times show plainly enough what <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen.

This coming fate might have been a calamity to those savage peoples two hundred years ago; but now it will in some cases be a benefaction. The sooner the seizure is consummated, the better for the savages.|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the time}} the video was created, the United States invaded Iraq, which {{ultimately}} led to the Iraq War.
