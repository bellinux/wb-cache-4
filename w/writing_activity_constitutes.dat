40|$|Drawing on data {{collected}} in an ethnographic study of kindergarten journal writing activity, this article demonstrates how {{students who are}} not directly participating in instruction are nevertheless key contributors to the social construction of literacy knowledge. More specifically, this study examines how the participation framework of <b>writing</b> <b>activity</b> <b>constitutes</b> and is constituted by the context for learning to write. Five interconnected roles in the participation framework are identified in the data and presented as a shared indexical context within which children's texts are interactionally negotiated. The author argues for a reconceptualization of classroom language and literacy practices from current dyadicbased participation frameworks to more expanded multi-party participation frameworks that allow for flexible access to the social construction of literacy knowledge. By changing the ways in which students participate in school-based literacy practices, students will be socialized to more democratic access to participation in classrooms and in the larger society. This reconceptualization of classroom language and literacy practices attempts to disrupt monolithic definitions of literacy as a reified set of "neutral" skills by challenging the sanctity of dyadic interaction in literacy activity...|$|E
30|$|Analysis of pedagogic {{activity}} {{proceeds from}} both above and below. i.e. from {{the functions of}} lesson activities in the curriculum genre, down to the functions of learning cycle phases. The curriculum genre {{in this case is}} Joint Construction, and the lesson stage is Text Negotiation, that has followed a Note Making stage; the activity involves using the notes to create a new text. Within the Text Negotiation stage, each lesson activity includes the phases Focus (specifying the task), Task (creating the text) and Evaluate/Elaborate (review the text). From below, the first Prepare phase functions to preview the writing task, the next phases (2) start writing, and the next (3) review the genre structure. From above, the general function of these phases is to specify the <b>writing</b> <b>activity,</b> <b>constituting</b> the Focus phase of the lesson activity. Cycle 4 commences the writing task, by specifying the first lexical item in the sentence. Cycles 5 complete the sentence, by specifying the following structures and items. These cycles thus commence the Task phase of the lesson activity.|$|R

For this reason, the ability to move beyond memorization and think critically is an essential skill for engineering students. Writing is an effective pedagogic tool for helping undergraduate students to develop such critical thinking skills (Bean, 2011). Moreover, research shows that short <b>writing</b> <b>activities</b> can help engineering students deepen their understanding of complex concepts so that they are prepared to engage more critically with course content (Kågesten & Engelbrecht, 2006; Welch Gradin & Sandell, 2002; Wheeler & McDonald, 2000).
