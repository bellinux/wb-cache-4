40|$|This is {{the fifth}} time I have {{composed}} this overview of current writings on American library history, which means that {{for the past ten}} years I have carefully monitored the amount and variety of scholarship that has appeared every two years from the little band of scholars who continually explore our corner of the historical canvas. As usual, our colleagues have been busy providing the rest of us with a <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>writings</b> and interpretations of our library past that will in turn foster yet more research and more thought about the role libraries, librarianship, and book culture have played in our nation 2 ̆ 7 s journey to the present. So with this brief introduction, let us now begin our journey through this most recent outpouring of scholarship on American library history...|$|E
50|$|Given the <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> her <b>writings</b> {{that survive}} {{and which are}} now {{beginning}} to become widely available as online resources, there is a puzzling lack of scholarship on Hume. One article by Phyllis Mack of Rutgers University is not focused specifically on Hume, but does discuss her place in both Quaker history and the larger contexts of women writers and feminism.|$|R
25|$|Justice Wilcox's {{judgment}} is noteworthy for several reasons. It highlights Perth's <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> post-European settlement <b>writings</b> which provide {{an insight into}} Aboriginal life, including laws and customs, {{around the time of}} settlement in 1829 and also into the beginning of the last century. These documents enabled Justice Wilcox to find that laws and customs governing land throughout the whole Single Noongar Claim (taking in Perth, and many other towns in the greater South West) were those of a single community. The claimants shared a language and had extensive interaction with others in the claim area.|$|R
6000|$|Any one unversed in old English is {{familiar}} with the difficulty of reading Chaucer in the original--to many it is not only a difficulty, but an impossibility. The vast literary <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> Chaucer's <b>writings</b> has been therefore up to this time beyond the grasp of the general reader--for there has been no complete rendering in modern English. It is to do away with this condition that [...] "The Modern Reader's Chaucer" [...] has been prepared. Adhering closely to the original, the editors have rendered in modern English all the wonderful tales of this early poet. A particular feature of the volume is the illustrations, of which there are thirty-two in colors from paintings by Warwick Goble, the celebrated English artist. From the standpoint of artistic book making it is to be doubted if a handsomer book will be published {{for some time to come}} or even one which will stand comparison with this.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about net {{national}} product (NNP). We are concerned with what NNP means, what it should include, what it offers us and, therefore, why we {{may be interested in}} it. We show that NNP, properly defined, {{can be used as a}} gauge for project evaluation, but we also show that it should not be used in any of its more customary roles, such as in making intertemporal and cross-country comparisons of social well-being. We develop such indices as would be appropriate for making such comparisons. In particular, we show that comparisons of social well-being should involve comparisons <b>of</b> <b>wealth.</b> <b>Writings</b> on the welfare economics of NNP have mostly addressed economies pursuing optimal policies. Our analysis includes not only such economies, but also those where the government is capable of engaging only in policy reforms. The literature on green NNP has widely interpreted NNP as a "constant-equivalent consumption stream". We show that this interpretation offers no purchase. It is the Hamiltonian that equals a constant-equivalent utility stream and we argue that, as the Hamiltonian is typically a non-linear function of consumption and leisure, it is of little practical use. Allocative efficiency, cost benefit analysis, capital, investment, project evaluation...|$|R

He read everything from Plato to the trashiest novel, and [...] after {{reading a book}} could recall {{practically the whole of}} it after [...] a lapse of twenty years. To this photographic memory we are [...] indebted for the <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> quotation, allusion and anecdote which [...] brightens almost every page <b>of</b> his <b>writings.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{abolition}} movement did {{not exist}} only {{in the corridors of}} power. As one of the first mass political movements it gave rise to – and was arguably born <b>of</b> – a <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> cultural productions including poems, novels, plays, paintings, cartoons, sculptures, songs, and a range <b>of</b> personal <b>writings</b> from spiritual conversions to slave narratives.

50|$|On his deathbed, Bolívar {{had asked}} his aide-de-camp, General Daniel F. O'Leary {{to burn the}} remaining, {{extensive}} archive <b>of</b> his <b>writings,</b> letters, and speeches. O'Leary disobeyed the order and his writings survived, providing historians with a vast <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> information about Bolívar's liberal philosophy and thought, as well as details of his personal life, such as his longstanding love affair with Manuela Sáenz. Shortly before her own death in 1856, Sáenz augmented this collection by giving O'Leary her own letters from Bolívar.|$|R
50|$|Through the years, Dr. Stagg amassed an {{extensive}} library and <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> knowledge and scholarship {{in the form}} <b>of</b> correspondence, <b>writings,</b> articles, speeches, commentaries, book reviews, photographs, sermon notes and even private musings. The Papers of Dr. Frank Stagg, 1938-1999 now reside at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama. The 36 ft represent {{more than a half}} century of his life's journey and Christian pilgrimage. His collection shares prominence in the library with the manuscript collection of English theologian and preacher Charles Spurgeon.|$|R
