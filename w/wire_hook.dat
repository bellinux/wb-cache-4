40|$|BACKGROUND: Video-assisted {{thoracic}} surgery (VATS) is currently performed to diagnose and treat {{solitary pulmonary nodules}} (SPN). However, the intra-operative identification of deep nodules can be challenging with VATS as the lung is difficult to palpate. The aim {{of the study was}} to report the utility and the results of pre-operative computed tomography (CT) -guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization of SPN. METHODS: All records of the patients undergoing CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization prior to VATS resection for SPN between 2002 and 2013 were reviewed. The efficacy in localizing the nodule, <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> complications, necessity to convert VATS to thoracotomy and the histology of SPN are reported. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one patients (90 females, mean age 63 y, range 28 - 82 y) underwent 187 pulmonary resections after CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization. The mean SPN diameter was 10. 3 mm (range: 4 - 29 mm). The mean distance of the lesion from the pleural surface was 11. 6 mm (range: 0 - 45 mm). The mean time interval from <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> insertion to VATS resection was 224 min (range 54 - 622 min). <b>Hook</b> <b>wire</b> complications included pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage in 4 patients (2. 1 %) and mild parenchymal haemorrhage in 11 (5. 9 %) patients. Migration of the <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> occurred in 7 patients (3. 7 %) although it did not affect the success of VATS resection (nodule location guided by the lung puncture site). Three patients underwent additional wedge resection by VATS during the same procedure because no lesion was identified in the surgical specimen. Conversion thoracotomy was required in 13 patients (7 %) for centrally localized lesions (6 patients) and pleural adhesions (7 patients). The mean operative time was 60 min (range 18 - 135 min). Pathological examination revealed a malignant lesion in 107 patients (59 %). The diagnostic yield was 98. 3 %. CONCLUSION: VATS resection for SPN after CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization for SPN is safe and allows for proper diagnosis with a low thoracotomy conversion rate...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{investigate}} the {{factors related to}} the successful computed tomography–guided nodule localization for subsequent nodule excision. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records for 181 patients who had undergone computed tomography–guided nodule localization using <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> and subsequent video-assisted thoracic surgery resection for lung nodules. The demographic factors, nodule factors, and technical factors were reviewed to determine what affects effective nodule localization for video-assisted thoracic surgery resection using both univariate and multivariate models. ResultsA total of 174 patients were included in our study. Successful localization was accomplished in 166 patients (95 %). Univariate analysis implicated patient age, nodule solidity, zonal location, and a sufficient distance between the <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> tip and pleural surface as significant factors for successful localization. Multivariate analysis focused on {{the distance between the}} wire tip and pleural surface as the sole independent factor for successful localization (P = . 012). ConclusionsThe distance between the <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> tip and pleural surface was the major significant factor for successful computed tomography–guided nodule localization for subsequent video-assisted thoracic surgery resection. Thus, the localization of a <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> adjacent to a target nodule with sufficient depth from the pleural surface is crucial {{to the success of the}} procedure...|$|R

30|$|Pedicle screw {{instrumentation}} (PSI) provides better biomechanical fixation than hybrid instrumentation using <b>hooks,</b> <b>wires,</b> and lumbar pedicle screws [15]. PSI {{has been}} shown to obtain better correction of severe scoliosis of 100 ° or more than using <b>wires</b> or <b>hooks</b> [3]. Instrumenting severe scoliosis of 90 ° or more involves small or even absent apical concave pedicles and the need for an in–out–in pedicle screw insertion technique [6]. On the other hand, the need for anteroposterior surgery seems lower due to the enhanced correction potential [3, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In patients with over 100 ° of scoliosis, all posterior PSI with perioperative halo-femoral traction has been reported to obtain 44  % coronal correction of the spinal deformity [8].|$|R
40|$|To record {{extracellular}} nerve activity, wires or polyethylene suction electrodes {{are commonly}} used, which are modified according to particular experimental require-ments. For electrophysiological studies in a dissected animal, {{a length of}} the nerve under investigation may be lifted on to silver wires (Pearon, Stein & Malhotra, 1972), or a fine <b>wire</b> <b>hook</b> (Wilkens & Wolf, 1974), often under mineral oil. These methods produce good records but the mineral oil and the wires around the nerve and its associate muscle reduce the visibility of the preparation. This may cause difficulties when simultaneous records are required {{from other parts of}} a small preparation. Using drawn polyethylene suction electrodes, successful extracellular recordings can also be obtained from the cut ends of motor and sensory nerves. This is a simple electrode, but its major drawback is that it cannot be used to record from very fine nerves since it is difficult to construct very fine tips using polyethylene tubes.

40|$|Background/PurposeHistologic {{diagnosis}} of suspicious small subpleural lung lesions {{is difficult and}} often impossible using existing image-guided needle biopsy techniques including video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection. Preoperative lung lesion localization provides a more obvious target to facilitate intraoperative resection. This study reviewed the indications, results and complications of CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization for subpleural lung lesions in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). MethodsBetween February 2001 and January 2007, 41 patients (20 males, 21 females; mean age, 52. 5 ± 5. 1 years) with 43 subpleural pulmonary lesions underwent preoperative CT-guided double-thorn <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization prior to video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection. Nodule diameters ranged from 2 mm to 26 mm (mean, 9. 7 ± 1. 6 mm). The distance of the lung lesions from the nearest pleural surfaces ranged from 2 mm to 30 mm (mean, 9. 6 ± 2. 0 mm). Patients then received VATS within 5 hours. The efficacy of preoperative localization was evaluated in terms of procedure time, VATS success rate and associated complications of localization. ResultsForty-three wedge resections of the lungs containing 43 subpleural lung lesions as guided or assisted by the inserted <b>hook</b> <b>wires</b> were successfully performed in 41 VATS procedures (41 of 43 procedures, 95. 3 %). The mean procedure time for preoperative CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization was 30. 4 ± 2. 8 minutes. Eight patients had asymptomatic minimal pneumothoraces (18. 6 %); six patients had minimal needle tract parenchymal hemorrhages (13. 9 %) and one patient (2. 3 %) had an estimated 100 mL of hemothorax due to a small intercostal artery bleed that was cauterized during operation. The mean procedure time for VATS was 103 ± 9. 7 minutes (range, 44 – 198 minutes). Pathologic examination revealed seven primary lung cancers, 11 metastases, one hemangioma, 19 definite non-neoplastic pathologies, two nonspecific chronic inflammation, and three metallic foreign bodies. Diagnostic yield was 95 %. No major complications related to the preoperative <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization and VATS were noted.

Methods The records of 32 patients with 41 small GGOs who underwent intraoperative CT-guided double-thorn <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization prior to video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection from October 2009 to October 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients received video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) within 10 min after wire localization. The efficacy of intraoperative localization was evaluated in terms of procedure time, VATS success rate, and associated complications of localization. Results A total of 32 patients (15 males and 17 females) underwent 41 VATS resections, with 2 simultaneous nodule resections performed in 3 patients, 3 lesion resections in 1 patient, and 5 lesions in a patient. Nodule diameters ranged from 2 mm- 10 mm (mean: 5 mm). The distance of lung lesions from the nearest pleural surfaces ranged within 5 mm- 24 mm (mean: 12. 5 mm). All resections of lesions guided by the inserted <b>hook</b> <b>wires</b> were successfully performed by VATS (100 % success rate). The mean procedure time for the CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization was 8. 4 min (range: 4 min- 18 min). The mean procedure time for VATS was 32 min (range: 14 min- 98 min).

Perioperative spasm of these conduits, especially LIMA, is associated with perioperative morbidity and mortality. Papaverine is the conventional vasodilator used intraoperatively to overcome the conduits spasm. Accumulating evidence linking papaverine to endothelial damage has prompted the search for alternative vasodilators. Objectives: This in vitro experimental study aimed to compare the effects of a combined solution of glyceryl trinitrate and verapamil (GV) and papaverine on isolated human LIMA and SV. Materials and Methods: Isolated segments of LIMA and SV from 14 patients undergoing CABG were cut into 3 mm rings and suspended on <b>wire</b> <b>hooks</b> in organ bath chambers.
