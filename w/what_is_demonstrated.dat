[...] After some preliminary salutations and acknowledgements, Bellarmine begins by telling Foscarini that it is prudent for him and Galileo to limit themselves to treating heliocentrism as a merely hypothetical phenomenon and not a physically real one. [...] Further on he says that interpreting heliocentrism as physically real would be [...] "a very dangerous thing, likely not only to irritate all scholastic philosophers and theologians, but also to harm the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false." [...] Moreover, while the topic was not inherently a matter of faith, the statements about it in Scripture were so by virtue of who said them—namely, the Holy Spirit. [...] He conceded that if there were conclusive proof, [...] "then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary; and say rather that we do not understand them, than that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> is false." [...] However, demonstrating that heliocentrism merely [...] "saved the appearances" [...] could not be regarded as sufficient to establish that it was physically real. [...] Although he believed that the former may well have been possible, he had [...] "very great doubts" [...] that the latter would be, and in case of doubt it was not permissible to depart from the traditional interpretation of Scriptures. His final argument was a rebuttal of an analogy that Foscarini had made between a moving Earth and a ship on which the passengers perceive themselves as apparently stationary and the receding shore as apparently moving. [...] Bellarmine replied {{that in the case of}} the ship the passengers know that their perceptions are erroneous and can mentally correct them, whereas the scientist on the Earth clearly experiences that it is stationary and therefore the perception that the Sun, moon and stars are moving is not in error and does not need to be corrected.|$|E

And {{here it is}} to be noted that I do not deny {{absolutely}} there are general ideas, but only that there are any ABSTRACT general ideas; for, in the passages we have quoted wherein there is mention of general ideas, it is always supposed that they are formed by abstraction, after the manner set forth in sections 8 and 9. Now, if we will annex a meaning to our words, and speak only of what we can conceive, I believe we shall acknowledge that an idea which, considered in itself, is particular, becomes general by being made to represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the same sort. To make this plain by an example, suppose a geometrician is demonstrating the method of cutting a line in two equal parts. He draws, for instance, a black line of an inch in length: this, which in itself is a particular line, is nevertheless with regard to its signification general, since, as it is there used, it represents all particular lines whatsoever; so that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> of it is demonstrated of all lines, or, in other words, of a line in general. And, as THAT PARTICULAR LINE becomes general by being made a sign, so the NAME 'line,' which taken absolutely is particular, by being a sign is made general. And as the former owes its generality not to its being the sign of an abstract or general line, but of all particular right lines that may possibly exist, so the latter must be thought to derive its generality from the same cause, namely, the various particular lines which it indifferently denotes."

However, the literature cites significant disparity between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> to be effective in supporting young people with ASD and challenging behaviour and the support young people and families actually receive in practice. Paper 1 examines the extent to which evidence-based practice translates into actual practice in special schools in the UK for young people with ASD, severe learning difficulties (SLD) and challenging behaviour. A questionnaire survey targeting 64 special schools in the Midlands was used in conjunction with a series of follow-up semi-structured interviews of school staff. The findings indicate that: 1) the ideal of eclectic provision is potentially undermined by a limited range of training received by staff in evidence-based approaches; 2) mechanisms for supporting staff emotional reactions are inconsistently implemented; 3) limited mechanisms exist for developing staff understandings of challenging behaviour. Furthermore, staff attributions regarding challenging behaviour are pivotal to the consistency and effectiveness of any support programme. Implications and future research directions are discussed.
