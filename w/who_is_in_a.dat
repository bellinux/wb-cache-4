40|$|Social {{networking}} sites (SNS) play {{an increasingly}} important role in maintaining geographically close romantic relationships (GCRR). However, knowledge about SNS use in long-distance romantic relationships (LDRR) is still lacking. The present study examined {{the relative importance of}} SNS in maintaining LDRR compared to GCRR, particularly with regard to the use of SNS to express involvement (via relational maintenance behaviors) and to gauge a partner's involvement (via partner surveillance and jealousy) in the relationship. An online survey was conducted among predominantly young adult Facebook users <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship (N= 272). Results showed that participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> LDRR reported higher levels of relational maintenance behaviors through SNS than participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> GCRR. Also, as compared to participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> GCRR, participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> LDRR used SNS more for partner surveillance and experienced higher levels of SNS jealousy...|$|R

5|$|A soccer kick, {{also known}} as a soccer ball kick in puroresu and shoot fighting, is a {{reference}} to a kick that is similar to kicks used in association football. It is the colloquial term for a kick performed against a prone, kneeling, rising or supine opponent by a fighter <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> standing or semi-standing position, to any part of a downed opponent. The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993. Gerard Gordeau defeated Teila Tuli with a soccer kick, which also knocked out one of Tuli's teeth. The technique is banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets, including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them. Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to potential damage. There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA. Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them.|$|E
5|$|Enchanted is {{the first}} feature-length Disney live-action/traditional {{animation}} hybrid since Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same method {{as they did in}} Roger Rabbit; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cooking pot. The film uses two aspect ratios; it begins in 2.35:1 when the Walt Disney Pictures logo and Enchanted storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even {{for the remainder of the}} cartoon sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the logo and opening credits) was shown in the pillarboxed 4:3 aspect ration; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time. Enchanted took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.|$|E

5|$|Six of the 12 {{films have}} been adapted into novels—Friday the 13th 1 – 3, Jason Lives, Jason X, and Freddy vs. Jason—with Friday the 13th Part 3 being adapted twice. The first novel was Michael Avallone's 1982 {{adaptation}} of Friday the 13th Part 3; Avallone had previously adapted Beneath the Planet of the Apes and Shock Treatment. The author {{chose to use}} an alternate ending, one that was filmed for Part 3 but never used, as the conclusion for his adaptation. In the alternate ending, Chris, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> canoe, hears her boyfriend Rick's voice and immediately runs back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason is standing there with a machete and decapitates her. The next book was not published until 1986, when Simon Hawke adapted Jason Lives. Hawke would also adapt the first three films into novels, and his adaptation of the original Friday the 13th was published in 1987, with novelizations of Part 2 and 3 both being published in 1988. Hawke's first adaptation, Jason Lives, introduced the character of Elias Voorhees, Jason's father, {{who was supposed to}} appear in the film before being cut by the studio. The book explains how Elias has Jason's body buried, instead of the planned cremation, after his death in The Final Chapter.|$|E

25|$|First, there's {{the idea}} of the {{movement}} of the train, and then that of the sad young man <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corridor and who is moving about; thus there are two parallel movements corresponding to each other. Then, there is the distortion of the young man—I had called this elementary parallelism. It was a formal decomposition; that is, linear elements following each other like parallels and distorting the object. The object is completely stretched out, as if elastic. The lines follow each other in parallels, while changing subtly to form the movement, or the form of the young man in question. I also used this procedure in the Nude Descending a Staircase.|$|E
25|$|Anticipating {{word from}} Antía, and {{aware that she}} owes her {{daughter}} {{an explanation of the}} events that led to their separation, Julieta fills a journal with an account of her life as mother, spouse, and daughter. She begins with the story of meeting Xoan, a fisherman and Antía's father. In a flashback, Julieta recounts meeting Xoan on a train, having fled to the restaurant carriage from an older man. He tells her about his life as a fisherman, and his wife <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coma. The train stops sharply, having hit the older man, who committed suicide. As Julieta blames herself for his death, Xoan comforts her, and they have sex on the train. Later, at the school at which she works, Julieta receives a letter from Xoan which she takes as an invitation to visit. She learns his wife has recently died and that he is with Ava, a friend. Julieta and Xoan resume their relationship, and she informs him that she is pregnant with his child. Two years later, Julieta and Antía visit Julieta's parents. Her mother is ill and apparently suffering from Alzheimer's disease, at first not recognising her daughter. Her father is having an affair with the maid, to Julieta's chagrin.|$|E
40|$|Socio-economic status {{describes}} the position a person occupies within society {{on grounds of}} wealth, educational level and occupational prestige. It is associated with opportunities, resources, and outlooks on life. It therefore {{comes as no surprise}} that live-courses differ with socio-economic status. Interestingly, social inequalities accumulate over the life-course: people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> disadvantaged situation often experience more disadvantages throughout their lives, while people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> advantageous situation often experiences more advantages. Therefore, socieconomic status has more time to unfold its effects the further the live-courses progress. This chapter explores the connection between socio-economic status and live-courses <b>in</b> Poland, <b>a</b> post-socialist country with an ageing population...|$|R
