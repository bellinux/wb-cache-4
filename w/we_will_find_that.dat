25|$|Even when {{a system}} is entirely {{isolated}} from external influences, its microstate is constantly changing. For instance, the particles in a gas are constantly moving, and thus occupy a different position at each moment of time; their momenta are also constantly changing as they collide with each other or with the container walls. Suppose we prepare the system in an artificially highly ordered equilibrium state. For instance, imagine dividing a container with a partition and placing a gas {{on one side of}} the partition, with a vacuum on the other side. If we remove the partition and watch the subsequent behavior of the gas, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> its microstate evolves according to some chaotic and unpredictable pattern, and that on average these microstates will correspond to a more disordered macrostate than before. It is possible, but extremely unlikely, for the gas molecules to bounce off one another in such a way that they remain in one half of the container. It is overwhelmingly probable for the gas to spread out to fill the container evenly, which is the new equilibrium macrostate of the system.|$|E

However, by rotating the board, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> in the first turn, every corner mark is strategically equivalent to every other corner mark. The {{same is true of}} every edge (side middle) mark. For strategy purposes, there are therefore only three possible first marks: corner, edge, or center. Player X can win or force a draw from any of these starting marks; however, playing the corner gives the opponent the smallest choice of squares which must be played to avoid losing. This makes the corner the best opening move for X, when the opponent is not a perfect player.|$|E

60|$|It {{was well}} put; but I was not perhaps so entirely ignorant as he {{imagined}} {{of the nature}} of that special knowledge, or shall we say faculty, which he claimed. I take it to be cunning--the cunning of a wild animal with a man's brain--and a small, an infinitesimal, dose of something else which eludes us. But that something else is not of a spiritual nature: the gipsy has no such thing in him; the soul growths are rooted in the social instinct, and are developed in those in whom that instinct is strong. I think that if we analyse that dose of something else, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> it is still the animal's cunning, a special, a sublimated cunning, the fine flower of his whole nature, and that it has nothing mysterious in it. He is a parasite, but free and as well able to exist free as the fox or jackal; but the parasitism pays him well, and he has followed it so long in his intercourse with social man that it has come to be like an instinct, or secret knowledge, and {{is nothing more than a}} marvellously keen penetration which reveals to him the character and degree of credulity and other mental weaknesses of his subject.|$|E
60|$|All our {{knowledge}} consisting, as I have said, {{in the view}} the mind has of its own ideas, which is the utmost light and greatest certainty we, with our faculties, and in our way of knowledge, are capable of, {{it may not be}} amiss to consider a little the degrees of its evidence. The different clearness of {{our knowledge}} seems to me to lie in the different way of perception the mind has of the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas. For if we will reflect on our own ways of thinking, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>find,</b> <b>that</b> sometimes the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of two ideas IMMEDIATELY BY THEMSELVES, without the intervention of any other: and this I think we may call INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE. For in this the mind is at no pains of proving or examining, but perceives the truth as the eye doth light, only by being directed towards it. Thus the mind perceives that WHITE is not BLACK, that a CIRCLE is not a TRIANGLE, that THREE are more than TWO and equal to ONE AND TWO. Such kinds of truths the mind perceives at the first sight of the ideas together, by bare intuition; without the intervention of any other idea: and this kind of knowledge is the clearest and most certain that human frailty is capable of. This part of knowledge is irresistible, and, like bright sunshine, forces itself immediately to be perceived, as soon as ever the mind turns its view that way; and leaves no room for hesitation, doubt, or examination, but the mind is presently filled with the clear light of it. IT IS ON THIS INTUITION THAT DEPENDS ALL THE CERTAINTY AND EVIDENCE OF ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE; which certainty every one finds to be so great, that he cannot imagine, and therefore not require a greater: for a man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater certainty than to know that any idea in his mind is such as he perceives it to be; and that two ideas, wherein he perceives a difference, are different and not precisely the same. He that demands a greater certainty than this, demands he knows not what, and shows only that he has a mind to be a sceptic, without being able to be so. Certainty depends so wholly on this intuition, that, in the next degree of knowledge which I call demonstrative, this intuition is necessary in all the connexions of the intermediate ideas, without which we cannot attain knowledge and certainty.|$|E

These additional fields vanish in the classical spacetime manifolds that are solutions of the Einstein equations with connections given by the Levi-Civita connections.

They can be described by the torsion tensor and a symmetric second rank covariant tensor together with its ordinary partial derivatives. The later field is not considered in quantum theories of gravity.
