If, for example, an amount of £100 is <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> or on <b>a</b> website, and the software does not make sure that the same character set is used at both ends, it could be interpreted e.g. as ¥100, which is a much lower value than £100.|$|R

2500|$|Nearly {{a decade}} ago now, in 2008, Loyola {{students}} revealed to the legal tabloid Above the Law that Loyola had recently adopted a policy of excluding any student from participating in the school's on-campus interviewing (OCI) program if he had applied to transfer to other law schools. The exclusion applied even if a student's transfer application was still pending during OCI {{and even if the}} student had already paid tuition to Loyola for the next semester. In response to the Above the Law article, Loyola Dean Victor Gold <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> campus-wide <b>e-mail</b> that Above the Law [...] "misrepresents our policy, omits some key facts, and gets others wrong." [...] The purpose of the policy, Gold wrote, was to prevent transferring students from [...] "double-dipping" [...] by interviewing both at Loyola and at their new school. Furthermore, any student whose transfer application was rejected could apply for reinstatement in the OCI program. However, Above the Law noted that Gold did not dispute that Loyola banned tuition-paying students whose applications were still pending from participating in OCI. This policy was repealed soon thereafter.|$|R
