5|$|Thomson and Thompson (Dupont et Dupond in Hergé's {{original}} version) are two incompetent detectives <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> identical twins, {{their only}} discernible difference being {{the shape of}} their moustaches. First introduced in Cigars of the Pharaoh, they provide much of the comic relief throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic spoonerisms. They are extremely clumsy, thoroughly incompetent, and usually bent on arresting the wrong character. The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks except when sent abroad; during those missions they attempt the national costume of the locality they are visiting, but instead dress in conspicuously stereotypical folkloric attire. The detectives were in part based on Hergé's father Alexis and uncle Léon, identical twins who often took walks together, wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks.|$|E
25|$|Character {{designer}} Kōsuke Fujishima {{noted that}} while Luke's clothing {{makes him look}} lazy, {{it was okay to}} have clothes that are outrageous since the setting was designed to have him wear the most fashionable clothes of his time. He decided to show Luke's abdomen to demonstrate that he was a combatant in the game. Fujishima remains anxious about Luke's design wondering what people think about his abdomen always showing. Luke's pose is the result of Fujishima's research in fashion books which feature images of boys <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> they hang out at Shibuya.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa's {{affections}} {{come into}} conflict. Despite being self-aware {{of the fact}} that Usagi Tsukino and Mamoru Chiba are her biological parents, she does not immediately identify them as such, instead suspiciously viewing them as strangers <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> them. There is evidence that Chibiusa has a hard time identifying Usagi and Mamoru as being her parents since she sees such a sharp contrast in personality between their present and future selves. She also reacts differently toward Usagi and Mamoru than she does towards King Endymion and Neo-Queen Serenity, being more respectful to the latter but more spontaneous to the former; it is not clear if she prefers one set over the other. However, she always calls her teenage father Mamoru as Mamo-chan (in the 20th century), an affectionate nickname by Usagi, and has an innocent crush on him, much to Usagi's fury.|$|E

25|$|Another {{well known}} and violent street gang in West Anaheim is the Anaheim F.O.L.K.S(family of Latin kings surenos). This gang claims the area on Knott avenue and Ariel PL their {{neighborhood}} along with Neighbors avenue further east. This gang has many rivals including both the devious hoodlums and the la colonia gang. In March 2009, a couple members of this gang snuck onto the Magnolia High School campus and stabbed {{a member of the}} La Colonia gang. Although most of the local street gangs in this area are of Mexican or Hispanic heritage, there is also an African American gang known as the Del Monte Blocc Gangster Crips Gang. This violent gang in West Anaheim claims most of Lincoln Avenue as their territory. This gang counts most of the other Hispanic gangs as their rivals. as a result, members of this gang have been known to harass or assault Mexican youth <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> rival gang members or are found hanging out in their territory.|$|E
500|$|In a 2006 interview, Obama {{highlighted}} {{the diversity of}} his extended family: [...] "It's like a little mini-United Nations", he said. [...] "I've got relatives <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Margaret Thatcher." [...] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng, the daughter {{of his mother and}} her Indonesian second husband) and seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family—six of them living. Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham, until her death on November 2, 2008, two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011. In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.|$|E

500|$|... "A Milhouse Divided" [...] is {{the only}} episode for which Steve Tompkins has sole writing credit, {{although}} {{he had been a}} part of the writing staff for several years. The writers wanted to do an episode that involved a couple getting divorced. They had wanted to break the sitcom convention that characters <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> they will divorce get back together and have two characters remain divorced even after the episode. The Van Houtens were chosen because the writers felt that they were the most developed couple next to Marge and Homer and the Lovejoys. The scene in the episode [...] "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming" [...] where Milhouse is in a jet pretending to fire missiles at his parents is where they got the idea to have his parents' marriage be in trouble.|$|E

He {{believes}} that an actor with a [...] "proven track record" [...] would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show. He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part. Alan Taylor and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, [...] "it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part". Weiner also sensed that the actor had suffered early loss of his parents, which was similar to Draper's backstory.|$|E

500|$|After {{attending}} USC School of Cinematic Arts {{and working}} at a youth center in South Los Angeles, Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who {{do well in school}} are said to be [...] "acting white". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that [...] "Spelling Bee is for someone else". She [...] "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy," [...] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it [...] "empowers her to ... accomplish this task." [...] Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, [...] "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> her doing". The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated [...] "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing in their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics [...] "but particularly for kids of color to see a little black girl who does something powerful." ...|$|E

Describing the conception of Earth-4, Grant Morrison alluded that its interpretation of Vic Sage would resemble the classic Charlton incarnation, with tones borrowed from Rorschach and Watchmen. A number of other alternate universes in the 52 Multiverse may also contain versions of the Question from DC Comics previous Elseworlds stories or from variant [...] "themed" [...] universes, such as the gender-reversed world of Earth-11.|$|E

2500|$|A BBC {{audience}} research {{survey conducted}} in 1972 found that, {{by their own}} definition of violence ("any act which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental") Doctor Who was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time. The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as [...] "very unsuitable" [...] for family viewing. Responding {{to the findings of}} the survey in The Times newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, [...] "to compare the violence of Dr Who, sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors <b>who</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing Monopoly with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously." ...|$|E
