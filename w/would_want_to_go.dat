Having grown up riding horses on his family's plantation, Middleton scored very well on this exam, and the officer in charge thought that he <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the cavalry. Middleton, however, wanted to go into the infantry, leaving the officer stunned that anyone with such horsemanship skills would even consider spending his time walking instead of riding a fine horse.|$|E
500|$|Dante {{debuted in}} Devil May Cry, a game {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} part of Capcom's Resident Evil franchise. Series' creator Hideki Kamiya wrote his name after rewriting the story and took it from Dante Alighieri's poem Divine Comedy. Kamiya has said that the title character from the manga series Cobra by Buichi Terasawa served as the basis for Dante's personality. Kamiya based his idea of Dante on what he perceived as [...] "Stylish" [...] – wearing a long coat to make the character [...] "showy" [...] and a non-smoker, as Kamiya saw that as [...] "more cool". The character wears red because in Japan it is a traditional color for a heroic figure. Kamiya has also stated he perceives Dante as [...] "a character that you <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out drinking with", someone who was not a show-off but would instead [...] "pull some ridiculous, mischievous joke" [...] to endear people to him. He added that this aspect was intended to make the character feel familiar to audiences. Although Kamiya was not the main writer from the first two Devil May Cry novels he viewed Shinya Goikeda's depiction of Dante similar to the one he wrote.|$|E

The player, {{according}} to The Guardian, accepted that Arsenal were [...] "ready to let him go" [...] before agreeing in principle to join Juventus. On 15 August 2005, Vieira signed a five-year contract, in a deal worth £13.75 million. In a later interview with the Daily Mail, Wenger explained the departure of Vieira was to serve Cesc Fàbregas' career: [...] "When Cesc Fàbregas was 18, 19, I would play him in a 4–4–2 with Patrick Vieira and I saw it did not work. Then I had the decision to make about letting Patrick go, because Gilberto Silva and Vieira worked, Fàbregas and Silva worked, but I could not play Fàbregas and Vieira. But Fàbregas was 19 and if he did not play I knew he <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> so we risked destroying everything, all the work we had put into this player." ...|$|E

[...] But during the rainy weather some of them thought they had an excuse to drink. [...] They said they thought it kept them warm. [...] I saw at once that this must not go on, as a little whiskey always calls for more. [...] So I called all the Indians together in council, and explained to them that I had noticed they were beginning to look for liquor again {{and that it was}} not good for them. [...] Then I said: “I am going to make a new rule with you. [...] Every man and woman hereafter will receive only half their pay. [...] The balance will be kept in my care until {{near the end of the}} season. [...] Then those of you who think you must be spending your money all the time will have something to take home with you when your work is done.’ [...] Some, of course, did not like this plan. [...] While they knew it was for their best interest, still they did not want to do without their liquor. [...] But the majority fell right in with my proposition. [...] They knew I would be honest with them, and that their money was safe with me. [...] So it was agreed that on each pay day half of the money should be put away until the show closed.
