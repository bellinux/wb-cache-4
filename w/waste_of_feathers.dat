Despite the fact that the amount <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> animal tissues from poultry industry is relatively low as compared with processing of other animal products, <b>waste</b> management <b>of</b> hardly degradable keratin, mainly feathers, poses significant difficulties (Kopec et al. 2014). The annual global <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> chicken <b>feathers</b> is at 8.5 million tons (Fellahi et al. 2014). <b>Feathers</b> are composed <b>of</b> 95 – 98 % protein, predominantly β-keratin. The dominating amino acids in its structure comprise: cysteine, glutamine, proline, as well as serine, the most abundant amino acid (Tiwary and Gupta 2012). Keratins are insoluble in water and exhibit high resistance to physical and chemical treatments, as well as typical proteolytic enzymes. The degradation of these proteins is possible with the participation of specific microbial proteolytic enzymes—keratinases, frequently supported by chemical or enzymatic reducing agents (Lange et al. 2016).|$|R

However, the keratin in waste feathers is resistant to biodegradation and may require the addition of bacterial inocula to enhance the degradation process during composting. Two keratin-degrading bacteria isolated from plumage of wild songbirds and identified as Bacillus licheneformis (OWU 1411 T) and Streptomyces sp. (OWU 1441) were inoculated into poultry feather composts (1. 13 × 10 8 cfu g − 1 feathers) and co-composted with poultry litter and straw in 200 -l compost vessels.

40|$|The {{ability to}} hydrolyze keratin, a rigid and {{strongly}} cross-linked protein in the <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> poultry <b>feather</b> and sheep wool, has made keratinase production by microorganisms highly {{important to the}} biotechnological industry. A proteindegrading bacterium (C 4) was isolated from compost. Based on morphology and biochemical tests, along with 16 S rRNA sequencing, the isolated C 4 was tentatively identified as Bacillus sp. C 4 (2008). The proteolytic activity of the Bacillus sp. C 4 strain was broadly specific; it degraded keratinous and non-keratinous proteins to different degrees. Pea pods as substrate generated the highest protease production, followed by soybean meal and sheep wool. Notwithstanding, using wool keratin as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen yielded {{the highest level of}} soluble proteins. Furthermore, the C 4 bacterium grew well, and produced a significant level of keratinase when using wool and feather as substrates. Supplementing the medium with yeast extract and peptone shortened the time required for feather degradation, but delayed the onset of the wool keratin hydrolysis with two days. The predominant amino acids released in feather hydrolysate were tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine. In contrast, the wool lysate was rich in aspartic acid, methionine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, histidine, and lysine.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} history <b>of</b> birds and <b>feathers</b> {{is a major}} focus in palaeobiology and evolutionary biology. Diverse exceptionally preserved birds and feathered dinosaurs from Jurassic and Cretaceous biotas in China have provided pivotal evidence <b>of</b> early <b>feathers</b> and feather-like integumentary features, but {{the true nature of}} many of these fossil soft tissues is still debated. Interpretations <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> at intermediate developmental stages (i. e. Stages II, III and IV) and of simple quill-like (Stage I) feathers are particularly controversial. This reflects key uncertainties relating to the preservation potential <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> at different evolutionary-developmental stages, and to the relative preservation potential of diagnostic features <b>of</b> Stage I <b>feathers</b> and hair. To resolve these issues, we used high pressure-high temperature autoclave experiments to simulate the effects of burial on modern feathers from the Black Coucal (Centropus grilii) and Common Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and on human hair. Our results reveal profound differences in the recalcitrance <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> different types during maturation: Stage I and Stage V feathers retain diagnostic morphological and ultrastructural details following maturation, whereas other feather types do not. Further, the morphology and arrangement of certain ultrastructural features diagnostic of Stages III and IV, e. g. barbules, are preferentially lost during maturation.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. A {{number of}} {{hypotheses}} {{have been suggested}} for the origin <b>of</b> birds and <b>feathers.</b> Although distributions <b>of</b> functional complexes have frequently been used to test phylogenetic hypotheses, analysis of the origin <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> remains hampered by the incomplete fossil record of these unmineralized structures. It is also complicated by approaches that confuse the origins <b>of</b> birds, <b>feathers,</b> and flight without first demonstrating that these relate to the same historical event. Functional speculation regarding the origin <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> usually focuses on three possible alternatives: (1) flight; (2) thermal insulation; or (3) display. Recent fossil finds <b>of</b> Late Cretaceous <b>feathered</b> dinosaurs in China have demonstrated that feathers appear to have originated in taxa that retained {{a significant number of}} primitive nonavian features. Current evidence strongly suggests that birds are the-ropod dinosaurs, and that the most primitive known feathers are found on non-flying animals. This further suggests that feathers did not evolve as flight struc-tures. Thermoregulatory, display, and biomechanical support functions remain possible explanations for the origin <b>of</b> <b>feathers.</b> As the earliest function <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> was probably not for aerial locomotion, it may be speculated that the transitional animals represented by the Chinese fossils possessed skin with the tensile properties of reptiles and combined it with the apomorphic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>feathers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present new {{insights}} and promising directions for future research on feather pecking in laying hens. Our starting point was a multidisciplinary research program on feather pecking in The Netherlands, in which ethological, physiological, ontogenetic and genetic approaches were combined. The four topics addressed in this paper are: (1) the relation between gentle and severe feather pecking, (2) feather pecking and coping strategy, (3) causation <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking, and (4) the possibility to solve the problem <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking through genetic selection. When the relationship between gentle and severe feather pecking was studied, it was found that both forms <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking are related at the same age. Gentle feather pecking at young age, however, could not be used as a predictor <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking at adult age. Birds from high and low feather pecking lines that showed differences in feather pecking also differed in other behavioural and physiological characteristics. This may reflect line differences in coping strategy. Relating coping strategy with feather pecking may help us to better understand the motivations and characteristics underlying the development <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking. On the causation <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking, there is some evidence that it is redirected ground pecking, deriving either from a foraging or a dustbathing background. However, evidence was found that early feather pecking could also be interpreted as social exploration. Finally, the use of molecular genetics to help solving the problem <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> pecking seems promising. Feather pecking has been shown to be heritable and the first genetic regions (QTL) involved in feather pecking have been identified.
