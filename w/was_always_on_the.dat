5|$|Although many campaigns were {{fought in}} Asia and the Pacific, the {{major focus of}} the U.S. Army <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> European Theater, where most its {{strength}} was ultimately deployed. U.S. forces saw action in the invasion of North Africa in November 1942, and the subsequent Tunisia Campaign in 1943. The U.S. Army participated in the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, and then the Allied invasion of Italy in September. Hopes for a quick capture of Rome were frustrated by the Germans, who conducted a fighting withdrawal to the Gustav Line, which the landing at Anzio and the fighting at Monte Cassino in January 1944 failed to break. The Gustav Line was finally broken in May 1944, while Rome was captured on 4 June, and the Germans retreated to the Gothic Line in Northern Italy, where the Allies were held until they broke into the Po Valley in a successful offensive in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|Forster wrote well-polished German prose, {{which was}} not only scientifically {{accurate}} and objective, but also exciting and easy to read. This differed from conventional travel literature of the time, insofar as it presented {{more than a mere}} collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable ethnographical facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In A Voyage Round the World he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation. The book {{is one of the most}} important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.|$|E

While he towers above most of us physically, this attribute is matched by his intellect, faith in the process and optimism for peaceful resolution of conflict.|$|E
25|$|Ramprakash was {{selected}} for his first Test match for England against the West Indies at Headingley in 1991. This was the same game in which Graeme Hick made his England Test debut, and like Hick, he struggled to impress, producing a series of scores in the 20s. He was dropped in 1992 {{after a number of}} poor performances. However, his consistent heavy scoring in county cricket meant that he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fringes of selection.|$|E

25|$|By age 14, Fred {{had taken}} on the musical {{responsibilities}} for their act. He first met George Gershwin, who {{was working as a}} song plugger for Jerome H. Remick's music publishing company, in 1916. Fred had already been hunting for new music and dance ideas. Their chance meeting was to deeply affect the careers of both artists. Astaire <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lookout for new steps on the circuit and was starting to demonstrate his ceaseless quest for novelty and perfection. The Astaires broke into Broadway in 1917 with Over the Top, a patriotic revue, and performed for U.S. and Allied troops at this time as well.|$|E
25|$|Under her {{editorial}} management {{it proved}} the swiftest journalistic success on record, numbering its subscribers by the hundred thousand, and while other papers took {{a loss for}} granted in the beginning, putting itself upon a paying basis at the outset. While she had assistants in every department, among their names those of some most distinguished in our literature, she was herself the inspiration of the whole corps, and under the advice and suggestion of its proprietors she held it on an even course. There was scarcely a poet, or a story-writer, or novelist of any rank in America or England {{who is not a}} contributor to its pages, and its purity, its self-respect, its high standard, and its literary excellence, were unrivalled among periodical publications. The influence of such a paper within American homes was something hardly to be computed. It <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of good and sweet things; it made the right seem the best and pleasantest; it taught while it has amused; it held the happiness, well-being, and virtue of women and the family as its first consideration, and it created a wholesome atmosphere wherever it was constantly read. Through its columns, its editor made her hand felt in countless families for nearly 16 years, and helped to shape the domestic ends of a generation to peace and righteousness.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{declarations}} in {{the offseason}} that he may continue to play past 2016/17, an impending retirement announcement <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cards for Redhage in the back-end of the 2016–17 season. Such speculation came to fruition on 30 January 2017 when Redhage, nine days after his 36th birthday, announced via a press conference at Bendat Basketball Centre that this season {{would be his last}} in the NBL. Four days later, on 3 February, Redhage made his 372nd appearance for the Wildcats, scoring six points off the bench in the team's 94–63 win over the Brisbane Bullets in Perth. With his 372nd game played as a Wildcat, he moved into second spot on the team's all-time games played list, placing him behind only Ricky Grace (482). On 10 February, in his final regular season game at Perth Arena, Redhage tied his season high with 11 points to help the Wildcats defeat the Sydney Kings 101–74; nine of his points came in the last five minutes of the game. The Wildcats went on to finish the regular season in third place with a 15–13 record, and after sweeping the Cairns Taipans in the semi-finals, they moved on to the NBL Grand Final for the sixth time in eight years. There the Wildcats swept the Illawarra Hawks 3–0 in the best-of-five series to claim their eighth NBL championship, while Redhage collected his fourth title to bow out of the NBL on a high. The Wildcats not only collected their eighth championship, but went back-to-back {{for the first time since}} 1990/1991. In the 95–86 title-clinching Game 3 win on 5 March 2017 at Perth Arena, Redhage started at power forward in his 393rd and final NBL game and finished the contest with three points. Despite his limited role in 2016/17, Redhage competed in every game for the Wildcats, averaging 2.7 points, 1.2 rebounds and 7.8 minutes in 33 games.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, King {{said that}} Flagg {{had been a}} {{presence}} in his writing {{since the beginning of}} his career, with the idea coming to him in college. He first wrote a poem, [...] "The Dark Man", about a man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape; written {{on the back of a}} placemat in a college restaurant, the one-page poem was published in 1969, but the character never left King's mind. To the author, what made Flagg interesting was [...] "the idea of the villain as somebody who <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside looking in, and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends".|$|E
500|$|On defense, Michigan {{shut out}} a Minnesota offense that had scored 34 points against Northwestern and 20 against Iowa. [...] The Golden Gophers threw eight passes for zero {{completions}} and two interceptions. [...] Left tackle Stanley Muirhead, playing his final game for Michigan, {{was credited with}} the success of the defense:In his last game against Minnesota, November 24, Muirhead was everywhere. He made three-fourths of the tackles under punts, and <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball. A check was made during the game of Muirheads's tackles. No less than twenty-two times did this stalwart tackle bring down his man. He was a veritable demon on the field. [...] He could not be stopped. If there is a greater tackle in the country than Stan Muirhead of Michigan he has not yet been seen.|$|E
500|$|According to his biographer, Scarry: [...] "No {{president}} of the United States... has suffered as much ridicule as Millard Fillmore". He ascribed much of the abuse to a tendency to denigrate the presidents {{who served in the}} years just prior to the Civil War as lacking in leadership. For example, later president Harry Truman [...] "characterized Fillmore as a weak, trivial thumb-twaddler who would do nothing to offend anyone", responsible in part for the war. Anna Prior, writing in The Wall Street Journal in 2010, stated that Fillmore's very name connotes mediocrity. Another Fillmore biographer, Finkelman, commented, [...] "on the central issues of the age his vision was myopic and his legacy is worse... in the end, Fillmore <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong side of the great moral and political issues". Rayback, however, applauded [...] "the warmth and wisdom with which he had defended the Union".|$|E

[...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, Levy {{took over}} as Senior Partner from Weinberg, and built Goldman's trading {{franchise}} once again.
