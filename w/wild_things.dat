5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance. We {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of <b>wild</b> <b>things,</b> of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E

25|$|When Siouxsie and the Banshees {{ended in}} 1996, the Creatures {{had already begun}} {{composing}} new material. At the same time, the long-out-of-print <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> EP and Feast album were remastered and re-released through the compilation A Bestiary Of.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, {{he formed}} {{a second group}} with Siouxsie Sioux, named the Creatures. Their music was based more on drums and percussion, with marimba and vibraphone. The 1981 <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> EP and 1983 {{full-length}} Feast were their first releases.|$|E

25|$|Notable {{mainstream}} theatrical releases include Bound (1996), Chasing Amy (1997), <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> (1998), Kissing Jessica Stein (2001), Lost and Delirious (2001), Mulholland Drive, Monster (2003), D.E.B.S (2004), Rent (2005, {{based on}} the Jonathan Larson musical), My Summer of Love (2004), Loving Annabelle (2006) and Imagine Me & You (2005).

25|$|The band {{soon after}} began a {{longtime}} association with Blackout Records, who released {{some of their}} songs on the label's compilation Where the <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are, in 1989, along with a 7 inch Live At CBGB release. The following year, the band recorded their debut full length Just Can't Hate Enough. The record was engineered by Tommy Victor of Prong. As Victor also worked at CBGB, {{he was able to}} allow the band to record live at the famous bar in the morning and afternoon hours before shows were held. The record was released in Germany on Starving Missile Records, and later released stateside under the Blackout name. Just Can't Hate Enough quickly became one of the records that defined the new, heavier sound of hardcore that was emerging at the time, played by bands such as Biohazard and Killing Time, among others. The guitar tone and riffs, in particular, display a large heavy metal influence, especially from Swiss speed metallers Celtic Frost, who were allegedly one of Alan Blake's favorite bands. The band also became known for Bearer's no-nonsense stage personality, with some finding him offensive, and others enjoying his often blunt and obscenity filled humor.|$|E
500|$|The band also headlined the Young <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Tour, an {{international}} arena tour featuring Gym Class Heroes, Plain White T's and Cute Is What We Aim For. Of the thirty one dates, twenty nine {{were in the}} US with two in Canada. The tour was inspired by Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book Where the <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are, and included sets designed by artist Rob Dobi containing images from the book. Commenting on the decision to incorporate elements from the book, Wentz explained [...] "Where the <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are is a great narrative. It encapsulates pretty much every FOB song ever written: You know, tantrums and monster islands and all." ...|$|E

50|$|The heroine's {{story of}} being {{found in the}} woods by the hero while living like a <b>wild</b> <b>thing</b> is common to many more tales, such as The Bear, Allerleirauh, The Princess That Wore A Rabbit-Skin Dress, and Mary's Child.|$|R

500|$|Richard Corliss {{noted that}} the film {{appeared}} to have been influenced by The Wizard of Oz and the works of Maurice Sendak, writing, [...] "Labyrinth lures a modern Dorothy Gale out of the drab Kansas of real life into a land where the <b>wild</b> <b>things</b> are." [...] Nina Darnton wrote that the plot of Labyrinth [...] "is very similar to Outside Over There by Mr. Sendak, in which 9-year-old Ida's baby sister is stolen by the goblins". Copies of Outside Over There and Where the <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are are shown briefly in Sarah's room {{at the start of the}} film, along with copies of Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, a book by Hans Christian Andersen, Grimms' Fairy Tales and Walt Disney's Snow White. The film also features an end credit stating, [...] "Jim Henson acknowledges his debt to the works of Maurice Sendak." ...|$|E
500|$|Fall Out Boy then headlined the 2007 Honda Civic Tour {{to promote}} the album. Though the tour was {{initially}} postponed due to personal issues, it would take place with +44, Cobra Starship, The Academy Is... and Paul Wall as supporting acts. The band also headlined the Young <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Tour, an international arena tour featuring Gym Class Heroes, Plain White T's and Cute Is What We Aim For.|$|E
500|$|The novel explores {{themes of}} {{violence}} and the abuse of power, {{as well as of}} coming of age. The protagonists have a recurring struggle to make choices they are comfortable with. Their moral development takes place within the harshness of the Upland culture, contrasted with examples of kindness and altruism. It has been described as sharing themes of dreamworlds and choices with a number of other works by Le Guin, such as the Earthsea cycle, The Beginning Place, and [...] "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas". It also shares similarities with Maurice Sendak's book Where the <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are, while Orrec's transformation in the novel has been compared to the biblical story of Jonah.|$|E
60|$|Another month {{brought them}} to a little group of {{buildings}} {{at the mouth of}} a wide river, and there Tarzan saw many boats, and was filled with the timidity of the <b>wild</b> <b>thing</b> by the sight of many men.|$|R
60|$|Monstrous and odious as the <b>wild</b> <b>thing</b> was to him, he {{determined}} to seek it out, and prove {{if this were}} really so; and also to seek it with another intention, which came into his thoughts at the same time.|$|R
60|$|She {{was happy}} at home, Ursula was not. Slim and unwilling abroad, Gudrun was easy {{in her own}} house as a <b>wild</b> <b>thing</b> in its lair. Whereas Ursula, {{attentive}} and keen abroad, at home was reluctant, uneasy, unwilling to be herself, or unable.|$|R
