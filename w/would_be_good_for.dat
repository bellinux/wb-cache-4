5|$|It was {{reported}} that Madonna's appearance on the show was to promote her album American Life (2003). Many believed that the guest spot on the show <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the singer, following her appearance in the film 2002 film Swept Away, which was a box office disappointment. Her manager, however, insisted that Madonna's guest spot was not an attempt to showcase her acting abilities.|$|E
5|$|The band {{were well}} known for their strong stage act, and had privately {{recorded}} several shows, or broadcast them on radio, but were unenthusiastic about recording a live album until their Japanese record company decided it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> publicity. They insisted on supervising the live production, including using Martin Birch, who had previously collaborated with the band, as engineer, and were not {{particularly interested in the}} album's release, even after recording. The tour was successful, with strong media interest and a positive response from fans.|$|E
5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at {{how easy it was to}} get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E

25|$|Park began {{swimming}} {{at the age}} of 5 {{when his}} doctor suggested it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> his asthma. He began his competitive swimming career {{at the age of}} 7, earning several medals in junior competitions. This early success led to Park's selection to the Korean Swimming Federation as a national team member in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Soen asked Shimano {{to go to}} Hawaii {{instead to}} help to guide the Diamond Sangha, founded by Robert Baker Aitken and his wife, Anne Hopkins Aitken. At first reluctant, Soen persuaded Shimano that going to Hawaii <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> both his {{recuperation}} from an illness and his academic studies (suggesting he study at the University of Hawaii).|$|E
25|$|Ira Forman, {{executive}} director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, said that the choice indicates that Obama will not listen to the wrong people regarding the U.S.–Israel relationship. Some commentators opined that Emanuel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the Israeli–Palestinian peace process because if Israeli leaders make excuses for not dismantling settlements, Emanuel will be tough and pressure the Israelis to comply.|$|E

25|$|One {{survey by}} Staffordshire University showed {{that more than}} 90% of {{football}} fans would not hold any hostility to a footballer coming out, and suggested that most fans would stand by a gay player who played for their club. The survey showed that most fans expected {{there would be an}} openly gay footballer by 2015, and that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> improving the attitude towards homosexuality in the sport.|$|E
25|$|Thomas was {{recruited}} to play college basketball for Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers. Although he received mail saying Knight tied up his players and beat them, {{he did not}} believe the rumors. When Knight visited the Thomas home, one of Isiah's brothers, who wanted him to attend DePaul, embarrassed him by insulting the Indiana coach and engaging him in a shouting match. Nevertheless, Thomas chose Knight and Indiana because he felt that getting away to Bloomington <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> him, as would be Knight's discipline.|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{criticisms of}} Human rights in Cuba, the United States holds $6 {{billion worth of}} {{financial}} claims against the Cuban government. The pro-embargo position is that the U.S. embargo is, in part, an appropriate response to these unaddressed claims. The Latin America Working Group argues that pro-embargo Cuban-American exiles, whose votes are crucial in Florida, have swayed many politicians to also adopt similar views. The Cuban-American views have been opposed by some business leaders who argue that trading freely <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Cuba and the United States.|$|E

25|$|Kommotion was a teen-oriented daily TV {{pop music}} show, which had premiered in December 1964 on ATV-0, later Channel Ten. It {{included}} local performers miming {{to the latest}} overseas hits and artists showcasing their own material. In August 1966 its then-producer, David Joseph, was fired {{and most of the}} cast walked out in support. Al Maricic replaced Joseph and Meldrum reported the change-over for Go-Set. Maricic asked Meldrum to join the show: originally he declined but was convinced otherwise by Frazer, who reasoned that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> their circulation. Episodes of Kommotion were directed by Rob Weekes.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011, Governor Andrew Cuomo {{signed the}} state law that {{authorized}} the Five Borough Taxi Plan which included 18,000 new boro taxi permits and the sales of 2,000 new yellow medallions, all {{of which will be}} wheelchair accessible. Although the law would make street hail of livery cabs legal, it was not welcomed by some of the livery cab drivers and politicians due to the fear that the cost would be too expensive as seen in the yellow taxi medallions which are sold through auctions with an average of $700,000 each. The Taxi and Limousine Commission clarified that the boro taxi permit would cost $1,500 and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> three years.|$|E
25|$|A {{daughter}} of Charles and Anaïs Lenglen, Suzanne Lenglen {{was born in}} Paris. During her youth, she suffered from numerous health problems including chronic asthma, which also plagued her at a later age. Because his daughter was so frail and sickly, Charles Lenglen, {{the owner of a}} carriage company, decided that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> her to compete in tennis and gain strength. Her first try at the game was in 1910, when she played on the tennis court at the family property in Marest-sur-Matz. The young girl enjoyed the game, and her father decided to train her further in the sport. His training methods included an exercise where, the story goes, he would lay down a handkerchief at various places on the court, to which his daughter had to direct the ball.|$|E

25|$|As for... {{the great}} {{question}} {{of the power of}} sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> princes to be persuaded that their {{people have the right to}} resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Eve is {{the second}} human created by God, taken from one of Adam's ribs and shaped into a female form of Adam. Far from the {{traditional}} model of a good wife, she is often unwilling to be submissive towards Adam. She is more intelligent and curious about external ideas than her husband. Though happy, she longs for knowledge and, more specifically, self-knowledge. Her first act in existence is {{to turn away from}} Adam and look at and ponder her own reflection. Eve is extremely beautiful and thoroughly in love with Adam, though may feel suffocated by his constant presence. In Book IX, she convinces Adam that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> them to split up and work different parts of the Garden. In her solitude, she is tempted by Satan to sin against God. Adam shortly follows along with her.|$|E
25|$|Thomas now {{took up a}} posting to HMS Bellerophon as flag-lieutenant to his cousin, Rear Admiral Sir Algernon Lyons, {{which had}} been {{arranged}} before his illness. A letter to prince George noted {{that he was still}} not fully recovered, hoping that the climate in Bermuda <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> him. He remained on Bellerophon for nine months, before returning to England for ten months, again on half pay for health reasons. In August 1888 he was sent to the sail training ship, HMS St Vincent, from which home leave was possible and he assisted in his father's election campaign to the local council. In spring 1889 he attended Excellent for a gunnery course, and then Vernon for torpedo training. Prince George also attended at the same time. In 1889 he served briefly on , before a permanent posting to her in December when she sailed to the Mediterranean as flagship to Vice Admiral Sir Anthony Hiley Hoskins. In May 1890 the ship was 'swapped' for , which had been intended to serve as flagship, but whose construction had been delayed. The crews of the two ships changed places, with Camperdown returning to the Channel fleet. Hoskins was impressed with Evan-Thomas' performance, placing him in charge of arrangements for refloating Victoria after she ran aground in the Gulf of Corinth in February 1891. Hoskins was in the habit of leaving the bridge during manoeuvres, so that his junior officers would get a chance acting as admiral to complete them.|$|E

The words {{translate}} into archaic Portuguese as [...] "Burial Mound of Small Animals," [...] although other translations have been proposed. In Colombia and Venezuela, the word [...] "bichos" [...] is a euphemism for testicles, something Shiban was unaware of when writing the script. Shiban later joked that this [...] "controversy" [...] <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> ratings.|$|E

Willem Dafoe was cast as Geiger after he wanted to star in a [...] "big movie" [...] and once again play a villain. De Bont cast New Zealand actor Temuera Morrison as Juliano based on his role in Once Were Warriors (1994).

Although stopping short of an endorsement, Jenner said she liked Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, despite Cruz's negative views of trans people. On her reality show I Am Cait, Jenner said that although she does not support Donald Trump, she thinks he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> women's issues; she then stated she would never support Hillary Clinton. She ended up voting for Trump in the 2016 presidential elections.|$|E
