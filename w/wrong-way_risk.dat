40|$|Counterparty {{credit risk}} is an {{important}} type of financial risk. The importance of proper counterparty risk management became most apparent {{in the wake of}} the 2008 series of failures of several large banks. Correlation of market factors {{is an important}} issue in the calculation of CVA. A notable case of correlation is <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> which occurs whenever the probability of default of the counterparty is positively correlated with exposure. The basic formulas for CVA and basic counterparty credit risk models do not account for <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> because its modeling is nontrivial. This thesis aims to answer how well can the impact of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> on CVA be approximated with an add-on which only depends on correlation between the price of the underlying asset and the credit spread of the counterparty. The thesis is supplemented by a fully documented implementation of the model in the Mathematica software...|$|E

A consistent model of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> (WWR) is developed {{here with the}} probability-weighted addition of tail events to the calculation of credit valuation and funding valuation adjustments (CVA and FVA). This new practical model quantifies the tail risks in the pricing of CVA and FVA of derivatives and does not rely on a limited concept of linear correlation frequently used in many models. The application of the model is illustrated with practical examples of WWR arising {{in the case of}} a sovereign default for the most common interest-rate and foreign exchange derivatives.

40|$|We {{propose a}} model for the credit and {{liquidity}} risks faced by clearing members of Central Counterparty Clearing houses (CCPs). This model aims to capture the features of: gap risk; feedback between clearing member default, market volatility and margining requirements; the different risks faced by various types of market participant and the changes in margining requirements a clearing member faces as the system evolves. By considering the entire network of CCPs and clearing members, we investigate the distribution of losses to default fund contributions and contingent liquidity requirements for each clearing member; further, we identify <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risks</b> between defaults of clearing members and market turbulence.

40|$|Current CVA {{modeling}} framework {{has ignored}} {{the impact of}} stochastic recovery rate. Due to the possible negative correlation between default and recovery rate, stochastic recovery rate could have a doubling effect on <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk.</b> In {{the case of a}} payer CDS, when counterparty defaults, the CDS value could be higher due to default contagion while the recovery rate may also be lower if the economy is in a downturn. Using our recently proposed model of correlated stochastic recovery in the default time Gaussian Copula framework, we demonstrate this double impact on <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> in the CVA calculation for a payer CDS. We also present a new form of Gaussian copula that correlates both default time and recovery rate. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two parts. In the first part, we investigate {{the potential impact of}} <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> on calculating credit valuation adjustment (CVA) of a derivatives portfolio. A credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is an adjustment applied to the value of a derivative contract or a portfolio of derivatives to account for counterparty credit risk. Measuring CVA requires combining models of market and credit risk. <b>Wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> refers to the possibility that a counterparty's likelihood of default increases with the market value of the exposure. We develop a method for bounding <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk,</b> holding fixed marginal models for market and credit risk and varying the dependence between them. Given simulated paths of the two models, we solve a linear program to find the worst-case CVA resulting from <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk.</b> We analyze properties of the solution and prove convergence of the estimated bound as the number of paths increases. The worst case can be overly pessimistic, so we extend the procedure for a tempered CVA by penalizing the deviation of the joint model of market and credit risk from a reference model. By varying the penalty for deviations, we can sweep out the full range of possible CVA values for different degrees of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk.</b> Here, too, we prove convergence of the estimate of the tempered CVA and the joint distribution that attains it. Our method addresses an important source of model risk in counterparty risk measurement. In the second part, we study investors' trading behavior in a model of realization utility. We assume that investors' trading decisions are driven not only by the utility of consumption and terminal wealth, but also by the utility burst from realizing a gain or a loss. More precisely, we consider a dynamic trading problem in which an investor decides when to purchase and sell a stock to maximize her wealth utility and realization utility with her reference points adapting to the stock's gain and loss asymmetrically. We study, both theoretically and numerically, the optimal trading strategies and asset pricing implications of two types of agents: adaptive agents, who realize prospectively the reference point adaptation in the future, and naive agents, who fail to do so. We find that an adaptive agent sells the stock more frequently when the stock is at a gain than a naive agent does, and that the adaptive agent asks for a higher risk premium for the stock than the naive agent does in equilibrium. Moreover, compared to a non-adaptive agent whose reference point does not change with the stock's gain and loss, both the adaptive and naive agents sell the stock less frequently, and the naive agent requires the same risk premium as the non-adaptive agent does...|$|E
40|$|The credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) of OTC derivatives is {{an important}} part of the Basel III credit risk capital requirements and current accounting rules. Its calculation is not an easy task - not only it is necessary to model the future value of the derivative, but also the probability of default of a counterparty. Another complication arises in the calculation when the exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty, i. e. when it is needed to incorporate the <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk.</b> A semi-analytical CVA formula simplifying the interest rate swap (IRS) valuation with the counterparty credit risk including the <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> is derived and analyzed in the paper. The formula is based on the fact that the CVA of an IRS can be expressed using swaption prices. The link between the interest rates and the default time is represented by a Gaussian copula with constant correlation coefficient. Finally, the results of the semi-analytical approach are compared with the results of a complex simulation study...|$|E

This reflects a departure from the immersion property, whereby the default intensities of the surviving names and therefore the value of credit protection spike at default times.

40|$|D. Comm. Copulas {{provide a}} useful way to model {{different}} types of dependence structures explicitly. Instead of having one correlation number that encapsulates everything known about the dependence between two variables, copulas capture information {{on the level of}} dependence as well as whether the two variables exhibit other types of dependence, for example tail dependence. Tail dependence refers to the instance where the variables show higher dependence between their extreme values. A copula is defined as a multivariate distribution function with uniform marginals. A useful class of copulas is known as Archimedean copulas that are constructed from generator functions with very specific properties. The main aim of this thesis is to construct multivariate Archimedean copulas by nesting different bivariate Archimedean copulas using the vine construction approach. A characteristic of the vine construction is that not all combinations of generator functions lead to valid multivariate copulas. Established research is limited in that it presents constraints that lead to valid multivariate copulas {{that can be used to}} model positive dependence only. The research in this thesis extends the theory by deriving the necessary constraints to model negative dependence as well. Specifically, it ensures that the multivariate copulas that are constructed from bivariate copulas that capture negative dependence, will be able to capture negative dependence as well. Constraints are successfully derived for trivariate copulas. It is, however, shown that the constraints cannot easily be extended to higher-order copulas. The rules on the types of dependence structures that can be nested are also established. A number of practical applications in the financial markets where copula theory can be utilized to enhance the more established methodologies, are considered. The first application considers trading strategies based on statistical arbitrage where the information in the bivariate copula structure is utilised to identify trading opportunities in the equity market. It is shown that trading costs adversely affect the profits generated. The second application considers the impact of <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> on counterparty credit exposure. A trivariate copula is used to model the <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk.</b> The aim of the analysis is to show how the theory developed in this thesis should be applied where negative correlation is present in a trivariate copula structure. Approaches are considered where conditional and unconditional risk driver scenarios are derived by means of the trivariate copula structure. It is argued that by not allowing for <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk,</b> a financial institution’s credit pricing and regulatory capital calculations may be adversely affected. The final application compares the philosophy behind cointegration and copula asset allocation techniques to test which approach produces the most profitable index-tracking portfolios over time. The copula asset allocation approach performs well over time; however, it is very computationally intensive...|$|E

We show that this problem can be reduced to calculating contributions of the trades to the counterparty-level expected exposure (EE) conditional on the counterparty's default. We propose a methodology for calculating conditional EE contributions for both collateralized and non-collateralized counterparties. Calculation of EE contributions can be easily incorporated into exposure simulation processes that already exist in a financial institution. We also derive closed-form expressions for EE contributions under the assumption that trade values are normally distributed. Analytical results are obtained for the case when the trade values and the counterparty's credit quality are independent as well as when there is a dependence between them (<b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk).</b> Financial risk management; Derivative securities...|$|E

The method has applications to any situation where marginals are provided, and bounds need to be determined on total portfolio risk. This arises in many financial contexts, including pricing and risk management of exotic options, analysis of structured finance instruments, and aggregation of portfolio risk across risk types. Applications to counterparty credit risk are emphasized, and they include assessing <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> in the credit valuation adjustment, and counterparty credit risk measurement.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} dynamize the static Gaussian copula model of {{portfolio}} credit risk, we introduce a model filtration {{made of a}} reference Brownian filtration progressively enlarged by the default times. This yields a multidimensional density model of default times, where, {{as opposed to the}} classical situation of the Cox model, the reference filtration is not immersed into the enlarged filtration. In mathematical terms this lack of immersion means that martingales in the reference filtration are not martingales in the enlarged filtration. From {{the point of view of}} financial interpretation this means default contagion, a good feature in the perspective of modeling counterparty <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> on credit derivatives. Computational tractability is ensured by invariance of multivariate Gaussian distributions through conditioning by some components, the ones corresponding to past defaults. Moreover the model is Markov in an augmented state-space including past default times. After a discussion of different notions of deltas, the model is applied to the valuation of counterparty risk on credit derivatives. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{counterparty risk}} for Credit Default Swaps (CDS) in presence of correlation between default of the counterparty and default of the CDS reference credit. Our approach is innovative in that, besides default correlation, which {{was taken into}} account in earlier approaches, we also model credit spread volatility. Stochastic intensity models are adopted for the default events, and defaults are connected through a copula function. We find that both default correlation and credit spread volatility have a relevant impact on the positive counterparty-risk credit valuation adjustment to be subtracted from the counterparty-risk free price. We analyze the pattern of such impacts as correlation and volatility change through some fundamental numerical examples, analyzing <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> in particular. Given the theoretical equivalence of the credit valuation adjustment with a contingent CDS, we are also proposing a methodology for valuation of contingent CDS on CDS.

40|$|The global {{over-the-counter}} derivatives market {{reached a}} staggering 14. 5 trillion US dollars in gross market value {{at the end}} of December 2007. Although OTC derivatives are extremely useful and versatile in transferring risks, {{it appears to be a}} double-edged sword. For every derivative transaction concluded in the OTC market, there are two parties involved – each of which is exposed to the other defaulting on the agreed terms and conditions of the contract. Counterparty credit risk is defined as the loss that will be incurred in the event that a counterparty fails to honour its financial obligations. This dissertation provides an overview of counterparty credit risk measurement from a theoretical point of view and puts an emphasis on the demonstration of the current solutions used in practice to address this problem. The author applies a bottom up approach to the problem by defining counterparty credit risk exposure on a contract (single-trade) level and expands this definition on a step-by-step basis to incorporate portfolio effects, such as correlation among underlying market variables as well as credit risk mitigation techniques, such as netting and collateral agreements, in measuring counterparty credit risk exposure on a counterparty level. The author also discusses related concepts which impact counterparty credit risk such as <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> and proposes an enhancement to the framework introduced by Finger (2000) for incorporating <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> into existing measures of counterparty credit risk exposure. Finger‟s framework is enhanced by the introduction of a structural model approach which can be used in establishing a functional and intuitive relationship between the probability of default of the counterparty and the underlying market variable to the derivative contract under consideration. This approach is also applied to a typical South African situation through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. The topic of counterparty credit risk modelling is a very relevant topic in modern finance, especially since the advent of Basel 2 which this dissertation also touches on in terms of the applications of counterparty credit risk modelling and how this relates to the minimum regulatory capital requirements set by bank regulators.

40|$|A basic reduced-form {{counterparty}} risk modeling approach hinges {{on a standard}} immersionhypothesis between a reference filtration and the filtration progressively enlarged by the default times of the two parties, also involving the continuity {{of some of the}} data at default time. This basic approach is too restrictive for applicationto credit derivatives, which are characterized by strong <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk,</b> i. e. adverse dependence between the exposure and the credit riskiness of the counterparties, and gap risk, i. e. slippage between the portfolio and its collateral during the so called cure period that separates default from liquidation. This paper shows how a suitable extension of the basic approach can be devised {{so that it can be}} appliedin dynamic copula models of {{counterparty risk}} on credit derivatives. More generally, this method is applicable in any marked default times intensity setup satisfying a suitable integrability condition. The integrability condition expresses that no mass is lost in a related measure change. The changed probability measure is not needed algorithmically.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we compare the {{official}} Basel III method for computing credit value adjustment (CVA) against {{a model that}} assumes piecewise constant default intensities {{for a number of}} both market and fictive scenarios. CVA is defined as the price deducted from the risk-free value of a bilateral derivative to adjust for the counterparty credit risk. Default intensity is defined as the rate of a probability of default, conditional on no earlier default. In the piecewise constant model, the default intensity is calibrated against observed market quotes of credit default swaps using the bootstrapping method. We compute CVA for an interest rate swap in a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross framework, where we calculate the expected exposure using the internal model method and assume that no <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> exists. Our main finding is that the models generate different values of CVA.

40|$|Abstract We study {{mathematical}} {{aspects of}} dynamic hedging of Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) in {{a portfolio of}} OTC financial derivatives. Since the sub-prime crisis, counterparty risk and <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> are a crucial issue in connection with valuation and risk management of credit derivatives. In this work we first derive a general, model free equation for {{the dynamics of the}} CVA of a portfolio of OTC derivatives. We then particularize these dynamics to the counterparty risk of a portfolio of credit derivatives including, for instance, CDSs and/or CDOs, possibly netted and collateralized, considered in the so called Markovian copula model. Wrongway risk is represented in the model by the possibility of simultaneous defaults. We establish a rigorous connection between the CVA, which represents the price of the counterparty risk, and a suitable notion of Expected Positive Exposure (EPE). Specifically, the EPE emerges as the key ingredient of the min-variance hedging ratio of the CVA by a CDS on the counterparty. Related notions of EPE have actually long been used in an ad-hoc way by practitioners for hedging their CVA. Our analysis thus justifies rigorously this market practice, making also precise the prope...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} static and dynamic (reduced form) {{approaches}} for modeling <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> {{in the context}} of CVA. Although all these approaches potentially suffer from arbitrage problems, they are popular (respectively) in industry and academia, mainly due to analytical tractability reasons. We complete the stochastic intensity models with another dynamic approach, consisting in the straight modeling of the survival (Azéma supermartingale) process using the Φ-martingale. Just like the other approaches, this method allows for automatic calibration to a given default probability curve. We derive analytically the positive exposures V^+_t "conditional upon default" associated to prototypical market price processes of FRA and IRS in all cases. We further discuss the link between the "default" condition and change-of-measure techniques. The expectation of V^+_t conditional upon τ=t is equal to the unconditional expectation of V^+_tζ_t. The process ζ is explicitly derived in the dynamic approaches: it is proven to be positive and to have unit expectation. Unfortunately however, it fails to be a martingale, so that Girsanov machinery cannot be used. Nevertheless, the expectation of V^+_tζ_t can be computed explicitly, leading to analytical expected positive exposure profiles in the considered examples.

40|$|A {{key driver}} of Credit Value Adjustment (CVA) is the {{possible}} dependency between exposure and counterparty credit risk, known as <b>Wrong-Way</b> <b>Risk</b> (WWR). At this time, addressing WWR in a both sound and tractable way remains challenging: arbitrage-free setups {{have been proposed}} by academic research through dynamic models but are computationally intensive and hard to use in practice. Tractable alternatives based on resampling techniques have been proposed by the industry, but they lack mathematical foundations. This probably explains why WWR is not explicitly handled in the Basel III regulatory framework {{in spite of its}} acknowledged importance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a new method consisting of an appealing compromise: we start from a stochastic intensity approach and end up with a pricing problem where WWR does not enter the picture explicitly. This result is achieved thanks to a set of changes of measure: the WWR effect is now embedded in the drift of the exposure, and this adjustment can be approximated by a deterministic function without affecting the level of accuracy typically required for CVA figures. The performances of our approach are illustrated through an extensive comparison of Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) profiles and CVA figures produced either by (i) the standard method relying on a full bivariate Monte Carlo framework and (ii) our drift-adjustment approximation. Given the uncertainty inherent to CVA, the proposed method is believed to provide a promising way to handle WWR in a sound and tractable way. Comment: 29 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} problem of {{computing}} adjustments for bilateral counterparty risk for a standard Credit Default Swap (CDS) in a three-factor first passage time default risk model. Extending the existing literature that gives analytical expression for the transition probability density function for two-dimensional Brownian motions absorbed at the boundaries in the positive quadrant, a method to obtain a semi-analytical expression for the transition probability density function of a three-dimensional Brownian motion absorbed at first exit time from the positive octant is developed. This is done by separating the problem into a radial and an angular part, of which the latter depends only on the correlation matrix. The solution to the angular part is obtained through the finite element method. These mathematical results are then used to provide semi-analytical expressions for bilateral Credit Value Adjustment (CVA) and Debit Value Adjustments (DVA) of a credit default swap. An example of market data is analysed in detail and it is shown that these value adjustments can be non-negligible. An approximation commonly used by practitioners for the computation of bilateral value adjustments {{is to use the}} sum of the unilateral ones as a proxy. The framework developed here allows for an analysis on the precision of this approximation to be performed {{in the case of the}} credit default swap, when <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> is present. Finally, {{the problem of}} valuing partially collateralised CDSs is studied and analytical or semi-analytical solutions are developed for computing the potential shortfall caused by the risky nature of the collateral.

40|$|Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) pricing models {{need to be}} both {{flexible}} and tractable. The survival probability has to be known in closed form (for calibration purposes), the model {{should be able to}} fit any valid Credit Default Swap (CDS) curve, should lead to large volatilities (in line with CDS options) and finally should be able to feature significant <b>Wrong-Way</b> <b>Risk</b> (WWR) impact. The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model (CIR) combined with independent positive jumps and deterministic shift (JCIR++) is a very good candidate : the variance (and thus covariance with exposure, i. e. WWR) can be increased with the jumps, whereas the calibration constraint is achieved via the shift. In practice however, there is a strong limit on the model parameters that can be chosen, and thus on the resulting WWR impact. This is because only non-negative shifts are allowed for consistency reasons, whereas the upwards jumps of the JCIR++ need to be compensated by a downward shift. To limit this problem, we consider the two-side jump model recently introduced by Mendoza-Arriaga & Linetsky, built by time-changing CIR intensities. In a multivariate setup like CVA, time-changing the intensity partly kills the potential correlation with the exposure process and destroys WWR impact. Moreover, it can introduce a forward looking effect that can lead to arbitrage opportunities. In this paper, we use the time-changed CIR process {{in a way that the}} above issues are avoided. We show that the resulting process allows to introduce a large WWR effect compared to the JCIR++ model. The computation cost of the resulting Monte Carlo framework is reduced by using an adaptive control variate procedure...|$|E
40|$|A {{clearing}} {{member of a}} Central Counterparty (CCP) is exposed to losses on their default fund and initial margin contributions. Such losses can be incurred whenever the CCP has insufficient funds to unwind the portfolio of a defaulting {{clearing member}}. This does not necessarily require the default of the CCP itself. In this note we aim to quantify the risk a financial institution has when facing a CCP. We show that a clearing member’s CCP risk is given by a sum of exposures {{to each of the}} other clearing members. This arises because of the implicit default insurance that each member has provided in the form of mutualised, loss sharing collateral. We calculate the exposures by explicitly modeling the capital structure of a CCP as well as the loss distributions of the individual member portfolios. An important consideration in designing the model is the limited transparency with respect to the portfolio composition and collateral levels of individual clearing members. To overcome this we leverage the fact that, for a typical CCP, margin levels are risk-based. In particular, we parameterise the portfolio loss tail as a Pareto distribution and we calibrate this to the CCP defined probability of losses exceeding the posted initial margin levels. A key aspect of the model is that we explicitly take into account <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk,</b> i. e. the fact that member defaults are more likely to occur in stressed market conditions, as well as potential contagion between a member’s default and the losses on his portfolio.

40|$|The HJM {{framework}} {{was originally}} introduced for the modelling {{of the dynamics}} of the instantaneous forward rates in the fixed income market. This approach was later extended to the case with uncertainties described by a Gaussian random field, which is termed as the random field HJM model. In this thesis, this approach is extended and applied to both equity and credit markets. In each case, it is shown that how to yield a consistent condition such that the market is arbitrage-free or the market observables are martingales. In the first part, this approach is applied to the equity market. A unified framework is proposed for the joint modelling of an index and its local volatility surface. This model enables index and volatility derivatives to be priced consistently and reproduces empirical features of the equity market, including the strong negative correlation between the changes of SPX and VIX, any observed term structure of variance swap rates, and the volatility skews and term structures observed in SPX and VIX options. Starting from an initial collection of index options and their associated local volatility surface, it is shown in the framework of the HJM philosophy that how to construct the arbitrage-free evolution of this local volatility surface from a Gaussian random field. The relationship between the local volatility model and the variance rate model is also presented. In the end, it is shown that how to implement this model numerically by the Monte Carlo simulation and the finite difference method, and how to simultaneously calibrate to the prices of SPX options and VIX options across strikes and maturities. In the second part, this approach is applied to the credit market. Contagion credit and counterparty credit risks are two of the central topics in the credit risk management after the sub-prime crisis. Starting from a Gaussian random field, it is shown in the framework of the HJM philosophy that how to construct the dynamics of the conditional joint density of the default times given the risk-free market information via the change-of-measure technique. It is a top-down approach in the analysis of the contagion credit risk with multiple default events. In the same framework, the dynamics of the forward risk-free rate can also be described and a general pricing formula for credit products can be derived. Furthermore, this contagion model is applied to the pricing of the credit valuation adjustment by taking into account the unilateral or bilateral counterparty credit risk. The influence of the default of the counterparty on the underlying reference entity is considered so as to avoid the <b>wrong-way</b> <b>risk</b> in particular. Finally, the bilateral credit valuation adjustment for credit default swaps is illustrated through a numerical study. published_or_final_versionStatistics and Actuarial ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
