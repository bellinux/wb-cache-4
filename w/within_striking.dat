5|$|Operations Leap1 and2 {{improved}} {{the positions of}} the Croatian forces east and west of the Livanjsko field, and brought Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance. The advance secured the valley, threatened Glamoč and brought the Bosansko Grahovo-Glamoč road, the Cetina valley and the Vrlika field within Croatian artillery range. The Croatian forces sustained losses of 4 killed, 15 seriously wounded and 19 slightly injured during Operations Leap1 and2.|$|E
5|$|Young {{individuals}} have yellowish or greenish tail tips {{and engage in}} caudal luring. The tail tip is wriggled to lure prey, such as frogs and lizards, <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance. Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which suggests it is a daytime activity.|$|E

50|$|It was {{the first}} such {{organized}} <b>strike</b> <b>within</b> the video game industry and the first voice actors' strike in 17 years, {{as well as the}} first <b>strike</b> <b>within</b> the merged SAG-AFTRA organization. As of April 26, 2017, it is the longest <b>strike</b> <b>within</b> SAG, surpassing the both the 95-day 1980 Emmy Awards strike, as well as the 180-day 2000 commercials strike.|$|R
5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance of the fish.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September, General Mark W. Clark, the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard Iowa. Clark {{observed}} Iowa {{in action}} as her guns shelled the Wonsan {{area for a}} third time, accounting {{for the destruction of}} a major enemy ammunition dump. On 25 September, Iowa fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30-car train. The following month, Iowa was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a feint to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance of the battleships' big guns. During the operation, Iowa provided anti-aircraft support to , an amphibious force command ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactic of}} {{continuous}} forward patrolling {{was so successful}} that the advancing force's every move was known to the defenders, but the light horsemen were substantially outnumbered and could not stop the advance. By daylight on 3 August, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force had occupied Katia and were <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance of Romani, Dueidar, Hill 70 and the Suez Canal. Their line ran north-east and south-west from the Bardawil Lagoon to east of Katia, with their left flank thrown well forward.|$|E

50|$|The {{result of}} this broader role meant that Air Support Command, unlike its {{predecessor}} Transport Command, possessed strike aircraft such as Hawker Hunters. With the contraction of the RAF, it only lasted a short time as a command, and it was absorbed into Strike Command on 1 September 1972 forming No. 38 Group and No. 46 Group <b>within</b> <b>Strike</b> Command. The former was designated as a tactical support and the latter as a strategic support group.|$|R
5|$|Before {{they could}} deploy, the two mounted {{divisions}} of Desert Mounted Corps had to ride between , {{to bring them}} <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance of Beersheba at dawn on 31 October. Chauvel arrived at the Asluj Desert Mounted Corps headquarters during the afternoon of 30 October, when arrangements were completed for {{the continuation of the}} marches by the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions. The Anzac Mounted Division was at Asluj, the Australian Mounted Division was at Khalasa (three hours' march behind) and the 7th Mounted Brigade was at Bir el Esani. The No. 11 Light Armoured Motor Battery (LAMB) was sent ahead of the Anzac Mounted Division to a position on the north slopes of the Gebel el Shereif to guard their flank as they moved forward. The divisional headquarters at Asluj closed at 17:30, and the last Anzac divisional troops left the railway station a half-hour later.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{itself was}} also hastily fortified. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and {{teenagers}} worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million {{cubic meters of}} earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory {{was turned into a}} submachine gun armory, a clock factory manufactured mine detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles. Despite these preparations, the capital was <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance of German tanks, with the Luftwaffe mounting large-scale air raids on the city. The air raids caused only limited damage because of extensive anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.|$|E
5|$|On special teams, the Hokies {{had several}} highs and lows. Justin Harper's 84-yard punt-return {{touchdown}} sparked a Virginia Tech rally {{that brought the}} Hokies <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance, but failures on special teams also ended the rally and turned {{the momentum of the}} game against Virginia Tech. Kicker Jud Dunlevy had been the third-most accurate kicker in the nation heading into the Orange Bowl, having hit 21 of his 24field goal attempts during the season. He only needed two field goals to break Tech's record for most field goals in the season, set at 22 by Shayne Graham in 1998. Though Dunlevy had two chances for field goals, one fell short and the other was blocked.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of Strike Command the former 18 Group became the Northern Maritime Air Region, and Coastal Command was renamed 18 Group, both changes {{happening}} on 28 Nov 1969. <b>Within</b> <b>Strike</b> Command the new group's title was No. 18 (Maritime) Group. From that point the Group commander held the NATO post of Commander, Maritime Air, Eastern Atlantic, reporting to CinC, Eastern Atlantic at the Northwood Headquarters in London.

25|$|The Israeli Home Front Command issued {{detailed}} emergency {{instructions to}} Israeli citizens for preparing for {{and dealing with}} rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip. The instructions included orders to stay within a certain distance of bomb shelters based on proximity {{to the source of}} the rockets. Residents adjacent to the Gaza border were instructed to remain in fortified rooms. Israelis ascribed their low civilian casualties to an orderly public response to these instructions. Hamas Grad rockets' increased range of 40km put more than 700,000 Israelis <b>within</b> <b>strike</b> range.|$|R
5|$|Operation Winter '94 {{pushed back}} {{the front line}} of the VRS by about , {{capturing}} much of the Livanjsko field. The attack failed to achieve its primary objective but it brought the Croatian forces <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance of the Drvar–Knin road. Operation Winter '94 was followed by Operation Leap1 (Operacija Skok1) on 7 April 1995, which improved HV positions on Mount Dinara on the southern rim of the field, dominating the area around the RSK capital. The Croatian forces renewed their advance with Operation Leap2 between 4 and 10 June, allowing them to directly threaten Bosansko Grahovo on the Drvar–Knin road, and to secure the remainder of the valley. The improved Croatian dispositions around Livanjsko field provided a springboard for further offensive action on this front during Operation Summer'95.|$|E
5|$|Pressey became {{captain of}} the Missouri team as a junior. CBS Sports listed him as a 2012 first team preseason All-American and the 8th best player in its preseason top 100. Sports Illustrated also named him to its preseason All-American first team. CBS also named him the second best point guard (behind Isaiah Canaan). Pressey was both a preseason John R. Wooden Award top 50 {{selection}} and a preseason Naismith Award top 50 selection in 2012. Pressey was the preseason SEC {{player of the year}} selection by the SEC media and a first team All-SEC selection by the coaches.

5|$|The {{expansion}} {{draft was}} largely {{made up of}} aging veterans, giving the Buccaneers little basis for success. The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed heavily to the team’s problems, as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve. They were last {{in the league in}} points scored, touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns. After a 19-point 4th-quarter performance brought them <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance of a victory in week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs, they were blown out of every game the rest of the season. Subsequent expansion teams were given a more generous allotment of draft picks and expansion draft opportunities, in part to avoid a repeat of the Buccaneers’ difficulties.|$|E

5|$|With the {{addition}} of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance of Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of Project Alberta. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island: the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the Military Policy Committee.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Bouquet, delayed in Pennsylvania while {{mustering}} the militia, finally set {{out from}} Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance {{of a number of}} native villages. Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army's pace was {{dictated}} by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, {{had the advantage of}} superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when it was almost cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard's army had a respite from attack because while it hugged the coast and had gone round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin's army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance, and waiting for an opportunity to attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, {{the brand name}} of a popular {{lavatory}} deodoriser, and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas or fifth columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> distance of the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using limpet mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and then slipped away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have the audacity to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded that it must have been an internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|E
