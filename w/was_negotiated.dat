5|$|The {{development}} project <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> {{as an international}} treaty {{between the two countries}} rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation.

5|$|A {{unilateral}} ceasefire {{was announced}} on 10 August by the Georgian government. An intention {{to pull out}} Georgian troops from South Ossetia was stated by the Georgian government. However, Russia did not embrace this ceasefire offer. After the ceasefire agreement <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> by French president Nicolas Sarkozy on 12 August, military action was to cease at 15:00 on 12 August, however Russian forces didn't stop to advance.|$|E
40|$|Effective {{conversation}} {{occurs when}} beliefs <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> through interaction and evolve in {{a framework of}} goals. Concurrently, goals <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> and evolve through interaction. Such conversations are processes of design. Similarly, design—where proposed constructions <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> and evolve toward goals, while goals for the design <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> and evolve—is a process of conversation. Outcomes from such activities are greatly facilitated, in my view, from an understanding of Pask’s two main frameworks from conversation theory: a structure for the architecture of conversations and a schema for modeling the evolution of conversations. My conviction is that these {{can be used to}} mirror how design happens. This begs the question, can it help designers design? Yes, I believe it can. This paper offers a review of Pask’s frameworks and discusses their application in theory and practice...|$|R

25|$|The first futures {{contracts}} <b>were</b> <b>negotiated</b> {{for agricultural}} commodities, and later futures contracts <b>were</b> <b>negotiated</b> for natural {{resources such as}} oil. Financial futures were introduced in 1972, and in recent decades, currency futures, interest rate futures and stock market index futures have played an increasingly large role in the overall futures markets.|$|R
5|$|Competition {{between the}} French and the Portuguese {{began to show}} itself in the region during this period. Because the Portuguese-operated trading posts in Cacheu and Farim asked for higher prices than the French-operated trading posts in Carabane and Sédhiou, the Portuguese lost many traders to the French. This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe.|$|E
5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return <b>was</b> <b>negotiated.</b> After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to the appointment of a committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were {{to be in charge of}} the reform of the royal government. Arundel was one of eight earls among the twenty-one Ordainers.|$|E
5|$|David Benioff {{was hired}} to write the {{screenplay}} for the spin-off film Wolverine in October 2004. Hugh Jackman became producer as well as star and worked with Benioff on the script. Ratner <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> by the studio to take the helm of Wolverine after directing X-Men: The Last Stand, but no agreement was made. In July 2007, Gavin Hood was hired as director. Principal photography began in January 2008 in Queenstown, New Zealand, and ended in May. The film was released on May 1, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after Casimir's {{death in}} 1370, the heirless king's nephew Louis of Hungary of the Capetian House of Anjou assumed the Polish throne. As Casimir's actual {{commitment}} to the Anjou succession seemed problematic from the beginning (in 1368 the Polish king adopted his grandson, Casimir of Słupsk), Louis engaged in succession negotiations with Polish knights and nobility starting in 1351. They supported him, exacting in return further guarantees and privileges for themselves; the formal act <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> in Buda in 1355. After his coronation, Louis returned to Hungary; he left his mother and Casimir's sister Elizabeth in Poland as regents.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuq Zengi, Atabeg of Mosul, {{had added}} to his rule in 1128 Aleppo, the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and Damascus. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their {{attention}} towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129. Damascus, ruled by the Burid Dynasty, later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140; the alliance <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> by the chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh.|$|E
5|$|Military {{tensions}} between the two leaders immediately increased. Theobald mobilised his forces {{along the border with}} Touraine; Henry responded by attacking Chaumont in Blois in a surprise attack; he successfully took Theobald's castle in a notable siege. At the start of 1161 war seemed likely to spread across the region, until a fresh peace <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> at Fréteval that autumn, followed by a second peace treaty in 1162, overseen by Pope Alexander III. Despite this temporary halt in hostilities, Henry's seizure of the Vexin proved to be a second long-running dispute between him and the kings of France.|$|E

5|$|Otto Warmbier, an American student {{held captive}} in North Korea for 17 months, was {{released}} to U.S. officials {{the same day}} as Rodman's visit to North Korea. Despite the timeline of the two events, the U.S. State Department, The White House, and Rodman all flatly denied any diplomatic connection or coordination between Rodman's visit and the U.S. government. The U.S. State Department said the release of Warmbier <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> and secured by high level U.S. diplomats including Joseph Yun, the State Department's special envoy on North Korea. Warmbier who was in a nonresponsive coma throughout much of his imprisonment in North Korea, died days after being returned to his family in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Representative peers were {{introduced}} in 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into the Kingdom of Great Britain. At the time, there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers. The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently {{the election of a}} small number of representative peers to represent Scotland <b>was</b> <b>negotiated.</b> A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1801.|$|E
5|$|The Daruvar Agreement, {{mediated}} {{by the head of}} the United Nations (UN) Civil Affairs in Sector West Gerard Fischer, <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> in secrecy. When the central RSK authorities in Knin learned of the arrangement, the signatories on behalf of the RSK were sacked from their official posts and arrested. The agreement itself was labeled as treasonous by the central RSK authorities. Fischer and other UN officials, who were involved in mediation of the agreement, were criticised by the UN for being excessively assertive in the matter. Fischer soon left the area.|$|E

5|$|The Foch Line <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> {{with the}} Polish war mission, led by General Tadeusz Jordan-Rozwadowski in Paris, while Lithuanian representatives were not invited. The Foch Line had two major {{modifications}} {{compared to the}} June 18 line: first, the entire line was moved west to give extra protection to the strategic Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway and second, the Suwałki Region, including the towns of Sejny, Suwałki, Puńsk, was assigned to Poland. Despite assurances {{at the time that}} the line was just a temporary measure to normalize the situation before full negotiations could take place, the southern Foch Line has been regarded since then as the border between Lithuania and Poland.|$|E
5|$|The Jurchens marched southward {{with the}} aim of conquering the Southern Song, but counteroffensives by Chinese generals like Yue Fei halted their advance. A peace accord, the Treaty of Shaoxing, <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> and {{ratified}} in 1142, establishing the Huai River as the boundary between the two empires. Peace between the Song and Jin was interrupted twice. Wanyan Liang invaded the Southern Song in 1161, while Song revanchists tried and failed to retake northern China in 1204.|$|E
5|$|The {{commissioning}} of Cossa's tomb monument <b>was</b> <b>negotiated</b> {{for about}} a decade following Cossa's death.

The bequests to his nephews took priority, and his estate remained disputed by various creditors while the tomb was being completed.|$|E
