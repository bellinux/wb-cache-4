5|$|By {{the time}} of the Domesday Book, Camberwell was already a {{significant}} settlement. The town remained a popular resort for Londoners due to its believed medicinal <b>wells.</b> <b>In</b> 1685, John Evelyn's Diary mentions a Roman urn filled with bones which was uncovered intact during repairs to the road and exhibited at the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal power {{requires}} no fuel (except for pumps), {{and is therefore}} immune to fuel cost fluctuations. However, capital costs are significant. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet (extraction and injection <b>wells)</b> <b>in</b> Nevada can support 4.5 megawatts (MW) and costs about $10million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.|$|E

5|$|On 10 December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Peter Hancock would become Bishop of Bath and <b>Wells</b> <b>in</b> 2014. A few days earlier, the Church Commissioners had announced that the new bishop would work, but not live, in the Palace; it was later announced that he would instead live, at least temporarily, at The Old Rectory a few miles away at Croscombe.|$|E
5|$|The Bishop's Palace and {{accompanying}} Bishops House at <b>Wells</b> <b>in</b> the English county of Somerset, is adjacent to Wells Cathedral {{and has been}} {{the home of the}} Bishops of the Diocese of Bath and Wells for 800 years. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The English painter J. M. W. Turner visited <b>Wells</b> <b>in</b> 1795, making {{sketches}} of the precinct and a water colour {{of the west}} front, now in the Tate gallery.

50|$|Let us {{assume that}} we {{evaluate}} solutions in a specific problem situation using several criteria. Let us further assume that more is better in each criterion. Then, among all possible solutions, we are ideally interested in those solutions that perform <b>well</b> <b>in</b> all considered criteria. However, {{it is unlikely to}} have a single solution that performs <b>well</b> <b>in</b> all considered criteria. Typically, some solutions perform <b>well</b> <b>in</b> some criteria and some perform <b>well</b> <b>in</b> others. Finding a way of trading off between criteria {{is one of the main}} endeavors in the MCDM literature.|$|R

Halliday and his brothers dealt heavily in flour following the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Although 85% {{of world}} crude {{production}} was still coming from Pennsylvania <b>wells</b> <b>in</b> the 1880s, drilling in Russia and Asia began {{to reach the}} world market. Robert Nobel had established his own refining enterprise in the abundant and cheaper Russian oil fields, including the region's first pipeline and the world's first oil tanker. The Paris Rothschilds jumped into the fray providing financing. Additional fields were discovered in Burma and Java. Even more critical, {{the invention of the}} light bulb gradually began to erode the dominance of kerosene for illumination. But Standard Oil adapted, developing a European presence, expanding into natural gas production in the U.S. then into gasoline for automobiles, which until then had been considered a waste product.|$|E
5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving crude oil from oil <b>wells</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|E

In both, they may provide corrosion control recommendations, failure analysis investigations, sell corrosion control products, or provide installation or design of corrosion control and monitoring systems. Every material has its weakness. Aluminum, galvanized/zinc coatings, brass, and copper do not survive <b>well</b> <b>in</b> very alkaline or very acidic pH environments. Copper and brasses do not survive <b>well</b> <b>in</b> high nitrate or ammonia environments. Carbon steels and iron do not survive <b>well</b> <b>in</b> low soil resistivity and high chloride environments. High chloride environments can even overcome and attack steel encased in normally protective concrete. Concrete does not survive <b>well</b> <b>in</b> high sulfate environments. And nothing survives <b>well</b> <b>in</b> high sulfide and low redox potential environments with corrosive bacteria.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{negative}} associations with oil among many ranchers and farmers, demand for kerosene and other petroleum derivatives drove oil prospecting in Texas after the American Civil War at known oil-producing springs and accidental finds while drilling for water. One {{of the first}} significant <b>wells</b> <b>in</b> Texas was developed {{near the town of}} Oil Springs, near Nacogdoches. The site began production in 1866. The first oilfield in Texas with a substantial economic impact was developed in 1894 near Corsicana. In 1898, the field built the state's first modern refinery. The success of the Corsicana field and increasing demand for oil worldwide led to more exploration around the state.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin born in <b>Wells</b> <b>in</b> Somerset, {{and was the}} son of Edward of Wells, a small {{landowner}} in {{the city}} of Wells. His brother Hugh de Wells, was archdeacon of Wells and Bishop of Lincoln. Some historians say that another relative, although the exact relationship is unknown, was Simon of Wells, who became Bishop of Chichester in 1207, but other historians dispute this. The name Jocelin Trotman or Thotman, by which he was occasionally known by some modern historians, only dates from the Margam Annals, and is not contemporary with his life.|$|E

5|$|John of Tours or John de Villula (died1122) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of <b>Wells</b> <b>in</b> England who moved the diocese seat to Bath. He {{was a native}} of Tours and was King William I of England's doctor before {{becoming}} a bishop. After his consecration as bishop, he was either given or purchased Bath Abbey, a rich monastery, and then moved the headquarters of the diocese from Wells, to the abbey. He rebuilt the church at Bath, building a large cathedral that no longer survives. He gave a large library to his cathedral and received the right to hold a fair in Bath. Not noted for his scholarship, he died suddenly in 1122.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{excise tax}} {{continued}} through 1793 in the frontier counties of Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in western Pennsylvania. In June, Neville was burned in effigy by {{a crowd of}} about 100 people in Washington County. On the night of November 22, 1793, men broke into the home of tax collector Benjamin <b>Wells</b> <b>in</b> Fayette County. Wells was, like Neville, one of the wealthier men in the region. At gunpoint, the intruders forced him to surrender his commission. President Washington offered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, to no avail.|$|E
5|$|Set {{in a small}} steep valley {{overlooking}} the city of Bath a park was established on the site by John of Tours, the Bishop of Bath and <b>Wells,</b> <b>in</b> around 1100 as a deer park. It was subsequently sold to Humphrey Colles, a lawyer and member of parliament for Somerset, and then another member of parliament, Matthew Colthurst. Even before the Dissolution of the Monasteries the walls which had enclosed the deer park had fallen into disrepair and the deer had escaped. The land was then returned to agricultural use.|$|E

5|$|The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand {{and water}} to make mud mortar. They {{obtained}} most of the material from canyon deposits, {{but some of the}} clays may have been collected {{from the base of the}} cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep <b>wells</b> <b>in</b> the bed of Chaco Wash.|$|E
