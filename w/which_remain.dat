5|$|Although heavily {{populated}} {{prior to the}} conquest, the impact of Old World diseases {{was one of the}} factors that resulted in the depopulation of the hot, moist lands of the Depresión Central, <b>which</b> <b>remain</b> sparsely populated to this day. Likewise, Soconusco was rapidly depopulated as a result of disease soon after contact with the Spanish. Among the most deadly diseases were smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, {{the precise}} reasons for <b>which</b> <b>remain</b> unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him. Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's {{outspokenness}} had hurt Shelburne's political career. Schofield {{argues that the}} most likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, {{she did not like}} the Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted Birmingham New Meeting's offer to be their minister.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of <b>which</b> <b>remain</b> to be discovered. An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in the fossil record. By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E
5|$|Her {{achievements}} {{included the}} development of the theory of radioactivity (a term that she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and in Warsaw, <b>which</b> <b>remain</b> major centres of medical research today. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, {{the arsenal}} was renamed Little Rock Barracks {{and the main}} {{building}} used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside. Prior to renovation, a rear basement door provided the only entrance, while the tower served as a hoist to move munitions between floors. By 1868, front and rear porches had {{been added to the}} building, as well as interior walls and stairs, some of <b>which</b> <b>remain</b> today, including the central staircase. In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.|$|E

5|$|In {{the modern}} era, {{population}} peaked {{in the mid}} 19th century at just over 32,000 and declined for a century thereafter {{to a low of}} fewer than 18,000 in the 1970s. Declines were particularly significant in the outlying islands, some of <b>which</b> <b>remain</b> vulnerable to ongoing losses. Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends are very similar to those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
5|$|Japanese radio {{intercepts}} did notice {{an increase}} in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, {{so as not to}} reveal his position. These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons <b>which</b> <b>remain</b> unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E

5|$|Meteorology is a {{relatively}} young science {{and the study of}} tornadoes is newer still. Although researched for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes <b>which</b> <b>remain</b> a mystery. Scientists have a fairly good understanding of the development of thunderstorms and mesocyclones, and the meteorological conditions conducive to their formation. However, the step from supercell, or other respective formative processes, to tornadogenesis and the prediction of tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.|$|E
5|$|NSB also {{operates}} {{intercity services}} from Trondheim to Bodø on the Nordland Line.

Stjørdal and Steinkjer are the only stations along the line <b>which</b> <b>remain</b> manned. NSB uses a combination of Class 93 diesel multiple units and Di4-hauled trains. CargoNet and Cargolink operate freight trains along the line. CargoNet hauls using Vossloh Euro, while Cargolink uses Di 6 locomotives, respectively.|$|E

It was remade as Tiga Dara Mencari Cinta (Three Maidens Seek Love) in 1980 by Djun Saptohadi and influenced Teguh Karya's Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta (Lover Left by the Train, 1989). A second remake, Ini Kisah Tiga Dara (This is the Story of Three Maidens), was produced by Nia Dinata and released in September 2016. In 2015 Tiga Dara was restored and converted to 4K digital by L'immagine Ritrovata Laboratory.|$|E

The Lucian music industry is quite small scale, due to the island's small market, its lack of recording studios and record producers, the widespread bootlegging of cassettes, and the general unavailability of funding for musical ventures. Saint Lucia is home to several radio stations including Radio St. Lucia and Radio Caribbean International, which play a variety of popular music; since 1989, St Lucian radio stations have played {{an increasing number of}} programs about Lucian culture and in the local Creole tongue.|$|E
