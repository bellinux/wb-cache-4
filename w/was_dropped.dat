5000|$|Players first {{drop their}} pieces onto the board. Stewart Culin, H.J.R. Murray, and R.C. Bell {{unfortunately}} did not describe in detail how they <b>are</b> <b>dropped</b> onto the board.

Tiger pieces may not be moved or perform captures until all three tigers have <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> onto the board which takes three turns. Likewise, oxen pieces may not be moved until all twelve oxen pieces have <b>been</b> <b>dropped</b> onto the board which takes twelve turns. Another method that could be employed is the one used in the Myanmar game of Tiger and Buffaloes. Four oxen pieces would <b>be</b> <b>dropped</b> first, followed by a tiger piece. Then four more oxen pieces would <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> followed by another tiger piece. Then the remaining four oxen pieces would <b>be</b> <b>dropped,</b> followed by the last tiger piece.|$|R
