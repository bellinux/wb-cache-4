It has also gained popularity in several American cities, including San Francisco, Little Rock, and Cleveland. A few Church members have voiced concerns and/or amusement about new members who took the Church too seriously, fearing that they acted like serious cult-followers, the very concept that the SubGenius parodies. Stang has expressed concern that the Church's doctrines could exacerbate pre-existing psychoses of mentally ill devotees, although he believes that the Church genuinely helps many adherents.|$|E
500|$|When {{the book}} was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them. [...] The {{first part of the}} novel {{concerns}} the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. [...] Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. [...] One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism. [...] This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. [...] This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of [...] "fine folks" [...] being people with good sense <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> best they can with what they have. [...] The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.|$|E
500|$|The trips {{between the}} cities are {{seen by the}} public as [...] "a money-wasting junket hugely enjoyed by journalists, MEPs and researchers" [...] when {{in fact it is}} [...] "a money-wasting junket loathed by journalists, MEPs and researchers" [...] {{according}} to Gary Titley, MEP (PES), who announced he would not be standing for re-election in 2009 because of the two-seat issue. Titley stated that he could [...] "no longer tolerate the shifting of the Parliament lock, stock and barrel to Strasbourg one week a month...It's a miserable journey and it's always a problem" [...] noting the problems in lost luggage. As well as undermining the EU's climate change objectives, he criticises the Strasbourg sessions as the deals have already been made leading to them becoming formal voting sessions padded out with [...] "debates saying we are against sin." [...] Titley also states that, because the journeys take so much time, the committees in Brussels <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> bulk of the work do not have sufficient time to work. Titley {{is not the only one}} to leave over the issue; Eluned Morgan MEP is standing down in 2009 for similar reasons, notably due to the toll the moving has on time with her family, and former MEP Simon Murphy quit as leader of the Socialists in 2002 due to the inconvenience of the arrangement.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Official Xbox Magazine, Ashton claimed that Evolve would have the [...] "best support for downloadable content ever". However, many of the downloadable content packages {{are not covered by}} Evolves Season Pass On November 21, 2014 Turtle Rock Studios co-founder Phil Robb confirmed with IGN that all DLC maps will be free of charge. Robb stated {{the reason for this is}} [...] "to allow people who don't have the DLC, to still play against those <b>who</b> <b>do,</b> <b>the</b> only difference is that they can't play as those hunters or monsters". Despite Turtle Rock claiming that all DLC maps would be free to all players, the high number of paid DLCs has attracted criticism from fans who feel that it constitutes a large amount of content being deliberately withheld to be sold. Some players who purchased the game wrote negative reviews for the game on Steam, complaining about the excessive amount of DLC planned. [...] Turtle Rock Studios countered this by claiming that as much content as possible was packaged with the main game, with DLC only including content created after the completion of Evolves development. At release, Evolve launched with 44 different paid-DLC skin packs. Free updates were added to the game. The Observer mode was added on March 31, 2015, and a less strategic mode, the Arena mode, was introduced on May 26, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} accompanying music video was positive. Prior to its release, Jenna Halley Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy {{predicted that the}} video would depict women who triumphed over broken relationships as a homage to self-sufficiency. However, she praised the different treatment of the video, complimenting the synchronized dancing and thought that Clarkson kept it classy. Leah Collins of The Vancouver Sun interpreted that the video depicts Clarkson developing a sense of strength and endurance {{as well as an}} ability to lead a large-scale dance routine after surviving a trauma. Erin Strecker of Entertainment Weekly enjoyed Clarkson's goofy expressions and perceived the video as [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] round two. Rand Duren of The Dallas Morning News also reiterated that the music video is a reminiscent of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] and that it was great seeing more dancing and movement from Clarkson. Contessa Gayles of AOL.com described the song as [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "uplifting" [...] and she believed that the music video did the song justice. Trent Maynard of 4Music had a positive response towards the video and deemed Clarkson's look as properly fit in the video. He concluded his review writing, [...] "Nobody has a sense of humor quite like the original American Idol. Oh Kelly, you're the best." [...] The same opinion was echoed by Robbie Daw of Idolator who thought the video was fun especially [...] "when Kelly herself joins the giant mob at the very end." [...] He also stated that his personal favorite clip in the video was [...] "the girls <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> moves underwater with fish swimming all around them." [...] The video placed fourth for VH1's Top 20 Videos of the Year for 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influx of}} {{immigrant}} loggers introduces new risks {{for the local}} communities, such as rural food shortages, and increase in crime rate, {{and an increase in}} the rate of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV.

[...] Some locals have abstained from logging from fear of prosecution, while others have turned to logging out of desperation. [...] With armed militia occupying villages and issuing death threats towards people who object to their activities, people live in fear and communities and families have been divided.|$|E
