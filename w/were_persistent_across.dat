40|$|The feeding {{ecology of}} the Brazilian silverside, Atherinella brasiliensis, in a sub-tropical estuary of Brazil was {{investigated}} through the gut analysis of 1431 individuals. We described dietary composition and analysed seasonal, estuarine habitat, and body size variations in the diet; trophic level; feeding diversity; and gut fullness indices. Results reveal that A. brasiliensis is a typical, generalistic and opportunistic predator that makes use of {{a wide array of}} prey types (at least 89 different types), with zooplankton (mainly calanoids), diatoms, terrestrial insects, and plant detritus making up the bulk of the overall diet. The exotic calanoid Temora turbinata ranked as the primary prey. A wide feeding diversity (mean H` = 2. 26), low trophic level (mean TROPH = 2. 57), and high gut replenishment <b>were</b> <b>persistent</b> <b>across</b> seasons and habitats. Diet composition varied largely and significantly with respect to habitat, season, and body size. A closer assessment showed that habitat and season had a stronger effect on diet than fish size.

40|$|Background:  It is {{increasingly}} recognized that youth who follow early onset persistent (EOP), childhood limited (CL) and adolescent onset (AO) trajectories of conduct problems show somewhat varying patterns of risk (in childhood) and adjustment problems (in adolescence and adulthood). Little, however, {{is known about}} how other adjustment problems differentially co-develop with the EOP, CL and AO trajectories across the childhood and adolescent years. Method:  Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, an epidemiological, longitudinal cohort of boys and girls, we estimated growth curves for parent-reported hyperactivity, emotional difficulties, peer relational problems, and prosocial behaviors conditional on trajectories of conduct problems (i. e., EOP, CL and AO) from ages 4 to 13 years. At ages 7 – 8 years, DSM-IV-based diagnoses of conduct disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression were examined by conduct problems trajectory. Results:  Overall, the development of hyperactivity, emotional difficulties, peer relational problems, and prosocial behaviors mirrored the development of conduct problems, showing similar trajectories. Conclusions:  Results indicated that the problems of EOP youth <b>were</b> <b>persistent</b> <b>across</b> domains, CL youth showed decreased behavior problems while increasing in prosocial behaviors, and AO youth increased in adjustment problems after 10 years of age...|$|E

40|$|Although {{distribution}} {{patterns of}} seabirds at sea {{have been described}} for decades, it remains difficult to identify the mechanisms underlying these patterns. For instance, researchers focusing on prey dispersion as the primary determinant of seabird distribution have found high variability in the spatial overlap of bird and prey aggregations, partially due to the scale-dependent nature of such associations. We conducted a study to identify how the behaviour of capelin Mallotus villosus, the primary prey species of all vertebrate predators in the Northwest Atlantic, influences the search tactics of Common Murres Uria aalge while acting as central-place foragers during chick-rearing. The study was conducted from 1998 - 2002 on and around Funk Island, the largest colony of murres in eastern Canada (∼ 400 000 breeding pairs, situated on the northeast coast of Newfoundland. We made direct measurements of (1) the distribution, a bundance and spatial and temporal persistence of capelin aggregations within the foraging range from the colony (∼ 100 km) in combination with (2) bio-physical habitat characteristics associated with capelin aggregations, and (3) individual- and population-level arrival and departure behaviour of murres from the colony. During July of 2000, capelin {{were found to be}} persistently abundant within specific 2. 25 km blocks of transect ("hotspots"). Further study revealed that capelin persisted in hotspots due to bio-physical characteristics suitable for demersal spawning and for staging areas and foraging areas prior to and after spawning. Directions of return and departure flights of murres measured from the colony did not match during the same observation period (∼ 1 h), indicating that murres departing the colony did not use information on prey distribution provided by the flight paths of flocks returning to the colony (Information Center Hypothesis). Specific, commuting routes (regular flight paths) of murres toward and away from capelin hotspots, however, were obvious at sea, and feeding murres consistently marked the location of these hotspots. This provided excellent conditions for murres to locate capelin from memory and by cueing to activities of conspecifics (local enhancement). Hotspots <b>were</b> <b>persistent</b> <b>across</b> years in this region, presumably allowing marine predators to learn the locations of hotspots, resulting in the use of traditional feeding grounds through generations. Hotspots of predators and prey promote energy transfer among trophic levels, a key ecosystem process. Human predators also concentrate fishing activities within these areas and, thus, {{there is a need to}} identify hotspots for protection. Persistent hotspots would be particularly amenable to the design of marine protected areas defined by the habitats of marine predators and their prey...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} political systems in a framework where transitions are driven by reforms and revolts, and where political systems are a priori unconstrained, ranging continuously from single-man dictatorships to full-scale democracies.

Reinforcing this polarization, extreme political systems <b>are</b> <b>persistent</b> <b>across</b> time: Democracies <b>are</b> intrinsically stable, leading to long episodes without political change.

The objective of this investigation is to analyze the Hispanic-Asian achievement gap in elementary school using the ECLS-K, a longitudinal nationally representative study. I provide detailed descriptive analysis of the trajectory of the gap from kindergarten to fifth grade. Analysis is conducted using three approaches. First, I estimated the mean achievement gap in elementary school and the relative contribution of family, school and teacher factors to the gap. Second, I decomposed the Hispanic-Asian gap into explained and unexplained parts due to observed differences. Finally, I explored whether the achievement gap <b>is</b> <b>persistent</b> <b>across</b> the conditional distribution of test scores. Reading and math scores are the outcome variables. It is found that Hispanic students enter kindergarten with math and reading skills significantly lower as compared to Asians. In kindergarten the unadjusted reading gap starts at. 668 standard deviations below the mean, steadily narrows until third grade but flattens until fifth grade. Math unadjusted gap is larger and presents a different trajectory over time; it starts at. 816 standard deviations below the mean, narrows in first grade and broadens again in fifth grade. Overall, I find that the main predictors of the Hispanic-Asian achievement gap are family socioeconomic factors. Teacher and school factors have a marginal predictive power in explaining the gap. Decomposition analysis indicate that differences in observables between Hispanics and Asians children in family, school and teacher factors explain between 22 % and 49 % of the reading achievement gap in kindergarten. By fifth grade, these factors explain between 34 % and 62 % of the observed achievement gap; I find similar a pattern for math. Quantile regression estimates shows that the achievement gap <b>is</b> <b>persistent</b> <b>across</b> the entire distribution of test scores. However I find {{a shift in the}} pattern of the achievement gap as children progress in the school years.

Results: Controlling for potential confounding variables, blacks and Mexican‐Americans had significantly higher numbers of decayed teeth but fewer numbers of filled teeth than whites.

Web {{search engines}} have become often-used tools for many {{ordinary}} people today {{and a growing}} number of researcher are therefore studying how these lay-persons interact with such tools.

In this paper we report from a longitudinal and comparative transaction log analysis of a large intranet’s search engine covering the period 2000 - 2004. We conclude that intranet users search for other topics than do users of the public web.

In addition, the relevant partitions are required to <b>be</b> <b>persistent</b> <b>across</b> time, as given by low values of the variation of information between optimised partitions across time VI(t,t′).
