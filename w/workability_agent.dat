40|$|Portland cement {{production}} {{is known to}} have a detrimental impact on the global environment and subsequently the construction industry has made moves to introduce more sustainable materials and practices. The introduction of hydraulic lime based mortars for masonry being one example. Nevertheless there are other binders that are also deemed sustainable, as for example, lime or alkali activated ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS). Very little information is available on the performance of lime activated GGBS mortars, especially their tensile bond strength characteristics. This project was designed to compare the performance characteristics and properties of two sets of mortar mixes. One set of samples was based on traditional Portland cement, lime, sand mixes. The other set was based on GGBS, lime, sand mixes, where the lime content served as a <b>workability</b> <b>agent</b> and as an activator for the GGBS. Tensile, flexural and compressive samples were fabricated from both mortar sets and tested at 28 days. The results indicated that mortar mixes containing lime activated GGBS could be used as sustainable alternatives to Portland cement based mortars for masonry applications as they showed similar properties to their Portland cement based counterparts...|$|E

Rejuvenating <b>agent</b> such as waste engine oil (WEO) {{is one of the}} sustainable modifiers {{that can be used to}} improve and attain the desired performance of the aged binder. However, concern arises on the consistency of the engine oil properties due to its unknown history usage. This study focused on the rutting properties evaluation of the partial aged binder integrating with engine oil (new and waste sources) using Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). The findings showed that, the addition of WEO affects the rutting performance under ageing condition. From the isochronal curve, the complex modulus, G * of the rejuvenated binder was found lower than the aged binder at un-aged condition. However, after ageing process, the {{stiffness of}} the rejuvenated binder was increased and the phase angle, decreased obviously compared to virgin binder. The critical temperature of the binder was not differing substantially particularly under ageing. Meanwhile, the ageing index rutting factor (AIRF) clearly summarised that the rejuvenated binder with WEO with higher mass loss more susceptible to ageing...|$|R
