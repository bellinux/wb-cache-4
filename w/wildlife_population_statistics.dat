40|$|The Detroit River spans 32 {{miles from}} Lake St. Clair {{to the western}} Lake Erie basin. It {{includes}} upland habitats, coastal wetlands, riverfront property, and numerous islands. The Detroit River is unique in southeast Michigan because it acts as {{the border between the}} United States and Canada, and is co-managed and researched by both countries. In the early 1960 s, the Detroit River and its tributaries made national headlines because of devastating pollution problems. Fish and <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> were severely degraded as a consequence of loss of habitat, high levels of persistent contaminants, and excessive phosphorus loadings. In the early- 1970 s, pollution abatement programs were instated and fish and <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> were improved, but further action is still warranted. In support of these pollution abatement programs, data on a variety of parameters have been collected over the past 30 years within and surrounding the Detroit River watershed. To assess the status of fish and <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> of the Detroit River, this six-step Integrated Assessment, focused on a defined problem, is used to evaluate potential management options. This assessment compiles existing information on fish and <b>wildlife</b> <b>population</b> fluctuations, pressures on these populations, and current ecological health. The goals of this assessment are to document the extent, characteristics, causes, and consequences of the fluctuating fish and <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> in the Detroit River watershed. Future outcomes are predicted if current management strategies are held constant and with two scenarios of additional management actions, including increased remediation of contaminated sediment and increased protection and restoration of fish and wildlife habitat. Guidance for managers is provided for implementation of the two options to further enhance fish and <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations.</b> While the degradation of many fish and <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> in the Detroit River is irreversible, effective management will continue to improve ecosystem health so that fish and <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> become and remain self-sustaining...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Wildlife-human {{interactions}} are increasing in prevalence as urban sprawl continues to encroach into rural areas. Once {{considered to be}} unsuitable habitat for most wildlife species, urban/suburban areas now host an array of <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations,</b> {{many of which were}} previously restricted to rural or pristine habitats. The presence of some wildlife species in close proximity to dense human populations can create conflict, forcing resource managers to address issues relating to urban wildlife. However, evidence suggests that wildlife residing in urban areas may not exhibit the same life history traits as their rural counterparts because of adaptation to human-induced stresses. This creates difficulty for biologists or managers that must address problems associated with urban <b>wildlife.</b> <b>Population</b> control or mitigation efforts aimed at urban wildlife require detailed knowledge of the habits of <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> in urban areas. This paper describes the history of wildlife in urban areas, provides examples of <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> that have modified their behavior as an adaptation to urban stresses, and discusses the challenges that resource managers face when dealing with urban wildlife...|$|R

However, non-response does not preclude {{identification of}} bounds on <b>population</b> <b>statistics.</b> This paper shows how identified bounds on unidentified <b>population</b> <b>statistics</b> can be obtained under several forms of nonresponse. Organizations conducting major surveys commonly release public-use data files that provide nonresponse weights or imputations to be used for estimating <b>population</b> <b>statistics.</b> The paper shows how to bound the asymptotic bias of estimates using weights and imputations. The results are illustrated with empirical examples based on the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. ...|$|R

40|$|As long linear {{features}} on the landscape, railways, roads and highways have impacts on wildlife and wildlife habitat that are disproportionate {{to the area of}} land that they occupy. In addition to impacts on habitat, highways and railways are sources of road mortality that threaten <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations.</b> Indirect effects on wildlife include reduced access to habitat due to road avoidance and human exploitation. Transportation infrastructure also undermines ecological processes through the fragmentation of <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations,</b> restriction of <b>wildlife</b> movements, and the disruption of gene flow and metapopulation dynamics. A variety of techniques have been used to mitigate the impacts of transportation systems on wildlife movements with mixed success. To make progress on these issues wildlife biologists must: 1) recognize the potential long-term effects of highways and railways on <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations</b> and advocate more strongly for appropriate mitigation measures, 2) document the impacts of transportation infrastructure on <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations,</b> 3) conduct landscape analyses to identify “connectivity zones” and use these analyses to engage transportation planners earlier in the planning process, 4) enlist transportation engineers to help solve technical problems, and 5) design and conduct good monitoring studies to effectively evaluate various mitigation techniques...|$|R

This program is essential in identifying and describing fluctuations of <b>wildlife</b> <b>populations,</b> <b>wildlife</b> habitat use, and changes in species using RFETS.
