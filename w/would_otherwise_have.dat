5|$|Coal balls often {{preserve}} a remarkable {{record of the}} microscopic tissue structure of Carboniferous swamp and mire plants, which <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been completely destroyed. Their unique preservation of Carboniferous plants makes them valuable to scientists, who cut and peel the coal balls to research the geological past.|$|E

5|$|Governments and {{conservation}} groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of infrageneric taxa (such as the subgenus, section and series) in the 19th century by botanists including Augustin Pyrame de Candolle allowed {{the retention of}} large genera that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> become unwieldy. E. J. H. Corner believed that studying large genera might enable greater insights into evolutionary biology, and he concentrated his efforts on large tropical genera such as Ficus.|$|E
5|$|Aspect weavers take {{instructions}} {{known as}} advice specified {{through the use}} of pointcuts and join points, special segments of code that indicate what methods should be handled by aspect code. The implementation of the aspect then specifies whether the related code should be added before, after, or throughout the related methods. By doing this, aspect weavers improve modularity, keeping code in one place that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been interspersed throughout various, unrelated classes.|$|E

5|$|In November 1965, {{together}} with four business partners, David opened Elizabeth David Ltd, a shop selling kitchen equipment, at 46 Bourne Street, Pimlico. The partners were {{spurred on by}} the closure of a professional kitchenware shop in Soho on the retirement of its owner, and the recent success of Terence Conran's Habitat shops, which sold among much else imported kitchen equipment for which there was evidently a market. Among her customers were Albert and Michel Roux, who shopped there for equipment that they <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> to buy in France.|$|E
5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these annals were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous compendium, known as the Annals of the Four Masters. In the process, the authors sometimes modified the chronology and content {{of some of the}} materials, and is thus chronologically untrustworthy. However, it is recognised that they saved for posterity material that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been lost, and the entry contains the longest annalistic account of the battle.|$|E
5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E

London Life can only be played after {{completing}} the Japanese version of the main game Last Specter, but is accessible {{from the beginning of}} the game in North American and Australian versions of the game. The European versions do not include London Life, because the amount of time it would take to translate the game <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> prevented the game from being released before the end of 2011.|$|E
5|$|The low {{turnout was}} {{attributed}} {{in part to}} poor voter registry maintenance. The registry allegedly contains up to 900,000 nonexistent voters due to poor database maintenance, especially in updating the registry using death certificates and change of residence records. This allegation {{was supported by the}} 2011 census. The poor voter records were subsequently cited as the cause of the low formal turnout, which <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> exceeded 50%. It was later estimated that the actual turnout in Croatia itself, without the diaspora, was 61%.|$|E
5|$|The {{network of}} lines south of Preston allowed great {{flexibility}} in the routing of trains. A train approaching the town {{on any of the}} lines from the south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. It was even possible for trains from the north to perform an effective U-turn, a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> had to reverse.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{downloadable}} content packs were released. The Multiplayer Havoc Pack {{launched on}} the game's release date of August 21, 2012, and contains five characters {{for use in}} multiplayer: Perceptor, Ultra Magnus, Blast Off, Wheeljack, and Zeta Prime. It also unlocks the associated customization pieces related to these characters. The Dinobots, excluding Sludge, make up the DLC Dinobot Destructor Pack, released on September 11. The Insecticons, G1 Optimus, Megatron, Hound, and G2 Bruticus were released as DLC for single and multiplayer in the Massive Fury Pack on September 25. Players can also purchase specific customization pieces for their multiplayer characters via microtransactions, allowing players to access content they <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> to play to unlock.|$|E
5|$|Operation Summer '95 was {{launched}} {{in response to the}} resumption of attacks by the VRS and the RSK military on the Bihać pocketone of six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The area was viewed as strategic to the Croatian military effort by the HV General Staff because it presented an obstacle to the supply of the RSK and it pinned down a portion of the RSK military, as well as some VRS forces that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been redeployed. The international community feared the worst humanitarian disaster of the war to that point would occur if the RSK or the VRS overran the Bihać pocket. The United States, France and the United Kingdom were divided about the best way to protect the pocket.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{values of}} the {{composition}} and concentrations of trace metals and minerals in Boletus edulis tend to differ considerably, as the mushroom bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element concentration in the fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of the soils from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low. Whole fruit bodies also contain 4.7μg of vitamin D2 per 100g dry weight. The relatively high ergosterol content (see next section) of the fruit bodies can make the mushroom nutritionally pragmatic for vegetarians and vegans, who <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> a limited intake of vitamin D.|$|E

One of 12 players with previous experience at the tournament for Canada, Getzlaf was a leading player for what many observers have called the greatest team in the tournament's history. With 12 points in 6 games, Getzlaf finished second in overall scoring to teammate Patrice Bergeron's 13. He scored one goal and added two assists in the championship game against Russia as the Canadians won the gold medal by a 6–1 score; it was the nation's first title in eight years at the event.|$|E
5|$|While high {{metallicity}} {{is beneficial}} {{for the creation}} of terrestrial extrasolar planets, an excess amount can be harmful for life. Excess metallicity may lead to the formation {{of a large number of}} gas giants in a given system, which may subsequently migrate from beyond the system's frost line and become hot Jupiters, disturbing planets that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been located in the system's circumstellar habitable zone. Thus, it was found that the Goldilocks principle applies to metallicity as well; low-metallicity systems have low probabilities of forming terrestrial-mass planets at all, while excessive metallicities cause a large number of gas giants to develop, disrupting the orbital dynamics of the system and altering the habitability of terrestrial planets in the system.|$|E
5|$|Without {{sufficient}} {{troops to}} attempt a landing at Batavia itself, Admiral Pellew withdrew from the harbour. Preparing his prizes for the return to Madras, he ordered all prisoners taken from the captured and burnt ships returned to shore under condition of parole. The captured William {{was found to be}} in such a poor state of repair that it was not worth keeping the corvette and Admiral Pellew ordered the ship burnt, noting in his official report that Lieutenant Owen, who as senior lieutenant <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>have</b> been placed in command, should be recompensed with another command as reward for his services in the engagement. With his preparations complete, Pellew then ordered his squadron to disperse, Culloden sailing to Malacca.|$|E

50|$|Some {{economists are}} {{concerned}} about potential inflationary effects driven by increased demand engendered by a fiscal stimulus. In theory, fiscal stimulus does not cause inflation when it uses resources that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>otherwise</b> been idle. For instance, if a fiscal stimulus employs a worker who <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been unemployed, there is no inflationary effect; however, if the stimulus employs a worker who <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had a job, the stimulus is increasing labor demand while labor supply remains fixed, leading to wage inflation and therefore price inflation.|$|R
