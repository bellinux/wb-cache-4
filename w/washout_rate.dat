40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the diagnostic value of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in the differentiation between post-treatment changes and recurrent salivary gland tumors. Patients and methods: A prospectively designed study was conducted on 37 patients having salivary gland malignant tumors treated by surgery or chemo/radiotherapy or both. All patients underwent conventional MRI and DCE-MRI. The obtained DCE-MRI data were interpreted semi quantitatively (using time intensity curves, TIC and time to peak TTP) and quantitatively (using wash in and <b>washout</b> <b>rates).</b> The obtained TICs were classified into four types (A, B, C, and D). Results: There was a significant statistical difference as regards TICs, wash in and <b>washout</b> <b>rates</b> of recurrent salivary gland tumors and that of post treatment changes, whereas there was no significant difference as regards TTP. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed cutoff points of > 10. 25, and > 6. 25 for the wash in and <b>washout</b> <b>rates</b> used to differentiate recurrent tumors from post-treatment changes, respectively. Conclusion: We concluded that DCE MRI has a valuable diagnostic value in the differentiation of recurrent malignant salivary gland tumors from post-treatment changes, especially, for cases that remain unsolved by conventional MR imaging techniques...|$|R

The autonomic nervous system has been proposed to {{play a key role}} in attacks of vasospastic angina. A unique feature of vasospastic angina attacks is periodic fluctuation, which complicates the assessment of disease activity. Methods. Twenty-five patients with left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) spasm were studied: 12 with recent onset of chest pain (group 1) and 13 free of angina for more than 3 months after discontinuing medication (group 2). Group 1 underwent iodine- 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging (in the active phase) and atropine-stress MIBG imaging early after diagnostic angiography, and repeat MIBG imaging when they were free of angina for more than 3 months with medication (in the stable phase). Group 2 also underwent MIBG imaging (in remission). On a bull's-eye map, quantitative analysis of percent uptake and <b>washout</b> <b>rate</b> of MIBG was performed regionally. Results.

Background. Various noninvasive methods {{have been used to}} detect vasospastic angina, but they are not very sensitive in patients with sporadic attacks. MIBG imaging has recently been proposed as a useful tool for detecting vasospastic angina. Methods. Normal limits of both visual and quantitative analysis of two-dimensional polar maps (bull’s-eyes) for MIBG imaging were at first established in 59 normal subjects. For optimal criteria of visual analysis, we established regional differences in abnormal MIBG defect scores. An abnormal region of the bull’s-eye was defined as an area > 2 SD below normal. An abnormal regional <b>washout</b> <b>rate</b> was defined as < 0 %. Using these criteria, we prospectively evaluated 104 patients with suspected vasospastic angina. Visual, bull’s-eye and regional <b>washout</b> <b>rate</b> analyses were compared for overall detection of the disease and for individual vessel involvement. Results. Overall sensitivity by these methods was 30 %, 42 % and 76 %, respectively. <b>Washout</b> <b>rate</b> analysis showed a significantly higher sensitivity than the other two methods. Specificity was 78 %, 72 % and 87 %, respectively. The sensitivity of detecting spasm-induced coronary artery with <b>washout</b> <b>rate</b> analysis was 82 % for the left anterior descending (LAD), 76 % for the right (RCA) and 69 % for the circumflex (Cx) coronary arteries.

In contrast, WOR differed significantly (p <. 0001), while WOS did not differ significantly between before and after the therapy. Conclusion: The <b>washout</b> <b>rate</b> of MIBI is suitable for assessment of cardiac function in CS with steroid therapy, being especially better than the washout score of MIBI for assessment of disease activity of mild myocardial damage in CS with steroid therapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{subthalamic nucleus}} (STN) {{is a common}} {{anatomical}} target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) {{for the treatment of}} Parkinson’s disease. However, the effects of stimulation may spread beyond the STN. Ongoing research aims to identify nearby anatomical structures where DBS-induced effects could be associated with therapeutic improvement or side effects. We previously found that DBS lead location determines the rate – abrupt vs. gradual – with which therapeutic effect washes out after stimulation is stopped. Those results suggested that electrical current spreads from the electrodes to two spatially distinct stimulation targets associated with different <b>washout</b> <b>rates.</b> In order to identify these targets we used computational models to predict the volumes of tissue activated during DBS in 14 Parkinson’s patients from that study. We then coregistered each patient with a stereotaxic atlas and generated a probabilistic stimulation atlas to obtain a 3 -dimensional representation of regions where stimulation was associated with abrupt vs. gradual washout. We found that the therapeutic effect which washed out gradually was associated with stimulation of the zona incerta and fields of Forel, whereas abruptly-disappearing therapeutic effect was associated with stimulation of STN itself. This supports the idea that multiple DBS targets exist and that current spread from one electrode may activate more than one of them in a given patient, producin...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{myocardial}} {{blood flow}} {{before and after}} sublingual nitroglycerin was measured in 10 patients with coronary artery disease. During thoracotomy, 133 Xe was injected directly into the subepicardium in diseased regions of the anterior left ventricular wall, and <b>washout</b> <b>rates</b> were recorded with a scintillation counter. All disappearance curves were closely approximated by two exponential decays analyzed as two parallel flow systems by the compartmental method. The appearance of a double exponential decay pattern in diseased regions suggests that the slow phase was associated with collateral blood flow, although nonhomogeneous myocardium-to-blood partition coefficients for xenon cannot be excluded. Nitroglycerin increased the rapid phase flow in 9 of 10 patients and the slow flow in 7 of 10 patients. Average flow increased in 9 of the 10 patients (P < 0. 01). Mean rapid phase flow in the control state was 110 ml/ 100 g per min and after nitroglycerin increased to 132 ml/ 100 g per min (P < 0. 01); slow phase flow increased from 12 ml/ 100 g per min to 15 ml/ 100 g per min (P < 0. 05). It is concluded that, under these conditions, nitroglycerin improves perfusion in regions of diseased myocardium in patients with coronary artery disease...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Evaluation of {{diagnostic}} accuracy of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI in differentiating benign from malignant {{head and neck}} tumors using both Quantitative and semi quantitative analysis. Patients and methods: 55 patients with head and neck masses underwent DCEMRI at 1. 5  T Philips Ingenia MR scanner. Their enhancement curve patterns, Time to peak, wash in and <b>washout</b> <b>rates</b> were analyzed and compared in benign and malignant tumors. Results: 81. 8 % of benign tumors had gradual progressing and plateau curves, while 93. 3 % of malignant tumors had plateau and fast curves. TTP, wash in and wash out rates were significantly different between benign and malignant tumors. Using TTP cut off value of 83. 3  s differentiated benign from malignant tumors with a sensitivity of 84. 8 % and specificity of 77. 3 %, while wash in rate at cut off value of 15. 4   1 /s provided a sensitivity of 87. 9 % and specificity of 90. 9 %, wash out rates provided at cut off value of 5. 75   1 /s, a sensitivity of 81. 8 % and specificity of 90. 9 %. Conclusion: Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI is a promising method for differentiation between benign and malignant head and neck tumors, wash in rate is the most specific parameter used...|$|R
