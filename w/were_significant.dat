Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, and there <b>were</b> <b>significant</b> domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, {{and treatment of}} terrorist detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly. In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2014. The game was {{directed}} by Mark Pacini, written by Joseph Staten and conceptualized by Keiji Inafune. Mega Man and Metroid <b>were</b> <b>significant</b> influences in its creation. The development was divided between Armature Studio and Comcept into their own distinctive proficiencies, while Asobo Studio assisted. ReCore received mixed reviews, the most critical of which noted insufficient design choices, technical issues regarding lengthy and unsuccessful loading screens – later redressed – and repetitive combat. Praise was overall focused on the story, platforming and controls.|$|E

5|$|Family issues <b>were</b> <b>significant</b> {{concerns}} for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s.

Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E
