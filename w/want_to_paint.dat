5|$|In the mid- to late 1970s Kujau, an able amateur artist, {{turned to}} {{producing}} paintings which he claimed were by Hitler, {{who had been}} an amateur artist as a young man. Having found a market for his forged works, Kujau created Hitler paintings depicting subjects his buyers expressed interest in, such as cartoons, nudes and men in action—all subjects that Hitler never painted, or would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint,</b> according to Charles Hamilton, a handwriting expert and author of books on forgery. These paintings were often accompanied by small notes, purportedly from Hitler. The paintings were profitable for Kujau. To explain his access to the memorabilia he invented several sources in East Germany, including a former Nazi general, the bribable director of a museum and his own brother, who he re-invented as a general in the East German army.|$|E
25|$|By 1940 Hardrick's health {{prevented}} him from working in the family business and he began driving a taxi. He would often sell paintings {{out of the trunk}} and, while driving around, see a subject he would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint.</b> If a man or woman agreed, he would drive them to his studio and complete the portrait in a few hours.|$|E

I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> ourselves into a corner in the second season." [...] On February 4, 2014, Netflix announced it had renewed the web series for a season 3 of undisclosed length. In May 2014, the season {{became one of the first}} Netflix streaming offerings available in 4K video format.|$|E

6000|$|Would you not cry {{out against}} the barbarism and the Puritanism of such an idea? Would you not explain to them that the worst way to honour God is to dishonour man who is made in His image, and {{is the work of}} His hands; and, that if one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> Christ one must take the most Christlike person one can find, and if one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> the Madonna, the purest girl one knows? ...|$|R
50|$|She {{liked the}} {{paintings}} too. But when I told her I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> {{her as she}} appeared in SwanLake, she sadly shook her head.|$|R
500|$|The 1969 {{portrait}} {{was commissioned}} by the trustees of the National Portrait Gallery and funded by art dealer Hugh Leggatt. The style of the second painting stood {{in contrast to the}} first. It has been described as [...] "stark and monumental" [...] with Elizabeth [...] "standing against an ambiguous, spare and gloomy, plain background", as opposed to the earlier [...] "glamorous and romantic" [...] portrait. Annigoni said of the second portrait of the Queen that he [...] "did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> her as a film star; I saw her as a monarch, alone in the problems of her responsibility".|$|E
2500|$|In reflection, Francesa said, [...] "We had 20 {{years of}} {{something}} that was great. We're linked forever. That's just life. So {{the idea that people}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> Mike vs. Mad Dog, who's the good guy, who's the bad guy? You know what? There is no bad guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{painting}} portraits, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "in {{a picture}} I {{want to say}} something comforting as music is comforting. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize, and which we seek to communicate by the actual radiance and vibration of our coloring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The good Lord only knows," [...] responded Mrs. Wrapp, herein {{losing her}} assurance. [...] "Marriage would save most of them. But Helen doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> {{pictures}} and be free." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{subject was}} a {{composite}} of several gas stations Hopper had visited. According to Hopper's wife, the gas station motif was something he had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> for a long time. Hopper struggled with the painting. He had begun to produce new paintings at a slower rate than before, and had trouble finding suitable gas stations <b>to</b> <b>paint.</b> A problem was that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> a station with the lights lit above the pumps, but the stations in his area only turned the lights on when it was pitch dark outside, in order to not waste energy.|$|R
50|$|Brown {{originally}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> a 100 {{foot long}} chameleon, but when Chapel Hill’s Appearance Commission {{rejected the idea}} as too scary and inappropriate, he settled on a 140-foot pencil.|$|R
2500|$|Smart's {{paintings}} have {{been referred to}} as 'surreal', but Smart contended that it was the modern urban world that was surreal and not his depictions of it. [...] "I find myself moved by man in his new violent environment. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> this explicitly and beautifully... only very recently have artists again started to comment on their real surroundings".|$|E
2500|$|.....I {{was stunned}} by the sight of the breech of a 75 {{millimeter}} in the sunlight. It was the magic of light on the white metal. That's all it took for me to forget the abstract art of 1912–1913. The crudeness, variety, humor, and downright perfection of certain men around me, their precise sense of utilitarian reality and its application {{in the midst of the}} life-and-death drama we were in ... made me <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> in slang with all its color and mobility.|$|E
2500|$|After {{returning}} from his last European trip, Hopper rented {{a studio in}} New York City, where he struggled to define his own style. Reluctantly, he returned to illustration to support himself. Being a freelancer, Hopper was forced to solicit for projects, and had {{to knock on the}} doors of magazine and agency offices to find business. His painting languished: [...] "it's hard for me to decide what I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint.</b> I go for months without finding it sometimes. It comes slowly." [...] His fellow illustrator, Walter Tittle, described Hopper's depressed emotional state in sharper terms, seeing his friend [...] "suffering...from long periods of unconquerable inertia, sitting {{for days at a time}} before his easel in helpless unhappiness, unable to raise a hand to break the spell." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1927 Fred C. Britton, {{retiring}} {{principal of}} the North Adelaide School of Fine Arts, and Henry Van Raalte were critical of amateur members who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> without bothering <b>to</b> learn sketching.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pictorial}} {{ideals of}} Roh's original magic realism attracted new generations of artists through the latter {{years of the}} 20th century and beyond. In a 1991 New York Times review, critic Vivien Raynor remarked that [...] "John Stuart Ingle proves that Magic Realism lives" [...] in his [...] "virtuoso" [...] still life watercolors. Ingle's approach, as described in his own words, reflects the early inspiration of the magic realism movement as described by Roh; that is, the aim is not to add magical elements to a realistic painting, but to pursue a radically faithful rendering of reality; the [...] "magic" [...] effect on the viewer comes from the intensity of that effort: [...] "I don't want to make arbitrary changes in what I see to paint the picture, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> what is given. The whole idea is to take something that's given and explore that reality as intensely as I can." ...|$|E

6000|$|After {{a moment}} she thought: [...] "Why am I here? I guess the girls were right. I am a crank--an irresponsible. Why should I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> these malodorous tepee dwellers? Just to be {{different}} from any one else." ...|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Hergé {{decided he}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint.</b> He chose Louis Van Lint, {{one of the}} most {{respected}} Belgian abstract painters at the time, whose work he liked a lot, to be his private teacher.|$|R
50|$|Beal {{knew from}} an early age that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint.</b> Between 1892 and 1901 he studied with William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) on {{weekends}} in New York City and during the summer at Chase’s School in Shinnecock Hills, Long Island.|$|R
6000|$|... "A man {{come along}} an' he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> that on there, and I let 'im; and it's my barn anyway. I guess I {{can do what}} I'm a min' to with it," [...] he ended defiantly; but his eyes wavered.|$|R
6000|$|... "One needn't let oneself {{believe that}} {{dullness}} is unhappiness," [...] said Mr. Brumley. [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> things sadder than they are. But it's not a fine life, it's not a full life, that {{life in a}} Neo-Malthusian suburban hutch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] said he. [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> you. But I {{would have}} done it, sure as shot, if you hadn't promised. Now I'll untie you. I can trust you to stick to your word,--I mean your wag," [...] he said, with a grin.|$|E
60|$|He {{does not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> blue mist {{in order to}} teach you the nature of evaporation; nor this lava stream, to explain to you the {{operation}} of gravity on ponderous and viscous materials. He paints the blue mist, because it brings life and joy to men, and the lava stream because it is death to them.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, Dewis {{reconciled}} {{himself to}} his fate. And, happily so. He was perfectly content <b>painting</b> what he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint...</b> and not producing what was in fashion or what art promoters thought would [...] "sell." [...] He was free to experiment with different techniques, as daughter Yvonne recalled: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I've {{thought it}} all out. I've got the money, now. I keep <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint,</b> and I don't know whether I can or not, {{and the only}} way is to go and find out. It'll be easy enough to come home. I'll keep money enough to pay my way back." ...|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{precursor}} {{of how his}} daughter Constance Forsyth, an artist in her own right, summed up his career: [...] "Perhaps his most outstanding characteristic was his independence. He <b>painted</b> what he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> {{and in the way}} he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> it. He preferred to work in his own way, regardless of what other artists were exploiting in the way of styles and fads. He was never the kind of artist that followed theories or intellectual ideas about what or how <b>to</b> <b>paint.</b> He very early, before studying abroad, developed his own brush technique which varied very little over the years. Even though the general look of his work changed over periods of time, that same technique was still there." [...] (Constance Forsyth to Gary Lynn, March 4, 1975. Quoted by Martin Krause in The Passage, (Indianapolis Museum of Art, 1991), 228.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> me 'at all at all' of course. I'm {{struck with}} the way I'm taking that for granted," [...] the girl decently continued. [...] "When Mr. Nash spoke of it to me I jumped at the idea. I remembered our meeting in Paris and the kind things you said to me. But no doubt one oughtn't to jump at ideas when they {{represent}} serious sacrifices {{on the part of}} others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From her accent? Isn't it fascinating? I didn't believe I {{could ever}} endure Southerners, but we're like one family with the Woodburns. I should think you'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> Miss Woodburn. Don't you think her {{coloring}} is delicious? And such a quaint kind of eighteenth-century type of beauty! But she's perfectly lovely every way, and everything {{she says is}} so funny. The Southerners seem to be such great talkers; better than we are, don't you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I would!" [...] said Robina, {{springing}} to her feet. I {{could not}} see her face, but I knew there was the look upon it that made Primgate <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> her as Joan of Arc; only it would never stop long enough. [...] "I'd love him for talking like that. And I'd respect him. If he was that sort of man I'd pray God to help {{me to be the}} sort of woman he wanted me to be. I'd try. I'd try all day long. I would!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 13, David Pelfrey {{requested}} {{permission from}} the mayor <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> a bridge in Ritter Park red to raise awareness about lung cancer. The Mayor {{said that he was}} [...] "open to the idea" [...] and would [...] "help find a bridge to paint." [...] Pelfrey, who had no intention of painting any span red, was mocking the nearby pink span. Pelfrey publicly stated that if granted permission, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> the Ritter Park bridge white, its original color, so that it is the most [...] "aesthetically pleasing for the residential neighborhood" [...] and park. He also stated that he does not support painting a bridge [...] "obscene colors just to draw attention to something". He continued by saying that if one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> a bridge, it should be a color that is the most harmonious with the surroundings, and that a sign should be placed supporting the cause.|$|R
