Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience."

To see one's children secured against want, is doubtless a delightful thing; but to wish to see them begin the world as rich men, is unwise to ourselves, for it permits no close of our labours, and is pernicious to them; for it leaves no motive to their exertions, none of those sympathies with the industrious and the poor, which form at once the true relish and proper antidote of wealth.|$|E

All institutionalists agree with Veblen’s principle that social analysis {{must begin with}} institutions embodying human relationships, rather than with arbitrary laws of psychology. The notion of starting with specific institutions implies different institutions in different times and places, so it implies change and evolution. My own view of evolution, which agrees with Veblen,. {{may be found in}} Sherman 1995, and in Dugger and Sherman, 2000. Neoclassical economists deny evolutionary change in basic institutions and concentrate on long-run equilibrium analysis. Institutionalists all agree that there is evolution, but the notion is seldom developed in detail and rarely applied to specific cases. The key to a concrete evolutionary paradigm lies in two dichotomies made by Veblen. These dichotomies indicate the most important questions to ask, but not the answers. The questions must be answered by empirical research for each specific society. The dichotomies are certainly NOT...|$|R

60|$|Clemens {{had then}} {{and for many}} years the habit of writing to me {{about what he was}} doing, and still more of what he was experiencing. Nothing struck his imagination, in or out of the daily routine, but he wished to write me of it, and he wrote with the {{greatest}} fulness and a lavish dramatization, sometimes to the length of twenty or forty pages, so that I have now perhaps fifteen hundred pages of his letters. They will no doubt some day be published, but I am not even referring to them in these records, which I think had best come to the reader with an old man's falterings and uncertainties. With his frequent absences and my own abroad, and the intrusion of calamitous cares, the rich tide of his letters was more and more interrupted. At times it almost ceased, and then it would come again, a torrent. In the very last weeks of his life he burst forth, and, though too weak himself to write, he dictated his rage with me for recommending to him a certain author whose truthfulness he could not deny, but whom he hated for his truthfulness to sordid and ugly conditions. At heart Clemens was romantic, and he would have had the world of fiction stately and handsome and whatever the real world was not; but he was not romanticistic, and he was too helplessly an artist not to wish his own work to show life as he had seen it.

Its arrival is especially timely because the recognition that the nucleus is extremely dynamic has now been solidly established as a paradigm shift {{over the past two}} decades, and also because we now see on the horizon numerous ways in which organization itself, including gene location and possibly self-organizingbodies, underlies nuclear functions. “We have entered the cell, the Mansion of our birth, and started the inventory of our acquired wealth. ” —Albert Claude <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>read</b> <b>that</b> morsel from AlbertClaude’s 1974 Nobel Prize lecture it seemed Solomonic wisdom, as it indeed was.

THE NUCLEUS DISCOVERED We cannot know who first saw the nucleus {{but we do know that}} the father of optical microscopy, Antony van Leeuwenhoeck, did so with amphibian and avian erythrocytes in 1710 and that in 1781 Felice Fontana did so as well in eel skin cells. More definitive accounts followed by Franz Bauer, who in 1802 sketched orchid cells and pointed out the nucleus (Bauer 1830 – 1838), as well as by Jan Purkyně, who described it as the vesicula germanitiva in chicken oocytes (Purkyne ̌ 1825), and Robert Brown who observed it in a variety of plant cells (Brown 1829 – 1832), earning additional fame for coining the term “nucleus ” (for excellent accounts of these early descriptions of the nucleus see Gall 1996; Harris 1999). Of course, these early observations did not ascribe particu-lar significance to this structure, the given name simply conveying its central location. Later, the nucleus was increasingly observed and became, with some prescience, a key tenet of the cell theory.

This discourse will appear at the season <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>read</b> <b>that</b> wassail-bowls make their appearance; at the season of pantomime, turkey and sausages, plum-puddings, jollifications for schoolboys; Christmas bills, and reminiscences more or less sad and sweet for elders. If we oldsters are not merry, we shall be having a semblance of merriment. We shall see the young folks laughing round the holly-bush. We shall pass the bottle round cosily as we sit by the fire. That old thing will have a sort of festival too. Beef, beer, and pudding will be served to her for that day also. Christmas falls on a Thursday. Friday is the workhouse day for coming out. Mary, remember that old Goody Twoshoes has her invitation for Friday, 26th December! Ninety is she, poor old soul? Ah! what a bonny face to catch under a mistletoe! [...] "Yes, ninety, sir," [...] she says, [...] "and my mother was a hundred, and my grandmother was a hundred and two." ...|$|R
60|$|While {{she looked}} at the ivy I opened for the first time for many weeks an English newspaper, and <b>I</b> <b>read</b> a speech of Mr. Balfour in which he said that the House of Lords ought to be {{preserved}} because it represented something in the nature of permanent public opinion of England, above {{the ebb and flow of}} the parties. Now Mr. Balfour is a perfectly sincere patriot, a man who, from his own point of view, thinks long and seriously about the public needs, and he is, moreover, a man of entirely exceptionable intellectual power. But alas, in spite of all this, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>read</b> <b>that</b> speech <b>I</b> thought with a heavy heart that there was one more thing that I had to add to the list of the specially English things, such as kippers and cricket; I had to add the specially English kind of humbug. In France things are attacked and defended for what they are. The Catholic Church is attacked because it is Catholic, and defended because it is Catholic. The Republic is defended because it is Republican, and attacked because it is Republican. But here is the ablest of English politicians consoling everybody by telling them that the House of Lords is not really the House of Lords, but something quite different, that the foolish accidental peers whom he meets every night are in some mysterious way experts upon the psychology of the democracy; that if you want to know what the very poor want you must ask the very rich, and that if you want the truth about Hoxton, you must ask for it at Hatfield. If the Conservative defender of the House of Lords were a logical French politician he would simply be a liar. But being an English politician he is simply a poet. The English love of believing that all is as it should be, the English optimism combined with the strong English imagination, is too much even for the obvious facts. In a cold, scientific sense, of course, Mr. Balfour knows that nearly all the Lords who are not Lords by accident are Lords by bribery. He knows, and (as Mr. Belloc excellently said) everybody in Parliament knows the very names of the peers who have purchased their peerages. But the glamour of comfort, the pleasure of reassuring himself and reassuring others, is too strong for this original knowledge; at last it fades from him, and he sincerely and earnestly calls on Englishmen to join with him in admiring an august and public-spirited Senate, having wholly forgotten that the Senate really consists of idiots whom he has himself despised; and adventurers whom he has himself ennobled.|$|R
6000|$|Well, I {{was many}} {{a year before}} I found out that, and I dare say I never should have found it out for myself. A gentleman named Trimmer, who, alas! is now dead, was, I believe, the first to find it out. He knew that {{along the coast of}} Labrador, and other cold parts of North America, and on the shores, too, of the great river St. Lawrence, the {{stranded}} icebergs, and the ice-foot, as it is called, which is continually forming along the freezing shores, grub and plough every tide into the mud and sand, and shove up before them, like a ploughshare, heaps of dirt; and that, too, the ice itself is full of dirt, of sand and stones, which it may have brought from hundreds of miles away; and that, as this ploughshare of dirty ice grubs onward, the nose of the plough is continually being broken off, and left underneath the mud; and that, when summer comes, and the ice melts, the mud falls back into the place where the ice had been, and covers up the gravel which was in the ice. So, what between the grubbing of the ice-plough into the mud, and the dirt which it leaves behind when it melts, the stones, and sand, and mud upon the shore are jumbled up into curious curved and twisted layers, exactly like those which Mr. Trimmer saw in certain gravel-pits. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>read</b> about <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> said, [...] "And exactly like what I have been seeing in every gravel-pit round here, and trying to guess how they could have been made by currents of water, and yet never could make any guess which would do." [...] But after that it was all explained to me; and I said, [...] "Honour to the man who has let Madam How teach him what she had been trying to teach me for fifteen years, while I was too stupid to learn it. Now I am certain, as certain as I can be of any earthly thing, that the whole of these Windsor Forest Flats were ages ago ploughed and harrowed over and over again, by ice-floes and icebergs drifting and stranding in a shallow sea." ...|$|R
