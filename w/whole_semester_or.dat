40|$|Background: Haptic {{simulators}} {{are starting}} to attract a lot of dental schools to use and implement {{as part of their}} preclinical training. However, there is not much data available about the possible ways it could be used to gain the maximum benefits. Students being the end users of this new technology should have a valuable opinion about this topic. Methods: Twenty four dental students enrolled in the 4 th and 5 th years of the dental science program at the school of dentistry and oral health – Griffith University – Queensland – Australia participated in this study. Participants were offered a trial session on the Simodont® Dental Trainer and were asked to evaluate different aspects of this virtual simulator by completing a pre-experimental and post-experimental questionnaire. Results and conclusion: All students valued and appreciated the additional educational benefits the Simodont® Dental Trainer can offer. Before the trial session, fourth year students were more excited and enthusiastic about using the haptic simulator. After the trial session, fifth year students rated the simulator in some aspects higher when compared to fourth year students. All students agreed that Simodont® Dental Trainer should be used in conjunction with other traditional educational methods and to be supplemented by feedback from human educators. Further trials are required to investigate the value of using haptic simulators over a <b>whole</b> <b>semester</b> <b>or</b> a year.

50|$|In certificates, {{grades are}} either rounded to {{integers}} or half-integers. After having rounded the individual grades, a weighted mean {{is used to}} calculate the overall result. The weight of a grade is normally proportional to the number of hours the according subject was taught per week. To pass a year, this overall result needs to be sufficient. Sometimes further conditions need to be fulfilled, such as a maximum allowed number of grades below four. At university level, classes can often be repeated individually in case of an insufficient grade, so not the <b>whole</b> year <b>or</b> <b>semester</b> needs to be repeated.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possible effects of direct and indirect coded error feedback in a Turkish university context with regard to accuracy in writing. Two groups of pre-intermediate level Turkish students participated in this study. While one group of students received direct feedback, i. e., the correct form is written on student’s paper, the other group received indirect coded feedback, i. e., a symbol representing a specific kind of error is used for the indication of the error, on their first draft written composition during a <b>whole</b> <b>semester.</b> The results of the study revealed that while an overall comparison of the groups for the <b>whole</b> <b>semester</b> did not yield any statistically significant differences, the indirect coded feedback group committed fewer errors than the direct feedback group for the <b>whole</b> <b>semester.</b> The division of the semester into three periods showed that while the two groups did not statistically differ from each other by the end of the first period, the divergence gradually increased for the second and third periods, and for both periods the difference was found to be significant in the sense that indirect coded feedback group committed fewer errors than the direct feedback group...|$|R

30|$|We {{also note}} an {{unavoidable}} difference between MIST and MISTO: in MIST, students and instructors {{were asked to}} reflect cumulatively on the <b>whole</b> <b>semester,</b> whereas in MISTO, observers focused only on a particular week of class sessions. Several other studies have used a 1 -week sample (Lund et al. 2015; Lund and Stains 2015), and the high correlations for the Active Learning Strategies between students/instructors (who answered based on experiencing nearly a <b>whole</b> <b>semester)</b> and observers (who answered based on 1  week of class) suggests {{that the degree of}} activity during a 1 -week timeframe was fairly representative of the broader semester. However, the inherent differences in the level of detail and accuracy of these reflections represent a limitation that should be considered when interpreting the results. Although MISTO was designed and used here for 1 -week samples, adjustments can be made to the survey response scales and scoring sheets to support shorter or longer observation periods.|$|R
