5|$|The {{foundation}} of accountable Pony Express history {{rests in the}} few tangible areas where records, papers, letters and mailings have yielded the most historical evidence. Until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express {{was the product of}} a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E

5|$|In October 2013, {{cast member}} Colette Mann, who plays Sheila Canning, {{revealed}} that her character's daughter {{was going to}} be introduced. Producers decided to bring in another member of Sheila's family as they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> her background further. The producers were also keen to introduce a character similar to Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte), who would provoke strong reactions among the characters and viewers. Mann added that the role {{was in the process of}} being cast and the character would arrive the following year. On 30 December 2013, it was announced that New Zealand actress Morgana O'Reilly had been cast as Naomi. O'Reilly attended two rounds of auditions before being cast. She and her husband filmed her first audition in their garden in Sydney, before O'Reilly flew to Melbourne to audition in the studio, alongside Mann and Stefan Dennis (Paul Robinson).|$|E
5|$|Naomi Canning is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Morgana O'Reilly. Naomi was introduced as {{the daughter of}} established character Sheila Canning (Colette Mann), after producers decided they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> her background further. O'Reilly filmed her first audition in her garden in Sydney, before flying to Melbourne to audition in the studio. She competed with five other actresses for the part, but she believed that she was meant to get the role as Naomi is her middle name. A week after the second audition, O'Reilly's agent informed her that she had won the role. O'Reilly then relocated to Melbourne and began filming her first scenes in November 2013. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 25 March 2014. The character departed on 2 October 2015, following O'Reilly's decision to pursue new acting roles.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has spawned}} {{numerous}} spin-offs and metaseries. Several are, in fact, not Final Fantasy games, but were rebranded for North American release. Examples include the SaGa series, rebranded The Final Fantasy Legend, and its two sequels, Final Fantasy Legend II and Final Fantasy Legend III. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was specifically developed for a United States audience, and Final Fantasy Tactics is a tactical RPG that features many references and themes {{found in the}} series. The spin-off Chocobo series, Crystal Chronicles series, and Kingdom Hearts series also include multiple Final Fantasy elements. In 2003, the Final Fantasy series' first direct sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, was released. Final Fantasy XIII was originally intended to stand on its own, but the team <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the world, characters and mythos more, resulting {{in the development and}} release of two sequels in 2011 and 2013 respectively, creating the series' first official trilogy. Dissidia Final Fantasy was released in 2009, a fighting game that features heroes and villains from the first ten games of the main series. It was followed by a prequel in 2011. Other spin-offs have taken the form of subseries—Compilation of Final FantasyVII, Ivalice Alliance, and Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy.|$|E
30|$|My {{claim in}} this paper is that, to a {{significant}} degree, ritual among the Rathvas, a community of adivasis (indigenous people) {{who live in the}} easternmost portion of the western Indian state of Gujarat, proceeds by constructing and then breaching borders.

Since this is a native study, as I am a member of CAN, I plan to observe certain times, such as meetings, rallies, awareness events, specifically for my research. I plan to use interviews and participant observation as my main tactics of research.

25|$|Watson {{then went}} to Copenhagen University in September 1950 for a year of {{postdoctoral}} research, first heading to the laboratory of biochemist Herman Kalckar.

Watson, however, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the structure of DNA, and his interests did not coincide with Kalckar's. After working part of the year with Kalckar, Watson spent the remainder of his time in Copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist Ole Maaloe, then a member of the Phage Group.|$|E
25|$|Setsuna {{was created}} as a Kurd because {{director}} Seiji Mizushima <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the situation people in the Middle East go through which forces {{them to participate in}} wars. He was also made to contrast previous Gundam characters who were relatable with the audience. Setsuna has been a popular character in Japan, where voice actor Mamoru Miyano received an award for the role, and within the Gundam fanbase, ranking highly in various polls. However, critical reception to Setsuna's character from English-language publications for anime, manga and other media has been mixed, criticizing his silent personality but praising his growth across the series.|$|E

Sandy Denny also left to found her own group Fotheringay. Dave Pegg took over on bass guitar and has been the group's one constant ever since, in an unbroken membership of over four decades. The band made no serious attempt to replace Denny, and, although she would briefly return, the sound of the band would now be characterized by male vocals.|$|E

25|$|Meyer {{continued}} {{writing to}} the end chronologically, not worrying about the backstory. She lettered the chapters instead of numbering them, Chapter 13 being E. The last chapter of the first draft kept getting longer and longer, so she wrote epilogue after epilogue. However, {{she realized that she}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> many of the events in the backstory and the reasons behind the events in the chapters, so she planned to write a 5-6 chapter backstory. Instead, these turned into twelve chapters {{by the time she was}} finished. In a matter of three months she had completed a novel. She has said she was writing for her own enjoyment, never thinking of publishing the work. She finished the manuscript on August 29, 2003.|$|E
25|$|English explorers and colonists named Hudson Bay after Sir Henry Hudson who {{explored}} the bay beginning August 2, 1610 on his ship Discovery. On his fourth voyage to North America, Hudson {{worked his way}} around Greenland's west coast and into the bay, mapping much of its eastern coast. Discovery became trapped in the ice over the winter, and the crew survived onshore at {{the southern tip of}} James Bay. When the ice cleared in the spring, Hudson <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the rest of the area, but the crew mutinied on June 22, 1611. They left Hudson and others adrift in a small boat. No one knows the fate of Hudson or the crew members stranded with him, but historians see no evidence that they survived for long afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Cisplatin, a platinum-based compound, was {{discovered}} by a Michigan State University researcher, Barnett Rosenberg, working under an NCI contract. This was yet another serendipitous discovery: Rosenberg had initially <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the possible effects of an electric field on the growth of bacteria. He observed that the bacteria unexpectedly ceased to divide when placed in an electric field. Excited, he spent months of testing {{to try to explain}} this phenomenon. He was disappointed to find that the cause was an experimental artifact — the inhibition of bacterial division was pinpointed to an electrolysis product of the platinum electrode rather than the electrical field. This accidental discovery, however, soon initiated a series of investigations and studies into the effects of platinum compounds on cell division, culminating in the synthesis of cisplatin. This drug was pivotal in the cure of testicular cancer. Subsequently, Eve Wiltshaw and others at the Institute of Cancer Research in the United Kingdom extended the clinical usefulness of the platinum compounds with their development of carboplatin, a cisplatin derivative with broad antitumour activity and comparatively less nephrotoxicity.|$|E
