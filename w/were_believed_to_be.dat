5|$|Some traditions {{also hold}} that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; {{after the first}} {{invitation}} they can {{come and go as}} they please. Though folkloric vampires <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to sunlight.|$|E
5|$|South American giant {{cockroaches}} of {{the genus}} Lucihormetica <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first known example of defensive mimicry, emitting light in imitation of bioluminescent, poisonous click beetles.

5|$|Ale <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{able to make}} men insane; {{in eastern}} Serbia {{there is a special}} term for such a man: alosan. When people {{encountered}} an ala on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carnivores. This erroneous conception {{was based}} on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 one {{of three}} corps {{headquarters}} for the ground forces was situated at Hargeisa in the northwestern Woqooyi Galbeed region.

5|$|In his {{dissertation}} {{he argued that}} the iron ore near Clinton was a primary sediment; at the time the deposits <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> secondary nodules formed by replacement of primary limestone. His Princeton graduate student Hayes proved a similar result about the iron ores of his native Wabana, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1919, Smyth showed that a green mineral in the Clinton ores was chamosite and also a primary sediment.|$|E

Germany had threatened in propaganda to attack New York with V-1 flying bombs and V-2 missiles. After the war the Allies {{determined that the}} submarines had not been carrying either.|$|E

5|$|Teeth {{from what}} is now {{documented}} as a Tyrannosaurus rex were found in 1874 by Arthur Lakes near Golden, Colorado. In the early 1890s, John Bell Hatcher collected postcranial elements in eastern Wyoming. The fossils <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> from a large species of Ornithomimus (O. grandis) but are now considered Tyrannosaurus rex remains. Vertebral fragments found by Edward Drinker Cope in western South Dakota in 1892 and assigned to Manospondylus gigas have also been recognized as belonging to Tyrannosaurus rex.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Ephraim Fabricant {{was named}} for real-life murderer Valery Fabrikant, a mechanical engineering professor who shot dead four of his colleagues in {{what became known as}} the Concordia University massacre. In addition, the character's back-story and demise were both intended to echo the case of Jack the Ripper—both <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> medically trained, while the use of Fabricant's kidney to send a message is based on the From Hell letter, sent to the police by the Ripper along with one of his victims' kidneys.|$|E
5|$|The {{great amount}} of faith given to foxes {{can be seen in}} how, {{as a result of the}} Inari belief where foxes <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Inari no Kami or its servant, they were {{employed}} in practices of dakini-ten by mikkyō practitioners and shugendō practitioners and in the oracles of miko and other practitioners, and the customs related to kitsunetsuki can be seen as having developed in such a religious background.|$|E

5|$|Trees {{have been}} venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts, certain trees, {{especially}} the oak, ash and thorn, held special significance as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking {{the lives and}} fortunes of individuals to them or using them as oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shy nymphs who inhabited trees.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} were made to locate the remains of Yagan's body, which <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of Belhus. A remote sensing survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful. Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite the remains.|$|E
5|$|By October 1906, {{many in the}} U.S. government, {{including}} Secretary of State Elihu Root, {{were worried}} that war could break out in the Pacific between the United States and Japan. However, the Aleutian Islands <b>were</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of little strategic importance to the United States, and were ignored {{by a number of}} pre-war strategies formulated by the U.S. armed forces, including the Naval War Board's 1896 plan, which would have brought only a few scout ships to the Islands. In 1911, the Naval War Board considered three options through which Japan could mount an invasion of the United States, one of which involved an attack on the Aleutian Islands. However, this option was discarded by the Board owing to the cold climate of the islands.|$|E
