50|$|In the United States, {{the wine}} laws are more {{flexible}} than European standards {{in regards to}} regulations on what viticultural and <b>winemaking</b> <b>practice</b> are allowed in each wine region. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF) defines and approves applications for regions to become American Viticultural Areas. This system was established in 1978 with the Augusta AVA in Missouri designated as the first recognized AVA on June 20, 1980. A sizable portion of American wine laws relate to wine labelling practices and include the stipulations that if an AVA name appears on the label that at least 85% of grapes used to produce the wine must come from that AVA. In addition to AVAs, every American state and county can produce wine and label it under their state/county wide appellation provided at least 75% of the grapes come from that area. The state of California and Texas have wine laws increasing the requirement to 100% and 85%, respectively, for use of a statewide appellation on the wine label.|$|E

30|$|Grape must {{inoculation}} with selected S. cerevisiae strains is {{a general}} <b>winemaking</b> <b>practice</b> which requires the production of ADY as stable starter for long-term storage. However, this is a stressing process that challenges the fermentation performance of final biomass (Pérez-Torrado et al. 2009; Gómez-Pastor et al. 2010; Garre et al. 2010), largely due to oxidative damage of cellular macromolecules caused by ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, that influence cell vitality and viability (França et al. 2007). The adaptation and resistance of S. cerevisiae to desiccation include the protection against oxidative stress through ROS scavenging enzymes, such as catalase and glutathione reductase, and protective metabolites, such as trehalose and reduced glutathione (GSH). Recently, we identified a set of biochemical parameters (levels of oxidized glutathione and trehalose, and catalase and of glutathione reductase activities) after dehydration to predict physiologically relevant phenotypes for wine yeasts of potential interest for ADY production (Gamero-Sandemetrio et al. 2014), and demonstrated that low level of oxidative defense characterizes the worse performing strains. So, the analysis of protective mechanisms and/or treatments against oxidative stress, for instance via natural or food grade antioxidants, would have important biotechnological implications {{for the production of}} ADY and may also suggest potential therapeutic targets for several oxidative stress-related diseases (Halliwell and Gutteridge 2010; Escoté et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} wine {{produced}} in England and Wales is traditional method sparkling wine. English Sparkling Wine (ESW) {{has gained a}} good international reputation for quality, and maintaining this standard {{is critical to the}} UK wine industry. Effervescence and foamability are key features used to assess ESW quality. A critical, yet understudied, area of research is the potential for dosage to influence foam behaviour via associated changes in wine viscosity. In this project, dosage treatments of increasing levels of sucrose (5 g/L, 10 g/L, 20 g/L, and 50 g/L,) were added to commercially produced ESW, using commercial dosage practices. After storage for two months, bottles were opened and the foamability attributes of different treatments analyses via two novel foam assessment methods; an adapted Mosalux method and a novel image analysis method, designed to simulate more accurately ‘real world’ serving conditions when assessing foam behaviour. General wine chemical parameters as well as the wine dynamic viscosity were also measured. Results indicated that increasing sucrose concentration at dosage resulted in an improved foam formation, but reduced foam stability. As expected, sucrose increased wine viscosity and we hypothesised that this change could be the major driver for the observed alterations in foam behaviour. These results give an important insight into the impact that dosage treatments can have on the quality of foam produced upon pouring, and therefore have the potential to inform future sparkling <b>winemaking</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|E

Object of our project was to study wine micro-oxygenation through LC-MS untargeted metabolomic profiling. Eight different theses, differentiated by the dose of oxygen (four levels) and iron (two levels) were applied in a Sangiovese wine, before and after the malolactic fermentation. All other conditions were strictly standardized and monitored, while every thesis was carried out in triplicate. The metabolomics untargeted analysis was performed by a Synapt UPLC-MS QTof system, both in negative and positive electrospray ionization, and every sample was injected twice. Raw data were converted to CDF format and processed by XCMS, for feature extraction, grouping and alignment. The candidate list for separating the various levels of metal and oxygen was identified by using a Support Vector Machine algorithm. Analysis and advanced data analysis has been performed by Matlab.

40|$|Fermentation at low {{temperatures}} {{is one of}} the most popular current winemaking practices because of its reported positive impact on the aromatic profile of wines. However, low temperature is an additional hurdle to develop Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeasts, which are already stressed by high osmotic pressure, low pH and poor availability of nitrogen sources in grape must. Understanding the mechanisms of adaptation of S. cerevisiae to fermentation at low temperature would help to design strategies for process management, and to select and improve wine yeast strains specifically adapted to this <b>winemaking</b> <b>practice.</b> The problem has been addressed by several approaches in recent years, including transcriptomic and other high-throughput strategies. In this work we used a genome-wide screening of S. cerevisiae diploid mutant strain collections to identify genes that potentially contribute to adaptation to low temperature fermentation conditions. Candidate genes, impaired for growth at {{low temperatures}} (12 °C and 18 °C), but not at a permissive temperature (28 °C), were deleted in an industrial homozygous genetic background, wine yeast strain FX 10, in both heterozygosis and homozygosis. Some candidate genes were required for growth at low temperatures only in the laboratory yeast genetic background, but not in FX 10 (namely the genes involved in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis). Other genes related to ribosome biosynthesis (SNU 66 and PAP 2) were required for low-temperature fermentation of synthetic must (SM) in the industrial genetic background. This result coincides with our previous findings about translation efficiency with the fitness of different wine yeast strains at low temperature.

Wine micro-oxygenation is a common <b>winemaking</b> <b>practice</b> for red wine, that consists in a continuous addition of small amounts of oxygen into the wine {{in order to improve}} its color, aroma, texture and its positive evolution during ageing. Although being widely used and studied for decades, not all the mechanisms occurring during this mild exposure of wine to oxygen are completely known. Moreover, no analytical tools are available to winemakers in order to control the process. Object of our project was to study the wine micro-oxygenation through LC-MS untargeted metabolomic profiling. For this purpose, the effect of two wine micro-oxygenation experiments, one before and one after the malolactic fermentation, were studied by untargeted UPLC-QTOF MS, allowing to profile > 1000 components of Sangiovese wines. The design of this experiment allowed us to investigate the influence of oxygen and iron on the wine composition. Using the chromatographic and spectral data set of our laboratory and information from the literature it was possible to annotate more than 250 compounds in wines. The data analysis through supervised and unsupervised multivariate methods highlighted findings that revealed new hypothesis regarding the formation and evolution of polyphenols during wine ageing.
