5|$|On July 10, 2005 a new trolley station {{opened on}} the SDSU campus, after {{construction}} began in 1999. The station connected students and faculty with other areas in San Diego county and helped to combat the low availability of parking around campus. The $103 million station <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> university's several construction projects {{that occurred in the}} 2000s. Starting in the late 1990s, a $500 million College Community Redevelopment Project {{led to the development of}} the $8.5 million Piedra del Sol Apartments, the $14.3 million Fraternity Row, and future developments of a $15 million Sorority Row, a $150 million Paseo retail, office, and apartment project, as well as a $125 million research and office park. In 2003, a pedestrian bridge opened, connecting several of the dorms to the main campus. In the same year, the campus's most technologically advanced and largest classroom (capable of holding 500 students) was completed. Through 2008 and 2009, the campus began work on constructing a new alumni center, expanding Aztec Center, and modifying Storm Hall and Nasitir Hall to add more office and classroom space.|$|E
5|$|Sledd had not {{anticipated}} that the Lake City campus would be abandoned, and had assumed {{that it would be}} selected as the location of the newly consolidated men's university, placing him in a strong position to become the first president of the new institution. The selection of Gainesville for the campus of the new men's university put Sledd's future as its first president in question. The University of Florida in Lake City <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four existing institutions that were to be merged to form the new university, and there were other possible candidates for the presidency. Albert A. Murphree, president of Florida State College in Tallahassee, was the favorite of several prominent members of the legislature. But Sledd had Governor Broward's backing, and the Board of Control ultimately selected him to be the first president on June 7, 1905; Sledd's appointment was for a single year, but renewable on an annual basis, as was typical in the university's early years when the Board of Control appointed or re-appointed the presidents of the state's public colleges for each academic year. Murphree remained the president of the newly consolidated women's college in Tallahassee until 1909.|$|E

25|$|Through {{the thyroid}} clinic, Campos {{likewise}} pursued research on {{whether there was}} a genetic factor that contributed to endemic goiter. His findings, as contained in a paper that he published in 1961, proposed that the iodine intake deficiency thought to be the main cause of goiter <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triggering factors of the disease, and that physiology and anatomy proved to be more important considerations as some people were born without the enzyme necessary to take in trace elements such as iodine even if it were present in food and water.|$|E
25|$|One of Lloyd's {{crowning}} achievements {{during her}} years at Michigan was {{the development of}} women's dormitories. Two major residence halls were built under her watchful eye; Stockwell and Mosher—Jordan. She also was beneficial in the planning of the dorm that would eventually bear her name. Supportive programs for the female students were very important to her as well. The Women's Athletic Building <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many programs that advanced {{the quality of life}} for these undergraduate women due to her efforts. Most notably, was her dedication to the Michigan League, which was newly completed when she began her term as Dean. It proved to be a headquarters for activities of women students as well as for alumnae.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} seventeenth-century and the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth-century witnessed an increasing concern for vices and immorality spreading all over the country. There was a general sense of falling into the worst possible form of behaviour and a common feeling that avarice, vice, idleness, blasphemy, vagrancy and crime were all entangles together pushing people (poor and wealthy, young and old) into a slippery slope to damnation. A drastic social reformation was required and, at the end of the seventeenth-century, societies for the reformation of manners started emerging with a rank of proper paid agents operating locally. Indeed, Defoe <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many eighteenth-century voices believing that at least part of the falling of the offender was due to a weakening of the social and moral values of the English society.|$|E

25|$|Harriet Powers, a slave-born African American woman, {{made two}} famous story quilts. She <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many African-American quilters {{who contributed to}} the {{evolution}} of quilting. The first nationwide recognition of African-American quiltmaking came when the Gee's Bend quilting community was celebrated in an exhibition that opened in 2002 and travelled to many museums, including the Smithsonian. Gee's Bend is a small, isolated community of African-Americans in southern Alabama with a quiltmaking tradition that goes back several generations and is characterized by pattern improvisation, multiple patterning, bright and contrasting colors, visual motion, and a lack of rules. The contributions made by Harriet Powers and others quilters of Gee's Bend, Alabama have been recognized by the US Postal Service with a series of stamps. The communal nature of the quilting process (and how it can bring together women of varied races and backgrounds) was honored in the series of stamps.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{societies}} of hunter-gatherer tribes had no social stratification, and later {{societies of}} the Bronze Age had noticeable social stratification, which saw {{the creation of}} occupational specialization, the state and social classes of individuals who were of the elite ruling or religious classes, full-time warriors and wealthy merchants, contrasted with those individuals {{on the other end}} of the economic spectrum who were poor, enslaved and hungry. In between these two economic models (the hunter-gatherer tribes and Bronze Age civilisations) we find the later Neolithic and Eneolithic societies such as the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, where the first indications of social stratification began to be found. However, it would be a mistake to overemphasise the impact of social stratification in the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, since it was still (even in its later phases) very much an egalitarian society. And of course, social stratification <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many aspects of what is regarded as a fully established civilised society, which began to appear in the Bronze Age.|$|E

25|$|These {{concerns}} found expressing in the activism of the Moldovan Movement in Support of Restructuring—a {{movement of}} the intelligentsia oriented mostly towards generalized economic and political liberalization—and the Alexei Mateevici Literary-Musical Club, which pulled together prominent cultural and political figures, activists and citizens to celebrate and discuss Moldovan language, literature and history. Cultural revival <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issues championed by such informals in early 1988. However, {{during the course of}} that year events around the Soviet Union, and particularly the bloody clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in Nagornyi Karabakh and the pogrom against Armenians in Sumgait, brought issues of ethnicity increasingly to the fore in the union press. In Moldova, social movements increasingly began to focus on three issues involving language: the identity of the Moldovan and Romanian language, the artificiality of the use of the Cyrillic alphabet for the Moldovan language, and need for Moldovan to be given the status of official language of the republic. By June 1988, the Moldovan republican government began taking its cue from social movement leaders and discussing these issues, touching off the events that culminated {{in the creation of the}} Pridnestrovian state.|$|E
25|$|Government {{marriage}} {{officers who}} have an objection of conscience to solemnising same-sex marriages may note this objection in writing to the Minister of Home Affairs, {{and if they do}} so they cannot be compelled to solemnise same-sex marriages. (This provision does not apply to religious marriage officers because they are in any case not obliged to solemnise a marriage that would violate the doctrines of their religion.) Several constitutional scholars have argued that this provision is unconstitutional, representing as it does state-sanctioned discrimination in violation of the right to equality. In September 2016, almost a decade after same-sex marriage was legalized in South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs released a list of marriage offices across the country that are willing to solemnise same-sex marriages. According to the list, of the 409 marriage offices only 117 (or 28.6%) are willing to do so. In Gauteng, 17 out of 57 offices said they would conduct same-sex marriages, 10 out of 59 in the Eastern Cape, 5 out of 28 in the Free State, 10 out of 58 in Mpumalanga, 16 out of 61 in Limpopo, 10 out of 34 in the Western Cape, 9 out of 22 in the Northern Cape, 29 out of 68 in KwaZulu-Natal and 10 out of 22 in North West. Following its release, Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba said the list <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strategies that the Department had undertaken to resolve the issue, which include increasing sensitisation of Home Affairs officials and ensuring that LGBT people are treated respectfully and according to policies and laws by staff.|$|E
500|$|Marx <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{reporters in}} Europe that the New York Tribune employed.

Thus Marx very early began to write on issues affecting the United States — particularly the [...] "slavery crisis" [...] and the [...] "War Between the States".|$|E

Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I just remember Dan and I looking at each other when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you {{this was going to happen}} in the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, we just thought that was a really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Browns' early years, Paul Brown {{wanted to}} keep on reserve a number of {{promising}} players who {{did not make the}} team's official roster.

The taxi squad <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ways in which McBride backed Brown. He viewed owning the team as primarily a civic duty – as a gift to the city. [...] "Cleveland has been good to me," [...] he said in a 1947 interview. [...] "I've made a great deal of money here. If I was looking for a get-rich-quick investment, the last thing I'd do is buy a pro football club. It's a risky business. Too much depends on ideal weather conditions, and this is no climate to risk a buck on a raindrop." ...|$|E
500|$|Away from acting, Hawke {{directed}} the music video for the 1994 song [...] "Stay (I Missed You)," [...] by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb, {{who was a}} member of Hawke's theater company at the time. In a 2012 interview, Hawke said that the song, which was included in Reality Bites, is the only number-one popular song by an unsigned artist in the history of music. He published his first novel in 1996, The Hottest State, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, [...] "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best things I ever did." [...] The book met with a mixed reception. Entertainment Weekly said that Hawke [...] "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in The Hottest State. If Hawke is serious... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues." [...] The New York Times thought Hawke did [...] "a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion", concluding that The Hottest State was ultimately [...] "a sweet love story".|$|E

500|$|The {{pictures}} were taken almost entirely in Super 8 format, {{and most of}} the photo shoots took place in New York City and Miami. Locations in New York City included the Hotel Chelsea and Times Square's all-male burlesque Gaiety Theatre (dancers from theatre participated in one of the book's photo sessions), whereas in Miami the majority of the sessions were shot at a house Madonna had purchased just before starting the project, and in several beaches and streets. One morning during the four-day Florida shoot Madonna was prancing around her 14-bedroom house in Miami completely naked, when someone jokingly suggested she go out on the street, then, according to Baron [...] "the next thing we're in the street" [...] where allegedly [...] "cars screeched to a halt, motorists whistled, and one entranced cyclist fell off his bike." [...] This <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many crazy episodes that took place during the shooting of the book. According to Baron, during the photo shoots [...] "'d do something crazy and then we'd come up with something even crazier". One of the most shocking photographs made for the book, which featured two women in post-punk attire flanking Madonna with one of them holding a knife to Madonna's crotch, was dismissed as it was considered too violent. At some point, while the book was being produced, some of the photographs were stolen, but were quickly recovered by the FBI. According to New York magazine, there were approximately 80,000photographs taken for the book, but only a handful made the final cut. The printing of the book was extended for 15days making the total production process last about eight months.|$|E
