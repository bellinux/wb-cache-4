2500|$|After {{his defeat}} in the 1990 {{elections}} {{at the hands of}} opposition candidate Maulana Hassan Jan (a close confidante of the Afghan Pashtun leader Gulbadin Hekmatyar), Wali Khan opted to retire from electoral politics and turned down a senate ticket from his party and the offer from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of contesting Lahore.

40|$|Mountain {{communities}} are amongst those marginalized groups whose destinies are mostly decided by an influential tribe of resourceful institutions/persons who often represent diverse interest groups. Be {{it in the}} name of conservation or tourism, we always find ourselves the last party to <b>decide</b> <b>our</b> own <b>destinies.</b> Perhaps it is because we live in a land of abundant resources and opportunities. Perhaps, it is because of our looking at the mountains from an all-together different perspective. Or it may be due to our isolation or poverty or a myriad of other esoteric reasons. However, in [...] ...|$|R

The book Return to Fukushima (published in March 2017 by Carpet Bombing Culture) shows in the end, these macro-economic decisions are measured out in individual human lives, losses and hopes.|$|R
5000|$|A modern {{advocate}} of sortition, political scientist John Burnheim, argues for systems of sortition as follows: Let the convention for <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> is <b>our</b> common {{will be that}} we will accept the decision {{of a group of}} people who are well informed about the question, well-motivated to find as good a solution as possible and representative of our range of interests simply because they are statistically representative of us as a group. If this group is then responsible for carrying out <b>what</b> it <b>decides,</b> the problem of control of the execution process largely vanishes.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, {{when the}} state {{legislature}} voted to hold a public referendum on the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment, Equality Alabama's chair Howard Bayless said the legislators were [...] "meddling {{into the lives of}} families. The government is <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> families are and what families are made of, and to me that's unconscionable." [...] Before the referendum, Equality Alabama opened offices in Montgomery and Birmingham and sponsored programs to increase LGBT visibility and attempt to sway voters. [...] The amendment passed, however, by an 81% margin in favor of forbidding recognition of same-sex marriages and civil unions.|$|R
50|$|John Caldwell Holt {{asserts that}} youths {{should have the}} right to control and direct their own learning, and that the current {{compulsory}} schooling system violates a basic fundamental right of humans: the right to <b>decide</b> <b>what</b> enters <b>our</b> minds. He thinks that freedom of learning is part of freedom of thought, even more fundamental a human right than freedom of speech. He especially states that forced schooling, regardless of whether the student is learning anything whatsoever, or if the student could more effectively learn elsewhere in different ways, is a gross violation of civil liberties (Holt, 1974).|$|R

500|$|If {{his opponents}} objected that, if {{everything}} {{is determined by}} destiny, there is no individual responsibility, since what has been once foreordained must happen, come what may, Chrysippus replied {{that there is a}} distinction to be made between simple and complex predestination.
