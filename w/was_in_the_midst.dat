In this power vacuum, many smaller states such as Judah were able to govern themselves without foreign intervention from larger empires.|$|E

5|$|By 1967 {{the debate}} over ABM systems had become a major public policy issue, with almost continual debate on the topic in {{newspapers}} and magazines. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> of these debates, on 17 June 1967, that the Chinese tested their first H-bomb in Test No. 6.

At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, Cuba <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> of a {{constitutional}} crisis {{as a result of}} a disputed election and an attempt by elected President Tomás Estrada Palma to stay in power after the conclusion of his term.

This was permitted under the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1903, a treaty that stipulated the degree of United States intervention in Cuba. After a brief period of stabilization by Secretary Taft, Magoon was appointed governor under the Constitution of Cuba, effectively with absolute authority and backed by the U.S. military.|$|E

Operation Archery was a larger raid at Vågsøy Island. This raid involved men from Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 6 Commandos, a Royal Navy flotilla, and limited air support. The raid caused significant damage to factories, warehouses, and the German garrison, and sank eight ships.

5|$|Stanisław August Poniatowski, King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was the {{commander-in-chief}} of the Polish forces, {{but in practice}} he delegated this position to his nephew, Prince Józef Poniatowski.

In practice, Polish forces, still forming following the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May (which specified an army size of 100,000) numbered only 37,000.

Additionally, the province's economic condition remained poor. Liberal leader William R.

Reid asserted in response that Alberta's taxes had decreased since 1921, and criticised Howson for simultaneously attacking government spending and demanding new infrastructure projects.|$|E

But it was not until May 27 that Congress passed an emergency tariff increase on agricultural products.
