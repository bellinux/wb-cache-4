The singer wanted to make a song with Spanish influences, in order to pay homage for her Spanish mother. During a day in the studio, they came up with a melody but did not have any words. Then she called her mother for help. Halliwell {{recalled}} asking her, [...] "Mum, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to a bloke in Spanish if you fancy him and are being romantic?" [...] Her mother then said she did not remember that. So she asked her look at her library of Spanish language romances, and she read the titles out to Halliwell. Eventually she came out with [...] "¿Dónde está el hombre con fuego en la sangre?" [...] ("Where is the man with fire in his blood?" [...] in English), and she liked the way it sounded, and included the line {{at the beginning of the}} song. After [...] "Look at Me" [...] peaked only at number two, her record company wanted her to release [...] "Lift Me Up", while the Absolute team wanted [...] "Bag It Up", but she chose to release [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] after receiving good reception from children.

2500|$|Sheehan is {{best remembered}} as a novelist; in his novel My New Curate, he recounts an {{incident}} of a clerical appointment {{that may well be}} autobiographical and refer to his arrival in Doneraile: [...] "The Bishop sent for me and said, with what I would call a tone of pity or contempt, but he was incapable of either, for he was the essence of charity and sincerity: 'Father Dan, you are a bit of a literateur, I understand.

And when the Captain was got out of Bed, who was then very ill of a Feaver, Every came and said, I am a Man of Fortune, and must seek my Fortune.|$|E
