Accordingly, people have an obligation to act upon principles that a community of rational agents would accept as laws. In such a community, each individual would only accept maxims that can govern every member of the community without treating any member merely as a means to an end. Although the Kingdom of Ends is an ideal—the actions of other people and events of nature ensure that actions <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions</b> sometimes result in harm—we are still required to act categorically, as legislators of this ideal kingdom.|$|E

He is very clumsy and occasionally naïve but a brilliant nurse and team player <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions.</b> Lofty's backstory states he used his parents' money to party regularly, but when his parents grew tired of his attitude, they kicked him out.

25|$|Good Samaritan {{provisions}} are not universal in application. The legal principle of imminent peril may also apply. In {{the absence of}} imminent peril, {{the actions of a}} rescuer may be perceived by the courts to be reckless and not worthy of protection. To illustrate, a motor vehicle collision occurs, but there is no fire, no immediate life threat from injuries and no danger of a second collision. If someone, <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions,</b> causes injury by pulling the victim from the wreckage, a court may rule that good Samaritan laws do not apply because the victim was not in imminent peril and hold the actions of the rescuer to be unnecessary and reckless.|$|E
25|$|A {{new policy}} on debt collection, {{enforced}} in November 1903, {{also played a}} role in the uprising. For many years, the Herero population had fallen in the habit of borrowing money from colonist traders at extreme interest rates. For a long time, much of this debt went uncollected and accumulated, as most Herero had no means to pay. To correct this growing problem, Governor Leutwein decreed <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions</b> that all debts not paid within the next year would be voided. In the absence of hard cash, traders often seized cattle, or whatever objects of value they could get their hands on, to recoup their loans as quickly as possible. This fostered a feeling of resentment towards the Germans on the part of the Herero people, which escalated to hopelessness when they saw that German officials were sympathetic to the traders who were about to lose what they were owed.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition {{has been}} seen in cats fed home-made or vegetarian/vegan diets {{produced}} by owners <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions,</b> and most published recipes have been only crudely balanced (by computer) using nutrient averages. Because the palatability, digestibility, and safety of these recipes have not been adequately or scientifically tested, {{it is difficult to}} characterize all of these homemade diets. Generally, most formulations contain excessive protein and phosphorus and are deficient in calcium, vitamin E, and microminerals such as copper, zinc, and potassium. Also, the energy density of these diets may be unbalanced relative to the other nutrients. Commonly used meat and carbohydrate ingredients contain more phosphorus than calcium. Homemade feline diets that are not actually deficient in fat or energy usually contain a vegetable oil that cats do not find palatable; therefore, less food is eaten causing a calorie deficiency. Rarely are homemade diets balanced for microminerals or vitamins. Owner neglect is also a frequent contributing factor in malnutrition.|$|E

25|$|The ring had a {{great effect}} on the human bearers who held it in the interim. It granted them {{indefinite}} life; though the effort of living became more difficult as time went on, for it did not grant new life. If they wore it, it made them invisible, enhanced their hearing, and made the shadowy world of the wraiths visible to them. It exerted a malicious influence; Gandalf mentions that though a bearer might begin <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions,</b> the good intentions would not last. The Ring would give its bearer a fraction of Sauron's power, proportionate with the bearer's strength and force of will. Gollum, Bilbo, Sam, and Frodo only became invisible, although when Frodo bound Gollum to his service in The Two Towers he indicated that he could use the Ring to control Gollum (because the Ring had mastered Gollum long ago). Gandalf and Galadriel, however, recognized that they could use the full power of the Ring, becoming even more powerful than Sauron himself, but they resisted, knowing {{that in the end}} the Ring would corrupt them. Gandalf explained to Frodo that, with great concentration and training, even he could tap into the Ring's power, but probably at the cost of his sanity.|$|E

The overall theme of reviews {{is that it is}} a heartfelt film <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions,</b> but that it is flawed. Some reviewers found it funny and enjoyable with [...] "genuine laughs", however. Roger Ebert rated it three stars (of four) and wrote, it [...] "is not a great, breakout comedy, but more the kind of movie that might eventually become a regular on the midnight cult circuit."

500|$|Cudjoe {{has noted}} that Gather Together lacks the [...] "intense {{solidity}} and moral center" [...] found in Caged Bird, and that the strong ethics of the Black community in the rural South is replaced by the alienation and fragmentation of urban life {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century. The world that Angelou introduces her readers to in Gather Together leaves her protagonist without a sense of purpose, and as Cudjoe states, [...] "to the brink of destruction in order to realize herself". Critic Lyman B. Hagen disagrees with Cudjoe's judgment that Angelou's second autobiography lacked a moral center, saying that even though there are many unsavory characters in the book and that their lifestyles are not condemned, the innocent Rita emerges triumphant and [...] "evil does not prevail". Rita moves through a sleazy world <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions</b> and grows stronger as a result of her exposure to it. Hagen states that if were not for Gather Together's complex literary style, its content would prevent it from being accepted as [...] "an exemplary literary effort".|$|E

[...] Other reviews were more mixed: Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "marginal Thumbs Up" [...] as he liked Jennifer Grey's acting and development of her character, while Roger Ebert gave it [...] "Thumbs Down" [...] due to its [...] "idiot plot", calling it a [...] "tired and relentlessly predictable story of love between kids from different backgrounds." [...] TIME magazine was lukewarm, saying, [...] "If the ending of Eleanor Bergstein's script is too neat and inspirational, the rough energy of the film's song and dance does carry one along, past the whispered doubts of better judgment." [...] In a retrospective review, Jezebels Irin Carmon called the film [...] "the greatest movie of all time" [...] as [...] "a great, brave movie for women" [...] with [...] "some subtle, retrospectively sharp-eyed critiques of class and gender." ...|$|E

In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in Stratford, Connecticut, {{with the goal of}} providing a hotel, restaurant and public conference facility. It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in Wall Street Journal and the Nation's Restaurant News. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions</b> but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, [...] "I... wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S.senator and a more understanding presidential contender."

500|$|USA Today {{described}} Boone as [...] "a callow {{young man}} who had been toughened by island challenges." [...] Variety called him [...] "hot-headed", while Entertainment Weekly wrote he was [...] "even-tempered". Boone's quick decisions <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions</b> are often rash. [...] On his sixth day on the island, Joanna Miller drowns. As soon as he finds out she is drowning, he immediately tries to save her, although he does not succeed and almost becomes a casualty himself. While trying to take on a leadership role, Boone steals the camp's water; however, his plan backfires and the survivors turn on him. [...] When Boone suspects Sawyer has Shannon's medicine, he attempts to steal it. Aside from Shannon, he was closest to John Locke, who acted as a father figure and mentor to the younger, inexperienced Boone and who, unlike others including Shannon, tried to help him do his part on the island. Boone similarly {{is one of the few}} to trust Locke's guidance and made Locke feel like the hero he had always wanted to be. Boone reflects aspects of Locke's personality, such as his desire to have a unique purpose and his willingness to believe in the unlikely.|$|E
500|$|Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In {{a review}} for The New York Times, current U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a [...] "raging and often meandering assault" [...] on U.S. foreign policy. Believing that Chomsky divides the world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in Hegemony or Survival he portrays the U.S. as [...] "the prime oppressor, [...] can do no right", meanwhile overlooking the crimes of the oppressed. Arguing that he completely ignores the concept that the U.S. might undertake any foreign interventions <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>intentions,</b> she asserts that his book {{is not easy to}} read, and that his [...] "glib and caustic tone" [...] are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was [...] "sobering and instructive", having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the [...] "structural defects" [...] in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomsky's [...] "critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world," [...] she concedes that Chomksy's analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administration's standard response to the question, [...] "Why do they hate us?".|$|E
