500|$|The film's overall {{structure}} {{was influenced by}} the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, [...] "We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes." [...] The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, [...] "He {{is a little bit of}} an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{original}} version of [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was released, Carey's official website premiered two other versions of the song, the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix" [...] and the [...] "Pulse Club Remix". While the song's initial release was tepidly received by critics, reviewers were more favorable towards the remixes. The remixes only feature Carey and eliminate the extensive rap verses with which many critics took issue. According to Carey's manager, Randy Jackson, three versions of the song were released in order to monopolize all radio formats and cater to multiple audiences. In an interview with Billboard, Jackson expressed how they would remind Carey's fans of her earlier remixes, which she would always re-do her vocals: [...] "The vintage throwback mix will remind fans of remixes she did years ago, and she's {{had a lot of}} Billboard No. 1 dance hits as well. She went in and re-sang the vocals, knowing that the two verses on this first version of this single with Meek and Ross were going to be hip-hop verses where people were rapping. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something for all of her fans." ...|$|E

[...] He also drew on the [...] "awkward woodenness of Christmas pageants — the fact that children are often made to say large words that don't sound natural coming out of their mouths." [...] Timbers said they chose to stick to Church of Scientology primary source material for background on the script because [...] "We thought {{that the best way}} to satirize the Church of Scientology was to let the Church speak for itself." [...] During production, the creative team worked with cast members to educate them about the play's background. [...] "Kids shouldn't just be saying things that they don't understand. That's what we're criticizing...people who just parrot behavior and language. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an honest conversation with them," [...] Jarrow said. [...] The published version of the script says that the musical should not be performed by adults; Jarrow said adults are [...] "too jaded", and would not be able to portray the [...] "unwinking satire" [...] of the piece.|$|E

500|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the show, the producers had wanted to introduce the concept of LMDs, which Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb noted [...] "have always been part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s history in the comics". However, they were unable to before , which sees the introductions of Ultron and Vision in a similar manner to LMDs. For the fourth season, they particularly pushed the idea, and Whedon noted that the introduction of Ghost Rider and mysticism allowed the series to introduce new technology that could launch LMDs in a way deemed rewarding, so the Ghost Rider storyline [...] "dovetails" [...] into the LMD storyline. The S.H.I.E.L.D. program is introduced through the character Aida, an android. Additionally, with LMDs chosen as one of the pods for the season, Whedon said the writers questioned, [...] "what are all the things we could do? You don't want to do the ones that have been done , and you don't want to leave any on the table." [...] One idea that [...] "we knew <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> early on" [...] was to reveal that the majority of S.H.I.E.L.D. have been replaced at once.|$|E

In 2010 Harris stated, [...] "I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, {{all they have to}} do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it." [...] In 2004, Harris explained that the band's [...] "heaviness" [...] was inspired by [...] "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in."

Of course, I had to let Baby and Slim know and hope they would understand my expensive taste. It all came together." [...] It's just beautiful — the clothes, everything.

500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "if someone told you that concept, you'd {{think it was a}} great thing to have happen {{at the beginning of the}} show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the Silver Age Kathy Kane, who was romantically {{attracted}} to Batman, {{the new version}} of Kane is a lesbian. Her sexual orientation was announced {{at the same time}} the character was revealed in the spring of 2006. Stories appeared on television news outlets such as CNN, general news magazines such as USA Today, and gay culture magazines such as Out. The modern Katherine [...] "Kate" [...] Kane made her first comic book appearance in issue #7 of the maxi-series 52 (2006), where Kane is revealed to have been romantically involved with Renee Montoya, a former Gotham City Police detective (who later takes up the mantle of the Question after the original hero dies). When questioned about the editorial decision to make Batwoman a gay character in an interview with Wizard Entertainment, DC Comics Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio stated [...] "It was from conversations we’ve had for expanding the DC Universe, for looking at levels of diversity. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a cast that is much more reflective of today’s society and even today’s fanbase. One of the reasons we made her gay is that, again when you have the Batman Family—a series of characters that aren’t super-powered and inhabit the same circle and the same city—you really want to have a point of difference. It was really important to me to make sure every character felt unique." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E

The name is {{a reference to the}} NES Zapper light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed that [...] "What we found is that the reason <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand.

Katie Cassidy, Ella Rae Peck, Jessica Szohr, and Willa Holland also returned for small appearances. Long-time narrator Kristen Bell appeared in the episode as herself reading her lines alongside Rachel Bilson. On Bell's cameo Savage told: [...] "It was really funny and very, very special to be shooting with her. She's an intimate {{part of our family}} but yet we never get to see her.

2500|$|The {{sound of}} the album was notably {{different}} than Forever as the female vocals and violins had disappeared and the band's focus had shifted away from melody towards more technicality and progressiveness, featuring more complex song structures and time signature changes. Remy Beauchamp elaborated, [...] "Basically, it was over three years between the recordings of both albums so within that time, the music we listen to has changed. Also, we all improved on our instruments... The female vocals are just something we tried a long time ago. The song was actually written in 1994, and then every band started doing it {{so we decided to}} drop it. The violin is not out definitely though, we might be putting some on our next album but for 'Day Into Night', <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a good heavy album, no extras." [...] Bart said that [...] "the production is much better; we spent 3 months in the studio as opposed to a week and a half... Our budget helped as well - we basically spent ten times the amount that we spent on Forever..." [...] He also said, [...] "One thing that many fans asked about... was why there was no violin. At the time we wanted to distance ourselves from all the bands that filled space in their music with different instruments as opposed to writing good music that stood on its own. We did the violin thing five years ago when the idea was a new concept so we wanted to move in. In face, we did record a violin piece for the album but chose not to include it for the reason above. Too many bands with violins. We wanted Day into Night to be heavy and kick ass and not diluted by association." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June five adult actresses {{met with}} Hall's {{district}} director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his [...] "condoms in porn" [...] bill.
