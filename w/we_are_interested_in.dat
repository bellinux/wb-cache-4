40|$|Nucleolin {{is a major}} {{nucleolar}} phosphoprotein {{involved in}} various steps of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells.

25|$|We do {{not discuss}} the anatomical, physiological, and mental {{characteristics}} of man considered as an individual; but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the diversity of these traits in groups of men found in different geographical areas and in different social classes. It is our task to inquire into the causes that have brought about the observed differentiation, and to investigate {{the sequence of events}} that have led to the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life. In other words, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past.|$|E
25|$|In general, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{the active}} power {{averaged}} {{over a period}} of time, whether it is a low frequency line cycle or a high frequency power converter switching period.

30|$|Finally, time (values =  1, 2 and 3) was centred around 1, since <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{predicting}} student initial accounting competence {{at the end}} {{of grade}} 9 (Biesanz et al. 2004). All variables were z-standardised in order to obtain comparable estimates.|$|R
40|$|Since {{its release}} in April 2010, the Apple iPad {{has become the}} de facto tablet for consumers. Given the {{increasing}} popularity of the iPad as a consumer, educational, and work device, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> how different groups of people use the iPad. More specifically, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> how students and non-students use the iPad at work, school, and at play. One-hundred thirteen participants completed an online survey about iPad use. Results indicated students use the iPad more often for socializing, playing games, editing and posting photos, listening to audio, and taking pictures or videos. On the other hand, non-students use the iPad more often for reading the news, eBooks, and eMagazines...|$|R

25|$|Often <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> how {{the moving}} {{groundwater}} will transport dissolved contaminants around (the sub-field of contaminant hydrogeology). The contaminants can be man-made (e.g., petroleum products, nitrate, Chromium or radionuclides) or naturally occurring (e.g., arsenic, salinity). Besides needing {{to understand where}} the groundwater is flowing, based on the other hydrologic properties discussed above, there are additional aquifer properties which affect how dissolved contaminants move with groundwater.|$|E
25|$|As {{was shown}} in the section on {{properties}} of linear representations, we can, by restricting to a subgroup, obtain a representation of a subgroup starting from a representation of a group. Naturally <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the reverse process: Is it possible to obtain the representation of a group starting from a representation of a subgroup? We will see, that the induced representation, which will be defined in the following, provides us with the necessary concept. Admittedly, this construction is not inverse but adjoint to the restriction.|$|E
25|$|We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet {{almost none}} of the {{information}} we think we possess is true. Eskimos do not rub noses. The rickshaw was invented by an American. Joan of Arc was not French. Lenin was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither haggis, whisky, porridge, clan tartans or kilts are Scottish. So we stand, silent, on a peak in Darien a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. QI country. Whatever is interesting <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in.</b> Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at in the right way. At one extreme, QI is serious, intensely scientific, deeply mystical; at the other it is hilarious, silly and frothy enough to please the most indolent couch-potato.|$|E
