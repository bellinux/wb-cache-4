40|$|Even though under Fascism Italy was {{experiencing}} {{a period of}} harsh and patriarchal dictatorship, a feminist <b>writer</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Virginia Woolf was reviewed and discussed in the only forum where foreign ideas – and writers – could still be read: literary periodicals.

5000|$|Richard Holmes {{supports}} the anagrammatic derivation of the name, but adds that a <b>writer</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Voltaire would have intended it to also convey its connotations {{of speed and}} daring.

Many early Spanish Renaissance writers come from the Kingdom of Aragon, including Ausiàs March and Joanot Martorell. In the Kingdom of Castile, the early Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism, starting with writers and poets such as the Marquis of Santillana, who introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century. Other <b>writers,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Jorge Manrique, Fernando de Rojas, Juan del Encina, Juan Boscán Almogáver and Garcilaso de la Vega, kept a close resemblance to the Italian canon.

For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were {{thinking in terms of}} developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.|$|E
