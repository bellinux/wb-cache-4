40|$|Abstract: The mean {{vibration}} transmissibility {{values were}} measured for cotton work gloves {{commonly used in}} vibration-generating workplaces to evaluate the vibration isolating performance of cotton work gloves. The mean vibration transmissibility values of work cotton gloves were {{compared with those of}} four types of anti-vibration gloves measured in the same way. All the measurements were performed based on the newly issued JIS T 8114 that is identical to ISO 10819. Also, linear transmissibility values were calculated from the measured data. Cotton <b>work</b> <b>glove</b> samples did not satisfy the requirements specified in JIS T 8114. All the test samples showed mean vibration transmissibility values of more than 1. 0 for spectra M and H. In contrast, all the anti-vibration gloves tested in this study satisfied the JIS T 8114 requirements. The linear transmissibility values of cotton work gloves were consistently higher than those of anti-vibration gloves for spectrum H. The linear transmissibility values of cotton work gloves were steady at about 0. 9 up to 200 Hz, then increased with vibration frequency to about 1. 0 at 400 Hz. In contrast, the linear transmissibility values of anti-vibration gloves increased with frequency to 1. 0 at 30 Hz and then decreased with small peaks at 100 Hz and 300 Hz. Our results suggest that cotton work gloves do not show enough vibration-isolating performance. Therefore, attention should be paid to encouraging the widespread use of anti-vibration gloves in place of cotton work gloves to reduce exposure to hand-arm vibration...|$|E

40|$|During the {{production}} of polyurethane-based clothing - especially <b>work</b> <b>gloves</b> - the common solvent dimethylformamide (DMF) may remain in the product.

Solvent extraction is a cost-efficient solution but {{is associated with a}} limited sensitivity and the necessity to cut the material. Therefore, an accumulative sampling approach would be favourable.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{experimental data}} on hand/finger cooling responses {{and performance in}} cold environments with and without gloves. The first part concerned studies of hand/finger cooling behaviors under various cold conditions. The experimental results with human subjects indicate that {{a reduction in the}} contact temperature is a function of thermal properties and surface temperature of the materials, skin {{and the nature of the}} contact as well. Manual performance reduced after gripping the cold objects. A decrease of the hand skin temperature causes the performance loss. The safety criteria for the contact temperature are suggested to be 0 °C (freezing), 7 °C (numbness) and 15 °C (pain sensation). An artificial heated finger model was developed and used to derive additional cooling information for extremely cold metallic surfaces. All results were utilized to establish relations between contact temperature, contact time and material used and compiled in an ergonomic database. The information can be used for risk assessment and for setting temperature limit values for products in appropriate standards for cold work. Manual performance, such as dexterity and tactile sensitivity of gloved hand in the cold operation, has been investigated. The relations among physical properties of protective gloves and hand performance were evaluated objectively and subjectively. Human subjects wearing four different <b>work</b> <b>gloves</b> and three different types of gloving (outer, inner and double) participated in the experimental studies during cold exposure. It is indicated that wearing various <b>work</b> <b>gloves</b> gives impairment in both manual dexterity and tactile sensitivity in cold operations. The performance was affected both by glove design and by hand/finger cooling. Use of double gloving is recommended to be an appropriate approach to use the protective gloves in the cold while inner glove can be used to perform some precision work. In extremely cold exposures hand cooling overrides the effect of glove on tactile performance. Development and use of an electrically heated glove should be considered for hand protection in a prolonged cold operation. Godkänd; 2001; 20061116 (haneit...|$|R

25|$|Brown recluse spiders build {{asymmetrical}} (irregular) webs {{that frequently}} include a shelter consisting of disorderly thread. They frequently build their webs in woodpiles and sheds, closets, garages, plenum spaces, cellars, {{and other places}} that are dry and generally undisturbed. When dwelling in human residences they seem to favor cardboard, possibly because it mimics the rotting tree bark which they inhabit naturally. They have also been encountered in shoes, inside dressers, in bed sheets of infrequently used beds, in clothes stacked or piled or left lying on the floor, inside <b>work</b> <b>gloves,</b> behind baseboards and pictures, in toilets, and near sources of warmth when ambient temperatures are lower than usual. Human-recluse contact often occurs when such isolated spaces are disturbed and the spider feels threatened. Unlike most web weavers, they leave these lairs at night to hunt. Males move around more when hunting than the females, which tend to remain nearer to their webs. The spider will hunt for firebrats, crickets, cockroaches, and other soft-bodied insects.|$|R
