6000|$|... "And ... Ethel! No {{wonder she}} seemed shallow ... She has been shallow. No wonder she was restless. Unfulfilled ... <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> to do? She was drudge, she was toy ...|$|E
6000|$|The rain of {{questions}} gave Molly a sensation of being battered. She felt dazed, {{and a little}} mutinous. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> done {{that she should be}} assailed like this? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And pray, sir," [...] said Maria, bending {{her eyes}} inquisitively toward the youth, [...] "if <b>she</b> want it, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> done with it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will ask, as I did, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> {{to gain by}} this wicked {{plotting}} and contriving, {{with its}} shocking accompaniments of malice and anger? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't think you're ever much pleased," [...] Isabel {{was obliged}} to reply. [...] "If Madame Merle knew you would learn the truth <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> to gain by insincerity?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He had {{detained}} {{me in the}} drawing-room {{nearly half}} an hour from the time when his wife left us. Where had she been, and <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> been doing in that interval? ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{exist in}} this state of {{uncertainty}} was impossible for a woman of Edna's organization. At any hour Captain Horn might appear. How should she receive him? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> to say to him? ...|$|E
6000|$|Linley {{turned on}} the wretch with a mind divided between wonder and disgust. [...] "Good God, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> done to deserve being treated in that way?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Every jot! <b>What,</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> not written? The abominable little elf! I'm coming." [...] And {{he shrugged}} his {{shoulders}} as Allen, who had come round to the open window, beckoned to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is {{that woman}} and <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> written?" [...] Francesca asked Youghal; <b>she</b> dimly remembered <b>having</b> seen her {{at one of}} Serena Golackly's gatherings, {{surrounded}} by a little Court of admirers.|$|R
60|$|Pity her {{for what}} she had lost! <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> lost! What did she mean by that? He knew well what she meant by pitying her {{for what she}} had got. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> lost? She had lost him. Did she intend to evoke his pity for that loss? She had lost him. Yes, indeed. Whether or no the loss was one to regret, he would not say to himself; or rather, he, of course, {{declared}} that it was not; but such as it was, it had been incurred. He was now the property of Florence Burton, and, whatever happened, he would be true to her.|$|E
6000|$|He left her, and {{happiness}} {{went out of}} his life as at nightfall the daylight goes out of the day. Well, at least he had his work to go to. But Beatrice, poor woman, <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>she?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> {{been doing}} all the time?" [...] I queried. [...] "Do {{you mean to tell}} me that she, a married woman, had been content to let her husband {{disappear}} without making any attempt to trace him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Victoria! <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> {{to do with}} it? I {{should have}} thought her Marchioness-ship quite out of the region of gossip, though, for that matter, grandees like it quite as much as other people.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, she was not. She {{begged to}} spend the day with Constance Hacket, and we picked her up as we came home. Poor child, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> been doing? I have not looked after her properly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but it is}} of {{this that}} you may have to {{convince}} a jury who might possibly find a motive in Rodd's past, and your present, relationship to the same lady. But <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> to say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The castle your Majesty {{would build}} for any but your Queen must prove a prison." [...] <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> meant by that? Must he {{take her to}} queen before she {{would allow him to}} build a castle for her? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] said Linda, indignantly. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> {{to do with}} Mary Magdalene? The {{reality of}} her {{position}} then came upon her, and not the facts of that position which she had for a moment almost endeavoured to simulate.|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> done? Because she {{had been}} afraid she might succumb to the pleas of this giant, she had burned her bridges behind her--in her groundless {{apprehension}} that she might make a terrible mistake, {{she had made a}} worse one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] {{said the}} King, drawing himself {{suddenly}} {{into a state}} of haughty attention, and fixing his eye firmly on the supposed criminal; [...] "what of her? what of her? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> to do with this matter?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} Kirk {{restored}} her. After all, <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened was only <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> expected. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> chosen her path, {{and she did}} not regret it.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> done? I <b>have</b> {{never heard}} that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> behaved improperly. <b>What</b> does it all mean? She goes out everywhere. I don't think <b>she</b> <b>has</b> had any lovers. Frederic {{would be the last}} man in the world to throw himself away upon an ill-conditioned young woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> done?" [...] Rulledge asked. [...] "She {{would have}} been {{responsible}} for what happened, according to her notion, if she had had her way with the horse; she would have felt that she had driven Ormond to his doom." ...|$|E
6000|$|Poor foolish, lovely, happy Olive! She {{scarcely}} {{understood what}} had happened to her. She only knew that she had been born and had lived, and had grown, that he might come to her and say he loved her. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> been thinking of all this time? ...|$|E
60|$|The music {{which came}} after {{could not hold}} Rose's attention. How could it, {{in the face of}} the {{tremendous}} changes which were in progress in her brain? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> done? To an almost perfect stranger she had promised to burn all the work of her pen thus far.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it stands}} to reason that her going will be a great relief to him. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> done for him? <b>She</b> <b>has</b> made him contemptible to {{everybody}} in the diocese by her interference, and his life has been a burden to him through her violence." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Kendal gave {{a kind of}} groan, {{and asked}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done; <b>she</b> {{detailed}} the measures.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared in}} wonder {{at his own}} wife as she told him his own heart so callously. And he was indignant. <b>What</b> right <b>had</b> <b>she</b> to sit there telling him these things? She was his wife, <b>what</b> right <b>had</b> <b>she</b> {{to speak to him}} like this, {{as if she were a}} stranger.|$|R
6000|$|Enemies leered {{through the}} windows, stole on {{her from the}} hall. She had no one save Erik. This kind good man Kennicott--he was an elder brother. It was Erik, her fellow outcast, to whom she wanted to run for sanctuary. Through her storm she was, to the eye, sitting quietly with her fingers between {{the pages of a}} baby-blue book on home-dressmaking. But her dismay at Mrs. Westlake's treachery had risen to active dread. What had the woman said of her and Erik? What did she know? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> seen? Who else would join in the baying hunt? Who else had seen her with Erik? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> to fear from the Dyers, Cy Bogart, Juanita, Aunt Bessie? What {{precisely}} had she answered to Mrs. Bogart's questioning? ...|$|E
6000|$|To-morrow {{there would}} be several hundred dollars more, {{and the next day}} more, and so on always, and what was she doing, or <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> planned to do, to give proper {{direction}} to these tidal waves of wealth? She had bought a new dish-pan and ordered a door repaired! ...|$|E
60|$|Betty {{dropped the}} fan and rose quickly to her feet. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> done? A terrible thought had flashed into her mind. Suppose he were not delirious, {{and had been}} deceiving her. Oh! for a hiding-place, or that the floor would swallow her. Oh! if some one would only come.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> {{done that}} she should be thus punished? Tell me, man, that she shall be your lawful wife." [...] As she said this she caught him roughly by the collar of his coat and shook him with her arm.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Nesbit laughed. 'You, too! <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> {{to do with}} shyness? <b>She</b> <b>has</b> had her lesson; but you {{are like}} the rest! Your mamma {{actually}} proposing to take her likeness, but I {{told her it was}} not to be thought of. There will be plenty to fill her with presumption.' ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{suddenly}} wildly sorry for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done. <b>She</b> {{felt she was}} going to cry, to behave absurdly.|$|R
