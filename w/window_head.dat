We {{have thus}} {{arrived at the}} idea of a {{vertical}} frame work of subordinated bars, supported by cross bars at the necessary intervals, and the only remaining question is the method of insertion into the aperture. Whatever its form, if we merely let the ends of the bars into the voussoirs of its heading, the least settlement of the masonry would distort the arch, or push up some of its voussoirs, or break the window bars, or push them aside. Evidently our object should be to connect the window bars among themselves, so framing them together that they may give the utmost possible degree of support to the whole <b>window</b> <b>head</b> in case of any settlement. But we know how to do this already: our window bars are nothing but small shafts. Capital them; throw small arches across between the smaller bars, large arches over them between the larger bars, one comprehensive arch over the whole, or else a horizontal lintel, if the window have a flat head; and we have a complete system of mutual support, independent of the aperture head, and yet assisting to sustain it, if need be. But we want the spandrils of this arch system to be themselves as light, and to let as much light through them, as possible: and we know already how to pierce them (Chap. XII. § VII.). We pierce them with circles; and we have, if the circles are small and the stonework strong, the traceries of Giotto and the Pisan school; if the circles are as large as possible and the bars slender, those which I have already figured and described as the only perfect traceries of the Northern Gothic.[58] The varieties of their design arise partly from the different size of window and consequent number of bars; partly from the different heights of their pointed arches, as well as the various positions of the <b>window</b> <b>head</b> in relation to the roof, rendering one or another arrangement better for dividing the light, and partly from æsthetic and expressional requirements, which, within certain limits, may be allowed a very important influence: for the strength of the bars is ordinarily so much greater than is absolutely necessary, that some portion of it may be gracefully sacrificed to the attainment of variety in the plans of tracery--a variety which, even within its severest limits, is perfectly endless; more especially in the pointed arch, the proportion of the tracery being in the round arch necessarily more fixed.|$|E

One of the nine-steps was rendered more secure because the climber could take hold of the root of a nettle, so precarious were the means of passing this celebrated spot. The manning the Cowgate Port, especially in snowball time, was also a choice amusement, as it offered an inaccessible station for the boys who used these missiles to the annoyance of the passengers. The gateway is now demolished; and probably most of its garrison lie as low as the fortress.

40|$|Residential {{buildings}} are now better engineered to manage rainwater following the leaking building problem in New Zealand. The next {{challenge is to}} improve the weathertightness of medium-rise buildings which often use joint details widely applied on low-rise buildings but are subject to higher wind pressures and surface runoff rates. This study begins to address this challenge by measuring the water leakage performance limits of the following common flashings with static and dynamic rain and wind loads to see how their performance might be improved: (a) Horizontal H and Z jointers between direct fixed sheet claddings; (b) The <b>window</b> <b>head</b> flashing in a cavity wall; (c) A horizontal apron flashing at the junction between a roof and wall. At this stage, water penetration resistances have been measured but the data has not yet been discussed in the context of wind pressures and rain loads on mid-rise buildings. All of the joints were found to resist water leakage to pressures equivalent to the hydrostatic head of the upstand, so long as there were no air leakage paths through the joint. When vents were added, or openings were present that might arise due to construction tolerances, then the onset pressure for leakage was found to fall by as much as 50 %. Vents, of course, are essential for ventilation drying in rainscreen walls and even with vents present, the onset of leakage was at generally at least twice the 50 Pa wet wall test pressure applied in New Zealand. Opportunities were found to improve the way vented joints deal with runoff by enlarging the gap between the cladding and flashing. This prevented the outer joint volume from filling with water and occluding the vents. The apron flashing was found to cope better than a <b>window</b> <b>head</b> joint with runoff, because of the larger 35 mm vertical gap between the cladding and apron...|$|E

40|$|Daylight redirecting blinds are a {{class of}} sun control device that are {{designed}} specifically to increase daylighting levels in buildings in addition to preventing unwanted solar gain and glare. Because they rely on many parameters such as complex geometry and may require automated controls to achieve their high illuminance performance, their angle-dependent optical characteristics cannot be represented or simulated accurately using the simple tools that are normally used {{at the beginning of}} the design process when rapid assessments are needed. Instead they require time- and resource-intensive simulation methods that are difficult to integrate into existing building design workflows at such an early stage of design. Therefore design guidance for these daylight redirecting blinds is needed in support of design decisions {{at the beginning of the}} schematic design phase – to assist in answering questions such as: How deep can a floor plate be for the entire floor area in an open-plan office to be considered sufficiently daylit? The daylighting illuminance performance of two classes of blinds, passive and active, are investigated to generalize this design guidance. A representative model of each class of blind is used. Through the use of a high-performance multi-storey open-plan double-perimeter zone office building in Golden, USA (40 °N, 105 °W) as a case study, a simplified simulation model using the radiosity method is validated. The simulation model is used to examine the effect of different parameters such as blind type, location, glazing properties, building depth, façade orientation, window to wall ratio, and <b>window</b> <b>head</b> height on daylighting illuminance in the office space. Simple correlations between building geometry and interior daylight illuminance sufficiency are sought that can be used as design guidance in early schematic design in lieu of simulations. Based on the results, the conclusion is that for most combinations tested active blinds will perform as well as or better than passive blinds. While a passive blind may be acceptable for mild, temperate climates, it may cause excessive overheating in climates with high cooling loads. In this respect, the greatest flexibility is offered by the class of active blinds which can control when daylight or solar heat is desired in the interior. Using the sDA 300 / 50 metric from the IES LM- 83 - 12 standard, the study found that the maximum building depth for South-oriented open-plan space that provides ‘nominally acceptable’ daylight illuminance is 14. 5 m for Golden (actual building depth is 18 m). This calculated maximum building depth is between 11. 5 m (Vancouver) and 15 m (Montreal) for different locations. This variation is due to the different total annual sunshine hours and visible transmittance of the glazing and blind at different solar incidence angles at each location. A correlation is made between <b>window</b> <b>head</b> height and maximum building depth for an open-plan office space. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} daylighting of multistorey {{commercial building}} interiors poses an interesting problem for designers in Australia’s tropical and subtropical context. Given that a building exterior receives adequate sun and skylight as dictated by location-specific {{factors such as}} weather, siting and external obstructions; then the availability of daylight throughout its interior is dependant on certain building characteristics: the distance from a window façade (room depth), ceiling or <b>window</b> <b>head</b> height, window size and the visible transmittance of daylighting apertures. The daylighting of general stock, multistorey commercial buildings is made difficult by their design limitations with respect {{to some of these}} characteristics. The admission of daylight to these interiors is usually exclusively by vertical windows. Using conventional glazing, such windows can only admit sun and skylight to a depth of approximately 2 times the window height. This penetration depth is typically much less than the depth of the office interiors, so that core areas of these buildings receive little or no daylight. This issue is particularly relevant where deep, open plan office layouts prevail. The resulting interior daylight pattern is a relatively narrow perimeter zone bathed in (sometimes too intense) light, contrasted with a poorly daylit core zone. The broad luminance range this may present to a building occupant’s visual field can be a source of discomfort glare. Furthermore, the need in most tropical and subtropical regions to restrict solar heat gains to building interiors for much of the year has resulted in the widespread use of heavily tinted or reflective glazing on commercial building façades. This strategy reduces the amount of solar radiation admitted to the interior, thereby decreasing daylight levels proportionately throughout. However this technique does little to improve the way light is distributed throughout the office space. Where clear skies dominate weather conditions, at different times of day or year direct sunlight may pass unobstructed through vertical windows causing disability or discomfort glare for building occupants and as such, its admission to an interior must be appropriately controlled. Any daylighting system to be applied to multistorey commercial buildings must consider these design obstacles, and attempt to improve the distribution of daylight throughout these deep, sidelit office spaces without causing glare conditions. The research described in this thesis delineates first the design optimisation and then the actual prototyping and manufacture process of a daylighting device to be applied to such multistorey buildings in tropical and subtropical environments...|$|E
