Gollum slipped away and visited Shelob, planning to feed the Hobbits to her and then get the Ring for himself <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b> When he returned, he found the Hobbits asleep, {{and the sight of}} Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to him, and the opportunity for redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Shelob's Lair. There, Frodo was stung by the giant spider, taken prisoner by Orcs, and hauled to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{descent from}} Puritan John Leavitt, {{founding}} deacon of Old Ship Church, America's oldest in continuous use, Dudley Leavitt was a skeptic. Perhaps {{it was his}} academic and scientific nature, but Leavitt was known throughout the Meredith area for his scoffing at religion. At one session of evening prayer, for instance, Leavitt's wife offered up a fervent prayer that her husband scholar be saved. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> Leavitt got up, put on his hat and said [...] "We read in God's word, that the unbelieving husband shall be justified by the prayers of the believing wife," [...] and marched out of the church.|$|E

Well, the Injun boy had the raven tied up, and {{was all the}} time plaguing it and {{starving}} it, and she pitied the po' thing, and tried to buy it from the boy, and the tears was in her eyes. That was the girl- twin, you see. She offered him her thimble, and he flung it down; she offered him all the doughnuts she had, which was two, and he flung them down; she offered him half a paper of pins, worth forty ravens, {{and he made a}} mouth at her and jabbed one of them in the raven's back. That was the limit, you know. It called for the other twin. Her eyes blazed up, and she jumped for him like a wild-cat, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with him she was rags and he wasn't anything but an allegory. That was most undoubtedly the other twin, you see, coming to the front. No, sir; don't tell ME he ain't in there. I've seen him with my own eyes--and plenty of times, at that." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{passed out}} through the parlor, and there was Marget at the spinnet {{teaching}} Marie Lueger. So one of the deserting pupils was back; and an influential one, too; the others would follow. Marget jumped up and ran and thanked us again, with tears in her eyes--this was the third time--for saving her and her uncle from being turned into the street, and we told her again we hadn't done it; but that was her way, she never could be grateful enough for anything a person did for her; so we let her have her say. And as we passed through the garden, there was Wilhelm Meidling sitting there waiting, for it was getting {{toward the edge of}} the evening, and he would be asking Marget to take a walk along the river with him <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with the lesson. He was a young lawyer, and succeeding fairly well and working his way along, little by little. He was very fond of Marget, and she of him. He had not deserted along with the others, but had stood his ground all through. His faithfulness was not lost on Marget and her uncle. He hadn't so very much talent, but he was handsome and good, and these are a kind of talents themselves and help along. He asked us how the lesson was getting along, and we told him it was about done. And maybe it was so; we didn't know anything about it, but we judged it would please him, and it did, and didn't cost us anything.|$|E

6000|$|Tom was {{a trifle}} disconcerted. The basin was refilled, {{and this time}} he stood over it a little while, {{gathering}} resolution; took in a big breath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years--they were simply called his [...] "other clothes"--and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. The girl [...] "put him to rights" [...] after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively: ...|$|E

Mary also gained the friendship of the King and Queen. With this she could use her social access to seek political favor and exercise real political power.|$|E

50|$|The comic {{follows the}} adventures of minus (always uncapitalized), a young girl {{with the power to}} change almost {{anything}} in the world around her, from the flow of time to her own appearance. Minus is otherwise a typical child: fairly amiable, excitable, impulsive, and only vaguely aware that other people feel pain. Consequently, the comic ranges from flights of fancy to moments of surreal horror. In various strips minus has climbed into paintings and chalk drawings, brought inanimate objects to life, killed out of spite, turned a library into a pirate ship, become the ruler of a colony of ants, swum with mermaids in her bathtub and pulled the plug <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> and various other fantastical situations.|$|E

5000|$|The main character, {{an unnamed}} man, has been dropped off at Frank Martin’s alcohol {{rehabilitation}} center by his girlfriend, {{not to be}} confused with his wife. After arriving he encounters J.P. who starts telling him his story. J.P. is a drunken chimney sweep whose father-in-law has recently dropped him off at Frank Martin’s as well. He tells the story of how he met his wife, Roxy, one afternoon at his friend’s house. She was a chimney sweep that asked to kiss J.P.’s friend <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> cleaning his chimney when J.P. asked for a kiss as well.

I won't say anything about New Year's resolutions. There’s no way to make a joke out of this. After I talk to her, I’ll call my girlfriend. Maybe I’ll call her first.

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to decrease the}} amount of days that the participant went without washing her dishes. The participant would let her dishes pile up for days leading to unsanitary situations. For example, the participant would not soak her {{dishes in the sink}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> eating or cooking she would simply just set it on the counter. This would lead to whatever leftover food that was left on the plate to be caked on and take a long amount of time to wash off. Therefore, the study used ABAC design to help {{to reduce the number of}} days that the participant would let her dishes pile up for. After observing the behavior of the participant and realizing that this was a behavior that needed to be changed, the researcher made the behavior apparent to the participant and she volunteered herself for the study. Through the use of two different interventions, in an attempt to reach the goal of only having the duration of one day of letting her dishes pile up. The two different interventions included a stimulus intervention, which included having pictures of what her kitchen looked like when it was clean up on the cupboards. The second intervention included the pictures as well as verbal prompting to ensure that the behavior was to be performed. The outcome of the study showed that the participant was able to reduce the duration of the amount of days between washing dishes...|$|E
