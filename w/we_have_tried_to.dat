The band [...] "worked incredibly hard" [...] to make an album that reaches high standards set by other artists' albums that Hopeless have released.

Sayce wrote that the band [...] "gave British pop-punk a shot in the arm, drawing on the production sheen of 'Nothing Personal.'"

[...] Expressing a similar sentiment, director Jonathan Green acknowledges that [...] "Che is turning over in his grave" [...] because of the commercialization; in Green's view, Che's visage also {{has the potential to}} be a [...] "Trojan horse" [...] of capitalist marketing, by embedding itself into pop iconography.

In Ziff's view, despite the endless array of merchandising, the symbol of Che will continue to be worn and have resonance. Critical pedagogical theorist Peter McLaren theorizes that American capitalism is responsible for the Che phenomenon, stating that [...] "the United States has a seductive way of incorporating anything that it can't defeat and transforming that 'thing' into a weaker version of itself, much like the process of diluting the strength and efficacy of a virus through the creation of a vaccine."
