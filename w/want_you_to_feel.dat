500|$|In the meantime, MacArthur's {{amphibious assault}} at Inchon went ahead on 15 September. [...] "The success of Inchon {{was so great}} and the {{subsequent}} prestige of General MacArthur was so overpowering," [...] Collins later recalled, [...] "that the Chiefs hesitated thereafter to question later plans and decisions of the general, which should have been challenged." [...] In response to a rumor that the Eighth Army planned to halt at the 38th parallel and await United Nations authorization to cross, Marshall {{sent a message to}} MacArthur informing him that: [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of 38th parallel. Announcement above referred to may precipitate embarrassment in the UN where evident desire is not to be confronted with necessity of a vote on passage, rather to find you have found it militarily necessary to do so." [...] A few days later, MacArthur was instructed not to issue an announcement that his forces had crossed the 38th parallel. On 7 October a United Nations General Assembly Resolution was passed that could be broadly construed as permitting the invasion of North Korea.|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor also {{reviewed}} [...] "I Want You to Need Me" [...] {{and wrote}} that linking Dion and Diane Warren {{has always been}} about [...] "as fine a fit as a trusty pair of Thom McAn's." [...] Between Warren's [...] "heart-drenched" [...] words and dramatic melody writing and Dion's [...] "potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty." [...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need me, like the air you breathe/I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> me, in everything/I {{want you to see}} me, in your every dream/The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection". It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we've come to expect: a crescendo as [...] "spine-tingling" [...] as those first few times we heard [...] "My Heart Will Go On".|$|E
500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E

In {{his review of}} Stories V! for The Huffington Post, Declan Tan wrote, [...] "it doesn't {{have any of the}} staid and academically 'meta' tropes that often go with it; you can tell McClanahan feels something when he writes and when he lives.

2500|$|After {{recording}} {{her third}} studio album, As I Am, Keys began to [...] "find {{the way to}} totally be myself and what that meant; figuring out what choices I wanted to make and not make in order to truly honor myself". She described The Element of Freedom as diverse, but noted {{that there is a}} [...] "balance". She explained that [...] "one side is strong and one side is vulnerable", which she pointed to as the theme of the album. The album has a [...] "strong, edgy feel", but is also [...] "intimate and vulnerable and delicate". While on BET's 106 & Park, she described the album: [...] "The way that the songs progress [...] are gonna take you on a natural high. I just <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> a sense of freedom, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> out-of-the-box, feel inspired, You're definitely going to be taken on a trip, I know you're going to be shocked, you're going to hear things that you probably didn't think that I would sound like. It's a journey." [...] Keys revealed to The Times that in the period she was recording the album, she listened to artists such as Genesis, Tears for Fears, Fleetwood Mac and The Police.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 September, MacArthur {{received}} the top secret National Security Council Memorandum 81/1 from Truman reminding him that operations {{north of the}} 38th parallel were authorized only if [...] "at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily". On 29 September MacArthur restored {{the government of the}} Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee. On 30 September, Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes-only message to MacArthur: [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel." [...] During October, the ROK police executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea, and similar massacres were carried out until early 1951.|$|E
2500|$|Video game creators have {{realized}} the asset of incorporating supercouple romances within their products by stringing together epic stories {{of love and}} intrigue. While writing epic romances into video games {{is not a new}} phenomenon, the idea of capturing a video game player through emotionally charged moments via the death of a hero's lover in order to produce feelings of attachment to the fictional environment has expanded, especially within action-adventure/role-playing games (RPGs). The goal is to make the gamer actually become emotionally invested in the characters and their actions, ultimately resulting in heightened gaming experience. Video game designer Peter Molyneux, when speaking of the main component he wanted in his game Fable 2, spoke of more than just the romantic aspect, stating, [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> loved. You can have sex and you can have a baby. That baby will grow up and will kind of look like you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} {{track is}} the EDM song [...] "Break Free". The song combines the EDM and electro genres. In {{an interview with}} Billboard, Grande described the song as [...] "fantastic and super-experimental for [...] " [...] and stated: [...] "I never thought I'd do an EDM song, but that was an eye-opening experience, and now all I {{want to do is}} dance." [...] The album's first of three ballads, [...] "Best Mistake", features Big Sean. Billboard described it as [...] "A moody ballad that grows stickier upon each listen, [...] "Best Mistake" [...] carries a tidy collection of impressive production details, the momentary string stabs among them". Musically, it is a minimal hip-hop piano ballad lament that utilizes instrumentation from strings and a drum machine. It tells a story about a couple trying to [...] "make up their minds about the future of their relationship, with deep affection buried underneath their problems." [...] "Be My Baby" [...] featuring Cashmere Cat is a [...] "bouncy R jam". The song was compared with Mariah Carey's songs. The eighth track, [...] "Break Your Heart Right Back", featuring Childish Gambino, is about her boyfriend cheating on her with a man and contains the lyrics [...] "I know you’re mad 'cause I found out / <b>Want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> what I feel right now".

[...] He said the show [...] "might be an Al-Qaeda recruitment film." [...] However, he added that [...] "that's exactly how the show <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> - it's even more effective at creating instant hate figures than Big Brother, and that's saying something." ...|$|R

[...] Game Informer awarded it 5 out of 10, saying [...] "After a few matches, most players will be ready to move on to a bigger, better game." [...] GameSpot awarded it {{a score of}} 4.0 out of 10, praising the art style and characters but criticising the physics, ineffectual weapons and attempts at comedy.|$|R

[...] Subsequently, Alexander would mention (ASMR) Vin Diesel DMing a Game of D&D Just For You in talks like her John Seely Brown Symposium lecture on Technology and Society at the University of Michigan School of Information where she said it was [...] "light-hearted, brief, and actually feeling like you've made friends with Vin Diesel."

5000|$|Gabrielle Moss of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a highly {{positive}} review, rating it 4.8 out of 5, saying [...] "Community Season 5 <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> real things, {{even as it}} delivers perfectly crafted jokes about cop movies and Dane Cook—and Community Season 5 Episode 7 was perhaps the show's finest achievement {{in the field of}} actually, you know, feeling stuff." [...] She also commented positively on Abed and Hickey's roles, saying [...] "Abed's interaction with Hickey, in fact, might have been the sharpest emotional moment in the show's history. The idea of replacing Troy with Hickey seems completely counter-intuitive at first; Hickey is a grizzled ex-cop, Troy is someone who joyfully named a monkey [...] "Annie's Boobs." [...] But Jonathan Banks's Hickey absolutely burned through his first performance as Abed's tough love father figure.

[...] Ritter wrote, [...] "This record <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> not sad or angry but as if you are, say, in a government-town city centre at 4am, or a parking lot under a red sun. It’s not a cinematic mode of intuition, exactly, since there’s no plot; but there {{is the development of}} impression through time, as if the space gets sharper and more detailed as the song goes on." [...] Ritter wrote that each track is an evocative [...] "space" [...] a listener is brought in; these spaces take a variety of forms, such as spaces [...] "filled with regret," [...] "with the anticipation of an event just about to begin," [...] "with people and things, stone-still in a frozen tableau," [...] or [...] "emotional spaces, again not something like “happy” but the headspace you’re in when, for instance, you step off a cross-state bus into a very bright day." ...|$|R
