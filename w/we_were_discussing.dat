2500|$|Regarding the Major Signs, a Companion of the Prophet narrated: [...] "Once we {{were sitting}} {{together}} and talking amongst ourselves when the Prophet appeared. He asked us what it was <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing.</b> We {{said it was the}} Day of Judgment. He said: 'It will not be called until ten signs have appeared: Smoke, Dajjal (the Antichrist), the creature (that will wound the people), the rising of the sun in the West, the Second Coming of Jesus, the emergence of Gog and Magog, and three sinkings (or cavings in of the earth): one in the East, another in the West and a third in the Arabian Peninsula.'"

2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and in all {{the time}} I have been here, it has never {{occurred}} to me to think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E
2500|$|Celebrities of the post-2000 era, like Madhur Bhandarkar, {{say that}} they take at least three or four turns in Carter Road even today just to see Khanna. The younger {{generation}} stars like Imran Khan still regard Rajesh Khanna as someone who would take the top slot as the most romantic hero of all time. Shahrukh Khan idolises Rajesh Khanna and has opined; [...] "Rajesh Khanna, you can’t touch". Anupam Kher said [...] "Kishore Kumar, Sanjeev Kumar, S. D. Burman, R. D. Burman, Rajesh Khanna and Smita Patil {{changed the face of}} Indian cinema. They’re remembered by the films that they did." [...] Actor Tom Alter confessed [...] "I still dream of being Rajesh Khanna. For me, in the early 1970s, he was the only hero – romantic to the core, not larger than life, so Indian and real – he was my hero; the reason I came into films and he still is." [...] Actor Irrfan Khan stated in an interview, [...] "The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality." [...] The trend of wearing guru kurtas and belts on shirts became famous in the seventies and eighties because of Khanna. Javed Akhthar, in an interview, told about his experience with Khanna's stardom: [...] "Bangalore used to have a state lottery and the government asked him to draw the lucky number. They organised it in a stadium. I was with him as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> some scripts. I don't know if I will experience that again, the sound of 50,000 people gasping (when they saw him). He was like Caesar. It was unbelievable".|$|E
