40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{systematically}} {{assess the}} clinical effectiveness of Chinese medicines for {{prevention and treatment}} of radiation esophagitis by meta-analysis. MethodsThe articles were mainly retrieved from the “CHKD (China Hospital Knowledge Database) periodical full text databank”, the “China periodical full text databank”, the “CHKD doctor's and Master's degree student full text databank”, and the “China doctor's degree student thesis databank”, and they were selected according to the literature selection standard. The effects of Chinese <b>medicines</b> and <b>Western</b> <b>medicines</b> on radiation esophagitis were compared by meta-analysis. ResultsBased on 13 articles, {{we found that the}} effectiveness of Chinese medicines for prevention and treatment of radiation esophagitis was superior to <b>Western</b> <b>medicines,</b> with no obvious side effects. Meta-analysis showed that the total odds ratio was 0. 426 and the 95 % confidence interval was 0. 368, 0. 493. ConclusionChinese medicines are superior to <b>Western</b> <b>medicines</b> in preventing and treating radiation esophagitis. However, some methodological problems in the literature may have affected the authenticity of the results. Therefore, more rigorous, multi-central, randomized controlled trials with a large sample size should be designed to obtain a more reliable conclusion...|$|R

5|$|In 1619, King James I {{decreed that}} the American colonists of Jamestown {{would need to}} step up efforts to do their fair share towards {{supporting}} England. The Virginia Company enacted the decree, asking Jamestown's land owners to grow and export 100 hemp plants to help support England's cause. Later the colonists would grow it to support its expansion in the Americas. George Washington grew hemp at Mount Vernon {{as one of his}} three primary crops. The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) {{is a kind}} {{of chronic}} general immunological disease with primary clinical characteristic being joint synovitis, and no specific treatment has been found at present. In China, its morbidity is in an increasing trend, and also shows a trend of getting younger. RA is complicated in symptoms and chronic disease course, leading to joint ankylosis, deformity and even disability, which seriously threaten patients' psychological and physical health as well as the quality of life (QOL). RA, which belongs to “ Bi” symdrome, is termed as “arthroncus of knee” or “severe and migratory arthralgia” in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), for which TCM focuses on expelling wind to remove cold, tonifying qi to activate blood and dispelling dampness to smooth collaterals while the <b>western</b> <b>medicines</b> mainly based on the principles of anti-inflammation, analgesia and inhibiting autoimmune response. However, both Chinese and <b>western</b> <b>medicines</b> have certain advantages in treating RA. Therefore, this study primarily reviewed the advances of Chinese and <b>western</b> <b>medicines</b> in RA treatment in the hope of providing theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of RA...|$|R

People appear to base their treatment decisions largely on traditional notions of the efficacy of a medicine of a particular color, consistency, taste, size and reputed success in treating analogous illnesses. This helps to explain why people's uses of these medicines are often at odds with Western manufacturer's assumptions about their appropriate uses. Implications of these usesfor local as well as international health are drawn. ...|$|R
5|$|The European Renaissance brought {{expanded}} {{interest in}} both empirical {{natural history and}} physiology. In 1543, Andreas Vesalius inaugurated the modern era of <b>Western</b> <b>medicine</b> with his seminal human anatomy treatise De humani corporis fabrica, {{which was based on}} dissection of corpses. Vesalius was {{the first in a series}} of anatomists who gradually replaced scholasticism with empiricism in physiology and medicine, relying on first-hand experience rather than authority and abstract reasoning. Via herbalism, medicine was also indirectly the source of renewed empiricism in the study of plants. Otto Brunfels, Hieronymus Bock and Leonhart Fuchs wrote extensively on wild plants, the beginning of a nature-based approach to the full range of plant life. Bestiaries—a genre that combines both the natural and figurative knowledge of animals—also became more sophisticated, especially with the work of William Turner, Pierre Belon, Guillaume Rondelet, Conrad Gessner, and Ulisse Aldrovandi.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} aspirin (also known as acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) {{and the medical}} use of it and related {{substances}} stretches back to antiquity, though pure ASA has only been manufactured and marketed since 1899. Medicines made from willow and other salicylate-rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient Sumer {{as well as the}} Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt. Hippocrates referred to their use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around 400 BC, and were part of the pharmacopoeia of <b>Western</b> <b>medicine</b> in classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. Willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever, pain and inflammation in the mid-eighteenth century. By the nineteenth century pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to salicylic acid, the active component of willow extract.|$|E
5|$|Willow bark {{preparations}} {{became a}} standard {{part of the}} materia medica of <b>Western</b> <b>medicine</b> beginning at least with the Greek physician Hippocrates in the fifth century BC; he recommended chewing on willow bark to relieve pain or fever, and drinking tea made from it to relieve pain during childbirth. The Roman encyclopedist Celsus, in his De Medicina of ca. 30 AD, suggested willow leaf extract to treat the four signs of inflammation: redness, heat, swelling and pain. Willow treatments also appeared in Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, and Pliny the Elder's Natural History. By the time of Galen, willow was commonly used throughout the Roman and Arab worlds, as {{a small part of}} a large, growing botanical pharmacopoeia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionChronic {{urticaria}} (CU) {{is characterized}} by repeated occurrence of wheals or itching for more than 6 weeks. When urticarial symptoms repeatedly occur despite taking <b>western</b> <b>medicines</b> such as antihistamines, herbal medicines have potential as an alternative for them. Among various herbal medications for CU, we mostly prescribe Gwakhyangjeonggi-san (GJS) made by Lee Je-ma, the founder of Sasang Constitutional Medicine (SCM) in Korea. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate whether GJS actually helps in treating CU. MethodsWe performed a retrospective review of the medical records of 30 patients to whom GJS was administered in order to compare the changes in urticaria activity scores (UAS) and in <b>western</b> <b>medicines</b> taken at the beginning of treatment of GJS and at 6 months after completion of the treatment. ResultsThe UAS after 6 months from treatment (1. 63 ± 2. 06) with GJS for an average of 57. 30 ± 35. 88 days was significantly decreased compared to the score before treatment (5. 10 ± 0. 99), showing a statistically significant difference (p< 0. 001). 46. 67 % of the patients (14 / 30 patients) reported that their symptoms were completely eliminated, and 66. 67 % of the patients taking anti-histamines (18 / 27 patients) were able to stop it completely. DiscussionBased on the findings, GJS helps patients reduce taking <b>western</b> <b>medicines</b> such as anti-histamines, and we hypothesize that GJS improves symptoms of CU by the gastrointestinal protective activity and anti-oxidative/depressive effect. Further clinical study is warranted...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the social}} custom {{that men and women}} should not be near each other, the women of China were {{reluctant}} to be treated by male doctors of <b>Western</b> <b>Medicine.</b> This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors of <b>Western</b> <b>Medicine</b> in China. Thus, female medical missionary Dr. Mary H. Fulton (1854–1927) was sent by the Foreign Missions Board of the Presbyterian Church (USA) to found the first medical college for women in China.

On December 9, 2015, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, AMED, CNKI, KoreaMed, KMBASE, OASIS, and J-STAGE with no restriction on language or published year. We selected randomized controlled trials that involved patients with metabolic syndrome being treated with herbal medicines as intervention. The main keywords were “Chinese herbal medicines”, “metabolic syndrome”, and “randomized controlled trials”.
