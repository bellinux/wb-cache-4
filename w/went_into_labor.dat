25|$|On February 11, 1805, a {{few weeks}} after her first contact with the expedition, Sacagawea <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>labor</b> which was slow and painful, so the Frenchman Charbonneau {{suggested}} she be given a potion of rattlesnake's rattle to aid in her delivery. Lewis happened to have some snake's rattle with him. A short time after administering the potion, she delivered a healthy boy who was given the name Jean Baptiste Charbonneau.|$|E

Jacob buried her and erected a {{monument}} over her grave. Rachel's Tomb, just outside Bethlehem, remains a popular site for pilgrimages and prayers to this day. Jacob then settled in Migdal Eder, where his firstborn, Reuben, slept with Rachel's servant Bilhah; Jacob's response was not given at the time, but he did condemn Reuben for it later, in his deathbed blessing. Jacob was finally reunited with his father Isaac in Mamre (outside Hebron).|$|E
25|$|In early 1963, Jacqueline {{was again}} pregnant, leading her to curtail her {{official}} duties. She {{spent most of}} the summer at a home {{she and her husband had}} rented on Squaw Island, near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On August 7, five weeks ahead of her scheduled Caesarean section, she <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>labor</b> and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base. His lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to Boston Children's Hospital where he died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth. Jacqueline had remained at Otis Air Force Base to recuperate after the Caesarean delivery; her husband went to Boston to be with their infant son, and was present at his death. He returned to Otis on August 14 to take her home, giving an impromptu speech to thank nurses and airmen that had gathered in her suite, and she presented hospital staff with framed and signed lithographs of the White House.|$|E
25|$|The {{writing and}} {{recording}} sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture were marred by numerous distractions and inconveniences. In November 2003, Dreamworks {{was acquired by}} Universal Music Group for US$100 million, and eventually folded into Geffen Records. The transition period between labels left Rise Against without an A representative, and little acknowledgement from Geffen executives. Guitarist Todd Mohney left the band during the writing sessions, was replaced by Chris Chasse of Reach the Sky. McIlrath noted that the band was nervous about teaching Chasse completely new songs in a short period. Meanwhile, McIlrath was experiencing more personal distractions. Some Rise Against fans accused the band of selling out after signing with Dreamworks. Although McIlrath felt {{that most of the}} fans would realize that the band had not changed upon hearing the album, it still bothered him knowing that some longtime fans now hated the band for switching labels. Additionally, McIlrath's wife, who was seven months pregnant, <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>labor</b> {{while he was in the}} vocal booth. The band temporarily moved recording sessions from Vancouver to Chicago so that McIlrath could be with his wife.|$|E

500|$|When Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>labor</b> {{with hers}} and Prince William's baby in July 2013, {{the idea that}} the couple should reenact the famous scene from The Lion King became quite popular among Twitter users. [...] Radio {{journalist}} Darren Simpson reportedly tweeted, [...] "when your baby arrives please re-enact the scene from the Lion King". [...] Shortly after Middleton gave birth to a boy, England native Tommy Peto initiated a petition asking the couple to welcome their baby by having the Archbishop of Canterbury emulate the scene by holding him over the balcony of Buckingham Palace. [...] Ultimately, the idea was deemed [...] "outside the responsibility of the government" [...] and was declined.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Hemingway {{and his wife}} Hadley lived in Paris where he was foreign {{correspondent}} for the Toronto Star. When Hadley became pregnant they returned to Toronto. Hemingway biographer Kenneth Lynn suggests that Hadley's childbirth became {{the inspiration for the}} story. She <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>labor</b> while Hemingway was on a train, returning from New York. Lynn believes Hemingway likely was terrified Hadley would not survive the birth, and he became [...] "beside himself with fear... about the extent of her suffering and swamped by a sense of helplessness at the realization that he would probably arrive too late to be of assistance to her". Hemingway wrote [...] "Indian Camp" [...] a few months after John Hemingway was born in Toronto on October10, 1923.|$|E

500|$|Together, {{the family}} sailed on La Peyrouse {{to the port}} of Pointe des Galets, a site twenty {{kilometers}} (12.5 miles) from the capital of St. Denis, to secure a discreet arrival. Despite this effort, a crowd of French onlookers jeered and shouted as the boat docked, angry at the queen {{for the loss of}} French lives incurred during France's campaign to occupy Madagascar. After waiting for the crowd to disperse, the captain escorted the queen and her party into a horse-drawn buggy, the first Ranavalona had ever seen, and drove to the Hotel de l'Europe in St. Denis. Young Razafinandriamanitra, suffering from the emotional and physical strains of the journey into exile, <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>labor</b> shortly after reaching the hotel. She gave birth to a little girl on her second day in Réunion, but could not recover her strength and died five days later. The infant was named Marie-Louise and was baptised a Catholic to avoid antagonizing the French. [...] Marie-Louise, who could have become heir-apparent according to the traditional rules of succession, was adopted by Ranavalona as her own daughter.|$|E
500|$|Lamashtu is a {{historically}} older image that left {{a mark on}} the figure of Lilith. Many incantations invoke her as a malicious [...] "Daughter of Heaven" [...] or of Anu, and she is often depicted as a terrifying blood-sucking creature with a lion's head and {{the body of a}} donkey. Akin to Lilitu, Lamashtu primarily preyed on newborns and their mothers. She was said to watch pregnant women vigilantly, particularly when they <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>labor.</b> Afterwards, she would snatch the newborn from the mother to drink its blood and eat its flesh. In the Labartu texts she is described; [...] "Wherever she comes, wherever she appears, she brings evil and destruction. Men, beasts, trees, rivers, roads, buildings, she brings harm to them all. A flesh-eating, bloodsucking monster is she." [...] Gallu was a demon closely associated with Lilith, though the word (like [...] "Utukku") is also used as a general term for demons, and these are [...] "evil Uttuke" [...] or [...] "evil Galli". One incantation tells of them as spirits that threaten every house, rage at people, eat their flesh, and as they let their blood flow like rain, they never stop drinking blood. Lamashtu, Lilitu, and Gallu are invoked in different amulet texts, with Gallu showing up in Graeco-Byzantine myth as Gello, Gylo, or Gyllo. There she appears as a child-stealing and child-killing female demon, in the manner of Lamia and Lilith.|$|E

Adam believes the only way to cure Tender is for Tender to have sex - to reject the Church doctrine at its core. Tender resists, and as Adam recounts the details of the [...] "mental castration" [...] (as he calls it), Tender loses control and crashes the car into a giant concrete pylon {{in the middle of the}} landfill.|$|E
