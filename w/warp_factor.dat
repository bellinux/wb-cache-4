40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a novel pitch mean based {{frequency}} warping (PMFW) {{method is}} proposed {{to reduce the}} pitch variability in speech signals at the front-end of speech recognition. The <b>warp</b> <b>factors</b> used in this process are calculated based on the average pitch of a speech segment. Two functions to describe {{the relations between the}} frequency <b>warping</b> <b>factor</b> and the pitch mean are defined and compared. We use a simple method to perform frequency warping in the Mel-filter bank frequencies based on different <b>warping</b> <b>factors.</b> To solve the problem of mismatch in bandwidth between the original and the warped spectra, the Mel-filters selection strategy is proposed. At last, the PMFW mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) is extracted based on the regular MFCC with several modifications.

The presented technique aims {{to reduce the}} distortion in the Mel filter-bank energy estimation due to the harmonic composition of voiced speech intervals and DFT (discrete Fourier transform) sampling when the central frequency of band-pass filters is shifted. This paper also proposes an analytical maximum likelihood (ML) method to estimate the optimal <b>warping</b> <b>factor</b> in the cepstral space.
