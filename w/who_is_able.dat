5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to}} see themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E

He was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S. citizenship and inability to speak Arabic caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned. He had received Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam's book The Eternal Message of Muhammad with his visa approval, and he contacted the author. Azzam's son arranged for his release and lent him his personal hotel suite. The next morning MalcolmX learned that Prince Faisal had designated him as a state guest. Several days later, after completing the Hajj rituals, MalcolmX had an audience with the prince.|$|E

5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the children would have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E

5|$|Despite risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a {{story that}} was more {{directly}} critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any previous work. The Bad Sleep Well, based on a script by Kurosawa's nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about a young man <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company {{with the intention of}} exposing the men responsible for his father's death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new U.S.-Japan Security treaty, which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the country's democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} on the {{floating}} island of Skyloft and surrounding airborne islands; and the three Surface overworlds {{where the majority of}} the main adventure takes place. Side quests for the town's citizens are unlocked as the game progresses. The different areas of the Surface are accessed through portals in the clouds. Side quests for characters of the Surface are also available, and sometimes mandatory for completing the main quest. The Skyloft overworld is navigated with a great bird called a Loftwing, while the Surface is navigated on foot. Marker beacons can be set on the map for Link to follow, and save points in the form of statues preserve Link's progress up to that point. During his quest, Link is aided by the sword spirit Fi, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to give hints to the player for both environmental elements and enemies: for example, when an enemy is targeted and Fi is summoned, she will give the enemy's characteristics and weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|Through {{a series}} of miscommunications, Edward {{believes}} that Bella has killed herself by jumping off a cliff into the ocean. Distraught over her apparent suicide attempt, Edward travels to Italy and attempts to provoke the Volturi (powerful coven who act as vampiric overlords) to kill him by exposing himself as a vampire to humans. Alice, Edward's sister, and Bella travel to Italy to save Edward, and arrive {{just in time to}} stop him. Alice looks on as Bella jumps into the sunlight, and into Edward, preventing him from committing suicide. Realizing that Bella is alive, Edward explains to Bella that he always loved her and only left to protect her. However, the Volturi determine that Bella, a human who knows that vampires exist, must either be killed or transformed into a vampire herself. Alice stops them from killing her by sharing her premonition, in which Bella has been transformed, with Aro, a Volturi elder <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to read thoughts through touch. Soon after, they return to Forks and Cullens again settle themselves in Forks. Bella asks Edward to transform her and Cullens vote in favor of that much to Edward and Rosalie's dismay. Later, Jacob reminds Edward, the treaty Cullens and Quileutes made years before that they will not attack each other, as long as the Cullens do not feed on any humans, a necessity for Bella's transformation. The movie concludes with Edward telling Bella that he will change her into a vampire after she marries him.|$|E
