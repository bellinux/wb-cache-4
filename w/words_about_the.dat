5|$|With all of Memorize's secret {{operations}} taken down, Edge presses Nilin to {{find the}} Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once {{in the presence of the}} Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's <b>words</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E

25|$|The Guardian {{columnist}} and foreign correspondent Jonathan Steele {{published an article}} based on this line of reasoning. In an in-depth study of Iranian attitudes to Jews {{and the state of}} Israel, Hamburg professor of Islamic studies, Katajun Amirpur has argued that, in context, Ahmadinejad had been quoting Ayatollah Khomeini's <b>words</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> imminent appearance of the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime, and had tacked on his remarks concerning Israel. It follows, in her view, that the text could not imply any intention to destroy Israel or annihilate the Jewish people, since Khomeini's quoted statement preceding it prophesied that the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime would disappear, not that the Russian or Iranian people would thereby be extinguished.|$|E

As to manors which owned {{virtually all of the}} land in the medieval period, seven existed of which three were senior as had nobility living in them or owning them whereas the others did not; Malden wrote 3,788 words, mostly of their ownership and manor houses. These senior manors are summarised below whereas the other four were Wytley Chesberies or Wytley Cheasburies Manor, Mousehill Manor, Rake Manor and Roke or Roakeland Manor.|$|E
25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. She understood {{the impact of their}} journeys on others, but unlike Ai, did not have the maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even as she lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's <b>words</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what she felt so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E

The Bahraini Press Association described the verdict as [...] "unfair and outrageous" [...] and [...] "marred by abuses and violations of all legal and human rights standards". Human rights lawyer Mohamed al-Tajer said the appeal verdict was [...] "shocking" [...] and that [...] "he judge dismissed the appeal". In an op-ed in Al Wasat, Kassim Hussain argued that the most remembered <b>words</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> case of Bahrain Thirteen would be Ibrahim Sharif's words: [...] "These [...] trials are trials of ideas".|$|E

Cook had been around Charlotte for five months and no one realized there was anything wrong until he started developing stroke symptoms again. Doctors diagnosed his problems, which were not organic, and referred him to see the proper specialists. He claims to have had no recollection of leaving Florida, nor what he had done during his five months in Charlotte. When asked, he stated that, [...] "It was like someone switching off a light and then switching it back on." [...] Cook's story has been told through different media. The 700 Club did a full-length documentary about his life, which aired worldwide. Cook wrote a religious self-help book, Inspirational <b>Words</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> issues he overcame.|$|E

This doesn't sound like a good idea." [...] In a second one-minute clip, Michael tries stealing office supplies from the Dunder Mifflin office for his new company, until he is caught by Charles, who literally chases him out of the office; Charles then tries to describe what Michael's like to the camera but finds himself shocked into silence. In a final 38-second clip, Kelly visits Michael's office to ask what he will do with his life, then starts talking about her own fantasy of running off to Mexico with Charles. B. J. Novak wrote a talking-head segment for Toby, where he compares Michael to a movie on a plane because [...] "it's not great, but it's something to watch, and when it's over you're like, how much longer is this flight?

500|$|Ratatouille ( [...] ; [...] ) is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film {{produced}} by Pixar and released by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. It is the eighth film {{produced by}} Pixar and was co-written {{and directed by}} Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005. The title refers to a French dish, [...] "ratatouille", which is served {{at the end of}} the film and is also a play on <b>words</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> species of the main character. The film stars the voices of Patton Oswalt as Remy, an anthropomorphic rat who is interested in cooking; Lou Romano as Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; Ian Holm as Skinner, the head chef of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant; Janeane Garofalo as Colette, a rÃ´tisseur at Gusteau's restaurant; Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; Brian Dennehy as Django, Remy's father and leader of his clan; Peter Sohn as Emile, Remy's older brother; and Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef. The plot follows Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy.|$|E
500|$|But Shankly soon regretted his {{decision}} {{and tried to}} continue his involvement with the club, mainly by turning up for team training at Melwood. He said he still wanted the involvement as the club had become his life. He soon stopped going to Melwood because he felt there was some resentment and people were asking {{what he was doing}} there. He felt unwanted, but [...] "I never resented the club after I left, as some stupid person wrote in the paper." [...] He still attended matches, but sat in the stand away from the directors and staff. He was especially annoyed that Liverpool did not invite him to attend away matches as the club's guest. When, finally, he was invited to travel with them to the away leg of the 1976 UEFA Cup Final in Bruges, he was accommodated in a separate hotel and said he found that insulting. Shankly contrasted Liverpool's attitude with what he encountered at other clubs, including Liverpool's great rivals Everton and Manchester United, where he was received warmly. He recalled Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty's reply to a Liverpool director: [...] "Aye, Bill's welcome here". About Everton, once his greatest rivals, he wrote: [...] "I have been received more warmly by Everton than I have by Liverpool. It is a scandal that I must write these <b>words</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> club I helped to build".|$|E

[...] She was given a regular backup slot in Detective Comics starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordonâ€™s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics #417 (1971), stating: [...] "I'd like to say a few <b>words</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back... They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman's life. But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor, these hapless females are gone for good. In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime-fighter, a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [...] Batman." ...|$|E
