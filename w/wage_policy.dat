25|$|Poverty and {{inequality}} are significant social problems that Portugal {{has attempted to}} address VIA various social policy measures. The European economic crisis has {{increased the number of}} households that remain below the poverty line in Portugal with the greatest affected being the youth due to high unemployment rates. The current economic crisis experienced across the globe {{is the leading cause of}} income inequalities which lead to poor market demand in an economy and lower economic growth in Portugal. The minimum <b>wage</b> <b>policy</b> is aimed at reducing abject poverty and income inequalities in Portugal which will increase demand and lead to economic stability in the long-term. In 2014 after a four-year freeze Portugal increased their minimum wage by 4%. The minimum <b>wage</b> <b>policy</b> which came after negotiations with labor organizations and employers was only possible after substantial recovery of the economy and will increase the sustainability of the economy with aims at reducing poverty.|$|E
25|$|Labour unions {{were not}} allowed and a minimum <b>wage</b> <b>policy</b> was not enforced. However, {{in a context of}} an {{expanding}} economy, bringing better living conditions for the Portuguese population in the 1960s, the outbreak of the colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of more and more women into the labour market. Marcelo Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security.|$|E
25|$|Minimum wage rates {{vary greatly}} across many {{different}} jurisdictions, {{not only in}} setting a particular amount of money—for example $7.25 per hour ($14,500 per year) under certain US state laws (or $2.13 for employees who receive tips, which {{is known as the}} tipped minimum wage), $9.47 in the US state of Washington, or £7.50 (for those aged 25+) in the United Kingdom—but also in terms of which pay period (for example Russia and China set monthly minimum wages) or the scope of coverage. Currently the American federal minimum wage rests at seven dollars, twenty-five cents ($7.25) per hour. However, some states do not recognize the minimum wage law such as Louisiana and Tennessee. Other states operate below the federal minimum wage such as Georgia and Wyoming. Some jurisdictions even allow employers to count tips given to their workers as credit towards the minimum wage levels.

40|$|<b>Wage</b> <b>Policies</b> and Employment under Fixed and Flexible Exchange Rates. - Under {{flexible}} {{exchange rates}} moderate <b>wage</b> <b>policies</b> lead to increased employment via an interaction between profitability and real-balance effects. The employment increase, which results from a lower nominal wage increase, is smaller than under fixed exchange rates. The reason for this difference is that moderate <b>wage</b> <b>policies</b> under fixed exchange rates cause an additional expansion in the money supply, thereby increasing the employment effects of the <b>wage</b> <b>policies.</b> If expectations vis- 0 -vis price and exchange rate changes are taken into consideration, it is not impossible that a small increase in domestic wages will cause a decrease in inflation expectations {{and an increase in}} the demand for the domestic currency. A drop in real demand thereby induced, could be counteracted by a monetary policy aiming at ensuring that the target inflation rate is not undershot...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} individual top managers on <b>wages</b> and <b>wage</b> <b>policies.</b> A large longitudinal administrative dataset from Portugal allows us to match workers,firms and top managers, and follow {{the movements of the}} latter across different firms over time. We estimate the role of top manager fixed-effects in determining <b>wages</b> and <b>wage</b> <b>policies,</b> while also accounting for the effect of worker and firm heterogeneity. Our results reveal that top managers have a significant influence on wages, the returns to schooling and tenure, the gender wage gap, and the extent of rent sharing. Further-more, they point to the existence of managerial styles in the setting of <b>wage</b> <b>policies.</b> Finally, we relate worker compensation to observable managerial attributes, and find that returns to schooling tend to be higher in firms led by more educated top executives, while longer-tenured managers appear on average to engage in more rent sharing.

As noted by Robert Gildea, [...] "Social and economic policy was designed to restore liberal capitalism tempered by social reform, as prepared for during the war. Trade unions were also involved in a price and <b>wage</b> <b>policy</b> to cut inflation and this, together with the Allied use of Antwerp as the main entry point for war supplies, produced the so-called Belgian miracle of high economic growth combined with high wages."

In addition, the government should review and re-organize the existing policy in order to increase the number of employers that implement this policy in their business and firms and at the same time increase the employees’ satisfaction and happiness. ...|$|R

Two countries with different wage bargaining systems, Australia and France, are used to conduct a comparative study. It is found that firm <b>wage</b> <b>policies</b> in Australia play a much larger role in narrowing the gender earnings gaps than in France.

2500|$|Whether {{this caused}} the Great Depression is still heavily debated due {{to many other}} {{attributing}} factors. However, {{it is evident that}} the banking system suffered massive reductions across the country {{due to the lack of}} consumer confidence.

[...] This would allow healthy banks to take advantage of the struggling units forcing additional losses resulting in banks not being able to deliver on depositor demands and creating a failing cycle that would become wide spread.

40|$|The New Consensus {{approach}} in macroeconomics is criticised for its exclusive but unwarranted reliance on stabilising monetary policies, for its ill-designed {{approach to the}} role of <b>wages</b> and <b>wage</b> <b>policies,</b> and for its complete neglect of fiscal policies.

Based on this view macroeconomic performance and macroeconomic policies in France, Germany, Sweden and the UK between 1996 and 2005 are analysed, with a special focus on the role of fiscal policies.
