5|$|After the {{communist}} revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the Communist regime {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular backlash against the regime. The Soviet Union <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> that they were losing their influence in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, as he struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{declared}} war on Britain on 18 June 1812. Despite his preparations, Brock <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> about Canadian security. In Upper Canada, besides the militia, {{there was only one}} British regular infantry regiment, a detachment of retired veterans, and a company of artillery. These had to be dispersed among several widely separated posts. Brock's advantage was that the armed vessels of the Provincial Marine controlled the lakes, and allowed him to move his reserves rapidly between threatened points.|$|E

5|$|While the Crusades had causes {{deeply rooted}} in the social and {{political}} situations of 11th-century Europe, the event actually triggering the First Crusade was a request for assistance from Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Alexios <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> about the advances of the Seljuqs, who had reached as far west as Nicaea, not far from Constantinople. In March 1095, Alexios sent envoys to the Council of Piacenza to ask Pope Urban II for aid against the Turks.|$|E
5|$|Burton hired Danny Elfman, his {{collaborator}} on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, {{to compose}} the music score. For inspiration, Elfman was given The Dark Knight Returns. Elfman <b>was</b> <b>worried,</b> {{as he had}} never worked on a production this large in budget and scale. In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced {{when he heard the}} opening number. Peters and Peter Guber wanted Prince to write music for the Joker and Michael Jackson to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson's songs together for the entire film score.|$|E
5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T.

Sketch writer O'Donoghue <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E

5|$|Guitarist Joey Santiago and {{songwriter}} Black Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) met when they lived {{next to each}} other in a suite while attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Although Santiago <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> about distractions, he noticed Francis played music and the pair began to jam together. Francis embarked on a student exchange trip to Puerto Rico to study Spanish. After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university. Francis and Santiago spent 1984 working in a warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, British actress Gertrude Lawrence's {{business}} manager and attorney, Fanny Holtzmann, {{was looking for}} a new vehicle for her client when the 1944 Margaret Landon novel Anna and the King of Siam (a fictionalized version of Leonowens' experiences) was sent to her by Landon's agent. According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, Holtzmann <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> that Lawrence's career was fading. The 51-year-old actress had appeared only in plays, not in musicals, since Lady in the Dark closed in 1943. Holtzmann agreed that a musical based on Anna and the King of Siam would be ideal for her client, who purchased the rights to adapt the novel for the stage.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Chastain {{made her}} {{professional}} stage debut as Juliet in {{a production of}} Romeo and Juliet staged by TheatreWorks, a company in the San Francisco Bay Area. The production led her to audition for the Juilliard School in New York City, where she was soon accepted and granted a scholarship funded by the actor Robin Williams. In her first year at the school, Chastain suffered from anxiety and <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> about being dropped from the program, spending {{most of her time}} reading and watching movies. She later remarked that her participation in a successful production of The Seagull during her second year helped build her confidence. She graduated from the school with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2003.|$|E

However, there were no problems and this emergency plan was not implemented.

5|$|On {{the eve of}} the 1946 {{championship}} game, Bell {{was notified}} that Merle Hapes and Frank Filchock of the New York Giants had been implicated in a bribing scandal. Filchock was sanctioned by Bell to play in the game but Hapes was suspended. At the next NFL owners' meeting, Bell <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing. However, he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $30,000 per year. Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} afternoon, Bradman delayed {{the taking of}} the second new ball until after tea so that Lindwall and Johnston could have an extra period of {{recuperation}} before a new attack. This proved dividends as the bowlers took a wicket apiece within three overs of the new ball being taken, leaving England at 6/134. England were bowled out for 215 on the third morning, as Lindwall took 5/70. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he {{pretended not to notice}} Lindwall's pain. Lindwall <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax.|$|E

Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee, a young wife who is deified by her father-in-law. Ray <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> that the censor board might block his film, or at least make him re-cut it, but Devi was spared. In 1961, on the insistence of Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ray was commissioned to make a documentary on Rabindranath Tagore, {{on the occasion of}} the poet's birth centennial, a tribute to the person who likely most influenced Ray. Due to limited footage of Tagore, Ray faced the challenge of making a film out of mainly static material. He said that it took as much work as three feature films.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{defenders}} ran out {{of water}} on May 8 (according to a report later submitted by Madero himself) and were confined to only a few buildings {{in the center of}} the city. Most of the fighting at this point was at close quarters; as a result, the advantage in machine guns and artillery that the federals enjoyed earlier was no longer a factor. According to some accounts, Gen. Navarro's troops were on the verge of mutiny and he <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> that they would turn on his officers. To forestall that possibility, Navarro began negotiations with the rebel forces. He surrendered the town two days later, at 2:30p.m. on May 10, 1911.|$|E

However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, as they saw him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} idea for The Garden of Words came from Shinkai's desire {{to capture the}} beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku, he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards. Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit, Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo. Following the earthquake in March 2011, he <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> that it could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film.|$|E
5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time that Villa and Orozco were marching on Ciudad Juárez, the Zapatista revolt {{gathered}} strength and spread to the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. On April 14, Madero had Emiliano Zapata officially designated as his representative in the region. However, Zapata <b>was</b> <b>worried</b> that if he did not fully control all the major towns in Morelos by the time that Madero concluded negotiations with Díaz, the demands of his agrarian movement and the issue of the autonomy of Morelos would be ignored or sidelined. Zapata's first military action was to take the town of Chinameca where he obtained essential supplies. Subsequently, Zapata, for political and strategic reasons, decided to attack the city of Cuautla. In order to mislead his opponents however, he initially attacked and captured the towns of Izúcar de Matamoros (which was subsequently retaken by federal forces) and Chietla. From there he made a wide circle around Cuautla and captured Yautepec and Jonacatepec where he gathered more supplies, munitions and soldiers. By May, out of all the major urban centers in the region, only Cuautla and the capital of Morelos, Cuernavaca, remained outside of his control.|$|E
