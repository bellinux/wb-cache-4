A wealthy child molester, Verger was paralyzed and brutally disfigured by Lecter during a therapy session. He has been pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture, torture, and kill Lecter ever since. Using his wealth and political influence, Verger has Starling reassigned to Lecter's case, hoping her involvement <b>will</b> <b>draw</b> Lecter out.|$|E

In this title, Lionel is concerned that confidence trickster Donald Jacobi <b>will</b> <b>draw</b> {{too much attention to}} the meteor rocks in Smallville and ruin his plans to use the rocks for experiments. Lionel has the life of Jacobi's partner put in jeopardy when he threatens to alert some mobsters who are looking for Lionel. He makes a brief appearance in Smallville: Dragon, in which he tells Lex he used Lex's ex-girlfriend Renata to get close to Lex to test him for unknown reasons. The Smallville version of Lionel makes a brief appearance in the second volume of the internet series Smallville: Chloe Chronicles; he threatens Chloe after she discovers he is involved with the deaths of several people.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean {{there are plenty of}} nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. The hope is that such large scale exercises <b>will</b> <b>draw</b> down carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E

25|$|Since it {{was quite}} easy to stack {{interconnections}} (wires) inside the embedding matrix, the approach allowed designers to forget completely about the routing of wires (usually a time-consuming operation of PCB design): Anywhere the designer needs a connection, the machine <b>will</b> <b>draw</b> a wire in straight line from one location/pin to another. This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced crosstalk (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other—which almost never happens in Multiwire), though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.|$|E

25|$|The obscure word sōpiō (gen. sōpiōnis) {{seemed to}} mean a sexualized {{caricature}} with an abnormally large penis, such as the Romans were known to draw.

The grammarian Sacerdos preserves a quotation about Pompey, that says quem non pudet et rubet, non est homo, sed sopio ("whoever is not ashamed, and does not blush, is not a man, but a sopio.") Sōpiō would appear to describe drawings such as that of the god Mercury in the illustration.|$|E
