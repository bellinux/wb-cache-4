The BBC {{recorded}} the whole of the Reading Festival, we went down amazingly well.

[...] Maida even quit once after firing Rock at a group meeting. [...] "For me that was pretty much it. I was pretty much done with the band [...] [...] [...] It was really dark," [...] Maida Noted. Pressure was also coming from the band's management and the record company, who continued to fund the band's sessions. Raine commented, “I think we were at, like, 35 songs, and we all sat in a room and said, ‘Yeah, but there’s only eight that we all like.’ Everyone’s really frustrated.... And I think Bob had even lost perspective at this point. We’re sitting there in this shitty little studio in Malibu, and it just got a little aggressive and agitated in the room." [...] "It was never a personal thing. It was never, 'I don't want be in a band with you anymore.' It was more, what the hell are we doing? <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> faster or we're going to go insane. You can talk up and down about who stormed out or when they stormed out, but the whole point of it is that we kind of lost focus. It felt like we could've been in the studio for another six years and be at the same point. If we didn't finish this record, we would've been pretty bitter people. Jeremy Taggart, on fighting about Healthy... The album's release date was once again pushed back to January or March 2005 while a final recording session was held in Mississauga, Ontario to re-record most of the songs that would make the album. During these sessions, guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian visited with them and contributed his guitar playing to several tracks. [...] "He Shearer came {{in the last couple of}} sessions to help us out and to get a little different guitar perspective on there." [...] Duncan Coutts explained, [...] "We had a couple of our friends that came and played. One guy, Adam, played a little B3, and Jason Lader played on that song. He was also our Pro Tools engineer for part of it—not the whole thing, part of it, doing Pro Tools editing. He played on a song that never made the record." [...] Coutts recounted the atmosphere of the final recording session. [...] "It was kind of like a musical community, like friends and musicians would stop by and people that were working there, part of the recording team. Bob sang vocals; Bob played guitar. Eric Helmkamp, Bob’s assistant engineer and Pro Tools engineer—he sang on some stuff. It was just about a musical team." [...] These sessions brought the whole project back into focus for the band, easing many of the tensions that had arisen earlier. According to Coutts, [...] "I don't know what would have happened if not for that time." ...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{importance}} of emotions and feelings is crucial to effective teaching and learning. Why do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this?</b> The question may irritate the teacher, {{but it is one}} of the most intelligent questions that a student can ask. Students—and the rest of us, for that matter—are loathe to expend cognitive energy unnecessarily, so assessing {{the importance}} of a task is a key initial step in cognition. But how do we know what is important? Our brain's ability to unconsciously or consciously identify and assess the relevance and meaning of what we confront is just a small part of a very complex cognitive system. Recent developments in our understanding of the neurobiology of consciousness (Damasio, 1999; Edelman & Tononi, 2000) are providing educators with new understandings of how we recognize dangers and opportunities, and these insights pose important challenges to educators. Unconscious Emotions Because our immediate environment is rich in dangers and opportunities that range widely in importance, our brain needs something akin to a thermostat to determine when a specifi...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{motivation}} for clustering objects on subsets of attributes (COSA) {{was given by}} consideration of data where the number of attributes is {{much larger than the}} number of objects. Obvious application is in systems biology (genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics). When we have a large numbers of attributes, ob-jects might cluster on some attributes, and be far apart on all others. Common data analysis approaches in systems biology are to cluster the attributes first, and only after having reduced the original many-attribute data set to a much smaller one, one tries to cluster the objects. The problem here, of course, is that we would like to select those attributes that discriminate most among the objects (so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> while regarding all attributes multivariately), and it is usually not good enough to inspect each attribute univariately. Therefore, two tasks have to be carried out simultaneously: cluster the objects into homogeneous groups, while se-lecting different subsets of variables (one for each group of objects). The attribute subset for any discovered group may be completely, partially or nonoverlapping with those for other groups. The notorious local optima problem is dealt with b...|$|E
40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis we {{are going}} to discuss 2 -dimentional potential airflows around so called Joukowski airfoils. The reason for doing this is an assignment for the course Computational methods of science, also see [1]. In this assignment (discussed in section 3. 1. 1) we determine the speed and pressure around a cylinder using FFT’s. When we know the pressure we can say something about the net (lift) force acting on the body. As you can image, a cylinder is not a very interesting model. So the goal of this thesis is {{to find a way to}} transform this flow around the cylinder onto a profile that is more interesting. We do this by using the Joukowski transformation which maps a cylinder on an airfoil shaped body, the so called Joukowski airfoil. Before we can transform the speed around the cylinder we must first determine the speed around a cylinder with circulation. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in order to satisfy the so called Kutta-Joukowski condition. This condition states that the flow should leave the body smoothly. We determine the speed around a cylinder with circulation with the help of the Hess and Smith method combined with FFT’s. The Hess and Smith method is a boundary integral method for flows around arbitrary shapes, that uses sources and circulations to create a flow. As a check we also solve the problem using super positioning of singularities. After this we transform the flow to a flow around the Joukowski airfoil in such a way that it is physically realistic. In the last section we will discuss the most interesting results obtained. 3...|$|E
