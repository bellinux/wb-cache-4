40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency</b> and firm profitability, and how this relationship is affected by economic fluctuations. In the existing literature, the relationship between <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency</b> and firm profitability has been extensively researched. However, the impact of economic fluctuations {{on the relationship between}} <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency</b> and firm profitability is sparsely researched. To the best of our knowledge, only Enqvist, Graham and Nikkinen (2014) have addressed the impact ofeconomic fluctuations on the relationship between <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency</b> and firm profitability. This thesis is a replication of their study in another geographical setting, another time period and studying different types of firms. Using a sample of 2, 589 firm-year observations of listed Swedish firms for the years 2000 - 2015, this thesis conducts multiple regression analysis {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency</b> and firm profitability. The findings of this thesis propose that firms can enhance profitability by improving their <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency.</b> However, the relationship between <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency</b> and firm profitability does not appear to be significantly affected by economic fluctuations.

As a demonstration of patriotism {{large sums of money}} were voted annually for the purpose of building warships, and the patriotic common man paid the taxes gladly with a dream of irresistible naval predominance to sweeten the payment. But the money was not spent on warships; only a portion of it was spent, and the rest remained to make a surplus and warm the heart of the common man in his tax-paying capacity. This artful dodge was repeated for several years; the artful dodger is now a peer, no doubt abjectly respected, and nobody in the most patriotic party so far evolved is a bit the worse for it. In the organizing expedients of all popular governments, as in the prospectuses of unsound companies, the disposition is to exaggerate the nominal capital {{at the expense of the}} <b>working</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Democratic armies and navies are always short, and probably will always be short, of ammunition, paint, training and reserve stores; battalions and ships, since they count as units, are over-numerous and go short-handed, and democratic army reform almost invariably works out to some device for multiplying units by fission, and counting men three times instead of twice in some ingenious and plausible way. And this must be so, because the sort of men who come inevitably to power under democratic conditions are men trained by all the conditions of their lives to so set appearances before realities as at last to become utterly incapable of realities.|$|E

50|$|Fig. 15A {{shows the}} {{schematic}} of a standing {{surface acoustic waves}} (SSAW)-based cell enrichment device. A microchannel is assembled in the SSAW-activated region of the substrate with its long axis oriented in the propagation direction of acoustic waves. In order for the acoustic waves to propagate into the microchannel, a coupling gel is used {{to fill the gap}} between the tubing and the substrate, as shown in Fig. 15B. Applying an AC signal to the IDTs results in the generation of a SSAW field and thus the creation of a non-uniform pressure field in the fluid with a periodic distribution of pressure nodes and antinodes. In the presence of the SSAW field, a cell suspension is injected into the microchannel. Upon entering the region where the coupling gel bonds the microchannel to the substrate, known as the enrichment region, cells are trapped at SSAW pressure nodes. As more fluid pass through the enrichment region, the concentration of the trapped cells gradually increase. Finally, the SSAW is turned off to release the cells. A parallel sample enrichment approach could help to improve the <b>working</b> <b>efficiency</b> and throughput by enriching more cells in less time, or enriching different species of cells simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 15D, by assembling an array of microchannels onto the piezoelectric substrate, parallel sample enrichment is conveniently established. In each channel, the efficiency of the sample enrichment is consistent (Fig. 15E), revealing a steady performance of each working unit.|$|E
5000|$|In New South Wales, Australia, train {{controllers}} and the Telephone Train Control System {{have survived}} {{to the present}} under RailCorp, despite the advent of power signal boxes and other improved technical provisions for signalmen. These train controllers have gradually assumed theoretical and actual safe working responsibility, stemming from a process of consolidation and restructure in the 1980s and facilitated by considerable changes to the rules and regulations. The nett result of these changes was far-reaching, with fewer train controller positions, but an expanded train controller duty statement, diminished overall responsibility for signalmen (at least theoretically) and more direct involvement by train controllers in work previously managed by signalmen. It is doubtful that these changes have led to an overall improvement in train <b>working</b> <b>efficiency</b> and, significantly, {{it was not until}} circa 2000 that the train control system was ever properly enforced. With signalmen relieved of the right to make a large proportion of train working decisions themselves, the limitations of the train control system mentioned above became acutely apparent. Furthermore, the additional link in the chain of safety-critical communication has been identified as a risk by industry experts and railwaymen alike. The change, apparently influenced by a revised corporate outlook (since 1988) and a modern management culture with elements of postmodern business ideology, favoured a network overseen by a small number of controllers using a computerized, largely automated signalling system and simplified timetable. The old vertically integrated state-owned railway, which was operated almost solely by blue-collar workers, front-line managers such as station masters, with a small number of managers and engineers above, has fallen out of favour since the 1980s. Today, the railway and workforce generally have a greatly expanded, professionalized white-collar component, and the average railway employee's work is becoming less hands-on and more theoretical. However, owing to the retention of a colonial network, complex timetable and operational environment, real automation of the Sydney rail network and elimination of the traditional signalman role remains impracticable at this juncture. The deregulation and liberalization of the Sydney rail network, which began in the mid 1990s, remains in its preliminary stages. Should the virtual monopoly which CityRail has for passenger services over most of the network be dissolved, the traditional train control system, which evolved under the vertically integrated British railways of the early twentieth century, would probably be dissolved with it. This scenario is becoming increasingly likely, but its impact upon signalling and control remains indeterminate.|$|E

40|$|Pakistan is a {{developing}} country and for the accelerated growth of its economy an effective route is through proliferation and growth of commercial firms by enhancing their profitability. However, this requires reduction in the marginal cost of output of these firms. Therefore, the most important consideration is to find ways and means of reducing cost in the components of working capital. This thesis aims to look into firm-specific internal micro level factors that may impact the <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency</b> of large scale manufacturing firms in Pakistan. The study is empirical in nature and attempts to check <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency</b> standards for firms of different sectors. In addition to this, economic effect of micro level factors on business performance is investigated. Working capital requirements,liquidity requirements, and <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency</b> of business firms are examined {{on the basis of}} firm-specific internal micro level factors. All findings are based on an objective sample of 207 non-financial business firms listed on Karachi Stock Exchange from thirteen large scale manufacturing sectors of Pakistan. Reliable sources that are used for secondary data include State Bank of Pakistan,Ministry of Finance,Federal Bureau of Statistics, Business Recorder, websites of sampled firms,Trade Associations for some sectors etc. The thesis relies on using fixed effect method after controlling multicollinearity, autocorrelation, hetroskedasticity, and misspecification biases. Firms of different sectors are found more inclined towards improving their business performance through the use of current assets. Few firms in a sector are found improving their efficiency standards and are in status-quo with respect to their working capital strategies. Cash conversion cycle and size of the firm are identified as some main firm-specific internal micro level factors having significant influence on business performance of firms in most of the sectors. Leverage, cash flows, and growth of the firm are found to significantly influence the working capital requirements of firms. Liquidity needs of the firms are found to take significant influence of firms’ profitability, leverage, cash flows, and growth of the firm. It is observed that liquidity requirements and working capital requirements of business firms increase in poor economic conditions. A notable finding in the thesis is that receivables management,inventory management, cash conversion cycle, and firms’ growth have significant influence on the <b>efficiency</b> of <b>working</b> capital management in all economic sectors. This finding confirms that there exist internal micro level factors which impact the <b>working</b> capital <b>efficiency</b> of business firms...|$|R
