5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{especially}} {{due to the}} vernacular language used, this work was largely neglected among the Greek scholars, especially by Adamantios Korais and Dimitrios Katartzis, and was never used as an academic work, or even as a school textbook. It was also negatively received by the Church hierarchy, as well as conservative Greek scholars, due to the vernacular language it used and the liberal views it expressed. It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work’s linguistic form disappointed even Dimitrios Katartzis, the intellectual mentor of the two authors, while Philippidis himself, never used such vernacular style language again in his future works. However, Geographia Neoteriki inspired a number of similar geographical works published in Greece during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} {{whether the}} source test or nature test {{ought to be}} the determining test. It appears, though, that the impact of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be the determining factor. It is also <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E

25|$|It is also <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{relative}} {{rates for}} the formation reactions in the table above are the same for a given reaction at both temperatures. This {{is due to the}} reaction rate constants for these reactions having β and γ constants of 0, resulting in k=α which is independent of temperature.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Griffiths et al. {{concluded}} that psilocybin {{is capable of}} producing mystical experiences. These experiences may be conducive {{to the development of}} a religious ritual. It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> experience of death and rebirth can be brought on by psychedelic drugs, but it is also a central concept of Hinduism (i.e. saṃsāra).|$|E

25|$|The word Sadism {{originates}} {{from the}} works of Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade, and the word Masochism originates from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the author of Venus in Furs. However, it is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Marquis de Sade describes unconsented abuse in his works, such as in Justine. Venus in Furs describes a consented domme-sub relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{symbol of}} the town is {{reproduced}} on the coat of arms – the large black tower on the right {{as well as the}} smaller toll tower on the left bank of the Aare linked by the bridge in between. It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> machicolation mentioned in the blazon is really an oriel without any specified function, while the toll tower was removed in 1836.|$|E

25|$|During the Norman and Spanish {{periods and}} {{under the rule of}} the Knights, Malta became the devout Catholic nation it is today. It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Maltese Inquisition (more {{properly}} called the Roman Inquisition) had a very long tenure in Malta following its establishment by the Pope in 1530; the last Inquisitor departed from the Islands in 1798, after the Knights capitulated to the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|E
25|$|A disputed {{temperature}} of 42°C {{was set at}} an airfield in Wisley, Surrey on 18 July 2006. It {{has been suggested that}} the reading for this temperature should in fact have been 32°C. It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Met Office expected temperatures to surpass the August 2003 record during the July 2006 heatwave, and it is still speculated that both heatwaves did set higher temperatures than those officially recorded.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Azeri Turkic {{language}} {{came into}} existence with the invasion and settlement of waves of Turkic tribes from Central Asia over several centuries. The indigenous language of the region {{above and below the}} Aras river was a mix of Iranian Tati, Taleshi. With the increasing dominance of Turkic rulers, the language of the region gradually was infused with Turkic, resulting in what is known in modern days as the Azeri language.|$|E

25|$|Dobie categorically {{states that}} no records in Ayrshire exist of a 'Ravencraig Castle' {{and goes on}} to record that the {{building}} {{on the west side of}} the Corsehill Burn has been a ruin since 1608 and that the area it stands in was once called 'Corsehill Park. It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Scots for a raven (Corvus corax) is 'Raen' or 'Ra'en'. Above Kirkwood near Dunlop is a property called 'Ravenslie'. In 1820 David Cunninghame was the proprietor at a rental of £39 13s. 4d.|$|E
25|$|When {{a spectator}} or other person not {{associated}} {{with one of the}} teams (including such staff as bat boys or ball girls) alters play in progress, it is spectator interference, colloquially called fan interference. It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter is also (incorrectly) used to refer to fan obstruction – for instance a spectator running onto the field and tackling a baserunner. The ball becomes dead, and the umpire will award any bases or charge any outs that, in his judgment, would have occurred without the interference.|$|E
25|$|Bringing Out the Dead (1999) was {{a return}} to {{familiar}} territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier Taxi Driver. Like previous Scorsese–Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalled the films of Robert Bresson. (It is also <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of After Hours.) It received generally positive reviews, although not the universal critical acclaim {{of some of his}} other films. It stars Nicolas Cage, Ving Rhames, John Goodman, Tom Sizemore, and Patricia Arquette.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spinor Lie {{derivative}} {{is independent}} of the metric, and hence also of the connection. This is not obvious from {{the right-hand side of}} Kosmann's local expression, as the right-hand side seems to depend on the metric through the spin connection (covariant derivative), the dualisation of vector fields (lowering of the indices) and the Clifford multiplication on the spinor bundle. Such is not the case: the quantities on the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression combine so as to make all metric and connection dependent terms cancel.|$|E
25|$|After {{reviewing}} Quanta, Mallinckrodt, and the parties' arguments, this Court is {{persuaded that}} Quanta overruled Mallinckrodt sub silentio. The Supreme Court's broad {{statement of the}} law of patent exhaustion simply cannot be squared with the position that the Quanta holding is limited to its specific facts. Further, the Federal Circuit relied in part on Mallinckrodt in reaching its decision in LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc., 453 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the decision the Supreme Court reversed in Quanta. It is also <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quanta decision did not mention a single Federal Circuit case.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> {{rulers of}} these {{subordinate}} towns held rights of sovereignty {{similar to those}} wielded by the Ewi of Ado in making rules and that Llyod (1962:221) asserted that ‘the Ewi, however holds certain sovereign rights over the entire Kingdom’. A major feature is {{that each of the}} subordinate towns also has its separate rulers and chiefs, with a measure of importance and respect even when they hold lesser status or rank in relation to the Ewi who takes preeminence over them due to his prominence, influence, traditional rights, military might, population and size of the realm.|$|E
