It involves multiple agents interacting in such a way that a glimpse of structure may appear.|$|E
25|$|The Almanack {{contained}} the calendar, weather, poems, sayings and astronomical and astrological information that a typical almanac {{of the period}} would contain. Franklin also included the occasional mathematical exercise, and the Almanack from 1750 features an early example of demographics. It is chiefly remembered, however, for being a repository of Franklin's aphorisms and proverbs, many of which live on in American English.

500|$|Despite its popularity, a few music critics {{including}} Robert Copsey from Digital Spy {{criticized the}} song for being monotonous. Cospey wrote that [...] "you could slap an LMFAO tag {{on the cover}} and few would know the difference" [...] and Paul Lester of The Guardian similarly labelled it as [...] "generic ravey Euro dance with guitars". Lester described the song as [...] "Pump Up the Jam meets the Macarena <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> of Cotton Eye Joe" [...] while Robert Myers of The Village Voice dismissed [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] as an [...] "inspired piece of silliness".|$|E

The synth sounds remind him a little of Ray Lynch. [...] Parsons details this as [...] "much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements". [...] Debbage writes that [...] "the remainder of the album is filled with Joseph’s uncanny ability to compose elegant and emotive ballads.

'All You Need Is Love' by The Jamms is more than rife with a bit of The Beatles (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> of MC5 and Samantha Fox). It seems to be anti-AIDS, but as I know nothing about the band it could easily be a piss take. Either way this is a superb jam, if you can find it, buy it (it's so dodgily constructed in legal terms that no distributor info is given)." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by American mycologist Charles Christopher Frost in 1874 as Boletus salmonicolor, based on specimens he {{collected in the}} New England area of the United States. In a 1983 publication, mycologist Roy Halling declared Boletus subluteus (described by Charles Horton Peck in 1887; Ixocomus subluteus is a later combination based on this name) and Suillus pinorigidus (described by Wally Snell and Esther A. Dick in 1956) to be synonymous. Halling also reexamined Frost's type specimen of B.salmonicolor, and considered the taxon better placed in Suillus because of its glutinous cap, dotted stem, and ring; he formally transferred it to that genus, resulting in the combination Suillus salmonicolor. The specific epithet salmonicolor is a Latin color term meaning [...] "pink <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> of yellow". The mushroom {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "slippery Jill".|$|E

The aircraft, with a [...] payload, {{had to be able}} to clear a [...] obstacle following a [...] takeoff roll. Victory in this competition was viewed being of a high importance at the time as it was seem as being potentially [...] "the first real NATO combat aircraft". However, due to changes made to the requirement, the P.1150 was considered to be undersized and thus unsatisfactory, which led to a desire for a redesign. Wood views the decision not to persist with the original P.1150 design was a [...] "serious setback...it would have provided a first class basic type".|$|E
500|$|The Toronto Suns Steve Tilley, who {{believed}} that Remedy did a [...] "killer job" [...] on Max Payne 2, felt that the company kept what was great about the previous game, [...] "while everything else has been tweaked, overhauled and juiced up". He was {{a fan of the}} Bullet Time from the first game, and therefore appreciated seeing it return in the sequel, with [...] "even more impressive" [...] visuals. Tilley found that the game's [...] "lifelike physics engine" [...] was easily its best aspect, and noted that while playing the game, he threw a grenade across a room, which resulted in an explosion that sent enemies flying through the air in a realistic fashion. In addition, Tilley applauded Remedy for listening to fan complaints and resolving issues from the previous game, including improved dream sequences in Max Payne 2. He was, however, disappointed with the general linearity of the game, and noted that players who are not interested in film noir themes will not enjoy them in Max Payne 2. Concluding, Tilley commented that the game [...] "has enough polish, cinematic flair and outright mayhem to thrill those who like their Sopranos <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> of John Woo and a touch of Frank Miller." ...|$|E
500|$|Salander is a {{computer}} hacker who has survived severe emotional and sexual abuse. The character was a [...] "vulnerable victim-turned-vigilante with the [...] "take-no-prisoners" [...] attitude of Lara Croft and the [...] "cool, unsentimental intellect" [...] of Spock. Fincher felt that Salander's eccentric persona was enthralling, and stated, [...] "there's a kind of wish fulfillment {{to her in the}} way that she takes care of things, the way she will only put up with so much, but there are other sides to her as well." [...] Casting was complicated by the raft of prominent candidates such as Natalie Portman, Ellen Page, Kristen Stewart, Emily Browning, Jennifer Lawrence, Keira Knightley, Anne Hathaway, Olivia Thirlby, Scarlett Johansson, and Emma Watson. Despite the hype, some eventually withdrew from consideration due to the time commitment and low pay. Mara had worked with Fincher in his 2010 film The Social Network. Fincher, while fond of the actress' youthful appearance, found it difficult at first to mold her to match Salander's antisocial demeanor, which was a vast contrast from her earlier role as the submissive Erica. Mara went through multiple changes in her appearance to become Salander. Her hair was dyed black and cut into various jagged points, giving the appearance that she cut it herself. In addition to her transgressive appearance, which was described as a [...] "mash-up of brazen Seventies punk and spooky Eighties goth <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> of S temptress" [...] by Lynn Hirschberg of W, Mara participated in a formal screening and was filmed by Fincher on a subway in Los Angeles in an effort to persuade the executives of Sony Pictures that she was a credible choice.|$|E

500|$|The LM's {{policies}} were generally progressive, and Hall himself stated that [...] "we had no major {{differences with the}} written philosophies of the LCL". The LM's colour, purple, was described by observers as [...] "LCL blue <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> of Labor red", signifying the faction's location on the political spectrum. The LM was less concerned with creating differing policy as it was taking over and reforming the LCL; however, on the electoral reform front, the LM started by calling for the Legislative Council to be devoid of ministers. Worried by the LM, conservatives in the LCL tried to change the party rules to prevent members from criticising the organisation in public, and enforce discipline. This backfired as the LM exploited it to portray the conservatives as repressive, and the media also viewed it negatively, and the move was put on hold. The non-Labor forces, in their disunity, were in a poor position to challenge the dominance of charismatic Premier Dunstan. The LM itself contained two poorly defined internal groups: moderates, concerned with the inequalities of the electoral systems and the LCL's aging image; and radicals, who espoused the aforementioned {{in addition to the}} desire for wide-ranging social reform. Some of the latter felt Hall was the most progressive option available, but not progressive enough. Nevertheless, the LM had generated a large amount of campaign funds and had great name recognition; Hall was also favoured in opinions as a better leader than Eastick by a threefold factor. They cited such figures to portray themselves as the main threat to Labor and justify why they were the direction the LCL needed to take. Late in the year the LM received another boost when Wilson regained the seat of Sturt for the Liberal Party at the 1972 federal election, making much of his LM membership.|$|E

[...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "It's beautiful to look at. The talking cars feel more alive than talking cars should." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "Cars made me want to hop in my jalopy and to head out to Route 66, bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the Mother Road redundant." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie's young audience -- Cars finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Cars might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it." [...] Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it's a Pixar film, right? And they're always worth a gander no matter what anyone says." ...|$|E
