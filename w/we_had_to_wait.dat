500|$|I {{was very}} pleased it was made at all. ... There were people who said, 'I don't think we're going to do this', and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> months to get the green light. We thought, 'Well, we haven't got the budget we want, we haven't got the {{schedule}} we want, so we're {{going to have to}} make it as brilliant as we can.' It was a costume drama and it needed a costume drama budget, and it didn't get that.|$|E

Since then, the changes haven't been {{fundamental}} at all.” Continuing, “I think the shapeshifting story {{is one that}} has been greatly exaggerated by the media. There have been a couple of twists and turns after the Blake record, that's granted, but nothing too significant. I see Ulver as having a part one and a part two. And that's a division that we already had in our minds before those first three albums were even finished. We already knew we were going somewhere else after Nattens madrigal. Due to logistics, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> almost two years until that one got released, and in the interim we had amassed a huge array of influences. We were out of our teens and our outlook was becoming more complex." ...|$|E
60|$|A dish was at {{this point}} passed over his shoulder, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> while he helped himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{more than}} anyone can say; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for Anstruther and Spencer. It may be three or four days; {{it may be a}} fortnight." ...|$|R
30|$|T 2 : Just {{wait for}} your turn, Izzy. You’re coming up with some really good {{questions}} but each time <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for each person’s turn.|$|R
5000|$|... "Overnight, {{this show}} went from ho-hum TV for me, to must-watch TV. I am only unhappy that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until January for more episodes." [...] - SFScopewriter Sarah Stegall ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until Uncle Roger stopped {{laughing}} {{before we}} heard the explanation. We thought he never WOULD stop.|$|E
6000|$|... "And how <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for {{our dinner}} at Gaza till the camels came up?" [...] And Mr. M'Gabbery, urging on his horse, brought him up once more abreast {{with that of}} Miss Waddington.|$|E
6000|$|... "As deep as the ocean! All I pretend is {{that the}} author doesn't see--" [...] But a dish {{was at this point}} passed over his shoulder, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> while he helped himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{until the}} bushes bear again," [...] Twinkle remarked, [...] "it will be nearly a year, and I'm sure we can't {{live in the}} forest all winter." ...|$|R
50|$|As already mentioned, {{there are}} no {{important}} events evidencing this castle sieges by enemy troops during the Middle Ages. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for war episodes of the first Carlist War to document their partial use again.|$|R
6000|$|She was saying, {{in answer}} to a question: [...] "No, Dr. Weissmann, I {{have no control over}} the manifestations; in fact, the more anxious I am, the longer <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait.</b> I cannot promise {{anything}} to-night--" ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR OLD JOE AND HARMONY,--The baby is {{here and}} is the great American Giantess--weighing 7 3/4 pounds. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> a good long time for her, but she was full {{compensation}} when she did come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, we saw it; {{but there}} is an officer with a boat-load of sailors ashore from the King's ship at Harwich. He is {{spending}} the evening with the revenue captain here, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until the two men left in charge of the boat went up to join their comrades at the tavern. What have you got for us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's easy done, Mr. Montgomery," [...] {{said the}} fat-voiced publican. [...] "But before sayin' {{anything}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> and see whether, {{in a way}} of speakin', there was any need {{for us to say}} anything at all. Mr. Wilson thinks there is. Mr. Fawcett, who has the same right to his opinion, bein' also a backer and one o' the committee, thinks the other way." ...|$|E
5000|$|But {{the authors}} waffle here, saying [...] "Let's stick to [...] "algorithm" [...] and [...] "machine", {{and the reader}} is left, again, confused. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007 to get the {{following}} footnote comment: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{do make a}} fire, for {{we shall}} die of cold if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> long," [...] begged Gwen, rubbing Rita's cold hands, and looking anxiously at little Gus, who was about making up his mind to roar.|$|R
30|$|Sometimes, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{before the}} time for a {{particular}} idea arrives! May be the valorization of food waste is one such idea [27, 28]. Seaweed lipids constitute another renewable source of diverse compounds of nutritional value or with very interesting physiological effects [29].|$|R
60|$|The bus stopped again, {{and they}} trooped {{out into the}} hot sun. The priest scuffled round the corner this time. Not to go round the corner was no doubt harmful. We waited. A frown came between the bus Hamlet's brows. He looked nerve-worn and tired. It was about three o'clock. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for a man from a village, with the post. And he did not appear.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{thought it}} was that, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> nearly another hour afore the two came aboard, to make sure. There was a {{difference}} in the way they came aboard, too, from that of the mate. They didn’t make no noise, and the fust thing we knew of their coming aboard was seeing a bare, black foot waving feebly {{at the top of the}} fo’c’s’le ladder feelin’ for the step.|$|E
60|$|If we {{had been}} the pilots, we would have bumped that old steamer over the bar, somehow or other, long before the real pilot started her in; but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait.</b> When we did go in, and steamed along {{in front of the}} old fort, we could see that it was gray and crumbling, and moss-covered in places, and it was just like an oil-painting. The whole town, in fact, was like an oil-painting to us.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for the Artesian ray," [...] she said, [...] "we {{must try}} to carry out {{something}} else. People are watching us, talking of us, expecting something of us; we must give them something. Now the question is, what shall that be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll do {{the best}} I can to get a date," [...] Mr. Henslow said, grumblingly, [...] "but you fellows are always in such a hurry, and you don't {{understand}} that it don't go up here. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> our time month after month sometimes." ...|$|R
5000|$|We are {{witnessing}} {{the events of}} paramount significance. Two big leaders shook hands.(manifest reference to Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan). But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{for a long time}} before the Eighth One will come forth and sign a final peace agreement on Earth. Predicted by Baba Vanga in January 1988 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{for that}} it would be hopeless; but at the same time, as it must be evident to any {{individual}} of the meanest capacity that something or other for which troops will be required will have to be done, surely a month ought to be sufficient for the idea to occur to some one in authority {{that it would}} be as well not to be sending soldiers abroad until matters are finally settled." ...|$|E
6000|$|The little drums were {{instantly}} hushed, {{the procession}} {{turned to the}} right-about, {{and walked back to}} the altar again, the blown-out candle that had been on the near side of us before was now on the off side, the National Guards set down their muskets and began at their sandwiches again. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{an hour and a half}} at least before the great procession arrived. The guns without went on booming all the while at intervals, and as we heard each, the audience gave a kind of [...] "ahahah!" [...] such as you hear when the rockets go up at Vauxhall.|$|E
60|$|At this {{juncture}} I saw a tiny speck {{of a boat}} way out on the horizon. Captain Dan said it was Shorty's boat with Adams. I suggested that, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for wind to fly the kite, we run in and attract Shorty's attention. I certainly wanted some one else to see those magnificent schools of tuna. Forthwith we ran in several miles until we {{attracted the attention of}} the boatman Captain Dan had taken to be Shorty. But {{it turned out to be}} somebody else, and my good intentions also turned out to my misfortune.|$|E
60|$|SIR CHARLES. Don't mean that? Then <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for 'em.|$|R
6000|$|NICHOLLS (embarrassed). Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no {{official}} announcement {{or anything}} of that kind. It's all in the future. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait,</b> you know. (With a sentimental smile.) We've been sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of understood between us. (He laughs awkwardly.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{then you}} mustn't go. They might shoot {{you before you}} got away. Stay. If we hear them you can hide. I'll turn out the light. I'll meet them at the door. You can trust me. Wait till all quiets down, if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> till morning. Then you can slip out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. We {{spoke to}} no one until {{we got to the}} village, beyond asking a woman which was the turning from the main road. There didn't seem to be a soul about in the village, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> about some time before I could get hold of a boy to tell me which was the revenue officer's cottage. I left Hogan outside when I went in; but he saw no one, nor did any one speak to us on our return beyond one or two men we met passing the time of night, which Hogan answered." ...|$|E
60|$|Even this fluent {{discharge}} of Italian {{did not bring}} the soap at once, {{but there was a}} good reason for it. There was not such an article about the establishment. It is my belief that there never had been. They had to send far up town, and to several different places before they finally got it, so they said. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> twenty or thirty minutes. The same thing had occurred the evening before, at the hotel. I think I have divined the reason for this state of things at last. The English know how to travel comfortably, and they carry soap with them; other foreigners do not use the article.|$|E
60|$|The {{roads were}} very heavy for the horses, but the pathway was {{generally}} good, so we alighted {{and walked up}} all the hills, and liked it so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground {{when we got to}} the top. At Barnet there were other horses waiting for us, but as they had only just been fed, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for them too, and got a long fresh walk over a common and an old battle-field before the carriage came up. These delays so protracted the journey that the short day was spent and the long night had closed in before we came to St. Albans, near to which town Bleak House was, we knew.|$|E
50|$|The {{exponential}} distribution is popular, for example, in queuing theory {{when we want}} to model the time <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until a certain event takes place. Examples include the time until the next client enters the store, the time until a certain company defaults or the time until some machine has a defect.|$|R
6000|$|... "It can't be done, sir!" [...] the man groaned. [...] "There isn't a car {{ever built}} {{could get through}} that. See, it's nearly {{up to the top}} of those posts. I must put her in the reverse and get back, even if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> on the higher part of the road for a boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Then you mustn't go. They might {{shoot you}} before you got away. Stay. If we hear them you can hide under my bed. I'll turn out the light. I'll meet them at the door. You can trust me. Stay, Russ. Wait till all quiets down, if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> till morning. Then you can slip out." ...|$|R
