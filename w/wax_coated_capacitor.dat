40|$|Mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruit has a {{relatively}} short storage life due to perishable nature. In order to increases the storage life of ‘langra’ mangoes, fruits were <b>coated</b> with sunflower <b>wax.</b> Mangoes were stored at room and refrigerated temperature. Sunflower <b>wax</b> <b>coating</b> protects the mangoes in greater proportion to change their color, weight loss, moisture loss, pH and total soluble solids content. The sensorial panel also favors the grander role of sunflower <b>wax</b> <b>coating.</b> Application of sunflower wax coatings {{had no effect on}} vitamin ‘C’ content of mangoes variety and could increases mango storage time around 30 days under regular storage conditions. Sunflower <b>wax</b> <b>coating</b> also inhibited the growth of micro-organisms.

Amrita sagar was carried out at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur during September 1997 to January 1998. The five materials viz., CaCl 2 @ 1 %, waxol, Benlate 500 ppm, surfactant (Jet powder) @ 6 %, thickener (corn starch) @ 6 % and their combinations were considered as coating materials. The longest shelf life was found in <b>wax</b> <b>coated</b> fruits (21 days) with the lowest weight loss per finger (6. 89 %) while the shortest shelf life was recorded in Benlate treated fruits (9. 33 days). The highest weight loss was obtained in CaCl 2 treated fruits (25. 07 %). The highest percentage of total sugars was recorded in control fruits (21. 63) and the lowest in <b>wax</b> <b>coated</b> fruits (18. 8) at full ripe condition.

40|$|In rain-fed {{agricultural}} regions, limited {{rainfall and}} frequent unpredictable droughts {{have resulted in}} low and variable wheat yields. Balanced water use between root water-uptake and remaining soil moisture is a key factor for drought adaptation. Thirteen recombinant inbred lines selected from a backcross population of synthetic-derived bread wheat were examined for the association among root water-uptake ability, grain yield and root elongation under limited water conditions using pot and field experiments. The effect of <b>wax</b> <b>coating</b> on grain formation under soil desiccation was also studied in two selected genotypes. There were significant variations in both root water-uptake ability estimated in pot experiments and grain yield obtained in field experiments among wheat genotypes. Infrared thermography indicated that canopy temperature {{was related to the}} leaf transpiration due to root water-uptake. A significant negative correlation was found between root water-uptake ability and grain weight, suggesting that lower root water-uptake ability was associated with higher grain weight. Genotype SYN- 10 had the lowest water-uptake ability and the highest grain weight, indicating a type of ‘water-saving wheat’. <b>Wax</b> <b>coating</b> significantly reduced root water-uptake in wheat genotypes SYN- 8 and SYN- 10. Infrared thermography showed an increased leaf temperature due to the transpiration-suppression effect of the <b>wax</b> <b>coating.</b> Reductions in grain yield due to soil desiccation were found in SYN- 8, but not in SYN- 10. The higher grain yield of SYN- 10 was attributed to more grains under soil desiccation. Grain yield of SYN- 10 was decreased by the <b>wax</b> <b>coating</b> under soil desiccation. Dehydration tolerance of SYN- 10 might be associated with the transpiration process of the leaves...|$|R
