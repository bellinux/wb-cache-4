40|$|This survey may {{be opened}} with some apologetic remarks. The {{first is that}} to write a {{complete}} survey would mean to write a book.

Therefore, this survey is, in principle, incomplete, as <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> <b>seen</b> by the many important authors whose work is not here discussed. The second remark is that a survey like this is, of necessity, one-sided and restricted. It is one-sided by reason of the special view of the writer on what is interesting and what is not; as, for example,this survey shows special interest in quantitative problems. It is restricted {{as a consequence of the}} fact that knowledge of nearly every individual about subjects more removed is less than about subjects in his direct neighborhood-both in a concrete and an abstract sense.

60|$|Notwithstanding {{the object}} of their {{expedition}} was of a public nature, the feelings which had induced both Griffith and Barnstable to accompany the Pilot with so much willingness, it <b>will</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> were entirely personal. The short intercourse that he had maintained with his associates enabled the mysterious leader of their party to understand the characters of his two principal officers so thoroughly, as to induce him, when he landed, {{with the purpose of}} reconnoitering to ascertain whether the objects of his pursuit still held their determination to assemble at the appointed hour, to choose Griffith and Manual as his only associates, leaving Barnstable in command of his own vessel, to await their return, and to cover their retreat. A good deal of argument, and some little of the authority of his superior officer, was necessary to make Barnstable quietly acquiesce in this arrangement; but as his good sense told him that nothing should be unnecessarily hazarded, until the moment to strike the final blow had arrived, he became gradually more resigned; taking care, however, to caution Griffith to reconnoiter the abbey while his companion was reconnoitering ---- house. It was the strong desire of Griffith to comply with this injunction, which carried them a little out of their proper path, and led to the consequences that we have partly related. The evening of that day was the time when the Pilot intended to complete his enterprise, thinking to entrap his game while enjoying the festivities that usually succeed their sports; and an early hour in the morning was appointed, when Barnstable should appear at the nearest point to the abbey, to take off his countrymen, in order that they might be as little as possible subjected to the gaze of their enemies by daylight. If they failed to arrive at the appointed time, his instructions were to return to his schooner, which lay snugly embayed in a secret and retired haven, that but few ever approached, either by land or water.|$|E
5000|$|A 1903 {{article in}} Railway Magazine noted:We cannot regard Lowther Railway Station, on the London and North-Western line, as {{absolutely}} a private station, but the Earl of Lonsdale, {{who is the}} great territorial feudal lord of the district of Cumberland that stretches about Penrith and Askham, has a private agreement with the railway authorities in virtue of which, for certain concessions made with regard to building the station, the land it stands on, etc., he, his family, and guests {{have the right to}} have any train stopped at any required times at Lowther Station, whether such trains are expresses or not, and whether they may be timed to stop near or far from Lowther Station.It <b>will</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> therefore, that, such a [...] "right" [...] is tantamount in many ways to owning a private railway station, with the additional advantage that somebody else keeps up the maintenance of the place! Yet [...] "Clifton and Lowther Station" [...] is open to the public, and so is not absolutely a [...] "private" [...] station.The Earl and his family often exercise their right, and the German Emperor, when visiting his friend Lord Lonsdale, has more than once also availed himself of the privilege of detraining at Lowther.

Lord Lonsdale, moreover, is a landlord and nobleman of the old type, who does everything pertaining to his station and duties as a [...] "grand seigneur" [...] in a way above all criticism and cavil.

6000|$|The {{two points}} in that pamphlet, {{which it is}} said the {{prosecutors}} intend chiefly to fix on, are, First, where the author mentions the [...] "penner of the King's answer."

5|$|From {{early in}} its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole's gills and front legs. The lungs soon start {{to develop and}} are used as an {{accessory}} breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, {{but the number of}} rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification. In the Pipidae, with the exception of Hymenochirus, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small catfish. Their tails are stiffened by a notochord, but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and tip <b>is</b> fragile and <b>will</b> <b>easily</b> tear, which <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail.|$|R

40|$|Introduction I begin my tale {{with the}} moral: a {{quotation}} from the greatest English grammarian, Otto Jespersen (1965). The essence of language is human activity [...] {{activity on the}} part of one individual to make himself understood by another, and activity {{on the part of}} that other to understand what was {{in the mind of the}} first. These two individuals, the producer and the recipient of language, or as we may more conveniently call them, the speaker and the hearer, and their relations to one another, should never be lost sight of if we want to under- stand the nature of language and of that part of language which is dealt with in grammar. But in former times this was often overlooked, and words and forms'were often treated as if they were things or natural objects with an existence of their own [...] a conception which may have been to a great extent fostered through a too exclusive preoccupation with written or printed words, but which is funda- mentally false, as <b>will</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> with a...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{a number}} of {{problems}} of mathematical physics and other fields stochastic differential equations are used to model certain phenomena. Often the solution of those problems can be obtained as a functional of the solution of some specific stochastic differential equation.

We analyze some complexity issues for a class of linear stochastic differential equations (Langevin type), which can be given by dXt = −αXtdt + β(t) dWt, X 0 : = 0, where α> 0 andβ:[0,T] → R. It turns out that for a class of input data which are not more than Lipschitz continuous the explicit Euler scheme gives rise to an optimal (by order) numerical method. Then we study numerical phenomena which occur when switching from (real) Monte Carlo simulation to quasi–Monte Carlo simulation, which is the case when we carry out the simulation on computers.

60|$|It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> <b>seen,</b> {{that the}} getting of the Abraham {{into the water}} was an affair of {{a good deal of}} delicacy, under the circumstances. The strait between the Peak and Cape South was thirty miles wide, and it was twenty more to the crater. Thus the party at work on the vessel would be fully fifty miles from the main abodes of the colony, and thrown quite out of the affair should another {{invasion}} be attempted. As for bringing the Neshamony, the Dido, the Bridget, and the fighter, into the combat, everybody was of opinion it would be risking too much. It is true, one of the swivels was mounted on the former, and might be of service, but the natives had got to be too familiar with fire-arms to render it prudent to rely on the potency of a single swivel, in a conflict against a force so numerous, and one led by a spirit as determined as that of Waally's was known to be. All idea of righting at sea, therefore, until the schooner was launched, was out of the question, and every energy was turned to effect the latter most important object. A separation of the forces of the colony was inevitable, in the meanwhile; and reliance must be placed on the protection of Providence, for keeping the enemy aloof until the vessel was ready for active service.|$|R
40|$|Everyday, we make {{difficult}} choices under uncertainties. The {{decision making process}} becomes even more complicated when more agents get involved: one must consider their interactions and conflicts of interest because the final outcome is based not only on an agent 2 ̆ 7 s decision but on everybody 2 ̆ 7 s. In insurance industry, companies try to avoid making large claim payments to policyholders (commonly known as insureds) by purchasing reinsurance policies from reinsurance companies (the reinsurer). Each policy details conditions upon which the reinsurer pays {{a share of the}} claim to the insurance company (also known as the cedent or the insurer). To reach an agreement, the interests of both parties must be taken into consideration. In this thesis, we will discuss approaches for constructing optimal reinsurance policies that are beneficial to both the insurer and the reinsurer. Likewise, we have similar situations in real estate industry, where sellers and buyers negotiate contracts. For example, the difference between the seller 2 ̆ 7 s selling price and the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s budget (commonly referred to as the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s reservation price) affects the intensity of buyer arrivals, the bargaining process and its rate of success, as well as many other parameters. We will explore the likelihood of the buyer purchasing a property given factors such as the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s reservation price and the negotiated selling prices, {{which may or may not}} be dependent random variables. Of course, these are just two illustrative scenarios that make our results more intuitive and better appreciated from the practical point of view, which has been a very important consideration throughout the thesis. Furthermore, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> <b>seen</b> when reading the thesis that our developed and discussed methodologies can be adapted to numerous other scenarios, which may in turn require making certain adjustments to our results. Nevertheless, we are confident that the herein developed considerations are very general in nature and can already be used to facilitate decision making...|$|R
40|$|We re-estimate {{the decay}} {{branching}} ratio of Bs → 2 γ through D + s D − s and D∗+ s D∗ − s intermediate states, in the effective Lagrangian approach. We {{find that the}} branching ratio does not exceed a few times 10 − 7, contrary to the result recently claimed in the literature. PACS numbers: 13. 25. Hw Typeset using REVTEX 1 The Bs → γγ decay is an intereting process which has been investigated by several groups [1 – 3] {{within the context of}} pQCD. The branching ratio was found to be BR(Bs → γγ) ∼ 3. 8 × 10 − 7 for mt ≃ 175 GeV, to be compared with the present experimental upper limit BR(Bs → γγ) < 1. 48 × 10 − 4 [4]. It was also pointed out that the branching ratio can be substantially enhanced in some extensions of the standard model such as a generic 2 -Higgs doublet model [5]. Provide that the short distance contribution is not large [6, 5, 7], one may then hope the observation of such channel in future experiments as a signal of physics beyond standard model. However, as have been emphasized by Choudhury and Ellis [8], a careful analysis to the long distance effects has to be made before one could use this channel as a probe to the physics beyond the standard model. Choudhury and Ellis have considered the contributions due to intermediate Ds and D ∗ s states via the diagrams including loops of Ds mesons alone, loops of D ∗ s mesons alone (see fig. 1), and diagrams involving radiative D ∗ s → Ds + γ transitions. Based upon an estimation on the absorptive part of the amplitude they find that the contribution due to Ds alone is, Br(Bs → 2 Ds → γγ) ∼ 2. 9 × 10 − 8, (1) which is insignificant as comparing with the pQCD short distance contribution. Diagrams involving the D ∗ s → Dsγ transition are again found to be small. However they find that the contribution due to D ∗ s is much larger, Br(Bs → 2 D ∗ s → γγ) ∼ 6. 5 × 10 − 6, (2) which, if correct, is of great phenomenological interets as it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> <b>seen</b> in future hadron colliders.

40|$|The Deconstruction of the Cartesian Dichotomy of Black and Whitein William Blake’s The Little Black Boy Abstract This paper {{discusses}} English Romantic Poet William Blake’s anti-racial {{views in}} his poem The Little Black Boy. In so doing, it focuses upon how Blake attempts to deconstruct the Cartesian dichotomy of Western world view, a dichotomy which has usually {{been based on}} “the theory that the universe has been ruled from its origins by two conflicting powers, one good and one evil, both existing as equally ultimate first causes. ” In this binary and hierarchal relationship, there are two essential terms in which one term is absolutely regarded as primary or fundamental in its essence, whereas the other term is considered secondary or something that lacks originality and presence. Once this equation {{is applied to the}} relationship between black and white people, it <b>will</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in the Western world that white people are always primary or fundamental to black-skinned people, and thus the perception behind this binary and hierarchal relationship seems the root of all the racial problems between black and white. This paper argues that Blake strives to deconstruct radically in The Little Black Boy the basis of this binary and hierarchal relationship which has been carried out for centuries in the Western world to segregate and then control the lives of black people. Finally, the paper maintains that Blake also shows a strong aspiration for creating an egalitarian society free of discrimination and injustices at a time when anti-slavery campaigns hit the top on both sides of Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|Marulić is a many-sided {{cultural}} figure, {{of exceptional}} richness and complexity. He can be approached from several points of view, and his works {{can be divided}} into various genres and sub-genres, circles and areas. However, irrespective of the genre, area or theme concerned, his personal style <b>will</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> In most of his oeuvre this is essentially determined by literary creation and moral and theological commitment. He consciously builds upon an aesthetic and ethical unity, so that both poet and moralist speak in him, writer and theologian. It is this that the paper is concerned with. At the centre is a basic thesis about the binary principle in the poetics of Marulić: the poetic and the ethic. Marulić, says the author, used this in both poetry and prose. His inspirations are different, but the motivation is always the same - moral and didactic. Thanks to this, all of his works, if one excludes certain minor forms, are essentially marked by both components - naturally, the poetic more by the poetic, the discursive more by the moral and theological. To support these claims, a comparative analysis is made of Marulić’s genetic procedure and stylistic means in both genres, prose and verse, in which he shows a creative collaboration of both the components. This style is thus called the poetic-didactic. Its essential features are: 1, an artistic structure and a rich metaphorical layer; 2, poetic relief and thoroughgoing ethical commitment; 2, dialogical fiction, an imaginary conversation between the poet and the reader, and suggestiveness leading the poet intentionally to choose material and cumulative presentation for the purpose of poetic and didactic effect. From this point of view it is concluded that Marulić’s creative act, if one wishes to approach him integrally, cannot be looked at only from a poetic and artistic point of view, through an ordinary stylistic analysis of his philological means, but also from the poetic-didactic, through the psycho-genetic structuring of the united aesthetic and ethical inspirations and intentions that have both been involved in the act of creation...|$|E
