40|$|Extending Turkish {{traditional}} arts {{into next}} generations is quite important in ensuring {{the sustainability of}} our visual culture. Therefore; {{it is necessary to}} integrate this extension in visual arts education as well. This study specifically deals with “marbling”,one of the traditional arts in Turkish culture. Marbling art used to be applied especially on the covers of old books and to linebook bindings. It can be defined as making some patterns on thickened water by using soil and dry paints. In other words, wateris condensed with a special substance, and then paints that are insoluble in water are sprayed on the surface of water and finallythe patterns on the water surface are transferred onto a sheet of paper. As a paper decoration art, marbling is acquired through master-apprentice circle similar to all Ottoman arts and quite prone tobe affected by many factors that are not controlled by craftsmen. Although some resources state that the word Ebru (marbling) comes from the word “ab-ı ru”, which means “water for face” or from the word “ebre” which means “patterned paper or cloth”in Çagatay language, a Middle Asian language, the mostly agreed opinion is that the origin of the word Ebru is the word “ebri”which means “cloud-like, or losing its importance and even being a dead art. cloudy” in Persian language. Despite the fact thatmarbling is one of our traditional arts used in many decorations in the past, today there is still a risk ofThe aim of the study is to introduce “marbling” art to primary school students and to increase awareness of our visual cultureby preserving traditional and aesthetical values through the use of this art in different daily objects. In order to obtain students’opinions regarding marbling application, the students were asked to answer the following questions:What did you feel while working on the marbling application?In your opinion, {{what is the difference between}} marbling and other similarapplications (drawing by using crayons and aquarelle) ?<b>Where</b> <b>else</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> use “marbling?”Would you like to continue doing this art in the future?In this study, fifth year students in primary schools (11 years old) were given information about marbling and given theopportunity to explore this art through practical applications without being forced to use all the complex technical features ofmarbling. Later, they were asked to use their products on some objects they use daily, such as bookmarks, photo frames, pencilbox etc. and, at the end of the application, semi-structured interviews were made to learn about their opinions regarding theapplication. Finally, the findings gathered from the interviews and documentation analysis were presented as frequency distributions. The audio recorded interviews were transcribed by the researcher and transcription codes were prepared for eachstudent interviewed based on the interview questions and the answers. This descriptive study uses qualitative research method in data collection, analysis and interpretations phases. Purposefulsampling method was used to determine the school where the study was conducted. The basic idea behind sampling method, atype of purposeful sampling, is to study all the conditions that meet a pre-determined criterion. Here, the criteria determined bythe researcher can be used as well as a pre-determined criterion. The subjects of this study were 25 students attending fifth gradeclass in Private Cagdas Primary School located in Eskisehir. The majority of the students participating in the study considered the practice “a very nice work”, “like a game” and “fun”. Similarly, almost half of the students stated that the work was “different” and “unbelievable”. Some students said that they feltthat paints are floating on water surface. A few students mentioned that “it is like a magic”, one student “I felt that I didsomething special for the first time in my life” and another student “ I felt that I painted on the water”. As for the difference ofmarbling from other arts, most students stated: “not being able to control the spread of paints” and “intermingling of colors”. Half of the students mentioned they completed the work in a very short time compared to other art practices. Majority of thestudents pointed out they can use marbling on many daily objects such as picture frames, bookmarks, and plastic bags and otherobjects such as notebook covers, t-shirts, earrings, necklaces, different cloths and in kite making. In addition, all students statedthat they wanted to make marbling again. In this study, the students made 23 bookmarks, 13 photo frames, 2 pencil boxes, and 3 paper bags. Two of the studentswanted to hang their works on the wall of their rooms, therefore; they did not give these works a daily object function. Afterfinishing their works, they were interviewed to have their opinions regarding this activity. Almost all of the students stated thatthey knew this marbling art but have never applied it in their lives. All of the students told that they liked marbling and did thisactivity like a game and they found the colour diffusions amazing. Although related literature suggests that marbling is a demanding and challenging art, it can be integrated into primary schoolcurriculum by using ready-made paints and kitre (a gum like substance) and by considering certain limitations such as the classhours and physical conditions. In addition, this art can be presented as a fun game activity without forcing students to applychallenging techniques. Such attempts might make it possible to transfer our traditional arts to next generations. In conclusion, most of the students participated in this activity in a way appropriate to its purposes and meaning. They wereintroduced to this traditional Turkish art by using a different way of presentation and by giving credit to traditional and aestheticvalues...|$|E
