5|$|As {{early as}} 1857 the Beetons had {{considered}} using the magazine columns {{as the basis}} of a book of collected recipes and homecare advice, Hughes believes, and in November 1859 they launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements with The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine.

5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch.

5|$|Further {{experiments}} in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 at Berkeley demonstrated an actinide chemistry {{for the new}} element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide. In 1970, the Dubna group reported the synthesis of 255103 with half-life 20s and alpha decay energy 8.38MeV. However, {{it was not until}} 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed a <b>whole</b> <b>series</b> of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260, that all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed, apart from the Berkeley's group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of the probably correct 258103. All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of X-rays emitted from 258103 were measured.|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} an {{investigation}} of whether analysing subsets of time series gene expression data can give additional information about putatively co-regulated genes, compared to only using the <b>whole</b> time <b>series.</b> The original gene expression data set was partitioned into subsets and similarity was computed for both the <b>whole</b> timed <b>series</b> and subsets. Pearson correlation was used as similarity measure between gene expression profiles. The results indicate that analysing co-expression in subsets of gene expression data derives true-positive connections, with respect to co-regulation, that are not detected by only using the <b>whole</b> time <b>series</b> data. Unfortunately, with the actual data set, chosen similarity measure and partitioning of the data, randomly generated connections have {{the same amount of}} true-positives as the ones derived by the applied analysis. However, it is worth to continue further analysis of the subsets of gene expression data, which is based on the multi-factorial nature of gene regulation. E. g. other similarity measures, data sets and ways of partitioning the data set should be tried...|$|R
