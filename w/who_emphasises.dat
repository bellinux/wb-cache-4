5000|$|The word salakapurusa {{is often}} {{translated}} as illustrious persons or worthy persons or mighty persons. It {{is derived from}} the Sanskrit compound of words salaka and purusa. [...] "Purusa" [...] means person, but [...] "salaka" [...] is of ambiguous etymology in this context. The primary meaning of the word salaka (Sanskrit: Śalākā, Pali: salākā, Prakrit: salāgā, salāyā) is [...] "stick". In the Buddhist context it meant a ticket consisting of wooden sticks meant for voting or to distribute food; but in Jain context it was used to mean a stick and also a measurement and when combined with [...] "purusa" [...] to denote great heroes. According to 11th century Jain author, monk Acharya Hemachandra, these persons are called salaka as they have been specially marked among men. This emphasised that the names of the salakapurusas were underlined or specially significant due to their deeds. John Cort also quotes another author, S. D. Parekh, <b>who</b> <b>emphasises</b> the root meaning of voting sticks and concludes that a salakapurusa is a great person, as his greatness has been accepted by general public. Certain Śvētāmbara texts use the word Baladeva, Vāsudeva and Prativasudeva to refer Balabhadra, Narayana and Pratinarayana respectively. A 1975 treatise, detailing Mahavira's life and doctrine seems to imply the voting-etymology of the word, i.e. they are called salakapurusa, because they are men-that-count.|$|E

The research presented in this teaching brief involves the use of the MIT Beer Game. The research involves data collected in three stages: pre-game; post game and post game analysis. The data collected from participants indicates that the substantive stage of learning is during the post game analysis. The data indicates that understanding improves marginally upon completion of the game but that the post-game analysis provides a signifi cant improvement in the understanding of learners. In line with Jackson and Taylor (1998) the authors found the Beer Game to be a very effective experiential exercise for management students and that a competent instructor who acknowledges the three stages of learning proposed in this paper and <b>who</b> <b>emphasises</b> the learning value of the post game analysis will improve the participants understanding of supply chain dynamics.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{two issues}} related to the sociological idea of community in theoretical and practical contexts, in order to discover the reason behind declining urban community. First, it will reflect on what community actually means, referring to and comparing the understanding of Tönnies <b>who</b> <b>emphasises</b> particularity and MacIver whose understanding implies openness. Partly employing the latter, the author then identifies three key elements of community: namely common purposes and objectives; accumulation of shared activities and experiences; and a sense of belonging, {{in the context of a}} locality where regular and collective community practice and activities are possible. Second the paper explores the issue of declining contemporary urban community. Based on the theoretical understanding of community, and considering primary and secondary data which the author has collected, it will examine an actual case of urban community building efforts of Shiroishi Ward in Sapporo, Japan. It will point out that community's openness to the individual is not sufficiently addressed in community building practice in the area while institutional networking and co-operation, which essentially implies boundaries around it, is encouraged. A confusion of community’s particularity and openness can commonly be seen in theory and in practice. The paper concludes by arguing that this is the major factor of the declining sense of contemporary urban community...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{dimensions}} of supply chain collaboration and examine its impact on firm performance and its mediating variables. Methodology: A theoretical model was developed from a systematic review of relevant literature and theories. This was then revised by academics and practitioners. The model was empirically tested with survey data of 853 responses of tourism firms in Thailand using Structural Equation Modeling. Findings: Results indicate that supply chain collaboration improves firm performance. This impact is mediated by trust, commitment, transaction costs and sustained competitive advantage. A multiple group analysis supports the research model across four groups, however {{there are differences in}} the coefficients in some of the paths. In goodsbased transactions suppliers emphasises on collaboration to build relationships and to reduce transaction costs through developing commitment, while buyers focus on trust building. In the service-based transactions, service providers also tend to focus on trust as a key factor than service intermediaries <b>who</b> <b>emphasises</b> on developing commitment. Theoretical contribution: This thesis synthesised six theories to explain how supply chain collaboration affects firm performance. The constructs of supply chain collaboration and transaction costs are also improved. Managerial insight: The results inform managers about how different types of supply chain collaboration can improve the performance of their organisations. It also emphases the different mechanisms (i. e., trust and commitment) in supply chain relationships between goods-based and service-based transactions.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate how managers define career success for themselves. It seeks to discover what differences there are in the way that women and men, and older and younger managers, see their own career success. It fills an identifiable gap in the literature on career success, in that it examines the subject {{from the point of view}} of the individual, not the organisation. In doing so, it responds to calls for work in this area, especially the development of "orientational categories" which classify peoples' attitudes to careers according to their individual predispositions (Bailyn 1989). The research, which took place in BT, uses qualitative methods, in particular in-depth interviewing, to elicit managers' own definitions of career success. Using techniques of qualitative data analysis and with the help of NUD. IST computer software, it develops a typology of managerial career success, which shows that managers view their own career success in one of four ways: as a Climber, <b>who</b> <b>emphasises</b> hierarchical position, pay and enjoyment in their definition of success; as an Expert, who sees success as being good at what they do and getting personal recognition for this; as an Influencer, who defines career success primarily as organisational influence; and as a Self-Realiser, who judges their own career success by achievement at a very personal level. Women managers, who generally base their definitions of career success on internal and intangible criteria, are more likely to be Experts and Self-Realisers; men, who tend to base their ideas of success on external criteria are more likely to be Climbers and Influencers. Younger managers, especially men, are most likely to be Climbers, and older managers, Influencers who often see their own success in terms of achieving something at work by which they will be remembered...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this study is: The logic of faith: prayer as the link between {{rationality}} and experience {{in a study of}} Karl Rahner and John Calvin. The term ‘logic of faith’ refers to the correct way of reasoning about faith. Why do a study about the theology of Rahner? Firstly because Rahner is known as the theologian <b>who</b> <b>emphasises</b> a unity between theology and spirituality. In exploring Rahner’s theology, the question that does arise is: is Rahner a philosopher or a theologian? Rahner endeavours to question the logic of theology. In his philosophical, theological and spiritual works one discovers the ‘heart’ of modern man. Rahner connects the logic of faith with the everyday experience of man. This experience is his point of departure in presenting the case for Christianity. In relation to this, Rahner sees prayer as a common human experience and the key in discovering the unity between rationality and experience. Prayer implies experiencing God in ordinary everyday life. Through prayer the lost unity between God and man is restored. Although Rahner’s definition of experience may be vague and therefore subject to criticism, he gives a positive interpretation of the concept of experience in the sense of acceptance of the ‘self’. To him, the logic of faith is closely related to the acceptance of the ‘self’. Rahner’s view give rise to the following question: Does the truth of a theological statement present itself in experience or in faith only? This question is also put to the reformed tradition of which Calvin is a representative. Both Rahner and Calvin stress the unity between theology and spirituality. Knowing God and understanding man are inseparable concepts. Yet we a find an emphasis in Calvin’s theology, that we do not see in Rahner’s theology. Calvin accepts, unconditionally, the revelation of God in Jesus Christ as the source of faith. True understanding of human nature is dependant on God’s revelation in Scripture. To Calvin, the logic of faith goes against common human experience and rationality. We ask the question about the logic of faith; prayer directs us to the source of the answer: the Word of God. This is the truth that the reformers rediscovered. The logic of faith implies a living relationship with Jesus Christ through His Word and Spirit and prayer is the main exercise of this relationship. In this sense prayer is the Urakt of Christian ethics, the first step in becoming a disciple. This we see in Calvin’s exegesis of the Lord’s Prayer. The logic of faith and therefore faith itself become mysticism without God’s revelation through Scripture. This study concludes that prayer is a neglected theme in the reformed tradition. Rahner and Calvin give us a new appreciation for the logic of faith and prayer as an integral part thereof. Thesis (DD (Dogmatics and Christian Ethics)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Yes, Premier: Labor Leadership in Australia’s States and Territories {{edited by}} John Wanna and Paul Williams UNSW Press, May 2005, 276 pp, $ 39. 95 Reviewed by Paul Rodan PUBLISHED {{at a time}} of the {{historic}} simultaneous dominance of all state and territory governments by the Labor Party, this is a useful and readable addition to the literature on Australian state politics. The editors have been well-served by recent elections which resulted in the return of the Gallop and Martin governments, ensuring that the dramatis personae remain current. At the personal level, the premiers/chief ministers split fifty/fifty in terms of background. Half had ‘real’ jobs before entering politics and half have effectively been in union and party politics all their working lives. All (if one counts Bacon in Tasmania, not Lennon - the chapter deals with both) had to win government from opposition, most were at long odds to achieve it and several only did so by means of astute negotiations with largely conservative independents. The need to negotiate is reflective of a wider trend among the leaders. Quite simply, a consultative, non-macho, consensus style has become virtually mandatory for state leaders and woe betide anyone who veers {{in the direction of the}} dreaded ‘a’ word - arrogance. This, in fact, may be one of Jeff Kennett’s enduring contributions to state politics. In their chapter on Victoria’s Steve Bracks, Brian Costar and David Hayward leave us in little doubt about Kennett’s unsuitable personality type when it came to (unsuccessfully) negotiating minority government in 1999. The exception to this generalisation is Lennon, the only leader not to have secured office through election. The McCall/Hay chapter (which deals with Bacon and Lennon) is certainly no hagiography and the newest premier seems far removed from consensus, consultation and the various ‘soft’ skills. He emerges as the most electorally vulnerable, but it may be possible that the Tasmanians, having experienced more of the problems of ‘negotiating for government’ than most, will adjust to a brutal, ‘take no prisoners’ approach. Time will tell. Each chapter follows a consistent structure, the editors having done a good job in this regard. It is no reflection on the authors to observe that, to some extent, there is a sameness in what is revealed in each state and territory. Party takes power narrowly in the first instance; the leader is a moderate <b>who</b> <b>emphasises</b> caution and consultation with a heavy emphasis on financial and budgetary prudence; the leader is front person with minimal exposure for other ministers; poor-performing ministers are hidden rather than sacked; the opposition is hopeless; the government is returned with large majority at next election. A key theme of the chapters is that of populism, and in contrast with its usage by intellectually sloppy journalists, the authors in this volume actually know what it means, focusing on the non-elite, ‘in touch with ordinary people’ qualities of the state and territory Labor leaders. To some extent, ‘we are all populists now’: certainly the age of the patrician seems gone. Ours is now the democracy of talkback radio and reality TV. But the editors suggest that these leaders are not mere puppets of public opinion: they use sophisticated media techniques to lead and mould, and they know the limits. I would observe that even those who bring formidable intellects to the political battlefield (Carr and Gallop) do so without apparent political cost, despite the dumbed-down efforts of some of their opponents. One is left wondering why, in the midst of all this success, Labor remains so hopeless federally. Perhaps the answer partly lies in my suspicion, having read this book, that none of these state leaders could necessarily make the transition to the national stage, although Mark Latham’s ringing endorsement of three of them suggests some potential. Each is more than capable in his or her own backyard, but would face obvious difficulties in trying to assemble a national majority of voting support. Obviously, Labor’s problems federally go deeper and further than leadership, but that’s another story. • Paul Rodan is a senior honorary research fellow in the School of Political and Social Inquiry at Monash Universit...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to outline {{a framework for}} understanding implications of the musical devices used by composers in the opening and closing moments of electroacoustic music, with a particular focus on acousmatic music. The beginning-middle-end paradigm exerts a strong influence on the way practitioners and listeners formulate frameworks for the creation and reception of Western music (Agawu, 1991), as does {{the concept of the}} narrative curve (Childs, 1977). Thus openings and closings are particularly telling parts of musical structure. They are significant aspects of a work’s rhetorical character, often embodying much of the way music functions at levels of phrase and more extended sectional boundaries. They are also elements of a work that frequently differentiate the formulaic from the genuinely innovative and inventive. It is self- evident that openings establish a frame for the types of materials employed in a work, as well as establishing a relational and temporal architecture between them. The opening of a work inevitably influences the way listeners form expectations around the experience of a piece and interpret the ongoing nature of a musical design. Closure is considered here fundamentally problematic in musical structures that are not organised around the kind of perceptibly hierarchical syntax that is projected in tonal music. Focus on the transformation of sonic material, rich noise textures that pose segmentation problems and direct use of natural environmental sound tends to place electroacoustic music in this ‘difficult’ category. A distinction made by Meyer (1996) is used here to characterise the problematic nature of electroacoustic music’s materials, namely that of primary and secondary musical parameters. Primary parameters are those capable of being segmented into ‘perceptually proportional’ steps, with relationships between them shaped by ‘syntactic constraints’ enabling a set of tangible hierarchic value relationships to emerge between them. The psychologically complex consequences of discrete pitch steps used to evoke a tonal centre (definitively or ambiguously) and metrical rhythmic formations are core examples of the musical efficacy of primary parameters. Secondary parameters are those that cannot be separated definitively into proportional values, nominally: tempo, dynamics, and timbre (Meyer uses the term ‘sonority’) and are apt to function through relative increases and decreases in quantity or alterations in character, rather than a relational syntax. The polarised textural and behavioural sonic continua proposed by Smalley (1997) exemplify ways in which electroacoustic composers, and many spectrally or sound-object oriented instrumental composers, have dealt with the problem of creating a coherent basis for meaningful distinctions and oppositions between materials at this secondary level. For instance, in terms of spectral types, following the more detailed model of Schaeffer (1966), Smalley’s continuum of note-to-noise represents a theoretically summary of a sense of both the psychological distance between these notional sound states and the potential for grasping an uninterrupted sense of parametric coherence between them. That is to say, in a musical work, we need to be attuned or acculturated to the notion of such a continuum in order to gain meaning (such as tension/relaxation or goal states) from stages and states of progression or play within it. A supporting perspective is that of Snyder (2000 : 201), <b>who</b> <b>emphasises</b> a culturally relativist perspective for all cases, in that within a particular cultural frame ‘the meaning of learned syntactical patterns must constantly be maintained by repetition or it will be lost, both on the immediate and historical time scales. ’ But despite it being aurally verifiable that Smalley and Schaeffer’s nodal states of spectral definition and density are perceptually relevant, {{and despite the fact that}} in certain circumstances we might reasonably regard a focal pitch as a kind of goal state, movement through the continuum cannot be generically quantised, and therefore the sense of a definitive point of arrival (viz. closure) will tend to be tenuous. A similar critique can be posited for a continuum between sonic abstraction and realism, again a frequently summoned compositional strategy in acousmatic music. Assuming the absence of a culturally embedded syntactical scheme for electroacoustic music, it is hypothesised here that a generalised model for analysing the implications of ‘opening’ within this multi-faceted genre is that of entering a ‘space’. Space is used here as a metaphor for the volumes, distances and material associations that a listener might infer from the nature of the sounds and the timing and style of their presentation. A set of interrelated criteria, derived from extensive comparative listening, is proposed for evaluating the rhetorical and behavioural implications of the way a composed space is presented at the outset of a piece. In the spirit of an ecological context for musical understanding (as elaborated in Clarke, 2005) this is underpinned by a fundamental notion of low-level structural inference: that the opening of a work allows the listener to witness a spatial construct that is either: (1) already formed, or (2) in the process of forming. These are regarded here as structural primitives. In a formed setting a confluence of contextual information provides a sufficiently stable sense of spatial/material identity that the listener can comprehend as a coherent scene. This need not be naturalistic, but may be a complex amalgam of divergent material sources: such as in the opening of Federico Schumacher Ratti’s El Espejo de Alicia and many works of, or influenced by, a soundscape approach. Forming settings involve gradual assemblage of materials which unfold over time, elaborating characteristics and dimensions of an acousmatic space, as in Natasha Barrett’s The Utility of Space. In both cases of these opening structural primitives there are qualitative and temporal features of the materials that influence the richness and cogency of the design and its implications for the work. For example an initial sound of high or low frequency may imply the possibility of motion into some not-yet-stated frequency regions, or a granular edge to a pitch offer the potential for movement towards more saturate or noisy spectral constructs, while short fragmented noise bursts may afford potential for a clustering or coalescing process. From this perspective, very simple means at the outset of a work can be seen to have rich and imaginative implications, such as in Enrique Belloc’s Para Bla, which presents stark juxtaposition of relative pitch and noise—calling attention through the rhetoric of gestural immediacy, contrasting sound types and registral displacement. Additional factors such as the degree of divergence in the characteristics of materials and the timescale over which events are presented are also taken into account as defining formative seeds. In fact it can in itself be a significant analytical challenge to determine where the ‘opening’ section of a work ends, and another phase of continuation or involvement in discourse commences. The paper concludes that there is a richer range of opening strategies than closing ones in electroacoustic music where, in the latter, recourse to fade outs, singular upward or downward motion of pitch, or decisive final gestures are common devices. This kind of emphasis on secondary parameters for closure is also an element of classical tonal music, but is the staple of electroacoustic music without the additional advantage of a widely comprehended syntax that allows for structural clarity as well as playful and meaningful ambiguity (for example in many of Haydn’s endings). However, it is suggested that by identifying archetypal strategies within the electroacoustic genres and by drawing sensitive parallels and analogies with aspects of the tonal tradition, it may be possible to find ways to explain electroacoustic forms to a wider audience as well as locate ways for practitioners to expand and enrich their vocabulary...|$|E
