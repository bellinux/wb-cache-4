5|$|Punk {{was a form}} of rebellious {{rock that}} began in the 1970s, and <b>was</b> <b>loud,</b> aggressive, and often very simple. Punk began as a {{reaction}} against the popular music of the period, especially disco and arena rock. American bands in the field included, most famously, The Ramones and Talking Heads, the latter playing a more avant-garde style that was closely associated with punk before evolving into mainstream new wave. Other major acts include Blondie, Patti Smith, and Television. In the 1980s some punk fans and bands became disillusioned with the growing popularity of the style, resulting in an even more aggressive style called hardcore punk. Hardcore {{was a form of}} sparse punk, consisting of short, fast, intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth, with such influential bands as Bad Religion, Bad Brains, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, and Minor Threat. Hardcore began in metropolises like Washington, D.C., though most major American cities had their own local scenes in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1914, Goddard's health had improved, and he {{accepted}} a part-time position as an instructor and research fellow at Clark University. His position at Clark allowed him to further his rocketry research. He ordered numerous supplies {{that could be used}} to build rocket prototypes for launch and spent much of 1915 in preparation for his first tests. Goddard's first test launch of a powder rocket came on an early evening in 1915 following his daytime classes at Clark. The launch <b>was</b> <b>loud</b> and bright enough to arouse the alarm of the campus janitor, and Goddard had to reassure him that his experiments, while being serious study, were also quite harmless. After this incident, Goddard took his experiments inside the physics lab, in order to limit any disturbance.|$|E
25|$|With {{a growing}} {{majority}} of the Cabinet, including Lloyd George and Churchill, in favour of women's suffrage, Asquith was pressed to allow consideration of a private member's bill to give women the vote. The majority of Liberal MPs were also in favour. Jenkins deemed {{him one of the}} two main prewar obstacles to women gaining the vote, the other being the suffragists's own militancy. In 1912, Asquith reluctantly agreed to permit a free vote on an amendment to a pending reform bill, allowing women the vote on the same terms as men. This would have satisfied Liberal suffrage supporters, and many suffragists, but the Speaker in January 1913 ruled that the amendment changed the nature of the bill, which would have to be withdrawn. Asquith <b>was</b> <b>loud</b> in his complaints against the Speaker, but was privately relieved.|$|E
25|$|He faced uprisings in Algeria by the pied-noirs and the French armed forces. On {{assuming}} {{the prime minister}} role in June 1958 he immediately went to Algeria, and neutralised the army there, with its 600,000 soldiers. The Algiers Committee of Public Safety <b>was</b> <b>loud</b> in its demands {{on behalf of the}} settlers, but de Gaulle made more visits and sidestepped them. For the long term he devised a plan to modernize Algeria's traditional economy, deescalated the war, and offered Algeria self-determination in 1959. A pied-noir revolt in 1960 failed, while another attempted coup failed in April 1961. French voters approved his course in a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination. De Gaulle arranged a cease-fire in Algeria with the March 1962 Evian Accords, legitimated by another referendum a month later. It gave victory by the FLN, which came to power and declared independence. The long crisis was over.|$|E

He had a loud voice and a louder laugh, and [...] "liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the sight and sound of military good fellowship"; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as [...] "not everybody's cup of tea", and commented that [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>loud</b> in every possible way—in his voice, in his laugh, in his clothes, in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself, in his whole approach to life".

500|$|The band found Danesmoate {{to have a}} very {{creative}} atmosphere, but according to the Edge, they [...] "just couldn't settle in". The large drawing room, with a tall ceiling and wooden floors, created an [...] "ear-splitting" [...] drum sound that caused issues for the group. Lanois had a higher opinion of the house, saying: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>loud,</b> but it was really good loud, real dense, very musical. In my opinion it was the most rock and roll room of the lot." [...] According to him, [...] "the Danesmoate sessions were the backbone of the tonality of the record—we got a lot of the drums done in there." [...] He thought that the house sounded better than Slane Castle, and he was particularly impressed with the drawing room's [...] "low mid-range ... where the music lives", a property that he believes was {{a major factor in the}} success of The Joshua Tree.|$|E
500|$|As Russell concluded, {{to strong}} applause from gold delegates, {{there was a}} buzz of {{anticipation}} as Bryan ascended to the podium. There <b>was</b> <b>loud</b> cheering as Bryan stood there, waiting for his audience to calm. Bryan's lecture tours had left him a well-known spokesman for silver. As yet, {{no one at the}} convention had effectively spoken for that cause, which was paramount to the delegates. According to political scientist Richard F. Bensel in his study of the 1896 Democratic convention, [...] "Although the silver men knew they would win this fight, they nonetheless needed someone to tell them—and the gold men—why they must enshrine silver {{at the heart of the}} platform." [...] Bensel noted, [...] "The pump was more than primed, it was ready to explode." [...] Bryan would say little that he had not said before—the text is similar to that of a speech he had given the previous week at Crete, Nebraska—but he would give the convention its voice.|$|E

500|$|The stern section, which {{measures}} about [...] long, was catastrophically damaged during the descent and in {{landing on the}} sea bed. It had not fully filled with water when it sank and the increasing water pressure caused trapped air pockets to implode, tearing apart the hull. It <b>was</b> <b>loud</b> enough that multiple survivors reported hearing explosions about ten seconds after the stern had sank beneath the waves. Data from a sonar map made during a 2010 expedition showed that the stern section rotated like a helicopter blade as it sank. The rudder appears to have swung over to an angle of about 30–45° during the stern's descent, causing the section to follow a tight spiral to the bottom. It probably struck rudder-first, burying most of the rudder in the mud up {{to a depth of}} [...] The decks pancaked {{on top of each other}} and the hull plating splayed out to the sides of the shattered section.

500|$|Punk {{was a kind}} of rebellious {{rock music}} that began in the 1970s as a {{reaction}} against the popular music of the day - especially disco, which was seen as insipid and uninspired. Punk drew on American bands including the Velvet Underground, The Stooges and the New York Dolls. Punk <b>was</b> <b>loud,</b> aggressive and usually very simple, requiring little musical training to play. Later in the decade, British bands like the Sex Pistols and The Clash found short-lived fame at home and, to a lesser degree, in the United States. American bands in the field included most famously The Ramones, as well as groups like the Talking Heads that played a more artsy kind of music that was closely associated with punk before eventually evolving into pop-new wave. Other major acts include Blondie, Patti Smith and Television. Most of these bands got their start at what is considered [...] "ground zero" [...] of punk rock, a club named CBGB. The small club in New York threw a festival in 1975 that showed off the [...] "top 40 unrecorded rock bands". Among these bands were the previously mentioned The Ramones, Sex Pistols, Blondie and the like.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music <b>was</b> <b>loud</b> and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E
