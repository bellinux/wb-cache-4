The structural stress method for plate structures, as currently presented in commonly used design guidance documents, cannot account the effect of weld size and load carrying fillet welds are assessed using a different S-N curve as compared to non-load carrying fillet welds. The current proposal is to linearize the local stress distribution through the plate thickness in {{the plane of the}} weld toe and, thus, partially capture the local effect. A bilinear stress distribution is derived from the actual non-linear stress distribution based on equilibrium. A simple procedure is presented to determine the bilinear curve from the nominal <b>weld</b> <b>stress.</b> This is a great advantage in finite element analysis when only nominal base plate <b>stress</b> and nominal <b>weld</b> <b>stresses</b> need to be determined.
