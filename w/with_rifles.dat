5|$|Citizens {{were trained}} {{from the age}} of 12 to station {{themselves}} in the nearest bunker to repel invaders. Local Party cells organised families to clean and maintain their local bunkers, and civil defence drills were held at least twice a month, lasting for up to three days, in which civilians of military age of both sexes were issued <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> (but no ammunition).|$|E
5|$|The Tiflis {{branch of}} the State Bank of the Russian Empire had {{arranged}} to transport funds between {{the post office and}} the State Bank by horse-drawn stagecoach. Inside the stagecoach was the money, two guards <b>with</b> <b>rifles,</b> a bank cashier, and a bank accountant. A phaeton filled with armed soldiers rode behind the stagecoach, and mounted cossacks rode in front, next to, and behind the carriages.|$|E

50|$|However, {{soldiers}} armed <b>with</b> <b>rifled</b> muskets {{were not}} always successful on the battlefield. In the Italian War of 1859, Austrian troops armed <b>with</b> <b>rifled</b> muskets were defeated by French forces using aggressive skirmishing tactics and rapid bayonet assaults at close range.|$|R

5|$|As {{well as a}} fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons {{was also}} a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating {{explosives}} such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known to spend {{hours at a time}} in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{attempts}} at peaceful negotiation by FRELIMO were abandoned and, on September 25, 1964, Eduardo Mondlane began to launch guerrilla attacks on targets in northern Mozambique from his base in Tanzania. FRELIMO soldiers, with logistical {{assistance from the}} local population, attacked the administrative post at Chai Chai {{in the province of}} Cabo Delgado. FRELIMO militants were able to evade pursuit and surveillance by employing classic guerrilla tactics: ambushing patrols, sabotaging communication and railroad lines, and making hit-and-run attacks against colonial outposts before rapidly fading into accessible backwater areas. The insurgents were typically armed <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> and machine pistols, and the attackers took full advantage of the monsoon season in order to evade pursuit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him {{into the back of a}} vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned about someone he did not know, he was released.|$|E

5|$|On 12–13 April 1916 near Beit Ayeesa, Mesopotamia, Naik Shahamad Khan was {{in charge}} of a machine-gun {{covering}} a gap in our new line within 150 yards of the entrenched enemy. He beat off three counter-attacks and worked his gun single-handed after all his men, except two belt-fillers, had become casualties. For three hours he held the gap under very heavy fire and when his gun was knocked out, he and his two belt-fillers held their ground <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> until ordered to withdraw. With help he then brought back his gun, ammunition and one severely wounded man, and finally all remaining arms and equipment.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the animal keepers were issued <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> to deal with any dangerous animals who might escape if the gardens were bombed. A night shift was introduced to watch over the animals 24hours a day. A list of dangerous animals that was drawn up included 13lions, 6tigers, 2leopards, 1cheetah, 2tigons, 3other small cats and several bears. Although the zoo's administrators succeeded in convincing the local authorities that any danger from the animals was minimal, primarily because the perimeter walls were so high, the keepers were replaced in their sharp-shooting role by soldiers who patrolled the grounds armed with tommy guns.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{differ on}} the exact cause and extent of the {{massacre}} in Maribor. All agree that on 27 January 1919, the Coolidge Mission's delegation, led by Sherman Miles, visited Maribor and found thousands of citizens of German ethnic origin gathered in the main city square and waving flags of German Austria, many of which also decorated nearby buildings. German Austrian sources indicate that there were 10,000 protesters singing songs and wearing patriotic dress. Twenty soldiers under Maister's command were stationed {{in front of the}} city hall, armed <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> mounted with bayonets.|$|E

5|$|The Syrians were {{equipped}} <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> discarded by retreating Ottoman soldiers during World War I {{and those}} used by the Sharifian Army's Bedouin cavalry during the 1916 Arab Revolt. The Syrians also possessed a number of machine guns and about 15 artillery batteries. According to various versions, ammunition was low, with 120–250 bullets per rifle, 45 bullets per machine gun, and 50–80 shells per cannon. Part of this ammunition was also unusable because many bullet and rifle types did not correspond to each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms {{helped shape}} the cavalry's contribution to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. All would be trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed <b>with</b> <b>rifles,</b> the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than anything else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine had changed since the Boer Wars.|$|E
5|$|The {{substantial}} two storied station building, solidly build of stone, made {{an effective}} strong redoubt for the garrison, {{with the windows}} used by the defenders to fire their automatic rifles and throw their grenades from. At this time several white flags were reported at the station, but when the light horsemen approached they were fired on, {{and it was in}} this way that most of the light horsemen who died during the battle were killed. Once they succeeded in entering the station buildings, hand-to-hand fighting from room-to-room <b>with</b> <b>rifles,</b> bayonets, and swords, followed. Other groups of defenders deployed in the locomotives, tenders and carriages standing in the railway sidings, were also attacked.|$|E

5|$|When {{there were}} no signs of the POWs backing down on the third day, General Fukuye ordered the Commander of the British and Australian troops in Changi, Lt-Gen E. B. Holmes, and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Galleghan, to attend the {{execution}} of the four recent escapees — Breavington, Gale, Waters and Fletcher. One of the Australians, Breavington, pleaded to no avail that he was solely responsible for the escape attempt and should be the only one executed. Their executions were carried out by the Indian National Army guards <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> on 2 September. The initial volley was non-fatal, and the wounded men had to plead to be finished off.|$|E
5|$|During the {{bombardment}} a small naval engagement occurred when, at 09:05, the obsolete Glasgow fired upon the St George using her armament of 7 nine-pounder guns and a Gatling gun, {{which had been}} a present from Queen Victoria to the sultan. The return fire caused Glasgow to sink, though the shallow harbour meant that her masts remained out of the water. Glasgows crew hoisted a British flag as a token of their surrender, {{and they were all}} rescued by British sailors in launches. Thrush also sank two steam launches whose Zanzibari crews shot at her <b>with</b> <b>rifles.</b> Some land fighting occurred when Khalid's men fired on Raikes' askaris, with little effect, as they approached the palace. The fighting ceased {{with the end of the}} shelling. The British controlled the town and the palace, and by the afternoon Hamud bin Muhammed, an Arab favourable to the British, had been installed as sultan with much reduced powers. The British ships and crews had fired around 500 shells, 4,100 machine gun rounds and 1,000 rifle rounds during the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{divisions}} {{was made up of}} three brigades, each with three regiments. The 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions which had transferred from France, consisted of one British yeomanry regiment and two British Indian Army cavalry regiments, one of which was usually lancers. Except the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade which had three regiments of Indian Imperial Service Troops lancers. Some of the cavalry regiments were armed, in addition to their Lee–Enfield rifles, bayonets and swords, with lances. The 5th Cavalry Division, consisted of three lancer regiments. The Australian Mounted Division consisting of three light horse brigades, each of three regiments consisting of a headquarters and three squadrons; 522 men and horses in each regiment, was armed with swords, Lee–Enfield rifles and bayonets, while the Anzac Mounted Division detached to Chaytor's Force, was, and remained throughout the war, only armed <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> and bayonets. These divisions were supported by machine guns, three batteries from the Royal Horse Artillery or Honourable Artillery Company, and light armoured car units; two Light Armoured Motor Batteries, and two Light Car Patrols.|$|E
50|$|Most English pistols had smooth bores, {{though some}} had scratch rifling, a subtle form of rifling which was {{difficult}} to see with the naked eye. Pistols <b>with</b> <b>rifled</b> barrel spin-stabilise the shot when it is fired, resulting in much improved accuracy. As a result, duelling pistols <b>with</b> <b>rifled</b> barrels were considered unsporting by many, {{although there was no}} unfairness so long as the pistols were identical.|$|R

5|$|In 1846 the Mexican–American War began. Davis {{resigned}} his House seat {{in early}} June {{and raised a}} volunteer regiment, the 155th Infantry Regiment, becoming its colonel {{under the command of}} his former father-in-law, General Zachary Taylor. On July 21 the regiment sailed from New Orleans for Texas. Colonel Davis sought to arm his regiment with the M1841 Mississippi rifle. At this time, smoothbore muskets were still the primary infantry weapon, and any unit <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> was considered special and designated as such. President James K. Polk had promised Davis the weapons if he would remain in Congress long enough for an important vote on the Walker tariff. General Winfield Scott objected on the basis that the weapons were insufficiently tested. Davis insisted and called in his promise from Polk, and his regiment was armed with the rifles, making it particularly effective in combat. The regiment became known as the Mississippi Rifles {{because it was the first}} to be fully armed with these new weapons. The incident was the start of a lifelong feud between Davis and Scott.|$|E
5|$|Khalid ignored Cave's warning, and {{his forces}} began {{mustering}} in the Palace Square {{under the command}} of Captain Saleh of the palace bodyguard. By the end of the day, they numbered 2,800 men armed <b>with</b> <b>rifles</b> and muskets. The majority were civilians, but the force included 700 Zanzibari Askari soldiers who had sided with Khalid. The sultan's artillery, which consisted of several Maxim machine guns, a Gatling gun, a 17th-century bronze cannon and two 12-pounder field guns, was aimed at the British ships in the harbour. The 12-pounders had been presented to the sultan by Wilhelm II, the German emperor. The sultan's troops also took possession of the Zanzibari Navy, which consisted of one wooden sloop, the HHS Glasgow, built as a royal yacht for the sultan in 1878 based on the British frigate Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|The single cavalry {{division}} {{assigned to}} the BEF in 1914 consisted of 15 cavalry regiments in five brigades. They were armed <b>with</b> <b>rifles,</b> unlike their French and German counterparts, who were only armed with the shorter range carbine. The cavalry division also had a high allocation of artillery compared to foreign cavalry divisions, with 24 13-pounder guns organised into two brigades and two machine guns for each regiment. When dismounted, the cavalry division {{was the equivalent of}} two weakened infantry brigades with less artillery than the infantry division. By 1916, there were five cavalry divisions, each of three brigades, serving in France, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd divisions in the Cavalry Corps and the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions in the Indian Cavalry Corps, each brigade in the Indian cavalry corps contained a British cavalry regiment.|$|E
