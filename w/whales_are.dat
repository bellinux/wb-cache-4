5|$|Balaenidae {{consists}} of two genera: Eubalaena (right whales) and Balaena (the bowhead whale, B. mysticetus). Balaenidae was thought to have consisted of only one genus until studies done through the early 2000s reported that bowhead whales and right <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> morphologically (different skull shape) and phylogenically different. According to a study done by H. C. Rosenbaum (of the American Museum of Natural History) and colleagues, the North Pacific (E. japonica) and Southern right (E. australis) <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> {{more closely related to}} each other than to the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis).|$|E
5|$|Fin <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> more gregarious {{than other}} rorquals, and often live {{in groups of}} 6â€“10, {{although}} feeding groups may reach up to 100 animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} the Siberian Yupik people, killer <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|E
25|$|Blue and fin <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> {{primarily}} hunted, but humpback and sei <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> also included. However, {{prior to}} 1914 Icelanders did not hunt minke whales. Superstition held that minke <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> sent by God as protectors.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1987 a Blue whale washed ashore on Nail Pond beach. The <b>whale</b> <b>was</b> {{consequently}} buried, only {{to later}} be dug up. The <b>whale</b> <b>was</b> dug up in 2008. The skeleton of the <b>whale</b> <b>was</b> {{sent to the}} University of British Columbia, {{where it is now}} on display.|$|R
25|$|Primarily Right whales, {{humpback}} whales, gray, and fin <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> hunted. Blue <b>whales,</b> sei, Bryde's and sperm <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> however {{also taken}} when possible.|$|R
5|$|The ribs {{are bound}} to the spine by {{flexible}} cartilage, which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While sperm <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signals decompression sickness in humans. Older skeletons showed the most extensive pitting, whereas calves showed no damage. This damage may indicate that sperm <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> susceptible to decompression sickness, and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.|$|E
5|$|The <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> part of {{the largely}} {{terrestrial}} mammalian clade Laurasiatheria. Whales do not form a clade or order; the infraorder Cetacea includes dolphins and porpoises, which are not considered whales.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 {{moratorium}} ban on whaling set {{under the terms}} of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). There are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, all minke <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} a single species. However, the common minke <b>whale</b> <b>was</b> {{recognized as a}} separate species from the Antarctic minke whale based on mitochondrial DNA testing. This testing also confirmed that the Antarctic minke <b>whale</b> <b>is</b> the closest relative of the common minke whale, thus confirming {{the validity of the}} minke whale clade.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, nine badly gashed sperm <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> {{washed up}} on reefs near the island. Six of the <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> dead and the others had to be euthanatised.|$|R
50|$|Following a circumnavigation of the world, the <b>Whale</b> <b>was</b> {{deactivated}} {{while still}} in commission on 28 April 1995. <b>Whale</b> <b>was</b> placed in reserve, in commission, on 1 October 1995.|$|R
5|$|Baleen <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> {{cetaceans}} classified {{under the}} parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
5|$|Beluga <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> {{the only}} {{cetacean}} being common around the peninsula. Other dolphins, including Atlantic white-sided dolphins, white-beaked dolphins, and harbor porpoises, {{as well as}} large whales, such as bowhead, humpback, blue, and finback, also visit the area.|$|E
5|$|Fin <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> {{regularly}} encountered on whale-watching excursions worldwide. In the Southern California Bight, fin <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> encountered year-round, {{with the}} best sightings between November and March. They can even be seen from land (for example, from Point Vicente, Palos Verdes, {{where they can be}} seen lunge feeding at the surface only a half mile to a few miles offshore). They are regularly sighted in the summer and fall in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Gulf of Maine, the Bay of Fundy, the Bay of Biscay, Strait of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean. In southern Ireland, they are seen inshore from June to February, with peak sightings in November and December. Cruise ships en route to and from the Antarctic Peninsula sometimes encounter fin whales in the Drake Passage.|$|E
5000|$|Large {{ships were}} used as [...] "mother" [...] ships for the whale handlers. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> of great {{importance}} as a supplier of raw materials. <b>Whales</b> <b>were</b> intensively hunted during this time; in the 1930s, 30,000 <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> killed. This increased to over 40,000 animals per year up to the 1960s, when stocks of large baleen whales collapsed.|$|R
5000|$|Baleen <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> {{generally}} {{the main source}} of whale oil. The oil of baleen <b>whales</b> <b>is</b> exclusively composed of triglycerides, whereas that of toothed whales contains wax esters. [...] The bowhead whale and right <b>whale</b> <b>were</b> considered the ideal whaling targets. They are slow and docile, and they float when killed. They yield plenty of high-quality oil and whalebone, and as a result, they were hunted nearly to extinction.|$|R
50|$|Melon-headed <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> found {{stranded}} in South Carolina in 2008. In January, three stranded melon-headed <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> discovered. It {{was determined that}} they had died out at sea and the waves brought them onto the beach. Three more melon-headed <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> discovered after this at different times. Necropsies were done on the melon-headed <b>whales</b> and it <b>was</b> discovered that they all had similar infections as well as hemorrhaging and other problems. However, an actual {{cause of death was}} never determined.|$|R
5|$|Killer <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> highly social; some {{populations are}} {{composed}} of matrilineal family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species. Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, {{have been described as}} manifestations of animal culture.|$|E
5|$|Killer <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> {{notable for}} their complex societies. Only {{elephants}} and higher primates, such as humans, live in comparably complex social structures. Due to orcas' complex social bonds and society, many marine experts {{have concerns about}} how humane it is to keep these animals in captive situations.|$|E
5|$|Pilot <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> {{cetaceans}} {{belonging to}} the genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned pilot whale (G. melas) and the short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, {{and analysis of the}} skulls {{is the best way to}} distinguish between the species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the killer whale. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as blackfish.|$|E
5|$|Following {{large-scale}} commercial whaling {{during the}} late 19th and 20th centuries, when over 255,000 <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> taken, the sei <b>whale</b> <b>is</b> now internationally protected, although limited hunting occurs under a controversial research program conducted by Japan.|$|R
50|$|The Devil <b>Whale</b> <b>is</b> {{a legendary}} sea monster that was first {{reported}} by St. Brendan. According to myths, this <b>whale</b> <b>is</b> of enormous size and could swallow entire ships. It is often mentioned in children's books.|$|R
50|$|The first whaling season, {{lasted from}} 24 June, {{when the first}} <b>whale</b> <b>was</b> shot, to 9 September when GrÃ¸n {{returned}} to Norway with 940 barrels of whale oil, and 5 tonnes of baleen, 46 <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> shot.|$|R
5|$|Sperm <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> {{not known}} for forging bonds with other species, but it was {{observed}} that a bottlenose dolphin with spinal deformity had been accepted into a pod of sperm whales. They are known to swim alongside other cetaceans such as humpback, fin, minke, pilot, and orca whales on occasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{killer whale}} or orca (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale {{belonging}} to the oceanic dolphin family, {{of which it is}} the largest member. Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and dolphins. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. Killer <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> apex predators, as there is no animal that preys on them. Killer <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> considered a cosmopolitan species, and can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.|$|E
5|$|The toothed whales (systematic name Odontoceti) form a parvorder of the cetaceans. As {{the name}} suggests, the parvorder is {{characterized}} by having teeth (rather than baleen). Toothed <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> active hunters, feeding on fish, squid, {{and in some cases}} other marine mammals.|$|E
50|$|On January 10, 2009, {{a female}} Sowerby's beaked <b>whale</b> <b>was</b> {{found at the}} port of Fethiye on the Aegean coast of Turkey, far away from her natural habitat. The <b>whale</b> <b>was</b> {{successfully}} saved and released back to the open sea.|$|R
50|$|Like {{all other}} large whales, the fin <b>whale</b> <b>was</b> heavily hunted during the 20th century {{and is an}} {{endangered}} species. Over 725,000 fin <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> reportedly taken from the Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976; as of 1997 only 38,000 survived.|$|R
40|$|From 2001 to 2004 in {{the eastern}} Aleutian Islands, Alaska, killer <b>whales</b> (Orcinus orca) <b>were</b> {{encountered}} 250 times during 421 days of surveys that covered a total of 22, 491 miles. Three killer whale groups (resident, transient, and offshore) were identified acoustically and genetically. Resident killer <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> found 12 times more frequently than transient killer whales, and offshore killer <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> encountered only once. A minimum of 901 photographically identified resident whales used the region during our study. A total of 165 mammal-eating transient killer <b>whales</b> <b>were</b> identified, and the majority (70...|$|R
5|$|Whale-watching, principally blue whales, is {{also carried}} out south of Sri Lanka. <b>Whales</b> <b>are</b> widely seen {{along the coast}} of Chile and Peru near the coast, {{occasionally}} making mixed groups with fin, sei, and Bryde's whales.|$|E
5|$|<b>Whales</b> <b>are</b> {{air-breathing}} mammals {{who must}} surface {{to get the}} air they need. The stubby dorsal fin is visible soon after the blow (exhalation) when the whale surfaces, but disappears {{by the time the}} flukes emerge. Humpbacks have a , heart-shaped to bushy blow through the blowholes.|$|E
5|$|Wild killer <b>whales</b> <b>are</b> not {{considered}} a threat to humans, {{but there have been}} cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks. Killer whales feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.|$|E
40|$|A sperm <b>whale,</b> Physeter macrocephalus, <b>was</b> found washed ashore dead at Honnegadde landing centre, Uttara Kannada, Karnataka, on 31 st May 2006 during morning hours. The {{total length}} of the <b>whale</b> <b>was</b> about 35 ft. and {{weighing}} about 3. 5 tonnes. A baleen <b>whale</b> <b>was</b> also found washed ashore on 8 th May 2006 at Murudeshwara landing centre...|$|R
50|$|The blue <b>whale</b> <b>is</b> {{the largest}} mammal.|$|R
25|$|<b>Whale</b> <b>was</b> born in 1951 in {{the village}} of Ewell in Surrey, the son of an English father, David Whale, and a Welsh mother, Anne (nÃ©e Price), who owned a pub. <b>Whale</b> <b>was</b> educated at Longmead County Secondary Boys' School, a {{secondary}} modern school in Epsom, Surrey.|$|R
