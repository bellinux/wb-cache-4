25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, <b>why</b> <b>bother?</b> Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Morris joined Armando Iannucci's spoof news project On the Hour. Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, it saw {{him work}} {{alongside}} Iannucci, Steve Coogan, Stewart Lee, Richard Herring and Rebecca Front. In 1992, Morris hosted Danny Baker's Radio 5 Morning Edition show {{for a week}} whilst Baker was on holiday. In 1994, Morris began a weekly evening show, the Chris Morris Music Show, on BBC Radio 1 alongside Peter Baynham and 'man with a mobile phone' Paul Garner. In the shows, Morris perfected the spoof interview style that would become a central component of his Brass Eye programme. In the same year, Morris teamed up with Peter Cook (as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling), {{in a series of}} improvised conversations for BBC Radio 3 entitled <b>Why</b> <b>Bother?.</b>|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} rather negative reviews, since clip shows {{tend to be}} {{the least}} favorite episodes among fans. The episode has been described as [...] "framed {{in such a way as}} to still make [...] worth watching, like a slideshow that's not quite so boring", [...] "another clip show, although not the worst of them", and [...] "the episode title pretty much says it all". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said in a review: [...] "The romance related storyline fizzles. That leaves us with a good collection of clips, but since we can already watch them in their original episodes, <b>why</b> <b>bother</b> with this cheap excuse for product?" ...|$|E

500|$|Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network {{declined}} to post {{commentary on the}} preview announcement for the second season, claiming [...] "we assume if you loved School Rumble, you're gonna check out the sequel regardless of what anyone says, so <b>why</b> <b>bother</b> reviewing it?" [...] David F. Smith from IGN gave {{the first part of}} season two a rating of 6/10, with lower scores for the Funimation extras and higher ones for the plot and story. Specifically, Smith praised the anime for never taking itself seriously, and the studio for not cutting its budget for sight gags—something he notes that other companies do. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season funny and nonrepetitive, and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network praised the second season for not conforming to the conventions of reality. She complimented it for focusing more on the other students and their relationships than on the main love triangle. Chris Beveridge claimed that, although it comes across well, the season should not be watched in a marathon sitting. He was more critical of Funimation's packaging, preferring the first season's metal locker boxart to the packing for the half-season sets.|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{suffered}} from depression {{throughout much of}} his life. He described himself as [...] "incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression" [...] before his Oscar win for In The Heat of the Night. His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976 and 1979 and struggled with obesity, though certain roles, such as Napoleon, required him to intentionally gain weight. After the decline of his third marriage in 1979, a deep depression, partly {{a side effect of}} his surgery, during the 1980s negatively affected his career. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, often confining himself to his apartment, watching American football for several hours. He said of the experience: [...] "You begin to lose self-esteem. You don't walk, you don't shave and if no one was watching you'd go to the bathroom right where you were sitting". He would lie in bed at night thinking [...] "You'll never act again. <b>Why</b> <b>bother?</b> You're no good". Despite these challenges, Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s. In one of his final interviews, he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance, not a mental disease. He commented: [...] "Pain must never be a source of shame. It's a part of life, it's part of humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|MacDermot {{followed}} Hair {{with three}} successive rock scores: Two Gentlemen of Verona (1971); Dude (1972), a second collaboration with Ragni; and Via Galactica (1972). [...] While Two Gentlemen of Verona found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, Dude failed after just sixteenperformances, and Via Galactica flopped after a month. [...] According to Horn, {{these and other}} such [...] "failures {{may have been the}} result of producers simply relying on the label 'rock musical' to attract audiences without regard {{to the quality of the}} material presented." [...] Jesus Christ Superstar (1970) and Godspell (1971) were two religiously themed successes of the genre. [...] Grease (1971) reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s, and black-themed musicals like The Wiz (1975) were heavily influenced by gospel, R and soul music. [...] By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out. [...] Except for a few outposts of rock, like Dreamgirls (1981) and Little Shop of Horrors (1982), audience tastes in the 1980s turned to [...] with pop scores, like Les Misérables (1985) and The Phantom of the Opera (1986). [...] Some later rock musicals, such as Rent (1996) and Spring Awakening (2006), as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music, like We Will Rock You (2002) and Rock of Ages (2009), have found success. [...] But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after Hair. [...] Critic Clive Barnes commented, [...] "There really weren't any rock musicals. [...] No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ... You might think of the musical Tommy, but it was never conceived as a Broadway show. ... And one can see why. [...] There's so much more money in records and rock concerts. [...] I mean, <b>why</b> <b>bother</b> going through the pain of a musical which may close in Philadelphia?" ...|$|E

500|$|Professor Roy M. Anker {{argues that}} the film's {{thematic}} center is its direction to the audience to [...] "look closer". The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams' neighborhood with Lester's narrated admission {{that this is the}} last day of his life, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them. It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, [...] "from what place exactly, and from what state of being, is he telling this story? If he's already dead, <b>why</b> <b>bother</b> with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? There is also the question of how Lester has died—or will die." [...] Anker believes the preceding scene—Jane's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father—adds further mystery. Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside [...] "to view the film and its philosophical issues". Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, American Beauty satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction. Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a [...] "willing devotee of the popular media's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness". Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in [...] "house beautiful" [...] domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a [...] "fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden". The Burnhams are unaware that they are [...] "materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically" [...] who expect the [...] "rudiments of American beauty" [...] to give them happiness. Anker argues that [...] "they are helpless {{in the face of the}} prettified economic and sexual stereotypes that they and their culture have designated for their salvation." ...|$|E

It was produced by Danny Korthmar, and featured Steve Jordan, Neil Jason, Leon Pendarvis and Hugh McCracken. It was released in October 2009 and peaked in the top40 in Australia. Amazon.com editorial reviewer declared that Moss provides an [...] "unforgettable sound – not only as a telling soloist on guitar but especially with his silken voice, ringing with clarity and resonating with pure soul". Antonios Sarhanis at Anagrammatically Correct felt it was a [...] "good collection of covers, but <b>why</b> <b>bother</b> when the better originals are so freely available?".|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film a [...] "C". Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic {{gave it a}} {{negative}} review saying, [...] "Saw III is devoid of any suspense or terror or common sense. It's simply an exercise in gore. And really, if that's all the filmmakers have up their sleeve, <b>why</b> <b>bother</b> with a plot? Just show one grisly makeup effect after another and you'd create the same sensory experience". Empires Kim Newman gave the film two out of five stars. He said the acting was [...] "surprisingly good" [...] but criticized the script and torture devices, calling it [...] "more contrived, and thus less effective". He ended his review saying, [...] "It requires a {{stretch of the imagination}} too far, but there's still plenty of gore and tricksy murders here".|$|E

[...] <b>Why</b> <b>bother</b> fleeing?" [...] Zhu Xicai soon arrived, and they entered, killed Li, and slaughtered his family. [...] Zhu Xicai claimed the title of acting military governor. [...] The imperial government, later in the year, acquiesced and made Zhu Xicai military governor. [...] Zhu Ci continued to serve under Zhu Xicai, and it was said that because they shared the same surname, Zhu Xicai trusted him greatly.|$|E

2500|$|After Love Never Dies {{opened on}} 9 March 2010 in London, it {{received}} mostly negative critical reviews. Perhaps {{the most positive}} review was Paul Taylor's in The Independent giving the show five stars, and writing, [...] "What is in no doubt is the technical excellence of Jack O'Brien's seamlessly fluent, sumptuous (and sometimes subtle) production, or the splendour of the orchestra which pours forth Lloyd Webber's dark-hued, yearning melodies as if its life depended on them. Special praise {{should go to the}} lyrical lavishness of Bob Crowley and Jon Driscoll's designs, with their gilt interiors where the vegetation-imitating contours and giant peacock-plumage of Art Nouveau run rampant, and their ghostly external locations where a brilliantly deployed combination of flowing projection (timed to perfection with emotional/ rhythmic shifts in the music) and solidly presented stage-effects create a dizzying Coney Island of the mind". In stark contrast, Ben Brantley of The New York Times gave it zero stars, calling the production [...] "a big, gaudy new show. And {{he might as well have}} a [...] "kick me" [...] sign pasted to his backside. ... This poor sap of a show feels as eager to be walloped as a clown in a carnival dunking booth. <b>Why</b> <b>bother,</b> when from beginning to end, Love Never Dies is its very own spoiler." ...|$|E
2500|$|Overwatch {{received}} [...] "universal acclaim" [...] upon release, {{according to}} review aggregator Metacritic. IGN's Vince Ingenito praised the game's characters and maps, writing [...] "Overwatch takes {{just about every}} possible opportunity to make its cast and locales seem like people and places rather than puppets and scenery." [...] Ingenito added that the game has a [...] "strong online experience that gets you into games quickly and reliably." [...] The Verges Andrew Webster praised Overwatch and previous titles Titanfall and Splatoon as [...] "friendly online shooters" [...] that have room for both new and casual players who may not desire to master the game but can still compete fairly with others, and for expert players that can utilize the various heroes {{to adapt to the}} dynamic tactics of the game. Webster went on to cite the atmosphere of Overwatch as a reason for the game's approachability, writing, [...] "The first thing that makes Overwatchs world appealing and approachable is, well, its world. This isn't the dour brown-and-grey shooter you might be used to. Instead, it's bright and colorful, with a cast of characters that's eclectic and diverse." [...] Caty McCarthy of Kill Screen echoed similar thoughts, writing [...] "When playing Overwatch, the player is absorbed by its radiating positivity. It's a world filled with lively color and energetic, playful competition, much like Nintendo's creative kid-friendly ink-shooter Splatoon." [...] Mike Minotti of VentureBeat commending the team-based gameplay, the game's diverse character roster and colorful settings, as well as the unlockable cosmetics earned through level progression and the smooth server connection. Referencing its similarities to Team Fortress 2, Minotti confirmed that [...] " [...] distinct classes, the team- and objective-based combat, and a bright, cartoon-like art style," [...] and that [...] "Overwatch certainly takes plenty of inspiration from Valve's online shooter series," [...] but opines that [...] " [...] just better." [...] Daniel Tack of The News & Observer also positively received the game, expressing that [...] "no matter what happens – win or lose – you’re going to have fun," [...] adding that [...] "the game's strength lies in its simplicity and polish." [...] Tack went on to praise the game's characters, writing [...] "Unforgettable characters are the lifeblood and driving force of Overwatch." [...] The Denver Posts Hugh Johnson lauded the game for its emphasis on characters, rather than focusing on traditional first-person shooter tropes, such as weapon load outs and incremental level upgrades. Johnson went on to insist that the characters are balanced writing, [...] "The big question with class-based shooters like these {{is whether or not the}} characters are balanced," [...] expressing that [...] "some characters are naturally better, but no character is so overpowered that their mere presence spells doom for their opponents." [...] In June 2016, Vultures Joshua Rivera listed Overwatch as one of the [...] "best video games of 2016 (so far)," [...] writing, [...] "It's hard to separate Overwatch the game from Overwatch the phenomenon — and <b>why</b> <b>bother,</b> both are fascinating." ...|$|E
