5|$|Defence {{spending}} {{had been}} heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets. By 1935, {{faced with a}} resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership (see German re-armament), he <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> {{of the need for}} rearmament. Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force, realising that Britain's historical bulwark, the English Channel, was no defence against air power.|$|E

40|$|Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008] {{study the}} {{spreading}} {{of a message}} in an Erdős-Rényi random graph G(n, p) starting from a set of vertices that <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> of the message initially. In their strictmajority scenario, whenever {{more than half of}} the neighbors of a vertex v <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> of a message, v itself also becomes convinced. The spreading proceeds asynchronously until no more vertices can <b>be</b> <b>convinced.</b> Following Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008], we derive lower bounds on the minimum number min-seed(n, p) of vertices that need to <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> initially so that all vertices will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> at the end. Our main results are that min-seed(n, p) = Ω (min { n, p 2 n 2 }) and min-seed(n, p) = Ω (n 2 / 3) hold with high probability. We also consider the case of random seeds. For any sufficiently large constant d> 0 and any s ≤ n/(d ln n), we show that if one picks the set of seeds uniformly at random from the family of all s-sized sets, then with high probability, not all vertices will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> at the end. ...|$|R

5|$|Lamarck's {{evolutionary}} theory made little immediate {{impact on his}} fellow zoologists, or on the public at the time.

5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> {{that the company}} had been treated wrongly and insisted in {{bringing}} it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E

5|$|After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, {{during which}} Bizet {{served in the}} National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera Djamileh, though an orchestral suite derived from his {{incidental}} music to Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne was instantly popular. The production of Bizet's final opera, Carmen, was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that the work was a failure; {{he died of a}} heart attack three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success.|$|E
5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, as he <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that the progressives threatened the very {{foundation of the}} government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, {{one of the last}} links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found hard to accept as his body was not recovered.|$|E

5|$|By 1799, the {{fortress}} of Mantua {{on the river}} Mincio in northern Italy was in poor shape. It was commanded by viscount lieutenant general François-Philippe de Foissac-Latour (1750-1804) and garrisoned by a diverse force of 10,000, including French, Polish (Polish Legionnaires under general Józef Wielhorski), Italian (Republic of Alba and Cisalpine Republic), Swiss and German units. From {{the beginning of his}} assignment, Foissac-Latour, an engineer, <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that {{the fortress}} would be indefensible in any serious siege.|$|E
5|$|Chosen to play Quatermass was the {{distinguished}} actor John Mills, who {{had appeared in}} significant roles in many high-profile British films, including The Way to the Stars (1945), Great Expectations (1946) and Ice Cold in Alex (1958), and had won an Academy Award {{for his role in}} Ryan's Daughter (1970). Mills, whose only previous television credit at the time was The Zoo Gang (1974), was reluctant to take the part but <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> by his wife, who liked the script.

5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders.

Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E
