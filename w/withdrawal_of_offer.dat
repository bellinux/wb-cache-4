Some months later, France, Israel and Britain colluded to overthrow Nasser, and the Suez Crisis ensued.|$|R

Alarmed by this encirclement, Frederick began working to separate Britain from the coalition. On 16 January 1756, Prussia and Britain agreed to the Convention of Westminster, under which Prussia now undertook to guarantee Hanover against French attack, in return for Britain's <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> its <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> military subsidies to Russia. This move created a new Anglo-Prussian alliance and incensed the French court, which responded to Prussia's realignment with Britain by accepting Maria Theresa's invitation to a new Franco-Austrian alliance, formalized with the First Treaty of Versailles in May 1756, and to be consolidated by a dynastic alliance with marriage of the Dauphin to one of Maria Theresa's daughters.

Disputes with Egypt, who banned Israel-bound shipping from the Suez Canal and blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, pertained to the al-Auja DMZ. By 1955, Israel ceased attending the Egyptian MAC and stepped up raids into the Gaza Strip and Sinai to which Egypt retaliated by sponsoring the Palestinian fedayeen (self-sacrificer) raids.

40|$|Objective: Does the {{provision}} of a nurse-based intervention lead to smoking cessation in hospital patients? Method: At tertiary teaching hospital in Newcastle, Australia, 4, 779 eligible (aged 18 - 80, admitted for at least 24 hours, and able to provide informed consent) and consenting (73. 4 %) in-patients were recruited into a larger cross-sectional survey. 1, 422 (29. 7 %) smokers (in the last 12 months) {{were randomly assigned to}} control (n= 711) or intervention group (n= 711). The brief nurse-delivered intervention incorporated: tailored information, assessment <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> nicotine replacement therapy, booklets, and a discharge letter. Self-reported cessation at 12 months was validated with CO and salivary cotinine. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} groups in self-reported abstinence at three or 12 months post intervention, based on an intention to treat analysis. At three months, self-reported abstinence was 27. 3 % (I) and 27. 5 % (C); at 12 months was 18. 5 % (I) and 20. 6 % (C). There were no differences in validation of self-report between intervention and control groups at 12 months. Conclusion: This brief nurse-provided in-patient intervention did not significantly increase the smoking cessation rates compared with the control group at either three or 12 -month follow-up. Implications: A systematic total quality improvement model of accountable outcome-focused treatment, incorporating assertive physician-led pharmacotherapy, routine assessment and recording of nicotine dependence (ICD 10 coding), in- and outpatient services and engagement from multidisciplinary teams of health professionals may be required to improve treatment modalities for this chronic addictive disorder...|$|R

In this study of 763 US-based airline employees, we identify threat appraisal as a key mechanism explaining the relationship between four change-related variables (quality of change communication, procedural fairness in restructuring, change management history, and anxiety about change) and employee turnover intentions. Results indicate that turnover intentions are influenced by quality of change communication, procedural fairness in restructuring, and anxiety about change as mediated by threat appraisal. We also found that job embeddedness moderated the relationships of quality of change communication and procedural fairness in restructuring with threat appraisal.

40|$|Student {{progression}} {{and retention}} {{has always been}} a focus of attention at Glamorgan for many reasons. Not the least of these is the Universityâ€™s mission towards widening access to disadvantaged groups. The School of Electronics suffered a particularly difficult year for retention in 1999 - 2000, with the result that a programme of intensive action was initiated in the 2000 - 2001 session. This appears to have been successful. The programme involved close monitoring and counseling of students. In addition adjustments to the initial curriculum were implemented. As a result withdrawal has been halved and information on reasons for withdrawal has been enhanced. In addition to this tactical response a longer-term strategic programme has been started with the intention of addressing those factors which the School perceives to be the underlying causes <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> In this paper we look at some research carried out by others, regarding the underlying causes <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> <b>offer</b> some additional opinions on further causes, examine the 2000 - 2001 session tactical response and its outcome and offer, for discussion, the philosophy underlying the future strategic attack on the problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} {{of the market for}} {{retirement}} products in Chile has its origins in the pension reform that was implemented in 1981. But the successful development of an active annuity market also reflects many other factors. This paper summarizes and updates an earlier longer study {{on the development of the}} Chilean annuity market. The update focuses on the numerous changes that were introduced in 2008. The most striking aspect of the Chilean experience is the very high rate of annuitization. This has been linked to the restrictions that have been applied to lump-sum <b>withdrawals,</b> the <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> inflation-protected annuities, and the robust prudential regulation of providers. But the level of annuitization has also been supported by the annuitization incentives provided to early retirees and the influence of brokers and sales agents. The recent regulatory changes have weakened the impact of the last two factors, while strengthening the demand for annuities at normal retirement.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} have shown {{an effect of}} nCPAP-therapy in lowering bloodpressure in patients with OSA and hypertension. Various reasons lead to interruption of nCPAP-therapy in everyday conditions. Until today the effects on bloodpressure and heartrate variability <b>of</b> such <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was unclear. In a study on 18 patients with OSA and hypertension, treated over several months to years with nCPAP-therapy, we investigated {{the influence of a}} 7 to 10 days <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy on bloodpressure and heartrate. We investigated data of 12 patients. As a methode of measuring bloodpressure and heartrate variability we used ambulatory- 24 h-bloodpressure-monitoring (ABDM). Effects <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was documented by repeated polysomnography. We focused on comparing the mean bloodpressure in 24 hours before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy and after restarting nCPAP-therapy. We seperately compared bloodpressure during the day and at night. Patients were used as their own controls, so we could compare the results before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy caused an immediate onset of sleeapnoea. Ceasing of therapy produced a significant rise in systolic 24 -h-bloodpressure of 4 mmHg and a significant rise in diastolic 24 -h-pressure of 2 respective 3 mmHg. The rise in bloodpressure was considerered as clinically not relevant. The variability of bloodpressure {{can be used as a}} hint for the close association of OSA and regulation of bloodpressure. Change of heartrate was only significant during the day on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy but frequency was always below 100 /min [...] Therefore the risk for patients through extensive rising in heartrate is considered low. These results led us to the assumption that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy of 7 to 10 days in patients with OSA and arterial hypertension causes a certain rise in bloodpressure which probably is not clinically relevant. This means that the risk of a cardiovascular event caused by a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy is low...|$|R
