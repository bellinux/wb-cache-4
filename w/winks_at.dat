5|$|The video's main {{theme is}} a romantic fantasy narrative. It {{begins with a}} montage of pencil {{drawings}} in a comic-book style representing motorcycle sidecar racing, in which the hero, played by Morten Harket, is pursued by two opponents, {{one of whom is}} played by English actor Philip Jackson. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey (Harket's girlfriend at the time), is seen drinking coffee and reading the comic book in a coffee shop. As the woman reads, the waitress brings her the bill. The comic's hero, after winning the race, seemingly <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> the woman from the page. His pencil-drawn hand reaches out of the comic book, inviting the woman into it. Once inside, she too appears in the pencil-drawn form, as he sings to her and introduces her to his black-and-white world which features a sort of looking-glass portal where people and objects look real on one side and pencil-drawn on the other.|$|E

A sequel featuring Ash Williams from The Evil Dead franchise was planned, but never materialized on-screen. It was later turned into Dynamite Entertainment's comic book series Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash.|$|E

During the process of his recovery from his fever, he recollects the face of the killer. The next morning, he goes to the market square to observe the body language of Prince Aderopo, who suspiciously stares at him in confidence and even <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> him that {{there is no evidence to}} prove he indeed killed the girls. Danladi visits Tawa in the school she works as a teacher, in order to question her about the relationship she has with the Prince. Danladi discovers that Aderopo and Agbekoya are both recipients of a scholarship from a Reverend Father in the town, Father Dowling (Colin David Reese). Danladi visits Agbekoya, who reveals to him that they were constantly molested by the Reverend Father in Lagos city. At a celebration on the eve of Independence, Prince Aderopo invites Tawa to their childhood hideout, which has been renovated. Danladi and Afonja try to trail them, but are unsuccessful; Agbekoya, the only other person who knows the location of the hideout, leads them to it. On getting there, Aderopo is about to make Tawa his sixth victim, representing the end of the six years of violation he received from the Reverend Father. Tawa is saved.|$|E
500|$|Some Christian writers {{worried that}} Avatar {{promotes}} pantheism and nature worship. [...] A critic for L’Osservatore Romano of the Holy See {{wrote that the}} film [...] "shows a spiritualism linked to the worship of nature, a fashionable pantheism in which creator and creation are mixed up." [...] Likewise, Vatican Radio argued that the film [...] "cleverly <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> all those pseudo-doctrines that turn ecology into {{the religion of the}} millennium. [...] Nature is no longer a creation to defend, but a divinity to worship." [...] According to Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi, these reviews reflect the Pope's views on neopaganism, or confusing nature and spirituality. On the other hand, disagreeing with the Vatican's characterization of Avatar as pagan, a writer in the National Catholic Reporter urged Christian critics to see the film in the historical context of [...] "Christianity's complicity in the conquest of the Americas" [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Eric Goldman {{rated the}} episode 8.5/10. He commented that in {{resetting}} {{the events of}} [...] "Sectionals", it [...] "felt a bit rushed", but concluded: [...] "Glee continues to work because it has its cake and eats it too. It's an over the top, overly cheerful musical – but also a biting comedy that always <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> the audience and acknowledges how cheesy musical theater can be, even while also proving how fun it is." [...] The Daily News David Hinckley shared Goldman's concerns about resetting the characters, and while he believed that doing so was the right long-term move, he commented that: [...] "the immediate effect {{is to make the}} episode feel a little jerky." [...] Hinckley felt that the episode's greatest problems were its pace and execution, observing: [...] "Too many twists and turns feel a little too sudden, leaving us not quite sure how we got from here to there." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the video, {{there are}} scenes of Spears nude covered in diamonds. The look was {{compared}} to that of Kate Bush in the music video for her 1978 single, [...] "The Man with the Child in His Eyes". Spears then enters Toxic Industries, and gains access to a vault from which she steals a vial of green poison. She accidentally triggers a laser trap when she leaves that she evades with elaborate dance moves, including a back handspring. This is followed by scenes of Spears wearing a black superheroine outfit and black hair. She scales a building and enters an apartment, where her unfaithful boyfriend (Henderson) is waiting. She kisses him just before pouring the poison into his mouth, killing him. Spears kisses him again and jumps out of the window. She lands back on the plane sporting her flight attendant outfit, and <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> the camera. The video closes with a shot of the airplane flying surrounded by doves like the beginning.|$|E
500|$|Sandy Rios, {{president}} of the Culture Campaign criticized the video on Fox News {{in an interview with}} Megyn Kelly, calling it [...] "disgusting... poison for the minds of our kids". Critic Armond White, of the New York Press, described the video as [...] "cruel and ugly" [...] also stating that it [...] "epitomizes the insanity of the contemporary pop mainstream" [...] and pays [...] "homage to Tarantino's influence" [...] in distorting [...] "pop culture pleasure into nonsense". William Goodman of Spin called the video a [...] "Whitman's sampler of pop nuggets" [...] and found a [...] "boom-pow effect of colored Japanese television." [...] He finished his review by concluding that the [...] "video must have cost a fortune" [...] and described it as a [...] "big-budget, pop masterwork". Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone called the video a [...] "mash-up of lesbian prison porn, campy sexploitation flicks and insidery <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> the two divas' public personas." [...] He noted that [...] "If Quentin Tarantino and Russ Meyer remade Thelma & Louise as an orgy of product placement with fiercely choreographed interludes, this would be the result." [...] Ganz finished his review by saying that [...] "The clip is certainly cinematic and oddly feminist, and gasps at a larger statement about consumer culture." ...|$|E
500|$|The song is {{predominantly}} upbeat, featuring Bieber's R vocals over a backdrop containing a dance infused beat, full of keyboard and [...] "disco string" [...] synths. The song is composed {{in the key}} of E♭ major with Bieber's vocal range spanning from the low-note of G3 to the high-note of C5. According to Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, the song [...] "blends <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> Fifties doo-wop with hip-hop chants", comparing the style and the lyrics [...] "My first love broke my heart for the first time/And I was like/Baby, baby, baby, ooooh/I thought you'd always be mine" [...] to fifties [...] ballads like [...] "Tears on My Pillow", [...] "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" [...] and [...] "Earth Angel". Lyrically, Bieber's lines explain his distress over his lost love, and promise to get it back, featured in lines like, [...] "And I wanna play it cool/But I'm losin' you…/I'm in pieces/So come and fix me…". The chorus features the distinct and repetitive [...] "baby, baby, baby, ohhhh (nooooo)" [...] hook. After the second verse, Ludacris comes in with the verse-rap, an anecdote of young love when he was thirteen, as it runs [...] "When I was 13/I had my first love/She had me going crazy/Oh, I was star-struck/She woke me up daily/Don't need no Starbucks…".|$|E

500|$|In 2004, {{at the age}} of 19, Mulligan {{began her}} acting career on stage in the play Forty <b>Winks</b> <b>at</b> the Royal Court Theatre in London. She made her film debut the {{following}} year in Pride & Prejudice, the 2005 film adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, portraying Kitty Bennet. Later that year, she auditioned for and won the role of orphan Ada Clare in the BAFTA award-winning BBC adaption of Charles Dickens' Bleak House, her television debut. Among her 2007 projects were My Boy Jack, starring Daniel Radcliffe, that features her in a supporting role, and Northanger Abbey. She identified with her role Elsie, the daughter of writer Rudyard Kipling, who vociferously opposes her brother going to war. She earned a Constellation Award for playing the main character Sally Sparrow in the Doctor Who episode [...] "Blink". She rounded out 2007 by appearing in an acclaimed revival of The Seagull, in which she played Nina to Kristin Scott Thomas's Arkadina and Chiwetel Ejiofor's Trigorin. The Daily Telegraph said her performance was [...] "quite extraordinarily radiating'" [...] and The Observer called her [...] "almost unbearably affecting." [...] While {{in the middle of the}} production, she had to have an appendectomy, preventing her from being able to perform for a week. For her debut Broadway performance in the 2008 American transfer of The Seagull, she was nominated for a Drama Desk Award, but lost to Angela Lansbury.|$|E
2500|$|... "A trim, grim, vicious, and {{incredibly}} effective action movie with no cut comic-relief bit players, no <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> the audience, and no stars. Just a powder keg of a premise (lifted {{in part from}} Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo), in which a quasi-terrorist group's killing spree culminates in the action described in the title. Carpenter's mastery of wide-screen and almost uncanny talent at crafting suspense and action sequences make Assault such a nerve-racking experience {{that you may have}} to reupholster your easy chair after watching it at home." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{television}} {{performance of the}} Shakespearean text was in the United States in 1950, broadcast live on CBS {{as part of the}} Westinghouse Studio One series. A heavily edited sixty-minute modern-dress performance, written by Worthington Miner and directed by Paul Nickell, it starred Lisa Kirk and Charlton Heston. Katherina's opening speech in 4.3, beginning with [...] "the more my wrong, the more his spite appears" [...] was delivered {{in the form of a}} voice-over, an unusual technique at the time. The production is also notable insofar as when she hugs Petruchio after her climactic speech, she <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> the camera. Diana E. Henderson writes [...] "this version relentlessly reiterates conventional post-war ideas of gender difference [...] the production as a whole serves to legitimatise the domestication of women." [...] In 1952, BBC Television Service screened a live adaptation as part of their Sunday Night Theatre series, directed by Desmond Davis and starring Margaret Johnston and Stanley Baker. In 1956, NBC's Hallmark Hall of Fame screened the first colour television adaptation, directed by George Schaefer, and starring Lilli Palmer and Maurice Evans (who also produced). The initial script was written by Michael Hogan, who included the Induction, and kept Sly on stage for the entire show, which culminated with him beating his own wife, much to the delight of the actors who have just performed for him. This script, however, was heavily rewritten by Hall of Fame producer William Nichols, who removed the frame. The production instead opens with Grumio (Jerome Kilty) addressing the camera directly, [...] inviting the audience to view the [...] "antic players." [...] A commedia dell'arte-style production, Katherina and Petruchio first meet in a boxing ring, with their initial encounter, literally, turning into a boxing match.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{interpretation}} {{in the modern era}} is that the speech is ironic; Katherina has not been tamed at all, she has merely duped Petruchio into thinking she has. Two especially well known examples of this interpretation are seen in the two major feature film adaptations of the play; Sam Taylor's 1929 version and Franco Zeffirelli's 1967 version. In Taylor's film, Katherina, played by Mary Pickford, <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> Bianca during the speech, indicating she does not mean a word of what she is saying. In Zeffirelli's film, Katherina, played by Elizabeth Taylor, delivers the speech as though it were her own idea, and the submission aspect is reversed by her ending the speech and leaving the room, causing Petruchio to have to run after her. Phyllis Rackin {{is an example of a}} scholar who reads the speech ironically, especially in how it deals with gender. She points out that several lines in the speech focus on the woman's body, but in the Elizabethan theatre, the role would have been played by a young boy, thus rendering any evocation of the female form as ironic. Reading the play as a satire of gender roles, she sees the speech as the culmination of this process. Along similar lines, Philippa Kelly says [...] "the body of the boy actor in Shakespeare's time would have created a sexual indeterminacy that would have undermined the patriarchal narrative, so that the taming is only apparently so. And in declaring women's passivity so extensively and performing it centre-stage, Kate might be seen to take on a kind of agency that rebukes the feminine codes of silence and obedience which she so expressly advocates." [...] Similarly, Coppélia Kahn argues the speech is really about how little Katherina has been tamed; [...] "she steals the scene from her husband, who has held the stage throughout the play, and reveals that he has failed to tame her in the sense he set out to. He has gained her outward compliance in the form of a public display, while her spirit remains mischievously free." ...|$|E
