6000|$|... "Now, Frank, {{the first}} {{question}} of all is--How is my mother? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when I was missing? It must have been awful for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady St. Simon, then, {{returned}} from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than {{she had gone to}} it. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> on re-entering her father's house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter was puzzled. He blinked {{his eyes}} and stroked his {{whiskers}} {{as he tried to}} understand what it all meant. [...] "Who is Sally Sly, and <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> that for?" [...] he finally ventured.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do I {{care for}} your maintenance, or <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she?</b> <b>Do</b> you know, sir, that you are {{talking to me about}} a lady whom I intend to make my wife,--who is engaged to marry me? Goodness gracious me!" ...|$|R
50|$|Bates' agent {{sent her}} out to {{audition}} for All That and they liked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> <b>She</b> <b>did</b> a Steve Urkel impression among other things. Following four or five auditions Bates got the part.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thrums," [...] {{he would}} say persuasively, [...] "Thrums, Thrums. You opens your mouth like this, and shuts it like this, and that's it." [...] Yet when he had coaxed her thus for many days, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> but break her long silence with the word [...] "Tommy!" [...] The recoil knocked her over.|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Was she {{grateful}} {{to me for}} my plain speaking? Did she ponder upon my words and determine to profit by them and to lead from that hour a better and nobler life? ...|$|E
6000|$|CHRIS. It {{was well}} you escaped her net: Joseph was hard put {{to it by}} her, and he escaped her as you did; but it had like to have cost him his life. But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> to you? ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was quiet}} enough now, {{to suggest the}} hope {{that she might be}} able to give Alban some {{information}} [...] "Were you with Miss de Sor," [...] he asked, [...] "before you came out here? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> to frighten you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Marguerite {{clings to}} the jewels, and accepts the young man's arm for a {{moonlight}} promenade. And when it does enter into her innocent head that he and she have walked that shady garden long enough, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when <b>she</b> has said good-bye and shut the door? She opens the ground-floor window and begins to sing! ...|$|R
50|$|Hayden Carruth {{wrote about}} The Everyday Uncommon: “It’s {{clear to me}} that <b>she</b> knows <b>what</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants to <b>do,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>does</b> it well.” The book has also {{received}} critical praise from Rhina Espaillat, R. S. Gwynn, David Mason, and Deborah Warren, among others.|$|R
40|$|Each night, in {{the hours}} between supper and bedtime, the Tear Thief carries her waterproof, silvery sack as she steals the tears of every child who cries. But <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> with all those tears? This warm, poignant and beautifully {{illustrated}} story offers a thought-provoking message and {{a starting point for}} sharing children's emotional responses. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{all young}} ladies talk well, of course. But {{what did this}} one say? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do,</b> except suffer a visible pang of {{homesickness}} {{at the sight of}} unattainable poultry? Come, you have represented the interview with Miss Blood as one of great brilliancy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mysie {{tried in}} her own persevering way to argue again that Val was only put out, and {{disappointed}} at having to turn back, to which Valetta, in spite of Gillian's endeavour to silence her, added, 'So stupid of her to come out! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it for?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{refuse to}} go. My place {{is in this}} house. Neither Lady Janet nor you can get over the plain facts. All I asked was to be confronted with her. And <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when {{she came into the}} room? She fainted at the sight of me." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> {{gets the}} bath. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Why, merely {{opens the door}} of the bathroom, which wasn't locked, and turns on the water. But, of course, no man with any chivalry in him could allow a harpy to be put to all that labour without {{pressing}} her to accept three cents as a mark of personal appreciation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{they have}} found that out," [...] said Richard. Granny looked much entertained, and laughed triumphantly and shrewdly, [...] "ay, ay, that they have, the lasses--they be sharp enough for anything, that they be. Why, when I tell little Jenny that there's the black man coming after her, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> but <b>she</b> ups and says, 'Granny, I know 'tis only {{the wind in the}} chimney.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, it's {{the luggage}} they bring," [...] said the mate, slowly {{refilling}} his pipe. [...] "What they want {{with it all}} I can't think. As soon as my old woman makes up her mind to come for a trip, tomorrow being Bank Holiday, an' she being in the mind for a outing, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Goes down Commercial Road and buys a bonnet far beyond her station." ...|$|R
6000|$|And I?--I was {{exceedingly}} tired. My {{head was}} burning like a coal; my thoughts in confusion. Suddenly I {{lost control of}} myself and broke into an angry, ridiculous sobbing. I simply sat there, my face hidden in my dry, hot hands, miserable and defeated. And strange Fanny Bowater, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{powerful}} {{argument in}} favor of kindness to animals!" [...] said Smith. [...] "One of his celebrated stud of cats came into the possession of our stenographer. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Instead of having the animal made into a nourishing soup, she restored it to its bereaved owner. Observe the sequel. We are very much obliged to Comrade Jarvis." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was much}} impeded by my rifle, having to swim {{with one hand}} while I clung to my {{precious}} weapon with the other. The girl had seen the lioness take to the water, and she had also seen that I was swimming much more slowly than she, and <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> She started to drop back to my side.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{matter is}} that I cannot be plagued with this child any longer' said Miss Ophelia. 'It is past all bearing. Here, I locked her up, {{and gave her a}} hymn to learn. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do,</b> but spy out where I put my key. She has gone to my wardrobe, taken a bonnet-trimming, and cut it all to pieces to make dolls' jackets! I never saw {{anything}} like it in my life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that gives}} us a limit. Our lady enters this room, and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> <b>She</b> {{goes over to the}} writing-table. What for? Not for {{anything}} in the drawers. If there had been anything worth her taking, it would surely have been locked up. No, it was for something in that wooden bureau. Halloa! what is that scratch upon the face of it? Just hold a match, Watson. Why did you not tell me of this, Hopkins?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{must tell}} you about the silver-edged {{waistcoat}} which Bunting gave me. Mamma asked me about it, and I told her the truth,--that it was a present from one of the boys for my kindness to him. Well, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> but writes back to Dr. Swishtail, when I went to school, thanking him for his attention to her dear son, and sending a shilling to the good and grateful little boy who had given me the waistcoat! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{had to go}} {{over the}} whole {{proposal}} twice, and word it as plainly as A B C, before she would fully take it in. And then, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Instead of faltering a sweet Yes, or maintaining a soft, confused silence (which would have been as good), she started up, walked twice fast through the room, in the way that she only does, and no other woman, and ejaculated, 'God bless me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] another lady suggested, [...] "what could Mrs. Marven have done? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> He wasn't {{asked to}} the picnic, and I don't {{see why he}} should have been treated as a guest. He was there, purely and simply, to bring the things and take them away. And, besides, if there is {{anything}} in distinctions, in differences, if we are to choose who is to associate with us--or our daughters--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was a child}} {{going along}} out there {{and asked me if}} the postman had been by and I said yes, and she said how long since I saw him and I said I hadn't seen him at all, and she said how did I know he'd been by, then, and I said because I smelt his track on the sidewalk, and she said I was a dum fool and made a mouth at me. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> that for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's all Wilmet's fault,' said Bernard. 'She never {{gives one}} {{anything}} fit to eat. There was that beastly lamp out there {{went and got}} broke, and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> but crib it out of our grub! Now, Lance, was any living soul served like that before? She gave us only that beastly stir-about at breakfast' (Bernard worked his single adjective hard),' no butter nor sugar at tea, and no pudding, except when there's that beastly mess of rice.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The case is, that I {{cannot be}} plagued with this child, any longer! It's past all bearing; {{flesh and blood}} cannot endure it! Here, I locked her up, {{and gave her a}} hymn to study; and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do,</b> but spy out where I put my key, and has gone to my bureau, and got a bonnet-trimming, and cut it all to pieces to make dolls' jackets! I never saw {{anything}} like it, in my life!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As I {{hope to be}} saved, Miss Emily, I {{can only}} guess as you do--I don't rightly know. My {{mistress}} trusted me half way, as it were. I'm afraid I have a rough tongue of my own sometimes. I offended her--and from that time she kept her own counsel. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in the dark, so far as I was concerned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cruel, cruel deserter! Oh, Jane, {{what did}} I feel when I {{discovered}} you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after examining your apartment, ascertained {{that you had}} taken no money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent! A pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left corded and locked {{as they had been}} prepared for the bridal tour. What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless? And <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Let me hear now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> What did she say?" [...] Lapham was ready, in his dense pride, {{to resent}} any affront to his blood, but doubtful, with the {{evidence}} of this invitation to the contrary, if any affront had been offered. Mrs. Lapham tried to tell him, but there was really nothing tangible; {{and when she came}} to put it into words, she could not make out a case. Her husband listened to her excited attempt, and then he said, with judicial superiority, [...] "I guess nobody's been trying to make you feel bad, Persis. What would she go right home and invite you to dinner for, if she'd acted the way you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will," [...] he responded, impulsively. [...] "Yes, that's right. I {{did it for}} a girl--and afterward, when I was on the run, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Threw me down! Told {{everything}} she knew--the little coyote--and here I am hunted like a wolf on account of it." [...] His face settled into savage lines for a moment. But even as he sat thus another light came into his eyes. His gaze took account of Alice's lips and the delicate, rounded whiteness of her neck and chin. Her like {{he had never met}} before. The girls he had known giggled; this one smiled. His sweetheart used slang and talked of cattle like a herder, but this woman's voice, so sweet and flexible, made delightfully strange music to his ears.|$|E
60|$|The coal--il carbone! I {{knew we were}} in for it. England--l'Inghilterra she has the coal. And <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> <b>She</b> sells it very dear. Particularly to Italy. Italy won the war and now can't {{even have}} coal. Because why! The price. The exchange! Il cambio. Now I am doubly in for it. Two {{countries}} {{had been able to}} keep their money high--England and America. The English sovereign--la sterlina--and the American dollar--sa, these were money. The English and the Americans flocked to Italy, with their sterline and their dollari, and they bought what they wanted for nothing, for nothing. Ecco! Whereas we poor Italians--we {{are in a state of}} ruination--proper ruination. The allies, etc., etc.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{body image and}} its main focus is to analyze the {{attitude}} of a typical Czech consumer {{in connection with this}} issue. Its main topic is to find out the proper response for the question: How important is for a typical Czech consumer to look well and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> to look this way? Further analysis deals with the attitude of cosmetic producers to body image, how important it is for them and to compare the relationship between a typical Czech consumer and the cosmetic producers to body image...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you mean," [...] he said; [...] "and if it did--But it is my mother's neglect; there is the {{bitterness}} of it. Why, you and my father tried to stir her up {{to it in the}} spring, and she would not; and then, when for very shame <b>she</b> must attend, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> but let me go muddling on with that old woman Wells! She has regularly thrown my sight away, as much as if she had pulled my eyes out and thrown them over the hedge." ...|$|R
