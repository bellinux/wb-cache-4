25|$|Composition of isometries mixes kinds in {{assorted}} ways. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{the identity}} as either two mirrors or none; either way, {{it has no}} effect in composition. And two reflections give either a translation or a rotation, or the identity (which is both, in a trivial way). Reflection composed with either of these could cancel down to a single reflection; otherwise it gives the only available three-mirror isometry, a glide reflection. A pair of translations always reduces to a single translation; so the challenging cases involve rotations. We know a rotation composed with either a rotation or a translation must produce an even isometry. Composition with translation produces another rotation (by the same amount, with shifted fixed point), but composition with rotation can yield either translation or rotation. It is often said that composition of two rotations produces a rotation, and Euler proved a theorem to that effect in 3D; however, this is only true for rotations sharing a fixed point.|$|E

40|$|My {{research}} is {{an investigation into}} the mathematical foundations of supersymmetry, especially the theories of superstrings and supergravity. Over the past 30 years, string theory and related ideas have proven to be connected to many beautiful notions in differential geometry, such as mirror symmetry [Kontsevich] and gerbes [Brylinski, Freed and Witten]. The overarching goal of my work is to extend the tools of differential geometry, formulating a kind of “categorified differential geometry” suitable for superstring theory, M theory and supergravity. Categorification is the process of replacing set-based mathematics with mathematics based on categories—it has the effect of boosting up dimensions so that mathematics used for the description of point particles becomes appropriate for extended objects: strings and membranes. Through categorification, the tools of gauge theory, which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> loosely <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as the mathematics for describing the parallel transport of point particles, become higher gauge theory, which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> loosely <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as the mathematics for describing the parallel transport of strings, membranes and higher [Baez and Schreiber]. Into this categorification process, one can introduce supersymmetry, which is mathematics with a Z 2 -grading throughout. Discovered in the 1970 s by physicists, it is an early example o...|$|R
