Method of determination for <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> in the research area was developed based on different methods of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> that {{were used for the}} various regions of the world. Determination of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> in the Northwest Anatolia was carried out by interpretations of the synoptic maps (00 : 00 GMT), atmospheric events and climatic elements. Thirteen <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> that are occurred depending on seven genetic systems were determined for the study area. Different parts of the pressure systems and weather fronts together led to occurring of various <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> Determined <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> are divided into three groups: a) Annual: front of the mid-latitude depressions; north of the mid-latitude depressions; south of the mid-latitude depressions; middle of the Azores high; north of the Azores high; south of the Azores high. b) Cold period: the Azores high/the Siberian high; middle of the Siberian high; west of the Siberian high; south of the Siberian high. c) Warm period: the Azores high/the Basra low, and the Basra low. <b>Weather</b> <b>types</b> that were determined for the North-west Anatolia has a great ability to explain occurrence of the climatic features and conditions.

Despite the introduction of the desert boot at the time of Operation Desert Storm, many American military personnel were still issued jungle boots because there were not enough desert boots to issue to all personnel in the Middle East at the time, which led to many American soldiers and Marines to go into battle with jungle boots and black leather combat boots. During Operation Enduring Freedom, US Army and Marine personnel were seen wearing black jungle boots and black leather speedlace combat boots alongside the newer desert boots while on combat operations in Afghanistan during the early 2000s.|$|E

The aim was to deepen {{the understanding of the}} relationship between Lamb-Jenkinson weather types and surface ozone concentration variation, thus widening the application of the <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> analysis of air quality at 4 sites in this region. The long-range transport patterns associated with high-ozone events were classified into trajectories from Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and in the vicinity of southern Sweden (VIC). The VIC type, characterized by short and whirling curves, represented more than 40 % of the high-ozone events at the studied rural sites. More than half of the high-ozone events occurred under high-pressure condi-tions, belonging to <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> A (anticyclones). The high correlation coefficient between annual counts of <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> A and those of long-range transport pattern VIC confirmed the strong link between stagnant weather conditions and high-ozone events, especially during the summer. Furthermore, a strong linear anticorrelation was detected between high-ozone events and annual counts of <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> C (cyclones) during the summer. This relationship implies that the frequency of <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> C is a useful indicator for low risk of summertime high-ozone events in southern Sweden.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the spatial}} and temporal variability of winter droughts in a semi-arid geographic gradient in Northeast Spain, from the Pyrenees in the north to the Mediterranean coastland in the south. Droughts that occurred between 1952 and 1999 were analysed {{by means of the}} Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The influence of the weather-type frequency and of the general North Atlantic atmospheric circulation patterns was analysed. The results indicate that winter droughts show an important spatial variability in the study area, differentiating three well-defined patterns. These correspond to the Pyrenees, the centre of the Ebro Valley, and the Mediterranean coastland. General negative trends in winter SPI have been found, which are indicative of the increase in winter drought conditions in the study area. Nevertheless, important spatial differences have also been recorded. Dominant north-south gradients in the influence of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> are shown. Moreover, the negative trends in winter-SPI values agree with the negative trend in the frequency of the <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> prone to cause precipitation, such as the C, SW and W <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> and the increase in the frequency of A <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean coastland, the positive trend in SPI values agrees with the increase in the frequency of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> of the east (E, SE), which are prone to cause precipitation in this area. Interannual variations in the frequency of the different <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> have been highly determined by different general atmospheric circulation patterns, mainly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Nevertheless, the correlation between the time series of weather-type frequency and the winter SPI is higher than that found between the SPI and the NAO. Thus, although the interannual NAO variability explains a high percentage of the interannual differences in the frequency of different <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> it is not sufficient to explain the {{spatial and temporal}} variability of droughts, which respond better to atmospheric variability at more detailed (synoptic) spatial scales...|$|R
40|$|In the {{transportation}} literature {{in general and}} the travel behaviour literature specifically, there is no consensus on the representation of weather in behavioural models, ranging from studies that use direct meteorological measurements, such a continuous variable for inches of rainfall or temperature, to indicator variables (which themselves are often subjectively derived) for qualitative weather assessments. To explore the representation of weather, this paper develops constructs of weather based upon cluster analysis of various daily weather characteristics and test the validity of these weather representations against two dimensions of travel behaviour: mode share and trip generation. Using Sydney, AUS as a case study, ten years of hourly weather data for the region are reduced using a two-stage cluster analysis technique, resulting in 17 meteorologically distinct <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> These <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> are then tested for their correlation with one way of data from the Sydney area Household Travel Survey. Initial results comparing mode shares with <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> indicate that the <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> can be further reduced into fewer types.

40|$|Synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>typing</b> {{depends on}} the method and its implementation. This paper {{demonstrates}} the utility of a 2 -phase batch self-organising map procedure (CP 2) in comparison with a procedure (CP 1) consisting of T-mode principal component analysis followed by convergent K-means clustering, for classifying the synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> over east Australia. Four classifications were obtained for the 52 -year NCEP/NCAR dataset, one from CP 1 and three from CP 2. These classifications were examined in terms of grouping quality, mean type maps, type frequencies, lifetime and transitions, and {{in relation to the}} Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The results showed that the classifications derived from different procedures are inter-confirmative and capture a similar set of major synoptic situations influencing east Australia, each having counterparts in previous studies and conforming well to local synoptic experience. In particular, this study demonstrates that CP 2 is a promising tool for the purpose of <b>weather</b> <b>typing</b> with a two-fold utility: CP 2 can perform data projection (neighbourhood width > = 1) and provide a flexible means for visualising the broad distribution of the daily weather patterns in the dataset; and the procedure can also conduct cluster analysis (neighbourhood width = 0) and produce results equ ivalent to those from CP 1. It was found that performing data clustering or data projection may affect the inference associated with type frequencies. While focusing on methodology, the analysis has also shown that the frequency of synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> fluctuates on the seasonal, interannual, and decadal scales. From the 1970 s to 1995 there was a decline in the occurrence of a few <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> associated with an east-coast trough extending over New South Wales from the north, and a slight increase in the activity of some anticyclonic types.

ObjectiveTo investigate the air pollution–mortality relationship within weather types and seasons, and to determine which combination of atmospheric conditions may pose increased health threats in the elderly age categories. MethodsThe relative risk of mortality (RR) due to air pollution was examined using Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs) within specific weather types. Analysis was completed by <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> and age group (all ages, ≤ 64, 65 – 74, 75 – 84, ≥ 85 years) in ten Canadian cities from 1981 to 1999. ResultsThere was significant modification of RR by <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> and age. When examining the entire population, <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> was shown to have the greatest modifying effect on the risk of dying due to ozone (O 3). This effect was highest on average for the dry tropical (DT) <b>weather</b> <b>type,</b> with the all-age RR of mortality at a population weighted mean (PWM) found to be 1. 055 (95 % CI 1. 026 – 1. 085). All-weather type risk estimates increased with age due to exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and sulphur dioxide (SO 2). On average, RR increased by 2. 6, 3. 8 and 1. 5 % for the respective pollutants between the ≤ 64 and ≥ 85 age categories. Conversely, mean ozone estimates remained relatively consistent with age. Elevated levels of air pollution were found to be detrimental to the health of elderly individuals for all weather types. However, the entire population was negatively effected by air pollution on the hot dry (DT) and hot humid (MT) days. ConclusionsWe identified a significant modification of RR for mortality due to air pollution by age, which is enhanced under specific weather types. Efforts should be targeted at minimizing pollutant exposure to the elderly and/or all age groups with respect to <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> in question...|$|E

40|$|Variations in {{precipitation}} in Yorkshire, UK, {{are linked}} to large-scale atmospheric circulation using the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, objective Lamb <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> and long-term seasonal and annual precipitation indices at seven sites. Since the 1960 s, {{a significant decrease in}} summer precipitation has been observed across the region, with increasing winter precipitation at western locations since 1970. At western sites, precipitation is highly correlated to the NAO, with positive and negative winter-NAO indices producing anomalies from the long-term winter precipitation average of 112 % and 77 % respectively. The recent winter half-year precipitation increase is concentrated in March and related to a large increase in monthly NAO and the increased occurrence of westerly <b>weather</b> <b>types.</b> The decrease in summer precipitation, however, is caused by both declining receipt from westerly <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> and their decreased occurrence. This is significantly correlated to a decreasing summer index for the NAO.

The Schüepp synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> of the Alps (SYNALP) classification from the Alpine Weather Statistics (AWS) was used to define the synoptic meteorology over the whole Swiss region. The seasonal contribution of each synoptic <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> to the aerosol concentration was deduced from the aerosol annual cycles while the planetary boundary layer (PBL) influence was estimated by means of the diurnal cycles. Since aerosols are scavenged by precipitation, the diurnal cycle of the CO concentration was also used to identify polluted air masses.

The aerosol optical parameters and number concentration show elevated loadings during advective weather types during the December–March period and for the convective anticyclonic and convective indifferent weather types during the April–September period. This study confirms the consensus view that the JFJ is mainly influenced by the free troposphere during winter and by injection of air parcels from the PBL during summer.

Spatio-temporal dynamics and correlation structures among the variables of interest, as well as weather persistence and natural variability have to be reproduced accurately in a distributional sense. This quest leads to a large variety of so-called stochastic weather generators (WGs) in the literature. Here, we provide an up-to-date overview of <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> WG models. Weather types classically represent daily characteristics of the relevant atmospheric information at hand. There {{are many ways to}} build such weather states, either hidden or observed, and to infer their properties. This overview should help statisticians as well as meteorologists and climate product users to understand the probabilistic concepts and models behind <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> WGs, and to identify their advantages and limits...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{rainfall}} distribution {{is affected by}} the type of the prevailing weather situation as well as by local geographical factors, such us orography and latitude. The study of the areal distribution of rainfall is important especially when physiographic and climatological conditions vary over the same region causing different rainfall regimes. In this research, the influence of the prevailing <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> to the geographical distribution of the intense daily rainfall is studied. The study area is the Sterea Hellas region (Central Greece) and consists of three (among the fourteen) different water districts of Greece. The Pindos mountain chain in the west side of this region gives rise to heavy orographic rainfall and causes a wetter rainfall regime as compared with that of the east side. Daily data from 71 rain gages and hourly data from three rain recorders over a 20 year period are used. From these data sets, the intense rainfall events were extracted and analyzed. The intense rainfall days are classified according to the prevailing <b>weather</b> <b>type</b> using a daily calendar of synoptic weather types in Greece. Several methods (also including the available tools of a Geographical Information System) are used for the analysis and comparison of {{rainfall distribution}}s. The results of these methods are statistically analyzed to trace similarities in geographical distribution of rainfall produced by a specific <b>weather</b> <b>type,</b> and dissimilarities in the distribution of rainfall produced by different weather types. Overall, the analysis shows that different weather types affect the location and other characteristics of rainfall in the study area...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a classification of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> in the Mediterranean Basin based on cluster {{analysis of the}} daily occurrences of several surface pressure centers and the subjective identification of 500 hPa trough axis positions (1992 – 1996). The procedure results in 20 types that explain 69 % of overall pressure center variance and which {{are consistent with the}} seasonal succession of regional circula-tion. The development of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> in winter is primarily controlled by the eastward propagation of baro-tropic waves while departures from the zonal flow pattern in summer tend to be linked to blocked stationary pools. H 1 -types with anticyclonic circulation in the Western Medi-terranean and cyclonic flow in the eastern part are well interrelated with zonal and anticyclonic general <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> in Central Europe. H 2 -types featuring a weak Azores Anticyclone interrelate with a variety of meridional circu-lation types after the Hess and Brezowski (1969) classifica-tion. The 20 types explain rainfall variance in the core Mediterranean regions (as defined by principal components) to a high degree while rainfall variance in marginal regions is influenced by circulation patterns not being typical for the Mediterranean Basin. 1...|$|R
40|$|A k-means cluster {{analysis}} {{is used to}} summarize unfiltered daily atmospheric variability at regional scale over the western Sahel and eastern tropical North Atlantic during the boreal summer season [July– September (JAS) ] 1961 – 98. The analysis employs zonal and meridional regional wind fields at 925, 700, and 200 hPa from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalyses. An eight-cluster solution is shown to yield an integrated view of the complex regional circulation variability, {{without the need for}} explicit time filtering. Five of the <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> identified characterize mostly typical phases of westward-moving wave disturbances, such as African easterly waves (AEWs), and persistent monsoon surges, while the three others describe mostly different stages of the seasonal cycle. Their temporal se-quencing describes a systematic monsoonal evolution, together with considerable variability at subseasonal and interannual time scales. Daily rainfall occurrence at 13 gauge stations in Senegal is found to be moderately well conditioned by the eight <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> with positive rainfall anomalies usually associated with southerly wind anomalies at 925 hPa. Interannual variability of daily rainfall frequency is shown to depend substantially on the frequency of occurrence of <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> specific to {{the beginning and end of}} the JAS season, together wit...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for conditional analysis of {{spatial and temporal}} (1961 – 2007) variations in rainfall under different synoptic situations and different geographic sub-regions, using Cumbria in NW England as a study area. A daily synoptic typing scheme, the Lamb Weather Catalogue, was applied to identify rainfall under three different weather types: south-westerly (SW), westerly (W) and cyclonic (C). Topographic descriptors developed using GIS were used to classify rain gauges into six geographic sub-regions: coastal, windward-lowland, windward-upland, leeward-upland, leeward-lowland, secondary upland. Examining temporal rainfall trends associated with different <b>weather</b> <b>types,</b> in different geographic sub-regions, reveals useful information on changes in rainfall processes. The total rainfall under SW and W <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> is increasing, particularly in upland regions. The increase in SW rainfall is driven by more frequent wet-days, whereas the increase in W rainfall is driven by increases in both wet-day frequency and yield per wet-day. The rainfall under C <b>weather</b> <b>types</b> is decreasing. Combining GIS and synoptic climatology gives insights into rainfall processes under a changing climate. The conditional analysis method can be applied at both local and regional scales, and its success {{is largely due to}} the ability of GIS to integrate, visualise, and efficiently model spatial data...|$|R
