5|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{studio in}} New York, this {{place called the}} Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
25|$|For {{political}} reasons, Pakistan claims {{victory in}} the 1965 war. In my opinion, the war ended {{in a kind of}} stalemate. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position of strength. Had the war continued for a few more days, we would have gained a decisive victory. I advised then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri not to agree for ceasefire. But I think he was under pressure from the United Nations and some countries.|$|E
25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 {{and wanted to be}} in business with us if they could. What happened was that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E

500|$|For Miranda's actual look, Streep {{looked to}} two women. The bouffant hairstyle was {{inspired}} by model and actress Carmen Dell'Orefice , which Streep {{said she wanted to}} blend with [...] "the unassailable elegance and authority of [...] Christine Lagarde." [...] The costumes Field designed for that look resulted in numerous blown takes during the montage where Miranda repeatedly throws her overcoat on Andrea's desk when she arrives in the morning. When McKenna saw Streep as Miranda {{for the first time on}} set, she recalls being so terrified she threw her arm in front of Frankel [...] "like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car wreck." ...|$|E
500|$|Lydia {{discovered}} Zoe's true intentions for befriending her, {{and set out}} to take revenge. In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E
500|$|Marcel {{provided}} Warren with a filming slot on {{the wooded}} backlot of Shepperton Studios, {{located on the}} River Ash. Several scenes feature a bridge that had previously appeared in Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965). In addition, production designer Hayden Pearce secured {{the use of the}} manor house in Littleton Park (the studios' original site) to serve as the location of Jessica and Jo's country home. Of the filming arrangements, Warren comments: [...] "This really was quite a unique situation because ... here <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> studio looking at a real house and real rooms as if shooting on location." [...] The crew were permitted to redecorate the rooms as necessary and, to this end, make use of any of the items in the studios' prop store. Warren states that this resulted in a [...] "crazy" [...] mixture of decors that [...] "certainly helped create the right atmosphere" [...] for the film.|$|E

500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
500|$|Assistant manager Harry Redknapp {{was also}} now taking {{a bigger role}} in the {{transfer}} of players, with the club's approval. With rumours of his old club AFC Bournemouth being prepared to offer him a position, the West Ham board and their managing director, Peter Storrie, made a controversial move. The board were anxious not to lose Redknapp's services and offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the club—on the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and {{walked away from the}} club. His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling. Peter Storrie claimed they that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, [...] "If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> no-win situation. We're sad that Bill is going, and it's a big blow but it's time to move on and we have appointed a great manager." ...|$|E

I'm not—we typically would not say of ourselves <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 'classified' position. You're kind of undercover or overt employees." ...|$|E

He {{was among the first}} members of Fatah to call for talks with moderate Israelis, doing so in 1977.

2500|$|During Australia's second innings, Slater hit 45 from 55 {{deliveries}} before departing to Fraser and Angel, nightwatchman on {{the third}} evening, was run out by his captain, England reducing the Australians to 123/5. Blewett and Steve Waugh then hit a partnership of 203 at almost a run a minute. Blewett's 115 (158 balls, 19 fours) pleased the batsman who argued that [...] "I enjoyed this more ... I'm rapt because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bit of trouble when I came in." [...] England's catchers dropped a total of eleven chances in the match, {{and by the time}} that Taylor declared at 345/8, England were left with 104 overs to score 453.|$|E
2500|$|For {{much of the}} 1990s, Roubini {{combined}} {{academic research}} with policy making by teaching at Yale and then in New York, while also being employed at the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve, World Bank, and Bank of Israel.

Long study of emerging market blowouts in Asia and Latin America helped him spot the looming disaster in the U.S. [...] "I’ve been studying emerging markets for 20 years, and saw the same signs in the U.S. that I saw in them, which was that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> massive credit bubble," [...] he said.|$|E

It's dangerous to live too much in this kind of bubble. We had the chance to distance ourselves a bit from everything that happened since 1996 up until now. I also had the occasion to reflect to the montagne russe that is my personal life after these seven years. The ghosts I'm talking about are the people, the events you're wearing into your soul consciously or not." ...|$|E

Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 1999 book, Isaac's Storm:I remember now that {{it seemed as if}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bowl looking up toward the level of the sea.

2500|$|Sometime {{during the}} night of March 17 - morning of March 18, three cars parked at an {{evacuation}} center in Yamadamachi, Iwate had their tanks filled up and two 20-liter containers of heating oil were left outside the center by an unknown person. An evacuee discovered the donation upon starting his car and noticing his fuel gauge go from nearly empty to full. The evacuee noted: [...] "We had hardly any fuel left. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> real pinch. I'm so grateful for the donation. I reckon it was Tiger Mask." [...] The evacuation center noted that they would use the heating oil {{during the night}} to conserve fuel due to the ongoing crisis.
