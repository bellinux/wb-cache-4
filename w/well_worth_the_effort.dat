40|$|Many {{industries}} have embraced total quality {{to achieve a}} competitive edge in the international marketplace. What is not always understood in the beginning, however, is that implementing a total quality program introduces considerable and often drastic cultural change into the organization. It would be beneficial for any company considering such change {{to look at a}} few case studies to anticipate what might happen over time, and avoid unintended consequences. Implementing cultural change within an organization is always challenging, {{but in the case of}} quality, it should be a win-win proposition. Unfortunately, outcomes are not always as anticipated. In this real case study, critical mistakes in communication at the planning stage, and failure to foresee potential problem areas almost blocked the change before it could be fully implemented and did reduce its’ eventual effect. Process improvements, however, though modest by original intent, have been <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts.</b> Lessons learned from this case should be helpful to others considering or planning a major cultural change. For this qualitative research all data were obtained through direct observation in the plant and through confidential conversations with both hourly (union) and salaried (management) personnel at regular intervals over the period of the study.

These core concepts [...] that have implications for citizen-agency relationships that rage from adversarial to citizen-centered [...] are offered as an initial framework that can be applied to environmental management.

40|$|Fluoride in {{solution}} is most usually measured with the ion-specific electrode, {{although a few}} other methods are available. The electrode {{can be used in}} a straightforward manner, its lower concentration limit may be extended by special methods such as the standard addition of fluoride, or microdiffusion methods may be used to extract fluoride from the sample and concentrate it in base. Specifications of all methods are tabulated. A choice of method depends on the requirements in terms of specifications but also on the personal experience of the investigator and the required robustness. Microdiffusion of some kind is preferable for concentrations below 5 -mu-mol/L or when electrode interfering molecules such as proteins are present in rather high concentrations. Fluoride in enamel may be determined by removal of layers by etching, abrasion, or microdrilling, followed by dissolution of the layer removed. Specifications of depth and area resolution are tabulated. Alternatively, probing methods of a physical nature can be used. These methods require sophisticated instruments that are not widely available. Some of them are destructive, others are not. All but one require exposure to vacuum. However, most of them combine a very good sensitivity with a very good resolution in depth and/or measured area. Therefore, their use in research (requiring cooperation with instrument specialists/owners) may <b>well</b> be <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{implementation}} of a high performance layered video codec, designed for deployment in bandwidth heterogeneous networks. The codec combines wavelet based subband decomposition and discrete cosine transforms to facilitate layered spatial and SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) coding for bitrate adaption {{to a wide range}} of receiver capabilities. We show how a test video stream can be partitioned into several distinct layers of increasing visual quality and bandwidth requirements, with the difference between highest and lowest requirement being 47 : 1. Through the use of the Visual Instruction Set on SUN's UltraSPARC platform we demonstrate how SIMD parallel image processing enables real-time layered encoding and decoding in software. Our 384 320 24 -bit test video stream is partitioned into 21 layers at a speed of 39 frames per second and reconstructed at 28 frames per second.

50|$|Beginning in November 1985, WFNC {{began to}} run ads or local teasers in the Fayetteville Observer {{newspaper}} showing the 9 slowly rolling to a 6 in its frequency. The ad showed on the actual day of the switch the new 640 logo. After almost 40 years on 940 kHz it was decided the night time signal needed improvement. Being on 940 kHz, WFNC could not transmit a signal north at night, since it had to protect the stations broadcasting from Canada. At sunset, when WFNC lowered power and changed to directional antenna, there were citizens a short distance north of town that could not hear the station due to definitive signal change. By changing to 640 kHz, WFNC could have a 1000 watt night signal with a uniform circular pattern, which in essence increased its range to areas that had never heard WFNC after dark. The negative {{of all of that}} was that WFNC had to reduce its daytime power from 50,000 watts down to 10,000 watts, but to Mr. Dawson, that was <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to get more night time listeners.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{decrease}} in interconnect capacitance {{that can be achieved}} by the use of mesa-shaped wires. A methodology for creating mesa interconnect is described that uses simple postprocessing steps following standard CMOS IC foundry processes. By removing the oxide between metal lines and replacing it with air, the fringing capacitance between metal lines and the substrate is reduced as is the capacitance between adjacent metal lines. The decrease in capacitance resulting from the removal of the oxide between metal conductors is predicted using a 2 -D electrostatic field solver and verified by measurements on test structures fabricated in an 0. 5 µ HP CMOS process. Capacitance of mesa interconnect structures was reduced by roughly 40 % for these test structures. For circuits dominated by interconnect capacitance, cutting the parasitic capacitance by 40 % cuts the power dissipation by 40 % and cuts the gate delay by 40 %. Therefore the power-delay product is reduced by roughly 65 % and the energy-delay product is reduced by roughly 80 %. Although many issues must still be addressed to make this form of interconnect practical, the results presented in this paper suggest that the rewards in terms of decreasing capacitance could <b>well</b> be <b>worth</b> investing <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to solve these issues. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: The American Center for Reproductive Medicine's summer {{internship}} {{course in}} reproductive medicine and research at Cleveland Clinic is a rigorous, results-oriented annual program {{that began in}} 2008 to train both local and international students in the fundamentals of scientific research and writing. The foremost goal {{of the program is}} to encourage premedical and medical students to aspire toward a career as a physician–scientist. The internship provides participants with an opportunity to engage in original bench research and scientific writing while developing theoretical knowledge and soft skills. This study describes selected survey responses from interns who participated in the 2014 internship program. The objective of these surveys was to elicit the interns' perspective on the internship program, its strengths and weaknesses, and to obtain insight into potential areas for improvement. Methods: Questionnaires were structured around the five fundamental aspects of the program: 1) theoretical knowledge, 2) bench research, 3) scientific writing, 4) mentorship, and 5) soft skills. In addition, an exit survey gathered information on factors that attracted the interns to the program, communication with mentors, and overall impression of the research program. Results: The opportunity to experience hands-on bench research and scientific writing, personalized mentorship, and the reputation of the institution were appreciated and ranked highly among the interns. Nearly 90 % of the interns responded that the program was beneficial and <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> time and <b>effort</b> invested by both interns and faculty.
