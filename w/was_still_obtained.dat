It is at around this time that Giuseppucci {{met for the first}} time Nicolino Selis, known as Er Sardo (because he was born in Nuoro), a close associate and godson of Raffaele Cutolo. He, too, was in control of a rather large batteria and had begun seeking to achieve the same unity between criminal groups that Er Negro was trying to achieve. Selis and his group soon joined up with Giuseppucci and the others and became the main link between the Banda della Magliana and the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, which was the first supplier of drugs for the organization.|$|E

Masker pulses consisted of either one or eight sinusoidal components and were either synchronous or asynchronous with the signal pulses. Effects of pulse rate and asynchronous gating were generally consistent with a reduction in informational masking due to segregation of the signal and masker streams.

40|$|The carbonylation of {{dimethyl}} ether to methyl acetate over H-mordenite (HMOR) and pyridine-modified HMOR was compared. The catalytic stability of HMOR was improved significantly by pyridine pre-adsorption, and a yield of methyl acetate similar to 30 % <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>obtained</b> after 48 h on stream at 473 K.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{technique}} for studying the activation of semantic and phonological codes in speech planning using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) that extend a well-established behavioral procedure from speech production research. It combines a delayed picture-naming task with a priming procedure. While participants prepared {{the production of a}} depicted object's name, they heard an auditory target word. If the prepared picture name and the target word were semantically or phonologically related, the ERP waveform to the target word tended less towards the negative when compared to an unrelated control. These effects were widely distributed. By contrast, if participants performed a nonlinguistic task on the depicted object (natural size judgment), the semantic effect <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>obtained</b> while the phonological effect disappeared. This suggests that the former effect indexes semantic activation involved in object processing while the latter effect indexes word-form activation specific to lexical processing.

Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and {{transmission electron microscope}} images revealed that the porous carbons exhibit hierarchical porous structures with meso/macropores and micropores. Electric double layer capacitor performance of the porous carbons was investigated in an organic electrolyte of 1 M LiClO 4 in propylene carbonate and dimethoxy ethane.

In addition, the large capacitance <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>obtained</b> at a large current density up to 10 A g- 1, which satisfies demands from the high power application such as hybrid electric vehicles. Capacitance analysis of the hierarchical porous structures revealed the contribution of meso/macropores and micropore to the electric double layer capacitance to be 8. 4 and 8. 1 μF cm- 2, respectively.

We show that the loading phase can be prolonged up to 7 h and that the optimal length of PVS 2 treatment is 30 - 50 min at 0 degreesC. Ultra rapid freezing and thawing rates proved to be essential for high and reproducible post-thaw regeneration rates. This results in an increase of 23 - 46 % compared to the normal cryovial freezing protocol. When the optimal procedure was applied to 56 accessions belonging to eight different genomic groups of Musa spp. and one Ensete spp., an average of 52. 9 % post-thaw regeneration was obtained. These results were relatively genotype independent. Only wild diploid Musa acuminata accessions proved to be somewhat more recalcitrant towards cryopreservation though an acceptable average regeneration rate of 39 % <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>obtained.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Extinction {{is a very}} {{relevant}} learning phenomenon from an applied and theoretical point of view. Extinction-based therapies constitute the most widespread empirically validated treatment of anxiety disorders. However, they face an important limitation, as relapse often takes place once the extinction procedure has been completed. We provide the first demonstration of relapse reduction, a slowed reacquisition, in human contingency learning after a partial extinction procedure using mild aversive stimuli. This effect was specific of the partial extinction treatment (i. e., reinforced trials were occasionally experienced during extinction; Experiment 1) and not only {{due to differences in}} uncertainty levels between the partial and a standard extinction group (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 explored conditions in which partial extinction was complete, while the slowed reacquisition effect <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>obtained.</b> Potential uses of this strategy in anxiety disorders therapies, its theoretical explanation and its current limitations are discussed.

In chronological order, we can show the transfer of scientific results of neurophysiological research into an existing neuromonitoring system and product {{which can be used}} by non-experts in medical technology in the operating room environment. All neurophysiology functions were realized in an intuitive graphical user interface. To stimulate the autonomous nerves, a specialized parameter paradigm was used, different from motor nerve stimulation. In the background, a complex signal processing algorithm recorded smooth muscle and bladder manometry data in synchronized time and automatically detected neurophysiological signals.

The light-minus-dark ATP levels (JATP) from aerobic cells of Chlorella and Anacystis were negative; however, JATP from Synechococcus was positive.

40|$|Adaptation to slowed-down or speeded-up {{videos of}} natural scenes {{depicting}} human locomotion causes later videos played at standard playback speed to appear too fast or too slow respectively (re-normalisation; ECVP 2015, 2016).

As a test for the involvement of high-level motion processes, we measured adaptation to locomotion speed using point-light walker (PLW) stimuli which varied in retinal size and facing direction while walking at a fixed locomotion speed. An after-effect of apparent locomotion speed was obtained using PLW adapting and test displays which {{was similar to the}} effect obtained with full-videos, and also transferred to test displays containing full-cue videos.

We collected data from 5, 158 individuals over 40 years of age from a cross-sectional study in Nanjing, China. Anthropometric, demographic, hemodynamic measurements and arterial stiffness measured through brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were obtained. Subjects were grouped by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and visceral adiposity index (VAI), a sex-specific index based on BMI, WC, triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The multivariate regression analysis revealed a negative but weak effect of BMI (β = - 0. 047, P 0. 05), it <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>obtained</b> between baPWV and VAI quartile (P 0. 05).

40|$|The {{interstitial}} cell of hydra is a multipotent stem cell, {{which produces}} nerve cells {{as one of}} its differentiated cell types. The amount of interstitial cell commitment to nerve differentiation varies in an axially dependent pattern along the body column. The distribution of nerve cell density has the same equivalent axial pattern. These facts have led to speculation that the regulation of nerve cell commitment is dictated by the nerve cell density. We examined this question by assaying interstitial cell commitment behaviour in 2 cases where the normal nerve cell density of the tissue had been perturbed: (1) in epithelial hydra in which no nerve cells were present; and (2) in hydra derived from regenerating-tip isolates in which the nerve density was increased nearly 4 -fold. We found no evidence of regulation of nerve cell commitment in response to the abnormal nerve cell densities. However, the typical axial pattern of nerve commitment <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>obtained</b> in both sets of experiments, which suggests that interstitial cell commitment to nerve differentiation is dependent on some parameter of axial location that is not associated directly with the local nerve cell density...|$|E

The MoO 2 @C composite has a mesoporous structure with a surface area of 45. 7 m 2 g- 1, and a typical pore size of 3. 8 nm. When applied as an anode for lithium ion batteries, the MoO 2 @C electrode exhibits not only high reversible capacity, but also remarkable rate capability and excellent cycling stability.
