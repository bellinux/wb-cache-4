Cells ceased proliferation and differentiated when FGF 4, heparin, and REF conditioned medium were removed. Differentiation was characterized by a decline of stem cell-associated marker gene expression, the appearance of large polyploid cells (trophoblast giant cells), and the expression of trophoblast differentiation-associated genes. Collectively, the data indicate that the rat blastocyst-derived cell lines not only possess many features characteristic of mouse TS cells but also possess some distinct properties.

40|$|Introduction: Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESCs) are {{pluripotent}} cells {{derived from the}} inner cell mass(ICM) of blastocysts. A <b>feeder</b> <b>layer</b> and cytokines <b>are</b> necessary for culture of these embryonic cellsin most species. The {{aim of this study}} was application of rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as afeeder layer for the isolation and culture of mouse embryonic stem cells. Materials and Methods: Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from rat bone marrow and culturedin DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) medium supplemented with 10 % FBS (fetal bovineserum). To verify the isolated cells, they were affected by osteocyte differentiation inducer to becomebone mass. After twenty-one days, the differentiation was evaluated by Alizarin red staining. Blastocysts were obtained from Balb/c pregnant mice and cultured on this MSCs <b>feeder</b> <b>layer.</b> Twodays later; after hatching of blastocysts, the cells were trypsinized and the inner cell mass dissociatedto the small cell clumps. These clumps were cultured on 12 -well plates covered by the same MSCswithout applying any cytokines or growth inducer. Two to three days after the passage, coloniesappeared which were similar to embryonic stem cell colonies in morphology. These colonies werepassaged two more times using the mentioned procedure and their identities were examined bymorphological observation and alkalin phosphatase staining. Results: In this study we could easily cultured MSCs using DMEM media. The mesenchimic originof cultured cells, which showed fibroblastic morphology, was proved by differentiation to bonemasses using osteocyte inducer and detection with Alizarin red. By applying DMEM media and MSCscells, as <b>feeder</b> <b>layer,</b> we could culture ESC without any need to cytokines or growth factors. Afterpassage to the inner cell mass colonies were formed. These colonies were formed in two more otherpassages. The colonies were verified with alkalin phosphatase assay.

Murine {{embryonic stem}} (ES) cells are commonly cultured on <b>feeder</b> <b>layers</b> of primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) ...|$|R
40|$|Human keratinocytes {{grown in}} medium {{containing}} reduced calcium concentrations (0. 07 mM) {{have been found}} to show altered morphology and decreased differentiation in comparison with cells grown in medium with physiologic calcium concentrations (1 – 2 mM). Since such alterations could be mediated by growth factors, we measured binding of [125 I]epidermal growth factor (EGF). Neonatal keratinocytes <b>were</b> subcultured without <b>feeder</b> <b>layers</b> and grown to confluence in 1. 1 mM calcium. Medium was changed and cells incubated for various periods in reduced calcium prior to binding assays. Scatchard plots of binding data showed a 5 -fold increase in receptor number with no change in affinity (3 × 10 - 9 M) after 4 – 24 h at 37 °C. Maximal binding occurred at 0. 02 – 0. 04 mM calcium and decreased sharply with increasing calcium concentrations. The increase could be prevented by calcium added soon after binding began to increase but was altered less after substantial elevation had occurred, although morphologic changes at reduced calcium concentrations were reversed within several hours. Substantial increases in binding of [125 I]somatomedin C and [125 I]concanavalin A were detected, but binding of [125 I]pindalol, a beta-receptor ligand, was changed little. Keratinocytes at reduced calcium concentrations responded to added EGF by decreasing surface EGF receptors briskly in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion. The data suggest that keratinocytes show enhanced binding of EGF and some other cell surface ligands under conditions in which differentiation is retarded...|$|R
40|$|Only a few {{individual}} cells within {{less than}} 5 % of all primary tumors form the cell lines {{commonly used in}} cancer research. These growth bottlenecks result in cell lines that are often poor models of primary tumors. Co-culture of primary tumor-derived cells with an irradiated mouse fibroblast <b>feeder</b> <b>layer</b> and ROCK inhibitor, known as the Georgetown Method, offers a way to culture over 80 % of tumor-derived cells in vitro to create more representative tumor cell models. In our studies, we optimized the Georgetown Method to culture head and neck cancer cells, including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and investigated its mechanism of conditionally immortalizing cells in culture. Differential trypsinization and regular <b>feeder</b> <b>layer</b> replacement <b>were</b> found to significantly improve the efficacy of immortalizing co-cultured cells at both atmospheric and physiological oxygen levels. Medium conditioned by irradiated fibroblasts can also substitute for direct co-culture with a <b>feeder</b> <b>layer.</b> The Georgetown Method was found to maintain low levels of p 16 in co-cultured cells, suggesting a potential mechanism by which the Georgetown Method prevents differentiation and senescence. Our ability to culture over 80 % of primary tumor-derived cells allows us to test the translational value of tumor-derived cell cultures and xenografts using BH 3 profiling. Conditioned medium simplifies maintenance of cell cultures and will also allow us to perform high-throughput screens without the need to separate tumor-derived cells from the fibroblast <b>feeder</b> <b>layer.</b> The Georgetown Method provides opportunities to expand small tissue specimens for future diagnostics, therapeutics, and biobanking...|$|R

40|$|Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an {{intractable}} T-cell malignancy {{accompanied by}} massive invasion of lymphoma cells into various tissues. We demonstrate here that ATL cells cultured on a <b>layer</b> of epithelial-like <b>feeder</b> cells form anchorage-dependent multicellular aggregates (Ad-MCAs) {{and that a}} fraction of MCA-forming ATL cells acquire CD 44 high cancer stem cell-like phenotypes. ATL cells forming Ad-MCAs displayed extracellular microvesicles with enhanced expression of CD 44 v 9 at cell synapses, augmented expression of multidrug resistance protein 1, and increased NF-kappa B activity. Blockade of the NF kappa B pathway dramatically reduced Ad-MCA formation by ATL cells {{and the emergence of}} CD 44 high ATL cells, but left a considerable number of ATL cells adhering to the <b>feeder</b> <b>layer.</b> Disruption of vimentin cytoskeleton by treatment with withaferin A, a natural steroidal lactone, suppressed not only the adhesion of ATL cells to the <b>feeder</b> <b>layer</b> but also subsequent Ad-MCA formation by ATL cells, suggesting the involvement of vimentin in anchoring ATL cells to the <b>feeder</b> <b>layer.</b> Ad-MCA formation by ATL cells on a <b>layer</b> of epithelial-like <b>feeder</b> cells may mimic critical events that occur in metastatic colonization.

40|$|In recent years, {{umbilical}} cord blood (UCB) {{has been widely}} used as an alternative source to bone marrow (BM) for transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) {{in a variety of}} hematological and non-hematological disorders. Nevertheless, the insufficient number of UCB-HSPCs for graft represents a major challenge. HSPCs ex vivo expansion prior to transplantation is a valid strategy to overcome this limit. Several attempts to optimize the expansion conditions have been reported, including the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as <b>feeder</b> <b>layer.</b> Wharton's Jelly (WJ), the main component of {{umbilical cord}} (UC) matrix, is especially rich in MSCs, which are considered ideal candidates for <b>feeder</b> <b>layer</b> in co-culture systems. In fact, they can be easily harvested and grow robustly in culture, producing a confluent monolayer in a short time. Similarly to bone marrow-mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs), WJ-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) have been used to support hematopoiesis in vitro and in vivo. Here, we review the rationale for using MSCs, particularly WJ-MSCs, as a <b>feeder</b> <b>layer</b> for UCB-HSPCs ex vivo expansion. In addition, we report the main findings attesting the use of these MSCs as a support in hematopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|Rhesus monkey {{embryonic}} stem (rhES) cells were grown on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) <b>feeder</b> <b>layers</b> {{for up to}} 10 days to form multilayered colonies. Within this period, stem cell colonies differentiated transiently into complex structures with a disc-like morphology. These complex colonies were characterized by morphology, immunohistochemistry, and marker mRNA expression to identify processes of epithelialization as well as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and pattern formation. Typically, differentiated colonies were comprised of an upper and a lower ES cell layer, the former growing {{on top of the}} layer of MEF cells whereas the lower ES cell layer spread out underneath the MEF cells. Interestingly, in {{the central part of the}} colonies, a roundish pit developed. Here the <b>feeder</b> <b>layer</b> disappeared, and upper laye...|$|R
