2500|$|These figures, {{also known}} as [...] "apsarases" [...] were {{extensively}} adopted in Buddhist art, especially throughout Eastern Asia, in forms derivative to the Greco-Buddhist representation. The progressive evolution of the style {{can be seen in}} the art of Qizil and Dunhuang. It is unclear however if the concept of the flying cupids was brought to India from the West, of if it had an independent Indian origin, although Boardman considers it a Classical contribution: [...] "Another Classical motif <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> India is the pair of hovering winged figures, generally called apsaras."

2500|$|Rabbi Ishmael cited [...] {{as one of}} ten a fortiori (kal va-chomer) {{arguments}} {{recorded in}} the Hebrew Bible: (1) In [...] Joseph's brothers told Joseph, [...] "Behold, the money that <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> our sacks' mouths we brought back to you," [...] and they thus reasoned, [...] "how then should we steal?" [...] (2) In [...] Moses told God, [...] "Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me," [...] and reasoned that surely all the more, [...] "How then shall Pharaoh hear me?" [...] (3) In [...] Moses said to the Israelites, [...] "Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord," [...] and reasoned that it would follow, [...] "And how much more after my death?" [...] (4) In [...] "the Lord said to Moses: ‘If her (Miriam's) father had but spit in her face,'" [...] surely it would stand to reason, [...] "‘Should she not hide in shame seven days?'" [...] (5) In [...] the prophet asked, [...] "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you," [...] is it not logical to conclude, [...] "Then how can you contend with horses?" [...] (6) In 1 Samuel [...] David's men said to him, [...] "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah," [...] and thus surely it stands to reason, [...] "How much more then {{if we go to}} Keilah?" [...] (7) Also in [...] the prophet asked, [...] "And if in a land of Peace where you are secure" [...] you are overcome, is it not logical to ask, [...] "How will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?" [...] (8) [...] reasoned, [...] "Behold, the righteous shall be requited in the earth," [...] and does it not follow, [...] "How much more the wicked and the sinner?" [...] (9) In [...] "The king said to Esther the queen: ‘The Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in Shushan the castle,'" [...] and it thus stands to reason, [...] "‘What then have they done {{in the rest of the}} king's provinces?'" [...] (10) In [...] God came to the prophet saying, [...] "Behold, when it was whole, it was usable for no work," [...] and thus surely it is logical to argue, [...] "How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is singed?" ...|$|E
