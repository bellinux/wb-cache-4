5|$|In the United States, NBC Sports {{provided}} five-and-a-half {{hours of}} coverage in total, and no live coverage. Pay TV channel NBC Sports Network aired one-hour highlight shows on 4, 5, 6 and 11 September while NBC broadcast a special recapping the Games on 16 September – a week following their conclusion. The United States Olympic Committee provided additional coverage through its own digital outlets. Critics and American athletes expressed disappointment at NBC for its {{decision not to}} broadcast any {{live coverage of the}} Games, continuing the broadcaster's trend of providing minimal coverage for the Paralympics. In Canada, rights were held by Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium; TSN (English) and RDS (French) produced daily hour-long highlight programs (some of which were aired by CTV Television), while tape-delayed airings of the opening ceremony were carried by Sportsnet One, TSN2, RDS, and RDS2. The coverage was simulcast with open audio descriptions by AMI-tv, a network which broadcasts programming with accommodations for those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> or hearing impaired. AMI-tv also broadcast supplemental programming, such as a daily news program from London and a documentary series focusing on Canadian athletes at the Paralympics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a semi-autonomous wheelchair enabled with “HelpStar ” {{that provides a}} user <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>visually</b> impaired with mobility independence. Our “HelpStar ” enabled semi-autonomous wheelchair functions more like a personal assistant, allowing much greater user independence. When the user finds themself in an unforeseen circumstance, the “HelpStar ” feature can be activated to allow a remote operator to use Virtual Reality technologies to provide helpful navigational instructions or to send commands directly to the wheelchair. This paper demonstrates the successful integration of assistive technologies that allow a person <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>visually</b> impaired and using a wheelchair to navigate through everyday environments...|$|R

500|$|From {{the premiere}} of the {{original}} Jeopardy! {{until the end of}} the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring-in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing-in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal; attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second. The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was [...] "distracting to the viewers" [...] and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue. Contestants <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in Braille before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud.|$|E
