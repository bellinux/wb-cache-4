Baird <b>went</b> <b>downstairs</b> and fetched an office worker, 20-year-old William Edward Taynton, to see what a human face would look like, and Taynton became the first person to be televised in a full tonal range.

When I went to see David Maloney [...] his advice to me was to keep my performance as gritty as possible". Maloney was concerned that Pacey's curly hair made Pacey look similar to Gareth Thomas. Judith Smith, Maloney's production secretary, recalled that [...] "...there was all the rigmarole about trying to straighten his hair and can we cut it really short, and what can we do?".|$|E

I never heard from him again, but I hope he is well and thank him for his help.

When Oswald {{was asked to}} account for himself {{at the time of}} the assassination, he replied that he was eating his lunch in the first-floor lounge (known as the [...] "domino room"). He said that he then went to the second-floor lunchroom to buy a Coca-Cola from the soda machine there and was drinking it when he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker, who had entered the building with his gun drawn. Oswald said that while he was in the domino room, he saw two [...] "Negro employees" [...] walking by, one he recognized as [...] "Junior" [...] and a shorter man whose name he could not recall. Junior Jarman and Harold Norman confirmed to the Warren Commission that they had [...] "walked through" [...] the domino room around noon during their lunch break. When asked if anyone else was in the domino room, Norman testified that somebody else was there, but he could not remember who it was. Jarman testified that Oswald was not in the domino room when he was there.
