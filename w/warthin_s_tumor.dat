We found that human carcinoma tissues express not only full-length CD 200 (CD 200 L) but also its truncated form, CD 200 S. Although CD 200 S is reported to antagonize the immunosuppressive actions of CD 200 L, the role of CD 200 <b>S</b> in <b>tumor</b> immunity has never been investigated. We established rat C 6 glioma cell lines that expressed either CD 200 L or CD 200 S; the original C 6 cell line did not express CD 200 molecules.

Upon transplantation into the neonatal Wistar rat forebrain parenchyma, rats transplanted with C 6 -CD 200 S cells survived for a significantly longer period than those transplanted with the original C 6 and C 6 -CD 200 L cells. The C 6 -CD 200 <b>S</b> <b>tumors</b> were smaller than the C 6 -CD 200 L or C 6 -original tumors, and many apoptotic cells were found in the tumor cell aggregates. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in C 6 -CD 200 <b>S</b> <b>tumors</b> displayed dendritic cell (DC) -like morphology with multiple processes and CD 86 expression. Furthermore, CD 3 +, CD 4 + or CD 8 + cells were more frequently found in C 6 -CD 200 <b>S</b> <b>tumors,</b> and the expression of DC markers, granzyme, and perforin was increased in C 6 -CD 200 <b>S</b> <b>tumors.</b> Isolated TAMs from original C 6 tumors were co-cultured with C 6 -CD 200 S cells and showed increased expression of DC markers. These results suggest that CD 200 S activates TAMs to become DC-like antigen presenting cells, leading to the activation of CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which induce apoptotic elimination of tumor cells.

A 68 -year-old female patient was referred for evaluation of intra and extra hepatic bile duct dilatation noted on abdominal ultrasonography.

In addition, a substantial fraction of recruited, BM-derived cells resided in the vessel vicinity but did not demonstrate endothelial differentiation. Rather, these perivascular cells expressed desmin and PDGFR-β, implying pericyte-like/vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation. No defined, consensus set of markers exists for endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and the specific subsets of BM cells that participate in vessel formation are poorly understood. We used a functional in vivo assay to investigate the roles performed by specific human- and murine-derived stem/progenitor subpopulations within Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> sarcoma <b>tumors.</b> CD 34 + 45 +, CD 34 + 38 -, VEGFR 2 + and Sca 1 +Gr 1 + cells were demonstrated to establish residence within the expanding tumor vascular network and differentiate into endothelial cells and pericytes. By constrast, CD 34 - 45 + and Sca 1 -Gr 1 + cells predominantly localized to sites outside the Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tumor</b> vasculature, and differentiated into macrophages. Cytokines, such as VEGF, influence the recruitment of BM cells and their incorporation into the tumor vasculature. VEGF 165 -inhibited TC/siVEGF 7 - 1 Ewing 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tumors</b> showed delayed in vivo tumor growth, decreased vessel density, and reduced infiltration of BM progenitor cells. We tested whether another chemoattractant, Stromal Cell-Derived Factor- 1 (SDF- 1), could augment the growth of these VEGF 165 -inhibited TC/siVEGF 7 - 1 tumors by enhancing the recruitment of BM cells and stimulating neovasculature expansion. SDF- 1 promoted progenitor cell chemotaxis and retainment of BM-derived pericyte precursors in close association with functional, perfused tumor blood vessels. Treatment of TC/siVEGF 7 - 1 tumors with adenovirus-SDF- 1 α resulted in augmented tumor size, enhanced pericyte coverage of tumor neovessels, remodeling of vascular endothelium into larger, functional structures, and upregulation of PDGF-BB, with no effect on VEGF 165.

A chemically transformed hepatic epithelial cell line, GP 7 TB, derived from Fischer 344 rats, was used to generate tumor models and tumor cell vaccines.

As genomics {{have not been able}} to explain this intriguing clinical presentation, we here aimed at profiling the DNA methylome of stage 4 S NB to better understand this phenomenon. To this purpose, differential methylation analyses between International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stage 4 S, stage 4 and stage 1 / 2 were performed, using methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) sequencing data of 14 stage 4 S, 14 stage 4, and 13 stage 1 / 2 primary NB tumors (all MYCN non-amplified in order not to confound results). Stage 4 S-specific hyper- and hypo-methylated promoters were determined and further characterized for genomic localization and function by cytogenetic band enrichment, gene set enrichment, transcription factor target enrichment and differential RNA expression analyses. We show that specific chromosomal locations are enriched for stage 4 S differentially methylated promoters and that stage 4 <b>S</b> <b>tumors</b> show characteristic hypermethylation of subtelomeres. Furthermore, genes involved in important oncogenic pathways, in neural crest development and differentiation, and in epigenetic processes are differentially methylated and expressed in stage 4 <b>S</b> <b>tumors.</b> Based on these findings, we describe new biological mechanisms possibly contributing to the stage 4 S-specific tumor biology and spontaneous regression.

Materials and Methods: The pertinent clinical and pathologic data of 16 male patients who underwent postchemotherapeutic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre between 1994 and 2005 were reviewed retrospectively. It was found that all patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for advanced testicular GCT. Results: Out of the 16 male patients, 2 (13 %), 8 (50 %), and 6 (37 %) had viable GCT, fibrosis, and teratoma, respectively. Ten (10) of the patients with prechemotherapeutic <b>S</b> 1 <b>tumor</b> markers did not have viable GCT, and two of the six patients who had prechemotherapeutic <b>S</b> 2 <b>tumor</b> markers have viable GCT. All tumor marker levels normalized after chemotherapy even in patients with viable GCT. Four patients had vascular invasion without viable GCT. Furthermore, four patients had more than 60 % embryonal elements in the original pathology, but only 1 had viable GCT at PC-RPLND. Four of the five patients with immature teratoma had teratoma at PC-RPLND but no viable GCT; however, out of the four patients with mature teratoma, one had viable GCT and two had teratoma at PC-RPLND.

40|$|Several tumors {{have been}} {{reported}} to down-regulate expression of their class I major histocompatibility molecules, potentially altering their immune recognition. To investigate this phenomenon, we are using various sublines isolated from the S 49 lymphoma of the BALB/c mouse strain. These <b>S</b> 49 <b>tumor</b> sublines were previously found to have shut off expression of their Kd, Dd, and/or Ld class I molecules in a locus-specific manner. Extensive Southern blot analyses indicated that there were no major chromosome aberrancies in these S 49 sublines, and analyses of steady-state class I mRNA suggested that a form of transcriptional regulation was responsible for their variant class I expression. In this report, we characterize the nature of this locus-specific regulation of class I in S 49 cells by producing somatic cell hybrids. Three phenotypically distinct S 49 sublines were each fused to tumor cells with normal class I expression, and several of the resulting hybrids were analyzed. In every case, the class I molecules expressed by the hybrids were an exact composite of the two fusion partners. Thus, these fusions failed to rescue expression of the Kd, Dd, and/or Ld molecules shut off within each of the <b>S</b> 49 <b>tumor</b> sublines. These findings indicate that this locus-specific shutoff of class I expression results from a cis-acting defect and not trans-acting factors. Because the analysis of each of three phenotypically different S 49 cells implicated a form of cis-dominant regulation, we hypothesize that a common mechanism generating homologous mutations in class I genes is operative in <b>S</b> 49 <b>tumor</b> cells...|$|R

Furthermore, to compare tumor detection by micro-computed tomography (microCT) to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in individual mouse. Methods: SUV max values were calculated from [18 F]-DA and [18 F]-DOPA PET, tumor-to-liver ratios (TLR) were obtained and expression of NET, VMAT 1 and VMAT 2 was evaluated. Results: [18 F]-DA detected less metastatic lesions compared to [18 F]-DOPA. TLR values for liver metastases were 2. 26 - 2. 71 for [18 F]-DOPA and 1. 83 - 2. 83 for [18 F]-DA. A limited uptake of [18 F]-DA was found in <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumors</b> (TLR= 0. 22 - 0. 27) compared to [18 F]-DOPA (TLR= 1. 56 - 2. 24).

[18 F]-DOPA had overall better sensitivity than [18 F]-DA for the detection of metastases. Subcutaneous tumors were localized only with [18 F]-DOPA, a finding that may reflect differences in expression of VMAT 1 and VMAT 2, perhaps similar to some patients with pheochromocytoma where [18 F]-DOPA provides better visualization of lesions than [18 F]-DA...|$|R

At the three dosages used, (+/-) - 1, 2 -di(3, 5 -dioxopiperazin- 1 -yl) propane reduces the weight of spontaneous metastases to less than 3 %. A dose-dependent reduction of artificial metastasis weight is also observed.

These effects are consistent with the combined occurrence of cytotoxic and selective antimetastatic action, although the latter appears to be predominant. At the three dosages used, DM-COOK markedly depresses the weight and number of spontaneous metastases to about 10 %, leaving the formation of artificial metastases unaffected and causing no significant effect on primary tumor growth. The effects of these agents on the fractional incorporation of [3 H]thymidine in tumor cells further indicate that only DM-COOK is devoid of cytotoxic effects for pulmonary and <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumors.</b> In hosts pretreated with DM-COOK, no reduction in the formation either of spontaneous or of artificial metastases is observed.

40|$|Gain of {{chromosome}} 17 is {{the most}} prevalent genetic abnormality identified in neuroblastoma (NB) and distal 17 q gain has prognostic significance in NB. In this report, we have combined array-based comparative genomic hybridization (A-CGH) and gene expression analysis to investigate gene copy number changes {{and its impact on}} the gene expression level as well as their association with prognosis genes located on chromosome 17 in NB tumors. We observed differential gains of chromosome 17 between Stages 4 - and 4 <b>S</b> <b>tumors.</b> We found that WSB 1, mapping to 17 q 11. 1, which was frequently gained in 4 S- tumors and not changed in 4 - tumors, showed strong correlations between expression level and copy number. Furthermore, the increase of WSB 1 gene expression is associated with good outcome in patients with NB of all stages. WSB 1 also enhances the prognos-tic prediction when combined with other current prognostic factors in NB. Our results demonstrate that WSB 1 copy number correlates with its expression level and that its high expression associates with good prognosis suggesting a possible role of this gene in the biology of favorable outcome NB.

40|$|Several phenotypes of antigen-presenting {{cells are}} present in the dermis, where they presumably {{function}} to present encountered antigens for immune responses. This study examined the ability of dermal antigen-presenting cells to present tumor-associated antigens for the induction of in vivo antitumor immunity. Total murine dermal cells were exposed either to medium alone or to medium containing tumor-associated antigens from <b>S</b> 1509 a <b>tumor</b> cells. Subsequently, dermal cells were injected subcutaneously at weekly intervals into naïve mice for a total of three immunizations. One week following the final immunization, mice were challenged with living tumor cells. In these experiments, dermal cells pulsed with tumor-associated antigens induced protective immunity to tumor growth. Dermal cells exposed to tumor-associated antigens were also able to elicit delayed-type hypersensitivity after footpad injection into mice previously immunized against <b>S</b> 1509 a <b>tumor</b> cells. The ability to present tumor-associated antigens for both induction of antitumor immunity and elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity was dependent on I-A+ cells and was genetically restricted. Finally, dermal cells tended towards eliciting a greater antitumor delayed-type hypersensitivity response than epidermal cells. These results show that the murine dermis contains antigen-presenting cells capable of processing <b>S</b> 1509 a <b>tumor</b> antigens for the generation of protective antitumor immunity in vivo...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} whether {{tumor cells}} consistently generating granulocyte/macrophage colony– stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can recruit and activate macrophages to generate angiostatin and, hence, inhibit {{the growth of}} distant metastasis. Two murine melanoma lines, B 16 -F 10 (syngeneic to C 57 BL/ 6 mice) and K- 1735 (syngeneic to C 3 H/HeN mice), were engineered to produce GM-CSF. High GM-CSF (� 1 ng/ 106 cells) – and low GM-CSF (� 10 pg/ 106 cells) –producing clones were identified. Parental, low, and high GM-CSF–producing cells were injected subcutaneously into syngeneic and into nude mice. Parental and low-producing cells produced rapidly growing tumors, whereas the high-producing cells produced slow-growing tumors. Macrophage density inversely correlated with tumorigenicity and directly correlated with steady state levels of macrophage metalloelastase (MME) mRNA. B 16 and K- 1735 subcutaneous (<b>s.</b> c.) <b>tumors</b> producing high levels of GM-CSF significantly suppressed lung metastasis of 3 LL, UV- 2237 fibrosarcoma, K- 1735 M 2, and B 16 -F 10 cells, but parental or low-producing tumors did not. The level of angiostatin in the serum directly correlated with the production of GM-CSF by the <b>s.</b> c. <b>tumors.</b> Macrophages incubated with medium conditioned by GM-CSF– producing B 16 or K- 1735 cells had higher MME activity and generated fourfold more angiostati...|$|R
40|$|Deletion of {{the short}} arm of {{chromosome}} 1 is frequently observed in neuroblastoma (NB). We performed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of 120 well characterized NB to better define specific regions of 1 p loss and any association with clinical and biological prognostic features (DNA index, MYCN, age, and stage). All categories of disease were represented including 7 ganglioneuromas, 8 stage 4 S, 33 local-regional (stages 1, 2, and 3), and 72 stage 4 NB according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System. Patients were consistently treated with stage-appropriate protocols at a single institution. Sixteen highly informative, polymorphic loci mapping to chromosome 1 were evaluated using a sensitive, semiautomated, fluorescent detection system. Chromosome arm 1 p deletions were detected in all categories of tumor except ganglioneuroma. Frequent LOH was detected at two separate regions of 1 p and distinct patterns of losses were associated with individual clinical/biological categories. Clinically aggressive stage 4 tumors were predominantly diploid with extensive LOH frequently detected {{in the region of}} 1 ptel to 1 p 35 (55 %) and at 1 p 22 (56 %). The shortest region of overlap for LOH at 1 p 36 was between D 1 S 548 and D 1 S 1592 and for 1 p 22 was between D 1 S 1618 and D 1 <b>S</b> 2766. Local-regional <b>tumors</b> were mostly hyperdiploid with short regions of loss primarily involving terminal regions of 1 p 36 (42 %). Most spontaneously regressing stage 4 <b>S</b> <b>tumors</b> (7 / 8) were hyperdiploid without loss of 1 p 36 or 1 p 22. These findings suggest that genes located on at least two separate regions of chromosome arm 1 p {{play a significant role in}} the biology of NB and that distinct patterns of 1 p LOH occur in individual clinical/biological categories...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} anti-tumor and {{immunological}} effect of extracts from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak on mice transplanted <b>S</b> 180 <b>tumor</b> cells. Methods: Different doses of volatile oil and alcohol extracted substances from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak {{were given to}} mice bearing <b>S</b> 180 <b>tumor</b> for 9 days. Tumor inhibition rates and coefficients of spleen and thymus were determined. Results: Tumor inhibition rates of the groups with alcohol extracts (40 g crude drug·kg- 1 ·d- 1 and 20 g crude drug·kg- 1 ·d- 1) were 51. 5 % (P＜ 0. 01) and 36. 4 % (P＜ 0. 05) respectively, {{and those of the}} groups with volatile oil (40 g crude drug·kg- 1 ·d- 1 and 20 g crude drug·kg- 1 ·d- 1) were both 39. 4 % (P＜ 0. 05). Conclusion: The extracts from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak have anti-tumor activities. The coefficient of spleen in group with alcohol extracts (40 g crude drug·kg- 1 ·d- 1) was close to normal value, and its coefficient of thymus was between that of the negative control group and the group with cyclophosphamide (0. 02 g·kg- 1 ·d- 1). The anti-tumor activity of the alcohol extracts was significantly higher than that of the control group and the tumor inhibition rate was depending on drug concentration. Depending on index of immunity, the extracts from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak may have some influences on immunity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Aim of Work: Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) tumors {{represent}} {{a major public}} health problem, and their epidemiological data in Egypt have been rather incomplete except for some regional reports. There are no available frequency-based data on CNS tumors in our locality. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the frequency of CNS tumors in east delta region, Egypt. Materials and Methods: The data were collected during the 8 -year period from January 1999 to December 2007 from Pathology Department, Mansoura University, and other referred pathology labs. Examination of HandE stained sections from retrieved paraffin blocks were done in all cases for histopathologic categorization of C. N. <b>S.</b> <b>tumors.</b> Immunohistochemical studies were applied to confirm final histopathologic diagnosis in problematic cases. Results: Intracranial tumors represented 86. 7 % of cases in comparison to only 13. 3 % for spinal tumors. Gliomas were the CNS tumors of the highest frequency (35. 2 %), followed by meningioma (25. 6 %), pituitary adenoma (11. 6 %) and nerve sheath tumors (6. 6 %). 10. 25 % of tumors were of children < 15 years. Conclusion: This study provides the largest series of the relative frequency of CNS tumors in Delta region in Egypt till now and may help to give insight into the epidemiology of CNS tumors in our locality...|$|R
40|$|Smart drug {{delivery}} system with strategic drug distribution is the future state-of-the-art treatment for any malignancy. To investigate therapeutic potential of such nanoparticle mediated delivery system, we examined the efficacy of dual drug-loaded, pH and thermo liable lipid coated mesoporous iron oxide-based magnetic nanoassemblies (DOX:TXL-LMMNA) in mice bearing both drug sensitive (A 2780 (S)) and drug resistant (A 2780 -CisR) ovarian cancer tumor xenografts. In presence of an external AC magnetic field (ACMF), DOX:TXL-LMMNA particles disintegrate to release encapsulated drug due to hyperthermic temperatures (41 - 45 degrees C). In vivo bio distribution study utilizing the optical and magnetic properties of DOX: TXL-LMMNA particles demonstrated minimum organ specific toxicity. Noninvasive bioluminescence imaging of mice bearing A 2780 (<b>S)</b> <b>tumors</b> and administered with DOX-TXL-LMMNA followed by the application of ACMF revealed 65 % less luminescence signal and 80 % mice showed complete tumor regression within eight days. A six months follow-up study revealed absence of relapse in 70 % of the mice. Interestingly, the A 2780 -CisR tumors which {{did not respond to}} drug alone (DOX:TXL) showed 80 % reduction in luminescence and tumor volume with DOX:TXL-LMMNA after thermo-chemotherapy within eight days. Cytotoxic effect of DOX:TXL-LMMNA particles was more pronounced in A 2780 -CisR cells than in their sensitive counterpart. Thus these novel stimuli sensitive nanoassemblies hold great promise for therapy resistant malignancies and future clinical applications...|$|R
