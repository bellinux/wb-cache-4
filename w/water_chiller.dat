5000|$|A <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> is a {{mechanical}} device used to facilitate heat exchange from {{water to a}} refrigerant in a closed loop system. The refrigerant is then pumped to a location where the waste heat is transferred to the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{condenser}} water absorbs {{heat from}} the refrigerant in the condenser barrel of the <b>water</b> <b>chiller,</b> and is then sent via return lines to a cooling tower, which is a heat exchange device used to transfer waste heat to the atmosphere. The {{extent to which the}} cooling tower decreases the temperature depends upon the outside temperature, the relative humidity and the atmospheric pressure. The water in the chilled water circuit will be lowered to the Wet-bulb temperature or dry-bulb temperature before proceeding to the <b>water</b> <b>chiller,</b> where it is cooled to between 4° and 7°C and pumped to the air handler, where the cycle is repeated. The equipment required includes chillers, cooling towers, pumps and electrical control equipment. The initial capital outlay for these is substantial and maintenance costs can fluctuate. Adequate space must be included in building design for the physical plant and access to equipment.|$|E

50|$|A valve {{arrangement}} {{within the}} <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> opens a direct path between the condenser and the evaporator.

This method is driven by the idea that the refrigerant tends to move towards the coldest point in a refrigeration circuit. The cost savings associated with this method are due to the compressor’s inactivity, since the blower, fans and pumps are all operational.|$|E

The following year brought a summer of rolling blackouts and Enron market manipulation as California’s energy deregulation crisis hit, and electricity rates nearly doubled.

The water vapor is continuously evacuated from the VIM, compressed, and fed into a condenser due to the special construction of the centrifugal compressor.

40|$|Today, {{substantial}} savings can {{be achieved}} by converting constant flow-rate <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> systems to variable flow-rate systems. This conversion is best suited for large, central plant <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> systems where two or more chillers are utilized. Many large commercial and industrial energy users produce <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> for space conditioning and various processes.

40|$|Typically a {{blending}} {{station is}} designed to ensure that its user is able to avoid low <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> return temperature in the district cooling system. When the <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> return temperature drops to a low limit, building return water is blended into building supply water to reduce primary <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> flow and finally increase building <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> return. However, the blending station will cause extra pump power and may cause humidity and temperature issues. Theoretical analysis has been conducted on the blending station performance. The {{results show that the}} blending station is not necessary in the building <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> systems with 2 -way modulation valves at end users.

40|$|The {{study we}} present here {{analyzes}} {{the status of}} the <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> energy efficiency standard in China. The national standard, GB 19577 - 2004, which sets the grade and scale of <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> energy efficiency, has been implemented for five years and has produced achievements in energy-saving and emission reduction, which is a basic state policy in China. This paper presents extensive investigations on <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> energy efficiency conducted in 2009 and compares these results with results from 2003. This analysis shows that the average energy efficiency level in 2009 was higher than in 2003. Moreover, large units with more than a 5000 Â kW cooling capacity have now appeared, and low efficiency units with EERs (energy efficiency ratios) below 3. 8 have been phased out. The standard should be upgraded every five years. Therefore, this paper proposes a draft of a new energy efficiency standard. In the draft, thermodynamic perfectibility [eta] is presented to be used as an indicator instead of the EER; for [eta], 0. 4 is the minimum allowable value and 0. 6 is the maximum value. There is one category of cooling capacities, from 100 to 2000 Â kW, in which the energy efficiency has a linear relationship with its cooling capacity. <b>Water</b> <b>chiller</b> Energy efficiency standard Thermodynamic perfectibility...|$|E

40|$|A 3 -ton {{lithium bromide}} {{absorption}} <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> was tested {{for a number}} of conditions involving hot-water input, chilled water, and the cooling water. The primary influences on chiller capacity were the hot water inlet temperature and the cooling water inlet temperature. One combination of these two parameters extended the output to as much as 125 % of design capacity, but no combination could lower the capacity to below 60 % of design. A cooling system was conceptually designed so that it could provide several modes of operation. Such flexibility is needed for any solar cooling system to be able to accommodate the varying solar energy collection and the varying building demand. It is concluded that a 3 -ton absorption <b>water</b> <b>chiller</b> with the kind of performance that was measured can be incorporated into a cooling system such as that proposed, to provide efficient cooling over the specified ranges of operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|Improving <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> delta-T, {{which is}} the {{temperature}} difference of <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> supply and return temperature, in campus buildings that are connected to a central distribution loop will not only improve the power consumption of the building through reduced tertiary (building) pumping power but {{the impact on the}} central distribution system and chiller efficiencies will be even greater. A degraded delta-T is almost inevitable and it can be expected to fall to about one-half to two-thirds of design at low loads (Taylor, 2002) due to various causes, such as air entering and leaving temperatures, <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> supply temperature, type and effectiveness of flow control valves, tertiary connection configuration types and operation, coil cooling loads, air economizers, etc. However, in most variable-flow <b>chilled</b> <b>water</b> with 2 -way control valve systems, the root cause of low delta-T is at coil side (Zhang, 2012), for example the geometric configuration of coil.
