I am hopeful that in the near future we <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the road again playing music we love.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{slowly but}} surely the pack overtook us.

[...] So we did, and {{scarcely}} had we reached it and dismounted when the hounds came past. Yes, they went within fifty yards of us, lolloping along upon our spoor and running all but mute, for now they were too weary to waste their breath in vain. [...] "Run for it," [...] I said to Leo as soon as they had gone by, [...] "for they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the scent presently," [...] and we set off to the right across the line that the hounds had taken, so as not to cut our own spoor.|$|E
60|$|You {{have seen}} through the papers notice of my return from the great {{expedition}} into Kentucky. My orders were such and the force with me also so small that no attack was allowable. I made good use of the time however, making a splendid reconnoissance of the country over which an army may have to move. I have now a larger force than General Scott ever commanded prior to our present difficulties. I do {{hope it will be}} my good fortune to retain so important a command for at least one battle. I believe there is no portion of our whole army better prepared to contest a battle than there is within my district, and I am very much mistaken if I have not got the confidence of officers and men. This is all important, especially so with new troops. I go tonight to St. Louis to see General Halleck; <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> Sunday morning. I expect but little quiet from this on and if you receive but short, unsatisfactory letters hereafter you need not be surprised.|$|E

2500|$|In leagues which {{play with}} a shorthanded {{overtime}} (with {{only three or four}} attackers on the ice), should a team be penalized with only three players on the ice, an additional skater is added to the other team instead, until a five-on-three is produced.
