5|$|In {{addition}} to training courses available at a NOAC or section conclave, the OA offers specialized leadership training as weekend events for members: Lodge Leadership Development (LLD), National Leadership Seminars (NLS), and National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS). LLD is a one-day or two-day event {{conducted by a}} lodge to train their officers and advisers. NLS's are conducted by regions for lodge officers and advisers. Many lodges send key officers to receive training. Typically, each region schedules three or four NLS weekends annually, at geographically dispersed locations <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> NLATS is a training event for adults, usually held in conjunction with an NLS and conducted by regions, {{on the role of}} advisers in the OA.|$|E

5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital {{interests in the}} Río de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E

5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the North Indian Ocean between 100°E and 45°E is {{monitored by the}} India Meteorological Department (IMD, RSMC New Delhi). <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> a {{tropical cyclone}} is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. The lowest official classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Depression, which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 17–27kn (20–31mph; 31–49km/h). Should the depression intensify further then {{it will become a}} Deep Depression, which has winds between 28–33kn (32–38mph; 50–61km/h). The system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the IMD, if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 34–47kn (39–54mph; 62–88km/h). Severe Cyclonic Storms have storm force wind speeds of between 48–63kn (55–72mph; 89–117km/h), while Very Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 64–89kt (73–102mph; 118–166km/h). Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph). The highest classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Super Cyclonic Storm, which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn (138mph; 222km/h).|$|E
5|$|Fallout 3 {{takes place}} in the year 2277, and <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> that covers most of the ruined city of Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and parts of Maryland. The game's {{landscape}} includes war-ravaged variants of numerous real-life landmarks such as the White House, the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, Arlington National Cemetery and the Washington Monument, with a small number of settlements dotted around the Capital Wastelands that consist of descendants of survivors from the Great War, including one that surrounds an unexploded bomb, another consisting primarily of ghoul inhabitants, and another formed within the hulking remains of an aircraft carrier. While the city can be explored, much of the interior zones are cut off by giant rubble over many of the roads leading in, meaning that access can only be achieved by using the city's former underground metro tunnels (loosely based on the real-life Washington Metro).|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1870s, the Straits Governor, William Jervois {{contemplated}} on placing Maharaja Abu Bakar as the overlord of {{the chiefs}} in Negeri Sembilan after the British failed {{to quell the}} sectarian violence in Sungai Ujong. Abu Bakar's client, Tunku Antah was placed as the Yam Tuan of the Sri Menanti confederacy (comprising several small states <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region),</b> and Abu Bakar was made the adviser of Negeri Sembilan (except Sungai Ujong) in 1878. Abu Bakar was believed to have nursed expansionist ambitions, which was suggested by {{his involvement in the}} Pahang Civil War between 1857 and 1864. A later governor, Frederick Weld, aspired for stronger British control over the Malay states and was weary of Abu Bakar's influence. The chiefs were lukewarm to the prospect of Johor's sphere of influence over Negeri Sembilan, and in 1881 Weld convinced the chiefs within the Sri Menanti confederacy to deal directly with Singapore rather than with Abu Bakar. British officers were also appointed to oversee the affairs in 1883 and 1887, and were gradually given the powers similar to that of a British resident.|$|E

5|$|Planetesimals <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> {{which would}} become the {{asteroid}} belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{reviews of}} defence {{policy and the}} {{strategic}} situation in South East Asia after the war had resulted {{in the formation of}} the Australian Regiment in 1948, the first regular infantry unit of the Australian Army. From that time on as tension <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> increased the strength of the Regular Army increased rapidly in contrast to the CMF, signifying if not an end to Australian military planners' reliance upon citizen soldiers, at least a shift in focus and a realisation of the mistakes that had been made prior to World War II. This would see the CMF providing a platform upon which the Army could mobilise in the event of a war. Initially, the plan had been for the CMF to be made up of 50,000 men organised into two divisions and other units, however, recruitment was unable to meet these targets as initially it was attempted to achieve this through voluntary enlistment. Indeed, in its first year of existence, the actual strength of the CMF was only 8,698 personnel, although this rose the following year to 16,202 and to 32,779 in 1950. In March 1951, a system of compulsory national service was re-established.|$|E

Initial excavations at Gedi began in the late-1940s, and the site today {{remains one of the}} most intensely studied Swahili Coast settlements. The significance of the ruins has been largely used to assess the sites role <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> in association with other sites to provide insight into the development of Swahili culture, the organization of Indian Ocean trade, the introduction and spread of Islam, and the political and economic ties between Swahili communities through their cultural remains and their spatial relationships.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} bedrock or limestone of the Everglades basin {{affects the}} hydroperiod, {{or how long}} an area <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> stays flooded throughout the year. Longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater {{for longer periods of}} time, while the geology of Florida was forming. More water is held within the porous ooids and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level. A hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass, whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of periphyton, a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms. There are only two types of soil in the Everglades, peat and marl. Where there are longer hydroperiods, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Where periphyton grows, the soil develops into marl, which is more calcitic in composition.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that occur}} within the Northern Hemisphere {{to the east}} of the anti-meridian, are officially monitored by either the National Hurricane Center or the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored, non-frontal synoptic disturbance, that develops over tropical or subtropical waters, with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre. The region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance, that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones. Once either of these classifications are met, then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression, if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33kn (38mph; 62km/h). However, if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours, then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone. Should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 34–63kn (39–73mph; 63–118km/h), then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a name.|$|E
5|$|Strategically, as {{a result}} of the {{fighting}} around Milne Bay, Japanese operations <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> were constrained. The defeat at Milne Bay kept them from bypassing the holding action that the Australians were conducting on the Kokoda Track. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. The Japanese commanders were then forced to change their plans in the region, shifting their focus towards repelling the US forces that had landed on Guadalcanal, while maintaining a smaller effort around Buna–Gona, under Major General Tomitarō Horii. Once they had retaken Guadalcanal, they planned to reinforce Horii's forces and launch a reinvigorated attack on the Australians around Port Moresby. In the end, subsequent defeats at Buna–Gona and on Guadalcanal did not allow them to implement these plans, as the Allies gained the ascendency in the region throughout late 1942 and the Japanese were forced to fall back to the northern coast of New Guinea. In the aftermath of the battle, a large amount of intelligence was also gained by the Allies, providing their planners with a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese and their equipment. It also demonstrated that the Militia were an effective fighting force.|$|E
