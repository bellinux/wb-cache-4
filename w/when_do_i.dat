60|$|Q. <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> sin against preaching of the word?--A. When {{you refuse}} to hear God's ministers, or hearing them, refuse to follow their {{wholesome}} doctrine (2 Chron 36:16; Jer 25:4-7, 35:15).|$|E

60|$|An extreme {{blessing to}} me is your dear letter from Montreal. I had lately much longed to hear from you--and <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> not?--and had sent you a message to that effect in writing to Harry a week ago.

6000|$|Some {{one asked}} after Captain Duncombe as she descended into private life. [...] "There's a {{wonderful}} filly that absorbs all his attention. All Wil'sbro' might burn {{as long as}} Dark Hag thrives! <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> expect him? I don't know; it depends on Dark Hag," [...] {{she said in a}} tone of superior good-natured irony, then gathered up the radiant mantle and tripped off along the central street of the little old- fashioned country town, with gravelled not paved side-walks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello, Hal. It {{sure does}} me {{good to hear}} your voice. I might have known whose illigant home Pat is honoring. Where did you find him, and why didn't you tell me? Didn't expect you home {{until the end of}} next week. Funny thing, but I was {{thinking}} of you two fellows when the 'phone rang. Same old Pat, isn't he? Gee, but it's good to hear the voices of you two fellows! Now <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> see you and where?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When you write," [...] you say, and <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> write {{but just}} exactly {{an hour after}} your letter of this evening, that of February 1st, a {{fortnight}} ago to a day, has come to hand? I delight in having got it, and find it no less interesting than genial--bristling with fine realities. Much as it tells me, indeed, I could have done with still more; but that is of course always the case {{at such a time}} as this, and amid such wonderments and yearnings; and I make gratefully the most of what there is. The basis, the connection, the mode of employment on, and in, and under which you [...] "go off," [...] for instance, are matters that leave me scratching my head and exhaling long and sad sighs--but as those two things are what I am at in these days most of my time I don't bring them home most criminally to you. Only I am moved to beseech you this time not to throw yourself into the thick of military operations amid which your want of even the minimum of proper eyesight apparently may devote you to destruction, more or less--after the manner of the blind quart d'heure described to me in your letter previous to this one. I am sorry the black homesickness so feeds upon you amid your terrific paradoxical friends, the sport alike of their bodies and their souls, of whom your account is admirably vivid; but I well conceive your state, which has my tenderest sympathy--that nostalgic ache at its worst being the invocation of the very devil of devils. Don't let it break the spell of your purpose of learning Russian, of really mastering it--though even while I say this I rather wince at your telling me that you incline not to return to England till September next. I don't put that regret on the score of my loss of the sight of you till then--that gives the sort of personal turn to the matter that we are all ashamed together of giving to any matter now. But the being and the having been in England--or in France, which is now so much the same thing--during at least a part of this unspeakable year affects me as something you are not unlikely to be sorry to have missed; there attaches to it--to the being here--something so sovereign and so initiatory {{in the way of a}} British experience. I mean that it's as if you wouldn't have had the full general British experience without it, and that this may be a pity for you as a painter of British phenomena--for I don't suppose you think of reproducing only Russian for the rest of your shining days. However, I hasten to add that I feel the very greatest aversion to intermeddlingly advising you--your completing your year in Russia all depends on what you do with the precious time. You may bring home fruits by which you will be wholly justified. Address yourself indeed to doing that and putting it absolutely through--and I will, for my part, back you up unlimitedly. Only, bring your sheaves with you, and gather in a golden bundle of the same. I detest, myself, the fine old British horror--as it has flourished at least up to now, when in respect to the great matter that's upon us the fashion has so much changed--of doing anything consistently and seriously. So if you should draw out your absence I shall believe in your reasons. Meanwhile I am myself of the most flaming British complexion--the whole thing is to me an unspeakably intimate experience--if it isn't abject to apply such a term when one hasn't had one's precious person straight up against the facts. I have only had my poor old mind and imagination--but as one can have them here; and I live partly in dark abysses and partly in high and, I think, noble elations. But how, at my age and in my conditions, I could have beautifully done without it! I resist more or less--since you ask me to tell you how I [...] "am"; I resist and go on from day to day because I want to and the horrible interest is too great not to. But that same is adding the years in great shovel-fulls to our poor old lives (those at least of my generation:) so don't be too long away after all if you want ever to see me again. I have in a manner got back to work--after a black interregnum; and find it a refuge and a prop--but the conditions make it difficult, exceedingly, almost insuperably, I find, in a sense far other than the mere distressing and depressing. The subject-matter of one's effort has become itself utterly treacherous and false--its relation to reality utterly given away and smashed. Reality is a world that was to be capable of this--and how represent that horrific capability, historically latent, historically ahead of it? How on the other hand not represent it either--without putting into play mere fiddlesticks? ...|$|E

5000|$|Lawrence Ferlinghetti {{offered to}} publish [...] "Howl" [...] through City Lights soon after hearing Ginsberg perform {{it at the}} Six Gallery Reading.

5000|$|In 1989 Walter Hill {{explained}} why {{he changed his}} mind:First, I figured that Hollywood is based on melodrama anyway and, second, I thought up a way to present the story {{in a way that}} resisted histrionics. More importantly, I found an actor who could play Johnny and not make it risible. Someone who understood the pitfalls of the thing. The main thing is that motion pictures have conditioned us to expect psychological realism. This is a drama in a different category. It's about moral choices... I knew I was on very thin ice. If you let any histrionics in, it will fall apart. You have to trust the drama of the whole rather than an individual scene. And that's antithetical to most actors. They want to know, 'Where's my big moment? <b>When</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> get to cry and scream?'

5000|$|According to E.D. Huntley, several themes {{arise in}} the novel, including: “silence (both gendered and racially constituted); {{necessity}} for speech; the discovery of voice; the construction of identity {{and the search for}} self-realization; the mother-daughter relationship and the conflicts that it engenders; memory; acculturation and biculturalism; and cultural alienation.” Huntley compiles a list of scholarly reviews on the themes and finds that they agree with his findings, particularly themes relating to immigrant communities and cross-cultural conflict. “Other reviewers reflect on Kingston’s handling of a theme that pervades the literature of diaspora and immigrant communities, the theme of cross-cultural conflict. Huntley also notes: [...] "For reviewer Miriam Greenspan, Maxine Hong Kingston captures “the pain of an American-born child who inevitably reject the expectations and authority of her family in favor of the values of the new land” (Greenspan 108); Linda B. Hall describes the book as “remarkable in its insights into the plight of individuals pulled between two cultures” (Hall 191); and Susan Currier writes in the Dictionary of Literary Biography that Woman Warrior is a personal narrative that represents Kingston’s effort “to reconcile American and Chinese female identities” (Currier 235)." [...] When asked about the cultural themes in her writing, Kingston responded, “I wonder if it just takes a lifetime or two to be an integrated person, so that you don’t have to think, at what point do I have to announce that I am a minority person or a woman or what? When I think back on when I was a young writer, I would wonder, ok now, <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> let everybody know that I’m Chinese American? Do I have to announce that?” ...|$|E
