40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Comparisons {{were made}} of the tissue water relations, stomatal {{conductance}} and growth of grand fir (Abies grandis), white fir (Abies concolor) and their hybrids growing in a western Oregon plantation. The grand fir were naturally-regenerated trees native to the study site. White fir and hybrids were the progeny of controlled crosses between white fir from the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and grand fir from the northern California coast. Osmotic potential s of all trees, at both full and zero turgor, were lowest in March (averaging - 2. 05 MPa and - 2. 73 MPa, respectively), highest in June (averaging - 1. 18 MPa and - 1. 54 MPa), and intermediate in August (averaging - 1. 73 MPa and - 2. 34 MPa in August, 1981, and - 1. 65 MPa and - 2. 22 MPa in August, 1982). August, 1981, was hotter and drier than August, 1982; the lower osmotic potentials in 1981 may be a response to more severe stress. Osmotic potentials decreased more than water potentials between June and August; thus, turgor pressure increased through the summer. Bulk turgor of twigs averaged 0. 71 MPa before dawn in June, 1982, and 0. 87 MPa before dawn in August, 1982. In the mid-morning, twig turgor averaged 0. 30 MPa in June and 0. 40 MPa in August, 1982. The trees that grew most rapidly on the study site, hybrids between <b>Colorado</b> <b>white</b> <b>fir</b> and California grand fir, had lower stomatal conductance throughout the year than slower growing white fir. The fastest growing hybrids also had the least negative osmotic potential at full and zero turgor and the lowest twig turgor in August. Thus, rapid growth rate did not correlate with either high conductance or high turgor. More rapid growth may be partly explained by higher leaf area. Needle longevity {{of the fastest growing}} hybrids averaged 5. 3 years, compared with 2. 8 years for the slowest growing white fir. It is speculated that rapidly growing trees may also allocate a greater percentage of photosynthate to production of new needles...|$|R

30|$|Native Colorado River {{cutthroat}} trout did not evolve {{with any other}} trout species, and therefore are extremely susceptible to interspecific competition and predation by non-native salmonids, particularly {{at a young age}} (Benke 1992). We observed both rainbow trout and brown trout at each location we surveyed in 2006 and 2007. Rainbow trout could have escaped from adjacent stocked ponds that were unaffected by the fire or intentionally stocked by private landowners along the Florida River during our survey period (2003 to 2007) (Jim <b>White,</b> <b>Colorado</b> Division of Wildlife, personal communication). Brown trout may have initially escaped out of ponds or tributaries unaffected by the fire.|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to immediate die-off after fires, {{the effects of}} fire on Colorado cutthroat trout populations may extend to post-fire floods. Chronic changes in channel morphology and vegetation loss may affect recruitment and population stability {{for years to come}} (J.N. Rinne, U.S. Forest Service, unpublished data). Shearer Creek is a small first order tributary to the Florida River. Post-fire floods extirpated non-native brook trout, and DOW stocked Colorado cutthroat trout from 2005 to 2007 after constructing a fish migration barrier near the confluence. The DOW observed multiple-year classes of cutthroats when they stocked the stream in 2007. However, a high intensity rainstorm during the summer of 2008 filled many of the pools with sediment and they collected only one adult year class during electrofishing surveys in 2008 (<b>White,</b> <b>Colorado</b> Division of Wildlife, personal communication). The instability of Shearer Creek following wildfire and its apparent effects on the cutthroat trout population six years after the Missionary Ridge Fire serves to illustrate the long term effects of fire on cutthroat trout.|$|R
