The character's likeness appears on various items including coloring books, sleeping bags, frisbees, board games, wind-up toys, and stuffed animals.|$|E
5|$|Tech quarterback Reggie Ball <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> acclaimed. Despite {{leading the}} ACC with 20 {{touchdown}} passes and being named an All-ACC honorable mention, there were doubts about Ball's effectiveness. Since starting at quarterback in his freshman year, Ball went 0-4 against Tech rival Georgia, and was excoriated for his inconsistency. After suffering a game-losing fumble against the Bulldogs, commentators questioned how well Ball would recover from the setback before the ACC Championship Game.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's {{defense was}} strongest against the rush. During the regular season, the Tigers allowed {{an average of}} 101.8 yards per game on the ground, good enough for No. 18 nationally. Their passing defense <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> successful. On average, the Tigers allowed 238.6 yards per game through the air, making their pass defense the 97th best in {{division}} I-A football during the regular season. With both categories combined, the defense was ranked No. 37. In terms of points allowed, rather than yardage, the Tigers were ranked No. 23 after giving up an average of 19.3 yards per game.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{attorney}} William Shea {{was attempting}} to create the Continental League, a rival league to Major League Baseball. Hunt met with him, and Shea suggested Harry Wismer, a minority shareholder in both the Washington Redskins and Detroit Lions, as a potential New York franchise owner for the new football league. Wismer was willing; he was feuding at the time with the Redskins' principal owner, George Preston Marshall, and realized he would never own the Washington franchise. Wismer, while wealthy, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> rich as the other potential team owners.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, most {{commonly}} known as Rawlings' Regiment in period documents, was organized in June 1776 as a specialized light infantry unit of riflemen in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The American rifle units complemented the predominant, musket-equipped, line infantry forces of the war with their long-range marksmanship capability and were typically deployed with the line infantry as forward skirmishers and flanking elements. Scouting, escort, and outpost duties were also routine. The rifle units' battle formation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> structured {{as that of the}} line infantry units, which employed short-range massed firing in ordered linear formations. The riflemen could therefore respond with more adaptability to changing battle conditions.|$|E

5|$|The Programmer {{accessory}} {{had been}} {{mentioned in the}} earliest advertisement {{but it was not}} featured until March 1974. This was the same size as a desktop calculator and could hold 256 programming steps. (It could be expanded to 512 steps.) It was limited to emulating calculator key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering hexadecimal key codes. The combination of the MITS 7440 calculator and the programmer <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> sophisticated as the HP 9830 calculator but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.|$|E
5|$|Johann Tetzel {{responded to}} the Theses by calling for Luther to be burnt for heresy and having theologian Konrad Wimpina write 106 theses against Luther's work. Tetzel defended these in a disputation before the University of Frankfurt on the Oder in January 1518. 800 copies of the printed disputation were sent to be sold in Wittenberg, but {{students}} of the University seized them from the bookseller and burned them. Luther became increasingly fearful that the situation was out of hand {{and that he would}} be in danger. To placate his opponents, he published a Sermon on Indulgences and Grace, which did not challenge the pope's authority. This pamphlet, written in German, was very short and easy for laypeople to understand. Luther's first widely successful work, it was reprinted twenty times. Tetzel responded with a point-by-point refutation, citing heavily from the Bible and important theologians. His pamphlet <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> popular as Luther's. Luther's reply to Tetzel's pamphlet, on the other hand, was another publishing success for Luther.|$|E
5|$|Phips and {{the crew}} were rewarded by the investors with medals, and Phips was knighted by James in June. James also rewarded Phips with the post of provost marshal general (chief sheriff) of the Dominion of New England, serving under Sir Edmund Andros. In September 1687 Phips {{returned}} to the wreck, {{though he did not}} command the venture. Admiral Narborough elected to personally lead the expedition, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> successful. The wreck had been discovered by others, and the arrival of the English scattered more than 20 smaller ships. Treasure worth £10,000 was recovered before Narborough's death in May 1688 brought the expedition to an end. Phips had by then already left the wreck site in early May, sailing for Boston for what seems to have been his first time home in four and a half years, to take up his new post as provost marshal general.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the success}} of LWFC, Common {{continued}} collaborating with the Soulquarians for his next album, Electric Circus. It featured the Soulquarians more prominently than Like Water for Chocolate, but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> successful because of its more eclectic vision, and relatively poor promotion from MCA Records. Electric Circus was considered a commercial disappointment, selling just over 200,000 copies, whereas its predecessor sold over twice as many.|$|E

The season featured Allsopp's 250th match in all league competitions.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} how effective this nozzle system could be, multiple tests {{were carried out}} with the nozzles and without them. In these tests, {{it was discovered that}} the resonance frequencies and the likelihood of cavitation could be reduced by up to 75%. Those who conducted these tests also tried two different arrangements of the nozzles to find out which one was more effective. The first arrangement used only one nozzle, which though it used considerably less power than the other option, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> successful. The multi-nozzle system, on the other hand, gave much better results but required more power to operate.|$|E
25|$|Despite his ODI success, Bevan's Test career <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> successful. Thought to be {{susceptible}} to short-pitched deliveries, {{he never really}} succeeded in the longer form of the game, {{with an average of}} only 29. His problems with short pitched bowling are more myth than reality – he continued to perform consistently in ODIs, despite a rule change which allowed short pitch bowling in ODIs. He also scored heavily in domestic first-class cricket for New South Wales during this time averaging almost 60 with the bat. He performed well during his limited time as a bowler in Test matches, with his bowling style of unorthodox left-arm chinaman spin, including taking ten wickets in a Test match against the West Indies touring side in 1996.|$|E

25|$|In March 1943, , an art historian, {{director}} of the Wiesbaden Gallery and former deputy {{director of}} the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin took over the Special Commission. His appointment was considered odd by some, since he was known to be an anti-Nazi with a considerable number of Jewish friends and colleagues, but Hitler was known to overlook political factors when dealing with matters of art, and Voss's knowledge of southern German artwork, as well as French and Italian painting, may have decided the matter for him. Voss <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> active or energetic as Posse had been, and was prone to send out agents rather than to travel himself to make purchases, or to make dealers bring works to him.|$|E
25|$|UMWA {{support for}} the strike, however, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> strong. International union {{president}} Thomas Lewis had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts to drum up increased {{support for the}} strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the union's resources. Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers. Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the union's support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners.|$|E
25|$|Some company {{directors}} {{questioned the}} wisdom of acquiring extensive rail systems in northern New York State. A direct line to Albany, New York existed for many years through the canal and river system, {{so most of the}} coal markets in the area were already accessible. These concerns were overruled by the majority, who believed there would be great benefit to having an all rail route to Upstate New York that <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> vulnerable to winter weather as the canal. It was also desirable to avoid situations in which the company would have to rely on other railroads to reach its markets. The effort was helped by a report that estimated necessary upgrades to the canal would cost $300,000, an expenditure that would not be needed if rail routes could be purchased or leased.|$|E
