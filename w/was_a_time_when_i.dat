500|$|By the 1970s Tunis {{felt his}} message had been ignored or {{misunderstood}} by most Americans, saying [...] "Nobody has paid attention... There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{expected to do}} some good. But {{that was a long}} while ago." [...] This may seem surprising considering that his New York Times obituary referred to him as a man who [...] "helped educate a whole generation of Americans". Perhaps seen in light of Tunis' distrust of professional athletics, it can be understood. Though he may have felt his message against the commercialization of sports was ignored, there are those who cite Tunis as having made a lasting impact in publishing and to them personally and professionally.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Joel H. Cohen, {{and it was his}} first sole writing credit for a Treehouse of Horror episode. He {{previously}} wrote the [...] "Hex and the City" [...] segment of season 13's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XII". Bob Anderson served as director. It was his third Treehouse of Horror episode, the first two being season seven's [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI" [...] and season 20's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIX". Daniel Radcliffe, star of the Harry Potter film series, guest starred as Edmund in the third segment which parodies the Twilight novel and film series. Radcliffe said that he is a fan of the show and guest starring is [...] "a huge honour. The Halloween episode has become a big tradition in The Simpsons so I'm very excited to be part of it. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was 12 or 13 when 50 percent of everything I knew about the world came from The Simpsons, so this is a big deal." [...] Hugh Laurie of Blackadder and House guest starred as Roger in [...] "Master and Cadaver".|$|E
500|$|In 1665, Bashō and Yoshitada {{together}} with some acquaintances composed a hyakuin, or one-hundred-verse renku. In 1666, Yoshitada's sudden death brought Bashō's peaceful {{life as a}} servant to an end. No records of this time remain, but {{it is believed that}} Bashō gave up any possibility of samurai status and left home. Biographers have proposed various reasons and destinations, including the possibility of an affair between Bashō and a Shinto miko named , which is unlikely to be true. Bashō's own references to this time are vague; he recalled that [...] "at one time I coveted an official post with a tenure of land", and that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was fascinated with the ways of homosexual love": there is no indication whether he was referring to real obsessions or fictional ones. He was uncertain whether to become a full-time poet; by his own account, [...] "the alternatives battled in my mind and made my life restless". His indecision may have been influenced by the then still relatively low status of renga and haikai no renga as more social activities than serious artistic endeavors. In any case, his poems continued to be published in anthologies in 1667, 1669, and 1671, and he published a compilation of work by himself and other authors of the Teitoku school, , in 1672. In about the spring of that year he moved to Edo, to further his study of poetry.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Kakha Kaladze's brother Levan, {{a medical}} student, was kidnapped in Georgia, with a ransom of $600,000 demanded. Georgia's {{president}} at the time, Eduard Shevardnadze, promised that [...] "everything {{is being done to}} locate him". Despite this assurance, the only time that Levan was ever seen was in a video where he was shown blindfolded and begging for help. Following the kidnapping, Kaladze threatened to take up Ukrainian citizenship, but reverted his decision, stating, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought about quitting the national side completely, but I couldn't do it out of respect for the Georgian people and the fans who come and give us such support." [...] Roughly four years later, on 6 May 2005, Georgian police officers found eight dead bodies in the Svaneti region and it was speculated that Levan was among the dead. On 21 February 2006, Levan was officially identified among the deceased, after tests from FBI experts. The local media claimed that the ransom was paid by Kaladze's family, although another source says that Kaladze's father attempted to meet the kidnappers, who fled as they believed he was followed by the police. Two men were sentenced to prison for the murder: David Asatiani for 25 years and Merab Amisulashvili for five years. On 14 July 2009, Kaladze's wife Anouki gave birth to their first-born son in Milan. The couple named their son Levan, in memory of Kaladze's brother.|$|E
