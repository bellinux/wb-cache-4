40|$|Gallium {{selenide}} single crystals doped {{with different}} amounts of tin are studied through resistivity and Hall effect measurements in the temperature range from 30 to 700 K. At low doping concentration tin {{is shown to}} behave as a double acceptor impurity in gallium selenide with ionization energies of 155 and 310 meV. At higher doping concentration tin also introduces deep donor levels, but the material remains p-type in the whole studied range of tin doping concentrations. The deep character of donors in gallium selenide is discussed by comparison of its conduction band structure to that of indium selenide under pressure. The double acceptor center is proposed to be a tin atom in interlayer position, with a local configuration {{that is similar to}} that of tin diselenide. The hole mobility exhibits an anomalous dependence on the tin content, attaining its maximum value in the ingot with 0. 2 % nominal tin content. This is proposed to be related to impurity pairing effects giving rise to thermal shallow acceptors <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> and low carrier scattering cross section, making the hole mobility to be controlled by phonon scattering mechanisms even for relatively high impurity content.

Using a thermodynamic approach along with the fundamental equations for semiconductors, we show that films with partial depletion display unique features and an enhanced dielectric response compared with those fully depleted.

We demonstrate that partially depleted films should be expected to exhibit peculiar capacitance–voltage characteristics at low and high bias and that the thickness effect probed in experiments in ferroelectric thin films could be entirely inverted in thin films with depletion charges where a higher dielectric response can be measured in thicker films. Therefore, depletion charge densities in ferroelectric thin films should be estimated before size-effect-related studies.
