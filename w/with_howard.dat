5|$|After {{a disappointing}} season, the Rockets {{had to make}} some {{significant}} changes to their roster. Howard wasn't happy with his role and the team overall still lacked an identity. On June 1, 2016, the Rockets named Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. Howard opted out of {{the final year of}} his contract later in June, and signed with the Atlanta Hawks in July. <b>With</b> <b>Howard</b> gone, Harden was now the undisputed franchise player. Harden reaffirmed his commitment to the franchise when he signed a four-year, $118.1 million contract extension in July. The Rockets also signed Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon, two perimeter players who complemented Harden and fit D'Antoni's style of play.|$|E

5|$|Hawks' friend Howard Hughes finally {{suggested}} Cary Grant for the role. Grant {{had just}} finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The Awful Truth, and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film. Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving. Grant was initially concerned {{about being able to}} play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. Grant met <b>with</b> <b>Howard</b> Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.|$|E
5|$|During Michigan's in-home visit, Howard's {{grandmother}} treated Michigan {{head coach}} Fisher, his assistants Mike Boyd and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois Howard (Howard's aunt) and Howard to a soul food dinner. Dutcher had {{the responsibility to}} contact Howard several times a week. Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at his house and using his car once he got a driver's license. During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days. Dutcher developed {{an understanding of the}} dynamics of Howard's relationship with his grandmother. While other coaches, such as Lute Olsen, almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher understood that she was the key influence on his life, and understood that Kirskey also had sway <b>with</b> <b>Howard.</b> He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp that, which became the young athlete's introduction to Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script <b>with</b> <b>Howard</b> O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} {{reaching}} peak intensity, the storm moved over cooler waters, causing the eyewall to deteriorate and cloud tops to warm. The next day, {{the eye of}} Howard disappeared from satellite imagery, leading to the cyclone being downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane. Continued deterioration of the system caused rapid weakening, <b>with</b> <b>Howard</b> being downgraded to a tropical storm by 1200UTC on September4. Convection associated with the storm was separated from the center later that day. Early on September5, Howard was further downgraded to a tropical depression and later degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area about 265mi (425km) west-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. The remnants of the hurricane continued towards the northwest before turning towards the southwest the following day as it tracked along the southeast side of a ridge of high pressure. The low continued in this general direction until it dissipated on September10 about 1,150mi (1,850km) west of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The First of the Few (also {{known as}} Spitfire in the US and Canada) (1942) was a British film {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Leslie Howard, <b>with</b> <b>Howard</b> in the starring role of R.J. Mitchell, and David Niven playing a composite character based on the Schneider Trophy pilots of 1927, 1929 and 1931, and the Supermarine test pilot Jeffrey Quill. Some of the footage includes film shot in 1941 of operational Spitfires and pilots of 501 Squadron (code letters SD). Howard {{spent a long time}} researching the history of the Spitfire's development for the film; Mrs. Mitchell and her son Gordon were on the set during much of the production. The aerobatic flying sequences featured in the last 15 minutes of the film were made by Jeffrey Quill in early November 1941, flying a Spitfire Mk II mocked up to represent the prototype.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the villainous Ursula was based upon drag {{performer}} Divine. An additional early inspiration before Divine was Joan Collins {{in her role as}} Alexis Carrington in the television show Dynasty, due to a suggestion from Howard Ashman, who was a fan of the series. Pat Carroll was not Clements and Musker's first choice to voice Ursula; the original script had been written with Bea Arthur of the Disney-owned TV series The Golden Girls in mind. After Arthur turned the part down, actresses such as Nancy Marchand, Nancy Wilson, Roseanne, Charlotte Rae, and Elaine Stritch were considered for the part. Stritch was eventually cast as Ursula, but clashed <b>with</b> <b>Howard</b> Ashman's style of music production and was replaced by Carroll. Various actors auditioned for additional roles in the film, including Jim Carrey for the role of Prince Eric, and comedians Bill Maher and Michael Richards for the role of Scuttle.|$|E

5|$|While Hughes's time at RKO {{was marked}} by dwindling {{production}} {{and a slew of}} expensive flops, the studio continued to turn out some well-received films under production chiefs Sid Rogell and Sam Bischoff, though both became fed up with Hughes's meddling and quit after less than two years. (Bischoff would be the last man to hold the job under Hughes.) There were B noirs such as The Window (1949), which turned into a hit, and The Set-Up (1949), directed by Robert Wise and starring Robert Ryan, which won the Critic's Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The Thing from Another World (1951), a science-fiction drama coproduced <b>with</b> <b>Howard</b> Hawks's Winchester Pictures, is seen as a classic of the genre. In 1952, RKO put out two films directed by Fritz Lang, Rancho Notorious and Clash by Night. The latter was a project of the renowned Jerry Wald–Norman Krasna production team, lured by Hughes from Warner Bros. with great fanfare in August 1950.|$|E
