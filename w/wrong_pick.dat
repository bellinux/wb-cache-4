Dragas became the center of attention for those who supported Sullivan in their expression of dismay. According to a public records release, there were over 450 e-mails sent calling for Dragas to resign as rector. Additionally, the faculty senate of UVA passed a resolution supporting Sullivan and expressing a lack of confidence in Dragas. A newspaper report would later reveal that Sullivan’s supporters, mobilized by John O. “Dubby” Wynne, a former UVA rector who had originally hired Sullivan, had established “a ‘war room’ on grounds, where they organized a counterattack, focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members.” ...|$|E

The reliability of an automatic location algorithm {{is influenced by}} several factors such as errors in picking seismic phases, network geometry, and velocity model uncertainties. The main purpose of this work is to investigate the performances of different automatic procedures to choose the most suitable one to be applied for the quasi-real-time earthquake locations in northwestern Italy. The reliability of two automatic-picking algorithms (one based on the Characteristic Function (CF) analysis, CF picker, {{and the other one}} based on the Akaike's information criterion (AIC), AIC picker) and two location methods (“Hypoellipse” and “NonLinLoc” codes) is analysed by comparing the automatically determined hypocentral coordinates with reference ones. Reference locations are computed by the “Hypoellipse” code considering manually revised data and tested using quarry blasts. The comparison is made on a dataset composed by 575 seismic events for the period 2000 – 2007 as recorded by the Regional Seismic network of Northwestern Italy. For P phases, similar results, in terms of both amount of detected picks and magnitude of travel time differences with respect to manual picks, are obtained applying the AIC and the CF picker; on the contrary, for S phases, the AIC picker seems to provide a significant greater number of readings than the CF picker. Furthermore, the “NonLinLoc” software (applied to a 3 D velocity model) is proved to be more reliable than the “Hypoellipse” code (applied to layered 1 D velocity models), leading to more reliable automatic locations also when outliers (<b>wrong</b> <b>picks)</b> are present...|$|R

40|$|Technology {{innovation}} {{is the key}} to reducing carbon emissions cheaply, according to this report based on the experience of six pollution pricing schemes in Australia and overseas. In each case, costs to reduce pollution, and actual prices, were much lower than governments and their experts expected. Governments consistently got it <b>wrong</b> when <b>picking</b> in advance which technologies would deliver the cheapest reductions. Environmental markets routinely led to innovation to reduce emissions at lower cost in practice than in forecasts. This analysis suggests that markets, enabled by pollution prices, deliver more emissions more cheaply than government selecting specific actions or projects to reduce emissions. Markets unlock ingenuity across the community to find reductions cheaper than governments expect. The analysis also suggests that any pollution pricing scheme should have a floor price to provide certainty for investors. Floor prices effectively reduce the total amount of pollution permitted if {{it turns out to be}} easier than expected to reduce pollution. Technology {{innovation is}} the key to reducing carbon emissions.

40|$|Automatic {{procedure}} for locating earthquake in quasi-real time must {{provide a good}} estimation of earthquakes location within a few seconds after the event is first detected and is strongly needed for seismic warning system. The reliability of an automatic location algorithm is in[U+FB 02]uenced by several factors such as errors in picking seismic phases, network geometry, and velocity model uncertainties. On Mt. Etna, the seismic network is managed by INGV and the quasi-real time earthquakes locations are performed by using an automatic-picking algorithm based on short-term-average to long-term-average ratios (STA/LTA) calculated from an approximate squared envelope function of the seismogram, which furnish a list of P-wave arrival times, and the location algorithm Hypoellipse, with a 1 D velocity model. The main purpose of this work is to investigate the performances of a different automatic procedure to improve the quasi-real time earthquakes locations. In fact, as the automatic data processing may be affected by outliers (<b>wrong</b> <b>picks),</b> {{the use of a}} traditional earthquake location techniques based on a least-square misfit function (L 2 -norm) often yield unstable and unreliable solutions. Moreover, on Mt. Etna, the 1 D model is often unable to represent the complex structure of the volcano (in particular the strong lateral heterogeneities), whereas the increasing accuracy in the 3 D velocity models at Mt. Etna during recent years allows their use today in routine earthquake locations. Therefore, we selected, as reference locations, all the events occurred on Mt. Etna in the last year (2011) which was automatically detected and located by means of the Hypoellipse code. By using this dataset (more than 300 events), we applied a nonlinear probabilistic earthquake location algorithm using the Equal Differential Time (EDT) likelihood function, (Font et al., 2004; Lomax, 2005) which is much more robust in the presence of outliers in the data. Successively, by using a probabilistic non linear method (NonLinLoc, Lomax, 2001) and the 3 D velocity model, derived from the one developed by Patanè et al. (2006) integrated with that obtained by Chiarabba et al. (2004), we obtained the best possible constraint on the location of the focii expressed as a probability density function (PDF) for the hypocenter location in 3 D space. As expected, the obtained results, compared with the reference ones, show that the NonLinLoc software (applied to a 3 D velocity model) is more reliable than the Hypoellipse code (applied to layered 1 D velocity models), leading to more reliable automatic locations also when outliers are present...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Warehouse {{order picking}} {{has often been}} {{described}} as the most labor-intensive operation in manual warehouses, as well as the most expensive and time consuming. These factors have inevitably become even more crucial due to manufacturing and warehousing recent trends, requiring high flexibility and efficiency in processing orders that are always smaller and needed in very few time. For this reason, in the recent years more efficient and performing systems have been proposed and developed, employing various technological solutions that can support pickers during their work. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a new pick-to-light design solution capable of driving a number of different operators in their picking activities, preventing the possibility of human errors by a new real-time control and alert system. The new solution has been analyzed from a technical and economical point of view, developing also a cost and benefit analysis in comparison with other existing solutions. Design/methodology/approach The most widespread techniques adopted to facilitate picking operations generally rely on led displays or digital screens, voice-activated devices, RFID technology, wireless appliances or lighting systems. As far as the latter are concerned, a pick-to-light system supports the picker during his activities by using different kind of lighting devices that can send evident light signals. In particular, the pick-to-light system here described drives an operator through the various storage locations he has to visit with a set of different coloured lights. These lights can be turned on or off according to the picker’s picking list. Furthermore, they are linked to a control system that it is able to recognize whether the operator is accessing the right storage location or not and to alert him with a set of visual (or also acoustic) signals, preventing him from completing the <b>wrong</b> <b>picking</b> action. A prototype of the new pick-to-light system is under development and implementation too, in order to directly understand its strengths and weaknesses. Originality/value The benefits that such support device can typically provide can be summed up in three main points: - Increased accuracy: picking errors are strongly reduced, since pickers can quickly understand whether they are collecting the right item or not - Increased productivity: picking is made easier and more focused on other activities, and the time needed to look for the right picking location or to remedy errors is reduced - Reduced training: finding the various locations is more intuitive and immediate and pickers don’t have to learn to use complex devices The new presented pick-to-light configuration is designed to be easy-to-use, inexpensive, modular and with a low energy impact. Furthermore, the different coloured lights allow multiple operators to work simultaneously in the same area, as every picker can follow the lights of a specific colour. Finally, comparing this solution with other systems already available on the market, its economic sustainability emerges, making it applicable in every kind of industrial environment...|$|R
