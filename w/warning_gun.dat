Should the French return to reimpose slavery, Article 5 {{of the constitution}} declared: [...] "At the first shot of the <b>warning</b> <b>gun,</b> the towns shall be destroyed and the nation will rise in arms." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nor {{was this}} all. Splinter nets had been spread as before, all useless {{woodwork}} thrown overboard, and the surgeons' operating tables made ready. The <b>warning</b> <b>gun</b> from the Iowa {{was followed by}} a gun from the Texas, and then the Brooklyn helped to [...] "open the ball" [...] with her forward eight-inch guns. Another great naval battle, fully equal to that of Manila Bay, was now on.|$|E
50|$|The {{existing}} fort {{was built}} on the remnants of the old Chateau. Its white tower was originally built as a defence by the British in 1804 during the Napoleonic Wars, the builder was a local man, Thomas Henry from Clos du Valle The fort was named after Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey, who was Governor of Guernsey from 1797 to 1807. It was made one of three locations in the island where a <b>warning</b> <b>gun</b> would be fired in case of invasion.|$|E
5000|$|But {{the warning}} was {{delivered}} miles away {{to dozens of}} towns, first by Revere and Dawes on horses, and then by other men on horses and men who rang church bells and town bells, beat drums, and shot off <b>warning</b> <b>guns.</b> (The current status of the lanterns is not entirely clear; one {{is said to be}} in the hands of a private collector, another broken during a tour, and yet another is on display at the Concord Museum.) ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{were very}} high now. Perennial ice {{lay in the}} gullies and {{on the north side}} of the cliffs, and the air was light and keen. Suddenly the wind died away. A gray hush came over the valley. The water in the streams lost its vivid green and became lead-color {{streaked}} with white foam. One by one the mountains were blotted out by the storm. The world of sky and rocks grew mysterious, menacing; but the girl pushed fearlessly forward, singing like a robin, while the rain slashed over her, and the thunder boomed and re-echoed from crag to crag like <b>warning</b> <b>guns</b> in magnificent alarums. [...] "I love this!" [...] she cried, her clear voice piercing the veil of water like a flute note. [...] "Don't you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Let us go {{backward}} a few hours, {{and place}} ourselves in Westminster Abbey, {{at four o'clock}} in the morning of this memorable Coronation Day. We are not without company; for although it is still night, we find the torch-lighted galleries already filling up with people who are well content to sit still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall come for them to see what they may not hope to see twice in their lives --the coronation of a King. Yes, London and Westminster have been astir ever since the <b>warning</b> <b>guns</b> boomed at three o'clock, and already crowds of untitled rich folk who have bought the privilege of trying to find sitting-room in the galleries are flocking in at the entrances reserved for their sort.|$|R
50|$|The {{modus operandi}} of loyalist paramilitaries {{involved}} assassinations, mass shootings, bombings and kidnappings. They used sub machine-guns, assault rifles, pistols, grenades (including homemade grenades), incendiary bombs, booby trap bombs and car bombs. Bomb attacks were usually made without <b>warning.</b> However, <b>gun</b> attacks were {{more common than}} bombings. In January 1994, the UDA drew up a 'doomsday plan', to be implemented should the British Army withdraw from Northern Ireland. It called for ethnic cleansing and re-partition, {{with the goal of}} making Northern Ireland wholly Protestant.|$|R
50|$|Finally, Antoinette Henderson {{testified that}} {{she lived with}} Pedro for {{about five or six}} months until the middle of December 1982. During December she heard Martin say he was going to rob Robinson's store. Martin {{threatened}} her with a <b>gun,</b> <b>warning</b> her that she had better not tell anyone of his plan.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspect was}} not prosecuted for rape, but {{was charged with}} public nudity. However, he argued that his {{statement}} ("The gun is over there") was inadmissible in evidence because he had not first been given the Miranda <b>warning.</b> Since the <b>gun</b> was found {{as a direct result}} of the statement, he argued that the presence of the gun was also inadmissible, making it impossible to convict him.|$|R
25|$|In December 1992, he {{was charged}} with {{bringing}} a gun to the security checkpoint at New York's JFK airport. Connick was arrested by the Port Authority Police in 1992 and charged with having a 9mm pistol in his possession at JFK International Airport. After spending a day in jail, he agreed to make a public-service television commercial <b>warning</b> against breaking <b>gun</b> laws. The court agreed to drop all charges if Connick stayed out of trouble for six months.|$|R
50|$|From 1963 {{until the}} mid-1990s, Elko Tract was a largely ignored piece of land. The {{existing}} infrastructure (including, in some places, building foundations and even park benches) {{made it a}} popular hangout for teenagers and young adults in the area. There are accounts {{from the time of}} people being met in the Tract by men wearing non-distinctive but official-looking uniforms and carrying <b>guns</b> <b>warning</b> people {{to stay out of the}} area. These accounts, however, are not verified.|$|R

6000|$|... "At last he grew impatient, {{and without}} <b>warning</b> lifted his <b>gun</b> and fired at me, aiming low, for he feared lest the ball should pierce my mistress. The shot struck my leg where you see, and {{being unable to}} stop myself, {{although}} I broke my fall by clutching with my hands, I rolled down the rock to the ground beneath, but not {{over the edge of}} the precipice as I could have wished to do, for at the last I had intended to escape him by throwing myself from it.|$|R
50|$|Wesley Baker {{approached}} Jane Tyson, 49, on June 6, 1991, in {{the parking}} lot of Catonsville's Westview Mall as she got into her car with her grandchildren, a 6-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl, after shoe shopping. He placed a gun to her ear and demanded her purse and then, without <b>warning,</b> fired the <b>gun,</b> killing her instantly. He fled to where his accomplice was waiting with a Chevrolet Blazer. A member of the public spotted the two fleeing in a car. He noted the license number and called the police, who apprehended Wesley Baker and Gregory Lawrence a short time later.|$|R
5000|$|On August 24, 2016, while {{operating}} in {{the northern end of}} the Perisan Gulf, the Squall fired three [...]50 caliber machine <b>gun</b> <b>warning</b> shots at an Iranian Revolutionary Guards boat which had been harassing the Squall, the USS Tempest and a ship of the Kuwati navy. During the encounter, the Iranian boat closed within 200 yards of the Tempest and ignored earlier warnings to leave the area conveyed by radio and loud speaker and reinforced with the firing of flares. In accordance with standard maritime procedure, the warning shots were fired into the water. The Iranian boat then left the area.|$|R
5000|$|The {{squadron}} began {{operations on}} 28 October 1944 with a night {{attack against the}} submarine pens at Truk Islands and attacks against Iwo Jima in early November.

On 24 November 1944 Major Robert Morgan, the squadron commander, led the first mission of the XXI Bomber Command to bomb Japan, with wing commander Brigadier Gen. Emmett O'Donnell, Jr. as co-pilot. 110 aircraft of the 73rd Bombardment Wing bombed Tokyo during this mission. Major Morgan and his crew had flown a solo mission on 10 November using radio countermeasures equipment to obtain information on the disposition of Japanese early <b>warning</b> and <b>gun</b> control radars. [...] The 869th flew missions against strategic objectives in Japan, originally in daylight and from high altitude.

2500|$|Monica's career {{came to a}} {{slow down}} in 1999 due to {{relationship}} problems with her ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems. In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, {{who had died in}} an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998, when Weems, without <b>warning,</b> put a <b>gun</b> to his head and committed suicide. [...] "Afterward, I felt, 'What else could I have done?' You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: Maybe if I had said this, or if I would have done that,'" [...] {{she said in an interview}} with The Cincinnati Enquirer the following year. [...] "It's just something that it's never possible for me to go back and change." ...|$|R
25|$|In 233, someone {{reported}} to the imperial court that Cao Gun had violated a curfew by walking on the streets at night when he visited Luoyang {{in the winter of}} 231. Cao Rui knew that Cao Gun had a reputation for his virtuous and good behaviour, so he wanted to overlook this transgression and issue only an official <b>warning</b> to Cao <b>Gun.</b> However, after some officials pressured him, Cao Rui decided to punish Cao Gun by removing two counties, with a total of 750 taxable households, from his princedom. Cao Gun felt so distressed and upset that he instructed his subordinates to be more mindful in the future. Cao Rui appreciated Cao Gun's expression of remorse, so he returned the two counties to Cao Gun in the following year.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News in June 2000, Monica revealed that she was planning to start work on a follow-up to her 1998 album The Boy Is Mine throughout the summer season, with a first single to be released by October of the same year.

In early 2001, Monica eventually decided to resume recording to prepare the release of her third album in fall 2001. Throughout the process, Monica primarily worked with her usual stable of producers, which included Dallas Austin, production team Soulshock & Karlin, Bryan Michael Cox, and Rodney Jerkins and his Darkchild crew.
