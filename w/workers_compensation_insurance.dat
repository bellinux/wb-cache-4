2500|$|The United States {{has been}} {{perceived}} as particularly prone to filing tort lawsuits even {{relative to other}} common law countries, although this perception has been criticized and debated. As of 1987, class actions were relatively uncommon outside of the United States. As of 1987, English law was less generous to the plaintiff in the following ways: contingent fee arrangements were restricted, English judges tried more decisions and set damages rather than juries, wrongful death lawsuits were relatively restricted, punitive damages were relatively unavailable, the collateral source rule was restricted, and strict liability, such as for product liability, was relatively unavailable. England's welfare state, such as free healthcare through National Health Service, may limit lawsuits. On the other hand, as of 1987 England had no workers compensation system and lawsuits due to workplace injuries were relatively common and facilitated by trade unions, whereas in the United States the system of <b>workers</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>insurance</b> prohibits lawsuits against the employer although lawsuits against third parties such as manufacturers does occur. The United States also has faced a rise in no-fault insurance for automobile liability in several states. In England, ombudsmen [...] may also take cases which could alternatively become tort lawsuits.|$|E

50|$|In 1979, Hardy {{introduced}} a bill {{to change the law}} for workers compensation.

Hardy defended the bill, saying that it was intended to help small businesses and minority-owed businesses by reducing the cost of <b>workers</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>insurance.</b> <b>Workers</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>insurance</b> costs had indeed increased for businesses in the District due to new legislation passed by United States Congress.
