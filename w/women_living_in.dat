Each season concludes with a finale, typically involving a major event such as a progressing relationship or a personnel departure. Most installments revolve around the women's everyday lives, with the intention of balancing coverage of their personal and professional endeavors.|$|E
5|$|The heroine, Annis, {{is one of}} Heyer's {{more modern}} characters. Her wealth and spinsterhood allow her a level of freedom that is unusual in a Heyer novel, {{as it was in}} the Regency period. Many of the actions Annis takes, such as moving to a {{different}} city despite her family's objections, were common among <b>women</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s when the novel was written, but in a Regency setting they mark Annis as a bold and unusually independent woman.|$|E

5|$|Polygamy is common, with 39% of <b>women</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> such unions. This is {{sanctioned by}} law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify {{that this is}} unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, {{making it difficult for}} them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E
5|$|The City {{chronicles the}} lives of several young <b>women</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> New York City, New York.

Each season concludes with a finale, typically involving a major event such as a progressing relationship or the departure of a cast member. Most installments revolve around the women's everyday lives, with the intention of balancing coverage of their personal and professional endeavors. The City: Live After Show was occasionally aired following the broadcast of an episode; the program followed The After Show format used by other MTV programs, including The Hills, where Jessi Cruickshank and Dan Levy served as hosts while the audience commented on the episode.|$|E
5|$|While a few former bal maidens found {{alternative}} employment at local factories, and large numbers emigrated, the unemployment situation in Cornwall remained bad. As {{early as the}} 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants, and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted {{effort was made to}} recruit Cornish women to work in the mills. Large numbers of women took up these offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 Cornish <b>women</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Devon (the majority working in domestic service), 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit Cornish women.|$|E

5|$|Cook and Evans argue that, despite {{suffrage}} in Wales {{being introduced}} {{by a new}} generation of immigrant middle-class women, there was still a definite 'Welshness' to the ideology fostered by the nation, which was at loggerheads with their English counterparts. Wales had shown an independent resistance to the EFF and David Lloyd George was still a national institution, despite his prominent role in the government making him an obvious target for disruption. In 1911, after the Women's Coronation Procession, Edith Mansell Moullin formed the Cymric Suffrage Union, a Welsh society based in London. It attempted to link women's suffrage with Wales and Welshness, and sought to unite both Welsh men and <b>women</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the capital to their cause. They distributed hand-bills written in Welsh to the Welsh chapels in London and translated pamphlets of the Conciliation Bill. The Union also expressed their nationality through dressing in traditional Welsh costume during parades and unlike many unions in Wales actually addressed their membership in Welsh as well as the English language at meetings. In 1912 after Lloyd George scuppered the third Conciliation Bill, Mansell Moullin quit the organisation and formed the Forward Cymric Suffrage Union, which had a more militant policy. Members wore red dragon badges with the motto 'O Iesu, n'ad Gamwaith' ('Oh Jesus do not allow unfairness').|$|E

25|$|There are {{significant}} maternal mortality intracountry variations, especially in nations with large equality gaps in income {{and education and}} high healthcare disparities. <b>Women</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> rural areas experience higher maternal mortality than <b>women</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> urban and sub-urban centers because those living in wealthier households, having higher education, or living in urban areas, have higher use of healthcare services than their poorer, less-educated, or rural counterparts. There are also racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes which increases maternal mortality in marginalized groups.|$|E

25|$|Health {{differentials}} amongst races {{can also}} serve as determining factors for other facets of life, including income and marital status.

25|$|By 1921 {{the number}} of <b>women</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Ny-Ålesund grew to twenty-two and there were twenty-three {{children}} who spent the winter. Falling coal prices in 1921 saw the company receive further subsidies from the state. Throughout the 1920s the population varied from year to year. The peak summer population hit 319 men, 29 women and 8 children in 1923, and a low 188 employees in 1929. The winter population varied between 276 in 1926–27 and a low 158 in 1928–29. From the 1920s and onwards there was {{a limited amount of}} tourist traffic visiting Ny-Ålesund.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is similar within countries as well, where {{the health of}} both girls and women is critically affected by social and economic factors. Those who are living in poverty or of lower socioeconomic status tend to perform poorly in terms of health outcomes. In almost all countries, girls and <b>women</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> wealthier households experience lower levels of mortality and higher usage of health care services than those living in the poorer households. Such socioeconomic status-related health disparities is present in every nation around the world, including developed regions.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study on}} the {{maternity}} records of 5750 Hausa <b>women</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the Savannah zone of Nigeria, there were 40 twins and 2 triplets per 1000 births. Twenty-six percent of twins were monozygotic. The incidence of multiple births, which was about five times higher than that observed in any western population, was significantly lower than that of other ethnic groups, who live in the hot and humid climate of {{the southern part of the}} country. The incidence of multiple births was related to maternal age but did not bear any association to the climate or prevalence of malaria.|$|E
25|$|This {{is below}} the {{replacement}} rate of 2.1, and also lower than in previous years.

As of the 1990s, both urban and rural women were averaging fewer children than previously. For those women who do have children, after former president Michelle Bachelet's childcare mandates, childcare centers that provide free services are four times more numerous.
