5|$|At {{present the}} most {{informative}} sequence of dinosaur-bearing {{rocks in the}} world from the K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana. This formation, when compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> (approximately 75Ma) Judith River/Dinosaur Park Formations (from Montana and Alberta respectively) provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10million years of the Cretaceous. These fossil beds are geographically limited, covering only part of one continent.|$|E

5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food {{was available in}} the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back to live <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E
5|$|He {{also started}} a {{successful}} private company in partnership <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> and more experienced Michael Grubb, {{one of the}} directors of the SOIC and founder of the first Swedish trading office in Canton. They traded in Canton and Macao, which technically was against the rules and regulations in the charter of the SOIC. Grill took advantage of the fact that his father was a director of the SOIC, and until his father's death shipped his own goods on board SOIC ships. From Europe the ships brought objets d'art, corals from the Mediterranean Sea, expensive clocks and other mechanical automatons known to the Chinese as sing-songs. Such goods were appreciated by the Emperor and the rich mandarins.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{initially}} became {{established in}} Lower Silesia, Greater Poland, central Poland, and western Masovia and Lesser Poland, gradually replacing, moving eastbound, the Pomeranian {{culture and the}} Cloche Grave culture, coexisting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> cultures for a while (in some cases well into the younger pre-Roman period, 200 to 0 BC) and assimilating in process some of their characteristics, for example the Cloche Grave funerary practice and ceramics. The Przeworsk people must have originated from the above two local cultures, {{because of the lack}} of any other archeologically viable possibility, but in respect to their predecessors they represent a striking cultural discontinuity (different cremation rite and pottery).|$|E

The {{east side of the}} stadium has a large glass curtain wall that faces the nearby International District. The exterior of the stadium also consists of salmon-colored concrete, and {{the west side of the}} structure is partially clad with red brick. The coloring and facade were designed so the stadium would blend <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> buildings in neighboring Pioneer Square. To reduce costs, the exterior was not completed with brick or ornate steel work.|$|E
5|$|There {{are only}} two exposed {{contacts}} of Siletzia <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> (pre-Cenozoic) North American basement. One is near Roseburg, Oregon, where it is thrust against formations of the Klamath Mountains (discussed below), the other is along the Leech River Fault on {{the southern end of}} Vancouver Island, where it has pushed the pre-Cenozoic Pacific Rim formation beneath the Wrangellia Terrane). Everywhere else the contact between Siletzia {{and the rest of the}} continent is concealed under younger deposits, especially the Cascade Range volcanics. The contact around the Olympic Mountains is actually the bottom contact with the underlying oceanic sediments, tilted up by the uplift of the Olympics and exposed by erosion of about 10 to 12km of overlying deposits.|$|E
5|$|Aphilas {{introduced}} {{a number of}} different standards for all three metals, some of which lasted through to the 7th century, while the use of others ended with his reign. His new gold coins (issued in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older)</b> of a quarter aureus and eighth aureus were soon abandoned (each are known from only one specimen), and 1/16 aureus coins have been found, though these {{are more likely to be}} deliberate debasements to increase profit (Aksumite gold was generally very pure, however). Aphilas's silver coin, however, issued at half the weight of the former, became the new Aksumite standard for silver up until the end of coinage. The older coin was presumably more valuable than needed, and the new coin remedied the problem. Aphilas's bronze issue, however, was instead doubled to 4.83grams. The coin's rarity may attest to its quick withdrawal from the market, as is assumed with his quarter-aureus. These two issues are the only one of Aphilas's issues to portray him frontally, rather than in profile.|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN Radio {{expanded}} its coverage by signing programming agreements in 1998 with two subscription-only satellite radio systems: CD Radio (later renamed Sirius Satellite Radio) and General Motors' XM Satellite Radio, bringing {{the station to}} a nationwide audience in 2001. Temporarily for a year during the XM and Sirius merger in 2007 and 2008, it was not heard on Sirius, {{and it is not}} currently available on radios only compatible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Sirius system. The station was added to XM Radio Canada on April 1, 2007. The FM range of the radio station extends as far north as Hanover, Pennsylvania, south around 15 miles beyond Fredericksburg, Virginia, west to 5 miles east of Front Royal, Virginia and east to Cambridge, Maryland. C-SPAN offers three channels of programming for listeners within the FM signal radius with HD radios, using digital technology to multicast all three channels at 90.1 FM. The three channels offer different programming: WCSP-FM's usual programming is broadcast on 90.1 HD-1; 90.1 HD-2 simulcasts C-SPAN, broadcasting coverage of the House of Representatives plus other C-SPAN programming; 90.1 HD-3 simulcasts C-SPAN2, broadcasting coverage of the Senate and audio of Book TV.|$|E
5|$|In 1813 {{the yard}} of the King's Head {{coaching}} inn was widened to create Davey Place, a new street between {{the market and}} Back of the Inns, at that time a narrow passageway which ran parallel to Gentleman's Walk behind the coaching inns. (Although the inns no longer remain, Back of the Inns survives as a street name.) In 1820 the Gasolier, Norwich's first gas lamp, was installed in the market outside the entrance to Davey Place. Exchange Street, a new road running north from {{the northeast corner of}} the market, was completed in 1828 and a roadway was installed alongside the existing footpath. London Street, the main road connecting the market <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> areas of the city around Tombland and the Cathedral was widened in 1856. In 1860 the decrepit fish market adjacent to the Guildhall, by now over 700 years old, was replaced with a new neoclassical building. In 1863 Gentleman's Walk was paved properly with York stone, and in 1874 the cobbles of the marketplace were replaced by timber blocks. Although by this time the market operated on all working days, Sunday trading laws meant it was closed on Sundays. The market space on Sundays was used for public assemblies and gatherings.|$|E
5|$|Linderman {{assumed the}} {{position}} of Director of the Mint and Pollock became Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint. In July 1873, production began on the dies needed to strike the coins. During this time, in a telegram to Pollock, Linderman asked that production of trade dollars be hastened because Mexico was preparing to issue another series of dollars <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> design popular in Asia, a design that was discontinued in 1866. The first trade dollars were struck during a ceremony held on July 11, 1873. Forty thousand pieces were issued in the first release, on July 14. The Carson City Mint received its first dies for the new coins on July 22, and those intended for the San Francisco Mint arrived shortly after. In total, 396,635 business strikes and 865 proof coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint {{during the first year}} of production. The Carson City and San Francisco mints struck 124,500 and 703,000 coins respectively.|$|E

5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E
5|$|Technological {{advances}} proceeded in a {{range of}} areas. Watermills to grind grain had existed during most of the Anglo-Saxon period, using horizontal mill designs; from the 12th century on many more were built, eliminating the use of hand mills, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> horizontal mills gradually supplanted by a new vertical mill design. Windmills began to be built in the late 12th century and slowly became more common. Water-powered fulling mills and powered hammers first appeared in the 12th century; water power was harnessed to assist in smelting by the 14th century, with the first blast furnace opening in 1496. New mining methods were developed and horse-powered pumps were installed in English mines {{by the end of the}} Middle Ages. The introduction of hopped beer transformed the brewing industry in the 14th century, and new techniques were invented to better preserve fish. Glazed pottery became widespread in the 12th and 13th centuries, with stoneware pots largely replacing wooden plates and bowls by the 15th century. William Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde began using the printing press during the late 15th century. Transport links were also improved; many road bridges were either erected or rebuilt in stone during the long economic boom of the 12th and 13th centuries. England's maritime trade benefited from the introduction of cog ships, and many docks were improved and fitted with cranes for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> French pre-dreadnoughts, Charlemagne escorted Allied troop convoys {{through the}} Mediterranean until November {{when she was}} ordered to the Dardanelles to guard against a sortie by Goeben. During the {{bombardment}} on 25 February 1915, the ship engaged the fort at Kum Kale with some effect. On 18 March, Charlemagne, together with , , and Gaulois, was to penetrate deep into the Dardanelles after six British battleships suppressed the defending Turkish fortifications and attack those same fortifications at close range. After the French ships were ordered to be relieved by six other British battleships, Bouvet struck a mine and sank almost instantly while Gaulois was hit twice, one of which opened a large hole in her hull that began to flood the ship. Charlemagne escorted Gaulois to the Rabbit Islands, north of Tenedos, where the latter ship could be beached for temporary repairs. Charlemagne herself was moderately damaged during the bombardment and continued onwards to Bizerte for repairs that lasted through May.|$|E

5|$|Together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> French pre-dreadnoughts, the ship's first {{mission in}} the war was to escort troop convoys from North Africa to France. On 23 September, Saint Louis was ordered to Port Said to escort a British convoy {{carrying}} troops from India. She remained on escort duties until November when she was ordered to the Dardanelles to guard against a sortie by the German battlecruiser Goeben. The ship remained on station there until January 1915 when she was given a brief refit at Bizerte. Upon its completion, Saint Louis was ordered to the Eastern Mediterranean where she became the flagship of the newly formed Syrian Squadron (escadre de Syrie) on 9 February. These ships were intended to attack Turkish positions and lines of communication in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula. Saint Louis participated in the bombardment of Gaza and El Arish in April before she was transferred back to the Dardanelles in May.|$|E
