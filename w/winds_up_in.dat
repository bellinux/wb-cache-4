25|$|One {{major feature}} that distinguishes ZFS from other file systems {{is that it}} is {{designed}} with a focus on data integrity by protecting the user's data on disk against silent data corruption caused by data degradation, current spikes, bugs in disk firmware, phantom writes (the previous write did not make it to disk), misdirected reads/writes (the disk accesses the wrong block), DMA parity errors between the array and server memory or from the driver (since the checksum validates data inside the array), driver errors (data <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the wrong buffer inside the kernel), accidental overwrites (such as swapping to a live file system), etc.|$|E

25|$|A {{paradigm}} {{used for}} primetime couples is the love-hate relationship plotline. In the television series Dynasty, characters Krystle and Blake (Linda Evans and John Forsythe) are seen fighting for years, through ex-lovers {{and a host}} of other interferences. Krystle <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a coma and Blake spends years in jail, but their love eventually wins out over their problems. This resulted in the couple subsequently becoming one of television's classic supercouples. Other early primetime power couplings include Ricky and Lucy (Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball) from I Love Lucy, Pam and Bobby (Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy) from Dallas, and Cliff and Clair Huxtable (Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashād) from The Cosby Show, among others.|$|E
25|$|The more {{important}} aspect of the border crossing is the commercial shipping that goes through, especially the Nogales port. There are two crossings at Nogales, one which connects the downtowns of the two cities, mostly for non-commercial traffic, and the Mariposa Port of Entry outside of the twin cities for trucks and commercial traffic. NAFTA increased cross border shipping. Counting traffic going both north and south, the Nogales port handles about three quarters of all border crossing between Sonora and Arizona. Nogales is a major port of entry for Mexican agricultural products heading to the United States and Canada. In 2005, 268,163 commercial trucks moved through the port, up from 242,435 in 2004, handling about 7.6% of all United States-Mexico truck traffic. Most of the merchandise that passes through Sonora {{on its way to the}} United States <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> western states such as Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Idaho and Montana, as well as into Canada.|$|E
500|$|Observing {{that the}} show's main {{characters}} are each {{based on a}} stereotype, Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph identified Rachel as [...] "the self-absorbed one who goes from riches to rags." [...] According to Reign Magazine, Rachel is [...] "a human being full of vulnerability, humor and strength while aesthetically donning an undeniable beauty and allure." [...] Originally depicted as a character who is unprepared for [...] "the world as an adult", Rachel's personality was gradually tailored to suit Aniston as the series progressed, becoming [...] "more self-sufficient and sympathetic." [...] According to Shining in the Shadows: Movie Stars of the 2000s author Murray Pomerance, [...] "The more boundary collapsed between the 'real' Jennifer Aniston and Rachel, the more 'authentic' Aniston became." [...] Pomerance {{also noted that the}} character's [...] "well-roundedness, normalcy and relatability" [...] is similar to Aniston's, while both the character and the actress herself are very expressive, talking [...] "with [...] hands a good deal." [...] In her book How To Write For Television, author Madeline Dimaggio wrote that although [...] "Rachel grew {{within the context of the}} series ... she would always struggle with the spoiled, image-conscious Daddy's girl who fled from her wedding in the pilot." [...] Similarly, BuddyTV wrote that although Rachel [...] "eventually evolves into being less absorbed in later series, she [...] the most image-centric among the six", while Vogues Edward Barsamian opined, [...] "She might have been self-centered and bratty, but Rachel Green was perhaps the most stylish and unabashedly fashion-obsessed character on the show." [...] TV Land summarized the character's arc and development in the website's biography of her, writing, [...] "Rachel is a born shopper, but... she’s not necessarily a born worker. In fact, before moving in with Monica, she’s never had to work at all, thanks to the generosity of her parents. Luckily, Rachel is smart, resourceful and chic, so her future is bright, both as a member of the workforce and with her newfound tribe." [...] Examining the character's sexuality, Splitsider's Mike D'Avria determined that Rachel has had the third most sexual partners, 14, as well as the highest percentage of serious monogamous relationships at 71%. D'Avria opined, [...] "Throughout the whole series Rachel is continually meeting men she wants to impress. Her flirtations typically fail, but she somehow <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a serious relationship with them." [...] Additionally, Rachel is also the only character to admit to having had a homosexual experience.|$|E

[...] However, these operations have destroyed about 2,600 hectares. These operations produce noise, smoke, dust and small tremblers from explosions used to extract the minerals. Much of the environment damage come from runoff from mining waste which <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Grijalva River. However the dust and smoke have produced a distinct white coating on surrounding flora.|$|E

2500|$|After several misadventures, and {{escaping}} from Pontius Pilate, Brian <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a line-up of would-be mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced {{to come up}} with something plausible in order to blend in and keep the guards off his back, Brian repeats some of what he had heard Jesus say, and quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but he has unintentionally inspired a movement. He grows frantic when he finds that some people have started to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a miracle. Their responses grow in fervour and intensity, making it harder and harder for him to get away from them, yet because of the mob's excitement over the 'miracles' they discover, they ultimately end up completely ignoring Brian himself. [...] Judith is the only one that doesn't leave; Brian and Judith then spend the night together. In the morning, Brian, completely naked, opens the curtains to discover an enormous crowd outside his mother's house which proclaims him to be the Messiah. Brian's mother protests, telling the crowd that [...] "He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy" [...] and, [...] "There's no Messiah in here. There's a mess, all right, but no Messiah." [...] All of her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed. Furthermore, once Brian addresses them, he also finds that he is unable to change their minds. His followers are completely committed to their belief in Brian's divinity. They immediately seize upon everything he says and does as points of doctrine.|$|E

6000|$|Deputy Brissot perorates {{from that}} Tribune; Desmoulins, our wicked Camille, interjecting audibly from below, [...] "Coquin!" [...] Here, though oftener in the Cordeliers, reverberates the lion-voice of Danton; grim Billaud-Varennes is here; Collot d'Herbois, {{pleading}} for the Forty Swiss; tearing a passion to rags. Apophthegmatic Manuel <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> this pithy way: [...] "A Minister must perish!"--to which the Amphitheatre responds: [...] "Tous, Tous, All, All!" [...] But the Chief Priest and Speaker of this place, as we said, is Robespierre, the long-winded incorruptible man. What spirit of Patriotism dwelt in men in those times, this one fact, {{it seems to}} us, will evince: that fifteen hundred human creatures, not bound to it, sat quiet under the oratory of Robespierre; nay, listened nightly, hour after hour, applausive; and gaped as for the word of life. More insupportable individual, one would say, seldom opened his mouth in any Tribune. Acrid, implacable-impotent; dull-drawling, barren as the Harmattan-wind! He pleads, in endless earnest-shallow speech, against immediate War, against Woollen Caps or Bonnets Rouges, against many things; and is the Trismegistus and Dalai-Lama of Patriot men. Whom nevertheless a shrill-voiced little man, yet with fine eyes, and a broad beautifully sloping brow, rises respectfully to controvert: he is, say the Newspaper Reporters, 'M. Louvet, Author of the charming Romance of Faublas.' Steady, ye Patriots! Pull not yet two ways; with a France rushing panic-stricken in the rural districts, and a Cimmerian Europe storming in on you! ...|$|E
