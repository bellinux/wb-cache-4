5|$|The pilots' smaller stories {{actually}} make a bigger point, {{which is that}} we're all {{together in the same}} robot … Either we get along or we die. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>this</b> to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.|$|E
5|$|Seventy {{minutes of}} footage, mostly {{dealing with the}} origin, were not {{included}} in the final cut. Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet. Editor Kyle Cooper, creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits. Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in compressing these to the film's start. This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not <b>want</b> <b>this</b> scene to be lost amid the opening montage.|$|E

5|$|The section {{north of}} Maricopa, toward present day I-10, {{was built by}} 1939. The road headed north toward Tempe to U.S. Route 80. Between 1951 and 1958, the road was {{extended}} south to its current terminus at SR 84; at this time, I-10 had still not been built, nor had the route become a numbered route. By 1971, I-10 was finished through {{the south and east}} edges of the Phoenix area. In 1989, ADOT made preparations to establish the number along Maricopa Road and reserved the right-of-way along the parkway. This may have been because of a controversy over the name of John Wayne Parkway, which the road was dubbed at the time. The Gila River Native Americans, whose reservation the parkway ran on, did not <b>want</b> <b>this</b> name, as John Wayne, the actor who formerly owned a ranch on the road, had appeared in several movies in which he had killed Native Americans. In 1997, the route was officially established as a state highway with its current routing. SR 347 was widened from a two-lane road to the four-lane expressway that it is today.|$|E

25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I <b>want</b> <b>this</b> to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

After shooting had finished in South Korea, Olivier returned to England. He was needed in South Korea to shoot the final scene, but as a concession to his poor health, was allowed to film in Rome instead. The film's director Terence Young was {{not happy with the}} completed version of the film, and said [...] "the producers have turned Inchon into a Korean propaganda movie."

[...] Alluding to the Navy athletic staff's perceived reticence, she added, [...] "We got past the Charlotte situation." [...] The delay in scheduling was attributed to the need for a three-way contract between Maryland, Navy, and the stadium tenants, the Baltimore Ravens. For this reason, a renewal as far off as 2014 was not seriously discussed. Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "I {{would like to see it}} as an annual game, but that's not for me to decide." ...|$|E

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Robert Blackman {{created the}} costume for Arturis, who {{noted that the}} character was [...] "diabolical" [...] but didn't <b>want</b> <b>this</b> to be given away through the costume immediately. In order {{to make him look}} [...] "curious and affable", he placed the character in a shirt and pair of trousers. Where the script called for him to be shot by weapons fire, a burn on the shirt was created by key costumer Kimberley Shull using the hair color product Streaks and Tips. It was initially darker than intended, but the residue cleaned off to the desired level. Prop creator Alan Sims created Arturis' pistol weapon, intending for it to be held horizontally to give it a more alien appearance. It was made from two molds of a generic pistol weapon created for The Next Generation.|$|E

We do not <b>want</b> <b>this</b> war." [...] When JNA troops transferred to the front via the Višegrad region of north-eastern Bosnia, local Bosnian Croats and Muslims set up barricades and machine-gun posts. They halted a column of 60 JNA tanks but were dispersed by force the following day. More than 1,000 people had to flee the area.
