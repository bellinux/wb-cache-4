40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{determine}} {{the role of}} diffusion weighted MR imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in chest <b>wall</b> <b>masses.</b> Materials and methodsThis study included 62 patients with chest <b>wall</b> <b>masses.</b> They underwent routine MR imaging and diffusion MR weighted imaging on a 1. 5 T MR unit (Symphony-Siemens). Diffusion MR imaging was done with diffusion factor b value of 0, 500, and 1000 s/mm 2. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map was reconstructed. The signal intensity was visually assessed on ADC maps and ADC value was measured in chest wall lesions. The mean ADC values correlated with histo-pathological results. ResultsAdequate ADC maps were obtained in 62 patients. The mean ADC values of chest wall lesions were 1. 76 ± 0. 08 × 10 − 3 mm 2 /s in inflammatory lesion, 3. 21 ± 0. 05 × 10 − 3 mm 2 /s in the cystic lesions, 1. 67 ± 0. 03 × 10 − 3 mm 2 /s in neurofibroma, 2. 12 ± 0. 07 × 10 − 3 in haemangioma, and 0. 89 ± 0. 06 × 10 − 3 mm 2 /s in malignant tumors. The mean ADC value of the malignant tumor was significantly {{different from that of}} benign chest wall tumors (P< 0. 001). ConclusionDiffusion weighted MR imaging is a new imaging modality for differentiation malignant from benign chest <b>wall</b> <b>masses.</b> In addition, it has a role in characterization of different malignant and benign tumors...|$|R

5000|$|What {{makes this}} {{building}} special, {{in addition to}} its distinctive architectural value, is its unique memorial function. The church's crypt stores about 37 m³ of remains of Serbian and enemy soldiers who died in the Battle of Kolubara in 1914. The crypt was renovated between 1961 and 1964 under the direction of architect D. St. Pavlović. The area of the crypt was then divided into three parts. The first part is located in the west, the second in the central, and the third {{in the eastern part of}} the crypt. The main entrance to the crypt was opened on the north wall of the west continent. Their surfaces are filled by special panels on which basic information about the Battle of Kolubara and significant details are carved and effective visual representations of battlefields on which the Battle of Kolubara took place, arrangement of Serbian and enemy forces at certain stages of the battle, display of breakthroughs and directions of enemy prosecution. Relief plates are also built into particular frames. They illustrate the details of the Battle of Kolubara and the work of the sculptor Мihailo Tomić in a creative way. Text is engraved in the eastern side of the <b>wall</b> <b>mass.</b> The silhouette figures of Serbian soldiers, peasant men and peasant women in folk costumes were derived in shallow relief. With regard to the grave function of this space, the wall compartments of the charnel-house above the sarcophagus are refined with a decorative cladding of red marble, and 21 gray marble plate inscribed with the army's regiments is inserted on each side; on the north wall, of the Army of the commander General Živojin Mišić, on the eastern wall, of the II Army of the commander Duke Stepan Stepanović, and on the south wall, of the III Army of the commander General Pavle Jurišić-Šturm and of the Užice military commander General Vukoman Aračić. The niche of the east continent hosts a sculpture of a soldier. This building was included into the list of cultural monuments of [...] "exceptional importance" [...] in 1966. The church iconostasis was painted in 1940 by a prominent Russian emigrant painter Pimen Sofronov. It had been planned that he should paint the church with icons, but this could not be achieved due to the outbreak of the Second Wolrd War. The church was painted with icons only in the last decade of the 20th and first half of the 21st century. Built at the very end of the interwar period, the memorial church with the charnel-house in Lazarevac is stylistically unique and recognizable work. It is, next to Church of Saint Đorđe in Oplenac, the most monumental memorial that was erected in the former Кingdom of Yugoslavia, which gives it a special character.|$|E

By use of analytic geometry, mathematical expressions for RV surface area, volume and mass were derived.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} study whether {{patients}} with right ventricular failure (RVF) secondary to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) have reduced left ventricular (LV) mass, and whether LV mass reduction {{is caused by}} atrophy. BackgroundThe LV in patients with CTEPH is underfilled (unloaded). LV unloading may cause atrophic remodeling {{that is associated with}} diastolic and systolic dysfunction. MethodsWe studied LV mass using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 36 consecutive CTEPH patients (before/after pulmonary endarterectomy [PEA]) and 11 healthy volunteers selected to match age and sex of patients. We studied whether LV atrophy is present in monocrotaline (MCT) -injected rats with RVF or controls by measuring myocyte dimensions and performing in situ hybridization. ResultsAt baseline, CTEPH patients with RVF had significantly lower LV free <b>wall</b> <b>mass</b> indexes than patients without RVF (35 ± 6 g/m 2 vs. 44 ± 7 g/m 2, p = 0. 007) or volunteers (42 ± 6 g/m 2, p = 0. 006). After PEA, LV free <b>wall</b> <b>mass</b> index increased (from 38 ± 6 g/m 2 to 44 ± 9 g/m 2, p = 0. 001), as right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction improved (from 31 ± 8 % to 56 ± 12 %, p < 0. 001). Compared with controls, rats with RVF had reduced LV free <b>wall</b> <b>mass</b> and smaller LV free wall myocytes. Expression of atrial natriuretic peptide was higher, whereas that of α-myosin heavy chain and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase- 2 were lower in RVF than in controls, both in RV and LV. ConclusionsRVF in patients with CTEPH is associated with reversible reduction in LV free <b>wall</b> <b>mass.</b> In a rat model of RVF, myocyte shrinkage due to atrophic remodeling contributed to reduction in LV free <b>wall</b> <b>mass...</b>|$|E

The {{results indicated that the}} growth of the mutant strains was comparable to wild type strain without anhydrotetracycline. Further, the growth of the mutant strains was abolished when anhydrotetracycline was added {{as a result of the}} reduced expression of Ddl. Ddl gene repression was positively correlated with the concentration of anhydrotetracycline. When 2  ng mL− 1 anhydrotetracycline was added, the cell <b>wall</b> <b>mass</b> of the mutant decreased by only 14.7 % and there was no difference between the MIC of d-cycloserine to the mutant with or without this effector. However, when the concentration of anhydrotetracycline was increased to 20  ng mL− 1, the cell <b>wall</b> <b>mass</b> decreased to 44.9 % and the MIC was 16 times lower. Cell <b>wall</b> <b>mass</b> was only 26.2 % when 200  ng mL− 1 anhydrotetracycline was added. After adding 2000  ng mL− 1 anhydrotetracycline hardly any colonies were formed and cell <b>wall</b> <b>mass</b> did not changed from 200  ng mL− 1. It was speculated that the repression of Ddl gene expression through the addition of anhydrotetracycline had reached its limit. Given the low copy number at 200 and 2000  ng mL− 1 anhydrotetracycline, the MIC of d-cycloserine to the mutant was not determined. The data confirm that we were able to fully repress Ddl gene expression using anhydrotetracycline, and that the amount of Ddl protein correlates to the concentration of anhydrotetracycline added to the culture medium.|$|E
