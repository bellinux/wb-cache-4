40|$|Ebola spreads {{through direct}} contact with blood or body fluids (such as saliva or urine) of an {{infected}} person or by objects contaminated with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Avoid directly touching sick people or items contaminated with blood or body fluids, and use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for protection of yourself and others. PPE equipment should be worn properly throughout your period of potential exposure. During routine cleaning and other activities, follow usual procedures. While you are cleaning areas {{that might have been}} contaminated with body fluids that came from someone who might have been infected with Ebola (for example, from a person who was sent to secondary screening), you should wear two pairs of waterproof disposable gloves, long-sleeved waterproof gown, face mask, and eye protection such as face shield (preferred) or goggles. You should also wear close-toed shoes; <b>wear</b> <b>shoe</b> coverings when cleaning body fluids from the floor to prevent your shoes from getting contaminated. These protective items are important to protect your skin, eyes, nose, and mouth from contact with body fluids and to keep your clothes from becoming contaminated. You should remove and properly dispose of your PPE (see below) immediately after cleaning body fluids. You should then put on new PPE (if needed) to resume work.

50|$|Those {{who have}} loose ligaments {{in the legs}} and feet often mistakenly assume that they have flat feet. While their feet have an arch when not {{supporting}} weight, when stood upon, the arch will flatten. This is because the loose ligaments cannot support the arch {{in the way that}} they should. This can make walking and standing painful and tiring.Pain will usually occur in the feet and lower legs, but can also spread to the back due to abnormal standing and walking habits. <b>Wearing</b> <b>shoes</b> that have good arch support can help minimize the discomfort. The underlying problem, however, is not solved by <b>wearing</b> <b>shoes</b> with arch supports or worsened by <b>wearing</b> <b>shoes</b> without arch support.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of different outsole hardness of turf cleats shoes on the lower limb kinematics and kinetics of soccer players playing on artificial turf. The participants were required to complete tasks of straight running and 45 ° left sidestep cutting movements, respectively, at the speed of 4. 5 ± 0. 2 m/s on artificial turf. They were asked to randomly select turf cleats shoes with a soft outsole (SO), medium hardness outsole (MO) and hard outsole (HO). During the stance phase of straight running, peak pressure and force-time integral in medial forefoot (MFF) of players <b>wearing</b> cleats <b>shoes</b> with MO were significantly higher than those <b>wearing</b> cleats <b>shoes</b> with SO. During the stance phase of a 45 ° cutting maneuver, players <b>wearing</b> cleats <b>shoes</b> with SO showed significantly higher peak knee flexion and abduction angles than the HO group. Players <b>wearing</b> cleats <b>shoes</b> with SO also showed higher ankle dorsiflexion and inversion angles compared with those <b>wearing</b> cleats <b>shoes</b> with HO. The vertical average loading rate (VALR) as well as peak pressure and force-time integral in the heel (H) and lateral forefoot (LFF) regions of players <b>wearing</b> cleats <b>shoes</b> with HO were significantly higher than those <b>wearing</b> <b>shoes</b> with SO. On the contrary, peak pressure and force-time integral of players <b>wearing</b> <b>shoes</b> with SO were significantly higher than those <b>wearing</b> <b>shoes</b> with HO in MFF. A higher vertical loading rate and plantar pressure of some areas may increase the potential risk of metatarsal stress fractures and plantar fasciitis. Therefore, this finding about turf cleats shoes could give some theoretic support for the design of turf cleats shoes and material optimization in the future...|$|R
