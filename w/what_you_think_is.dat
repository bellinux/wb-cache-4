500|$|Upon Burton's casting, it was {{revealed}} by MSN that Dylan, who was described as [...] "the mysterious ex Avery keeps bringing up" [...] by Jillian Bowe of Zap2it, {{would be involved in}} a love triangle with his ex-girlfriend Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins) and her current lover, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> going to happen is not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind {{despite the fact that she}} had moved on.|$|E

[...] Along with the {{photographs}} of leaves and shadows Beckjord believed showed images of Bigfoot, he also reported having seen Bigfoot footprints that turned into deer tracks, confirming for him that the creature had the ability to shift its shape. He theorized that Bigfoot creatures share a [...] "space-time origin and connection with UFOs and come from an alternative universe by a wormhole." ...|$|E
2500|$|This is at {{the heart}} of the tetralogy's achievement. Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an {{exercise}} in point of view. This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth. Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity. A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism. In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and allow your characters eloquence, [...] "and not chop them down to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> the right size." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 31, 2014, {{at a press}} conference, Niiya officially {{announced}} her retirement from running professionally, citing her foot injury as the cause. [...] In November 2012, {{she was diagnosed with}} plantar fasciitis in her right foot and had decided then that the 2013 World Championships would be her last professional race. [...] When asked to reflect back on her past career as a runner, she said, [...] "Once I'm a granny I might think, 'Man that was hard,' but right now I have nothing but good memories" [...] and that her favorite memory was winning the National High School Ekiden Championships while attending Kōjōkan High School. [...] When asked about her future away from the sport, she said, [...] "It's a complete blank. [...] I can't imagine what I'll be doing. [...] I can't do anything useful for society, but I will completely cut off connection with the world of athletics." [...] She cried with her mother and left these final words for future athletes: [...] "Always do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> the right thing no matter what anybody tells you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court {{has been}} criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by {{engaging}} in judicial activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology. An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, which {{has been criticized}} by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts, and which was reversed in the 1930s. [...] An often cited example of liberal judicial activism is Roe v. Wade (1973), which legalized abortion in part {{on the basis of the}} [...] "right to privacy" [...] inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous. Legal scholars, justices, and presidential candidates have criticized the Roe decision. The progressive Brown v. Board of Education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater. More recently, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations. Lincoln warned, referring to the Dred Scott decision, that if government policy became [...] "irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have ceased to be their own rulers." [...] Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: [...] "You do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> right and let the law catch up." [...] During different historical periods, the Court has leaned in different directions. Critics from both sides complain that activist-judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead. Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano, Phyllis Schlafly, Mark R. Levin, Mark I. Sutherland, and James MacGregor Burns. Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: [...] "What judges have wrought is a coup d'état,– slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless." [...] Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism, [...] "their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than they would like." [...] One law professor claimed in a 1978 article that the Supreme Court is in some respects [...] "certainly a legislative body." ...|$|E
