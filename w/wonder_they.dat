5|$|Whatever {{the true}} {{extent of their}} {{financial}} rewards from the tour, the Mozart family continued to live in their cramped apartment on the Getreidegasse, while Leopold resumed his duties as a court musician. However, travel and public display dominated {{the next six years}} of Wolfgang's life. In September 1767 the family was on the move again, this time to Vienna, remaining there (apart from an enforced evacuation during a smallpox epidemic) until January 1769. In December of the same year Leopold and Wolfgang left for Italywithout Nannerl who, now 18, was no longer exhibitable as a child <b>wonder.</b> <b>They</b> were away for sixteen months, and returned to Milan in August 1771 for five months, to attend rehearsals and the performance of Wolfgang's opera Ascanio in Alba. A third and final visit to Italy, from October 1772 until March 1773, was the last of the extended trips; the new Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Hieronymous Colloredo, had distinct views about the roles of his court musicians, which precluded the freedoms that Leopold—and now Wolfgang, himself employed by the court—had formerly enjoyed.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Arsenal next played Manchester United, the club had {{extended}} its unbeaten league run to 49 games. United stood in sixth {{place in the}} table, 11 points behind Arsenal and were intent on ending their rivals' undefeated streak. Ferguson in his press conference described Arsenal's conduct in the equivalent fixture a year ago as [...] "...the worst thing I've seen in this sport. No <b>wonder</b> <b>they</b> were so delighted at the verdicts." ...|$|E

500|$|Of de Grasse's {{negotiations}} with the Spanish that secured {{the use of his}} fleet and his order to the economic fleet to remain in the West Indies, Royal Navy Captain Thomas White, in his 1830 analysis of the 1781 campaign, wrote that [...] "f the British government had sanctioned, or a British admiral had adopted such a measure, [...] the one would have been turned out, and the other would have been hung: no <b>wonder</b> <b>they</b> succeeded and we failed." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{men come}} to church to save or gain a reputation; {{or because they}} will not be singular, but comply with an {{established}} custom; yet, all the while, they are loaded with the guilt of old rooted sins. These men can expect to hear of nothing but terrors and threatenings, their sins laid open in true colours, and eternal misery the reward of them; therefore, no <b>wonder</b> <b>they</b> stop their ears, and divert their thoughts, and seek any amusement rather than stir the hell within them." ...|$|E
500|$|In the lead-up to the match, Ferguson criticised Arsenal's {{previous}} conduct at Old Trafford and likened their behaviour {{to that of}} a mob: [...] "What Arsenal players {{did that}} day was the worst thing I've seen in this sport. No <b>wonder</b> <b>they</b> were so delighted at the verdicts." [...] He described the game as must win given Arsenal's points advantage, but highlighted it was still all to play for given the league leaders needed to play several top teams twice. Although Ferguson praised Arsenal's unbeaten run, he disputed whether this heralded a shift of power in English football: [...] " [...] are still the team every club wants to beat most of all – regardless of who is champions or unbeaten records. In that respect, our profile as the major club in the country is untouchable. That is obvious and will never change." ...|$|E

500|$|Badu {{subsequently}} held recording {{sessions at}} Electric Lady Studios in New York City, where {{the album was}} completed. [...] "Everything that the producers e-mailed me I put into GarageBand", she explained to Remix. [...] "Then we would try to duplicate it at Electric Lady. I did vocals on my laptop, babies crying and everything. I also EQ'd the tracks using effects like GarageBand's Vocal Reflection." [...] Badu worked with audio engineers Chris Bell, Tom Soares, and Chavarria, who had spent numerous hours with Badu listening to her previous albums, including her 1997 debut Baduizm and its 2000 follow-up Mama's Gun, and older albums such as The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) by progressive rock band Pink Floyd and Innervisions (1973) by Stevie <b>Wonder.</b> <b>They</b> worked with the producers' emailed music and embellished their own 2-tracks by using Pro Tools to incorporate live instrumentation such as bass, guitar, flutes, percussion, and keyboards. Contributing musicians included vocalist Georgia Anne Muldrow, trumpeter Roy Hargrove, vibraphonist Roy Ayers, guitarist Omar Rodríguez-López, and vocalist Bilal.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the album, Madonna was {{dismissed}} by some critics. They called her voice sounding as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium", while the other detractors suggested that she was [...] "almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers." [...] Madonna said: [...] "From the very beginning of my career, people have been writing shit about me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'." [...] She responded to the comment [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium" [...] by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that [...] "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again." [...] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, [...] "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit <b>wonder.</b> <b>They</b> pushed me to be better, and I am grateful for their resistance." ...|$|E
500|$|There are a {{large number}} of castles in the {{countryside}} surroundings, constructed by wealthy medieval families living in the city. The most notable of them is the Bonțida Bánffy Castle—once known as [...] "the Versailles of Transylvania"—in the nearby village of Bonțida, [...] from the city centre. In 1963, the castle was used as a set for Liviu Ciulei's film Forest of the Hanged, which won an award at Cannes. There are other castles located {{in the vicinity of the}} city; indeed, the castle at Bonțida is not even the only one constructed by the Bánffy family. The commune of Gilău features the Wass-Bánffy Castle, while another Bánffy Castle is located in the Răscruci area. In addition, Nicula Monastery, erected during the 18th century, is an important pilgrimage site in northern Transylvania. This monastery houses the renowned wonder-working Madonna of Nicula. The icon is said to have wept between 15 February and 12 March 1669. During this time, nobles, officers, laity and clergy came to see it. At first they were sceptical, looking at it on both sides, but then humbly crossed themselves and returned home petrified by the <b>wonder</b> <b>they</b> had seen. During the feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos (commemorating the death of the Virgin Mary) on 15 August, more than 150,000 people from all over the country come to visit the monastery.|$|E
