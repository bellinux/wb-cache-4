5|$|Owing {{to their}} wood-eating habits, many termite species can do great damage to {{unprotected}} buildings and other <b>wooden</b> <b>structures.</b> Their habit of remaining concealed {{often results in}} their presence being undetected until the timbers are severely damaged, leaving {{a thin layer of}} a wall that protects them from the environment. Of the 3,106 species known, only 183 species cause damage; 83 species cause significant damage to <b>wooden</b> <b>structures.</b> In North America, nine subterranean species are pests; in Australia, 16 species have an economic impact; in the Indian subcontinent 26 species are considered pests, and in tropical Africa, 24. In Central America and the West Indies, there are 17 pest species. Among the termite genera, Coptotermes has the highest number of pest species of any genus, with 28 species known to cause damage. Less than 10% of drywood termites are pests, but they infect <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> and furniture in tropical, subtropical and other regions. Dampwood termites only attack lumber material exposed to rainfall or soil.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{was light}} in Maryland. Some sand dunes and <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> were damaged, and above-normal tides occurred. In New Jersey, high winds caused power outages and knocked down trees and power lines. Minor coastal {{flooding}} of streets and houses was reported. Otherwise, {{damage in the}} state was minor.|$|E
5|$|Super Typhoon Pamela was {{not only}} a wet {{tropical}} cyclone for the island of Guam, but a destructive one as well. Since Pamela, <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> across Guam have been largely replaced by concrete structures in order to better weather typhoons.|$|E
50|$|The roof of {{the temple}} is made of a <b>wooden</b> <b>structure</b> covered with clay tiles. The {{cylinder}} of the main dome is built in brick; the rest is a <b>wooden</b> <b>structure</b> covered in copper plates. The tower domes also are built with a <b>wooden</b> <b>structure</b> covered in copper plates, but these plates appear silver on the outside.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Astor Bridge, a <b>wooden</b> <b>structure,</b> {{was constructed}} across the St. Johns River in 1926; it replaced a ferry that crossed {{the river at}} Astor. A steel swing section was later constructed, replacing the original <b>wooden</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|R

5|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop. Hanging downwards on wooden stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split longitudinally {{to release the}} winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. <b>Wooden</b> <b>structures</b> known as lamellae separate the seeds {{from each other and}} the follicle walls.|$|E
5|$|Constructed from 1406 to 1420, {{the complex}} {{consists}} of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). The palace exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture, and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and is listed by UNESCO {{as the largest}} collection of preserved ancient <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> in the world.|$|E
5|$|Greek-style homes {{gave way}} to Gothic Revival in the 1830s, which {{emphasized}} pointed arches, steep gable roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival. Italianate elements emerged in the 1840s including cupolas, verandas, ornamental brickwork, or corner quoins. Norfolk still had simple <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> among its more ornate buildings.|$|E

5|$|The Great New York City Fire of 1845 {{broke out}} on July 19, 1845. The fire started in a whale oil and candle {{manufacturing}} establishment and quickly {{spread to other}} <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> in New York City the neighborhood. It reached a warehouse on Broad Street where combustible saltpeter was stored and caused a massive explosion that spread the fire even farther.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} defences were {{in place}} by the time of Ranulph's death in 1232, there were no living quarters, and neither were there on the death of Ranulph's {{successor}} John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and used it as a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> within the outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|By the 1870s, Chicago {{had become}} the main {{financial}} center for the West, but in October 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed {{the majority of the}} <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> within city. The city was rebuilt on large plots of land in a new grid network and followed new city ordinances that prohibited construction in wood. These factors encouraged the building of taller properties in new innovative designs, which, like New York, saw a range of businesses and services being packed into single buildings.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by <b>wooden</b> <b>structures,</b> elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.|$|E
5|$|Norway's {{architectural}} {{trends are}} also seen to parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the Viking Age, <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> {{developed into a}} sophisticated craft evident in the elegant and effective construction of the Viking longships. Following that, the ascent of Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, cruciform piers supporting vaults, and groin vaults; in large part {{as a result of}} religious influence from England.|$|E
5|$|Over these centuries, {{the city}} {{suffered}} numerous assaults. In the 13th century, Mongol forces destroyed a nine-story wooden pagoda at Hwangnyongsa. During the Japanese invasions of Korea, the Gyeongju area became a heated battlefield, and Japanese forces burned the <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> at Bulguksa. Not all damage {{was due to}} invasions, however. In the early Joseon period, {{a great deal of}} damage was done to Buddhist sculptures on Namsan by Neo-Confucian radicals, who hacked arms and heads off statuary.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the graves}} {{are marked by}} plain {{triangular}} stones set at one end. These are not carved or inscribed with names as in Christian cemeteries, but are similar to markers found in pagan cemeteries. Some graves are interrupted by stakeholes cut into them, possibly indicating the presence of wooden poles that might have served as markers or supported <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> within the graves. This is unusual {{in the north of}} England, though comparable examples have been found in Kent in the south-east.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the center}} of the storm {{remained}} offshore, outer rainbands led to heavy rainfall that triggered substantial flooding. In Michoacán, Dalila flooded ten municipalities with at least 15in (380mm) of precipitation, destroying dozens of <b>wooden</b> <b>structures.</b> Heavy rains in Jalisco killed eleven, many of whom occurred in automobile crashes. Flood waters covered numerous roads, causing many accidents, while approximately 50 homes were damaged. Rough seas and heavy rain affected Baja California Sur, though no damage or fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|To avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, {{two main}} {{sections}} of Borobudur stairs — the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides — {{are covered with}} <b>wooden</b> <b>structures.</b> The similar technique has been applied in Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids. In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with rubber cover. Proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals.|$|E

50|$|The Helmhaus is an {{extension}} of the church to the north, first mentioned in 1253 as a court of criminal justice, at which time it was a simple <b>wooden</b> <b>structure</b> covering the eastern end of the bridge. It was extended to a larger <b>wooden</b> <b>structure</b> in 1563, and replaced with a stonework hall in 1791.|$|R

5|$|Desperate for {{materials}} and short on funds, the palace was initially built {{entirely out of}} wood, its various structures surrounded by a simple log palisade. On 10 June 1782, the king ceremonially crossed the river from Thonburi to take permanent residence in the new palace. Three days later on 13 June, the king held an abbreviated coronation ceremony, thus becoming the first monarch of the new Rattanakosin Kingdom. Over {{the next few years}} the king began replacing <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> with masonry, rebuilding the walls, forts, gates, throne halls and royal residences. This rebuilding included the royal chapel, which would come to house the Emerald Buddha.|$|E
5|$|Lit torches (burning sticks) {{were likely}} the {{earliest}} form of incendiary device. They {{were followed by}} incendiary arrows, which were used throughout the ancient and medieval periods. The simplest flaming arrows had oil- or resin-soaked tows tied just below the arrowhead and were effective against <b>wooden</b> <b>structures.</b> Both the Assyrians and the Judeans used fire arrows at the siege of Lachish in 701 BC. More sophisticated devices were developed by the Romans which had iron boxes and tubes which were filled with incendiary substances and attached to arrows or spears. These arrows needed to be shot from loose bows, since swift flight extinguished the flame; spears could be launched by hand or throwing machine.|$|E
5|$|Several rivers, {{including}} the Parrett, Brue and Washford, drain into the bay. Man-made drainage ditches from the Somerset Levels, {{including the}} River Huntspill, also {{run into the}} bay. The mud flats provide a habitat {{for a wide range}} of flora and fauna. These include some nationally rare plants, beetles and snails. It is particularly important for over-wintering waders and wildfowl, with approximately 190 species recorded including whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope). Fishing has taken place using shallow boats, known as flatners, and fixed <b>wooden</b> <b>structures</b> for hundreds of years. It was also the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing'. There are several small harbours along the coast.|$|E
