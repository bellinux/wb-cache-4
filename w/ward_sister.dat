40|$|This degree work {{concerns}} {{the role of}} <b>sisters</b> and <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> and their share in the nursing care quality. The theoretical {{part of the work}} is divided into three sections. Section one presents <b>sisters</b> and <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> as active members of the nursing management. Section two deals with the managements functions of the sister staff and their impact on the nursing care quality. Section three reviews the basic issues of the nursing care quality. The purpose of section one was to review the scope of activities of <b>sisters</b> and <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> with respect to the nursing care quality. The purpose of section two was to identify the key difficulties preventing <b>sisters</b> and <b>wards</b> <b>sisters</b> from increasing the nursing care quality. The purpose of section three was to analyse the working relationships between <b>sisters</b> and <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> with respect to the nursing care quality. While mapping out the situation in the selected hospital (the Faculty Hospital in Plzeň), we asked the following six research questions: 1. What are the areas where the hospital sisters may affect the nursing care quality? 2. What obstacles the sisters can see preventing them from taking part in continuous improvements in the nursing care quality? 3. How do the hospital sisters co-operate with the respective <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> concerning the nursing care quality? 4. What are the areas where the <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> may affect the nursing care quality? 5. Are there any obstacles preventing the <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> from taking part in continuous improvements in the nursing care quality? 5. How do the <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> co-operate with the respective sisters concerning the nursing care quality? The questions were asked during informal discussions with ten <b>sisters</b> and ten <b>wards</b> <b>sisters</b> at the Faculty Hospital in Plzeň. The information and data collected were processed using the framework analysis method whereby the answers to the research questions were derived. The research identified the following main problems preventing the hospital <b>sisters</b> and <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> from increasing the nursing care quality: inefficient time management on the side of <b>ward</b> <b>sisters,</b> insufficient competencies of <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> regarding staff remuneration, insufficient application of the existing nursing-care quality improvement tools by both <b>sisters</b> and <b>ward</b> <b>sisters,</b> limited engagement of the hospital <b>sisters</b> and <b>ward</b> <b>sisters</b> in creation of internal standard procedures, and reluctant attitudes of the hospital staff to changes. Based on the shortcomings identified through our research we have worked out proposals on practical improvements...|$|R
