40|$|SummaryBackground: Arrestins are pivotal, {{multifunctional}} {{organizers of}} cell responses to GPCR stimulation, including cell survival and cell death. In Drosophila norpA and rdgC mutants, endocytosis of abnormally stable complexes of rhodopsin (Rh 1) and fly photoreceptor Arrestin 2 (Arr 2) triggers cell death, implicating Rh 1 /Arr 2 -bearing endosomes in pro-cell death signaling, potentially via arrestin-mediated GPCR activation of effector kinase pathways. In order to further investigate arrestin function in photoreceptor physiology and survival, <b>we</b> studied <b>Arr</b> 2 ’s partner photoreceptor arrestin, Arr 1, {{in developing and}} adult Drosophila compound eyes. Results: <b>We</b> report that <b>Arr</b> 1, but not Arr 2, is essential for normal, light-induced rhodopsin endocytosis. Also distinct from Arr 2, Arr 1 is essential for light-independent photoreceptor survival. Photoreceptor cell death caused by loss of Arr 1 is strongly suppressed by coordinate loss of <b>Arr</b> 2. <b>We</b> further find that Rh 1 C-terminal phosphorylation is essential for light-induced endocytosis and also for translocation of Arr 1, but not Arr 2, from dark-adapted photoreceptor cytoplasm to photosensory membrane rhabdomeres. In contrast to a previous report, we do not find a requirement for photoreceptor myosin kinase NINAC in Arr 1 or Arr 2 translocation. Conclusions: The two Drosophila photoreceptor arrestins mediate distinct and essential cell pathways downstream of rhodopsin activation. <b>We</b> propose that <b>Arr</b> 1 mediates an endocytotic cell-survival activity, scavenging phosphorylated rhodopsin and thereby countering toxic Arr 2 /Rh 1 accumulation; elimination of toxic Arr 2 /Rh 1 in double mutants could thus rescue arr 1 mutant photoreceptor degeneration...|$|R

40|$|Light and {{temperature}} are potent environmental signals used to synchronize the circadian oscillator with external time and photoperiod. Phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors integrate light {{quantity and quality}} to modulate the pace and phase of the clock. PHYTOCHROME B (phyB) controls period length in red light {{as well as the}} phase of the clock in white light. phyB interacts with ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 4 (ARR 4) in a light-dependent manner. Accordingly, <b>we</b> tested <b>ARR</b> 4 {{and other members of the}} type-A ARR family for roles in clock function and show that ARR 4 and its closest relative, ARR 3, act redundantly in the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian system. Loss of ARR 3 and ARR 4 lengthens the period of the clock even in the absence of light, demonstrating that they do so independently of active phyB. In addition, in white light, arr 3, 4 mutants show a leading phase similar to phyB mutants, suggesting that circadian light input is modulated by the interaction of phyB with ARR 4. Although type-A ARRs are involved in cytokinin signaling, the circadian defects appear to be independent of cytokinin, as exogenous cytokinin affects the phase but not the period of the clock. Therefore, ARR 3 and ARR 4 are critical for proper circadian period and define an additional level of regulation of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis...|$|R
40|$|ARR 19 (androgen {{receptor}} corepressor- 19 kDa), a leucine-rich protein whose {{expression is}} down-regulated by luteinizing hormone and cAMP, is differentially expressed {{during the development}} of Leydig cells and inhibits testicular steroidogenesis by reducing the expression of steroidogenic enzymes. However, the molecular events behind the suppression of testicular steroidogenesis are unknown. In the present study, <b>we</b> demonstrate that <b>ARR</b> 19 inhibits the transactivation of orphan nuclear receptor Nur 77, {{which is one of}} the major transcription factors that regulate the expression of steroidogenic enzyme genes in Leydig cells. ARR 19 physically interacts with Nur 77 and suppresses Nur 77 -induced promoter activity of steroidogenic enzyme genes including StAR, P 450 c 17, and 3 β-HSD in Leydig cells. Transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that ARR 19 -mediated reduced expression of steroidogenic enzyme genes was likely due to the interference of SRC- 1 recruitment to Nur 77 protein on the promoter of steroidogenic enzyme genes. These findings suggest that ARR 19 acts as a novel coregulator of Nur 77, in turn regulating Nur 77 -induced testicular steroidogenesis, and may play an important role in the development and function of testicular Leydig cells...|$|R

40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana has 11 members {{belonging}} to the typical type-B ARR (authentic response regulator) family. Among them, seven highly homologous members appear also to be conserved in rice (Oryza sativa), but others are not. It was suggested that these seven ARRs are commonly implicated as DNA-binding transcription factors in the phosphorelay-mediated cytokinin signal transduction network in higher plants. To gain an insight into {{the functions of the}} cytokinin-associated type-B <b>ARRs,</b> <b>we</b> previously investigated an arr 1 arr 10 arr 12 triple mutant and reported that it exhib-ited stunted growth and abnormality in vascular development. Based on this fact, here we attempted to characterize the mutant intensively with reference to cytokinin-associated phenotypes through the life cycle. We showed that the observed cytokinin-associated phenotypes of arr 1 arr 10 arr 12 were very severe and highly analogous to those observed for certain ahk 2 ahk 3 ahk 4 /cre 1 triple mutants, which have virtually no cytokinin receptor to propagate the phosphorelay signal transduction network. Among the seven ARR members {{belonging to}} the cytokinin-associated type-B ARR subfamily, it was thus suggested that ARR 1, ARR 10 and ARR 12 together play essential (or general) roles in cytokinin signal transduction. It is therefore conceivable that the other type-B ARRs (ARR 2, ARR 11, ARR 14 and ARR 18) might play more specific roles spatially and temporally in plants...|$|R
40|$|Arrestins (arr) are {{multifunctional}} adaptor {{proteins that}} {{can act as}} scaffolds for G protein-coupled receptor activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Here, we identify the actin-binding and scaffolding protein filamin A (FLNA) as a arr-binding partner using Son of sevenless recruitment system screening, a classical yeast two-hybrid system, coimmunoprecipitation analyses, and direct binding in vitro. In FLNA, the arr-binding site involves tandem repeat 22 in the carboxyl terminus. arr binds FLNA through both its N- and C-terminal domains, indicating the presence of multiple binding sites. <b>We</b> demonstrate that <b>arr</b> and FLNA act cooperatively to activate the MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) down-stream of activated muscarinic M 1 (M 1 MR) and angiotensin II type 1 a (AT 1 AR) receptors and provide experimental evidence indicating that this phenomenon {{is due to the}} facilitation of arr-ERK 2 complex formation by FLNA. In Hep 2 cells, stimulation of M 1 MR or AT 1 AR results in the colocalization of receptor, arr, FLNA, and active ERK in membrane ruffles. Reduction of endogenous levels of arr or FLNA and a catalytically inactive dominant negative MEK 1, which prevents ERK activation, inhibit membrane ruffle formation, indicating the functional requirement for arr, FLNA, and active ERK in this process.

40|$|Cytokinins are a {{class of}} mitogenic plant hormones that play an {{important}} role in most aspects of plant development, including shoot and root growth, vascular and photomorphogenic development and leaf senescence. A model for cytokinin perception and signaling has emerged that is similar to bacterial two-component phosphorelays. In this model, binding of cytokinin to the extracellular domain of the Arabidopsis histidine kinase (AHKs) receptors induces autophosphorylation within the intracellular histidine-kinase domain. The phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to cytosolic Arabidopsis histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs), which have been suggested to translocate to the nucleus in response to cytokinin treatment, where they then transfer the phosphoryl group to nuclear-localized response regulators (Type-A and Type-B <b>ARRs).</b> <b>We</b> examined the effects of cytokinin on AHP subcellular localization in Arabidopsis and, contrary to expectations, the AHPs maintained a constant nuclear/cytosolic distribution following cytokinin treatment. Furthermore, mutation of the conserved phosphoacceptor histidine residue of the AHP, as well as disruption of multiple cytokinin signaling elements, did not affect the subcellular localization of the AHP proteins. Finally, we present data indicating that AHPs maintain a nuclear/cytosolic distribution by balancing active transport into and out of the nucleus. Our findings suggest that the current models indicating relocalization of AHP protein into the nucleus in response to cytokinin are incorrect. Rather, AHPs actively maintain a consistent nuclear/cytosolic distribution regardless of the status of the cytokinin response pathway...|$|R

Only limited data are available on functional outcome in elderly patients with BAO. Using data from the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study, we aimed to determine outcomes in patients ≥ 75  years. Primary outcome measure was poor functional outcome (modified Rankin scale score 4 - 6). Secondary outcomes were death, insufficient vessel recanalization (defined as thrombolysis in myocardial infarction score 0 - 1) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH). Patients were divided into four age-groups, based on quartiles: 18 - 54, 55 - 64, 65 - 74, and ≥ 75  years. Outcomes were compared between patients ≥ 75  years and patients aged 18 - 54  years.

We sourced data on 10 clinical events: liver, nonliver, and all-cause mortality; first hospitalisation for severe liver morbidity (SLM); cardiovascular disease (CVD); respiratory disorders; neoplasms; alcohol-intoxication; drug intoxication; and violence-related injury (note: the latter three events were selected a priori to gauge ongoing chaotic lifestyle behaviours). We determined the association between SVR attainment and each outcome event, {{in terms of the}} relative hazard reduction and absolute risk reduction (<b>ARR).</b> <b>We</b> tested for an interaction between SVR and liver disease severity (mild vs. nonmild), defining mild disease as an aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) &# 60; 0. 7. Our cohort comprised 3, 385 patients (mean age: 41. 6 years), followed-up for a median 5. 3 years (interquartile range: 3. 3 - 8. 2). SVR was associated with a reduced risk of liver mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 0. 24; P[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 001), nonliver mortality (AHR, 0. 68; P[*]=[*] 0. 026), all-cause mortality (AHR, 0. 49; P[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 001), SLM (AHR, 0. 21; P[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 001), CVD (AHR, 0. 70; P[*]=[*] 0. 001), alcohol intoxication (AHR, 0. 52; P[*]=[*] 0. 003), and violence-related injury (AHR, 0. 51; P[*]=[*] 0. 002). After 7. 5 years, SVR was associated with significant ARRs for liver mortality, all-cause mortality, SLM, and CVD (each 3. 0 %- 4. 7 %). However, we detected a strong interaction, in that ARRs were considerably higher for individuals with nonmild disease than for individuals with mild disease. Conclusions: The conclusions are 3 -fold: (1) Overall, SVR is associated with reduced hazard for a range of hepatic and nonhepatic events; (2) an association between SVR and behavioral events is consistent with SVR patients leading healthier lives; and (3) the short-term value of SVR is greatest for those with nonmild disease...|$|R

METHODS: Patients randomly assigned to receive 0. 5 mg or 1. 25 mg daily oral fingolimod in the core study continued with the same treatment in our extension; patients who originally received 30 μg weekly intramuscular interferon beta- 1 a were randomly reassigned (1 : 1) to receive either 0. 5 mg or 1. 25 mg fingolimod. The initial randomisation and dose of fingolimod assigned for the extension remained masked to the patients and investigators.

After switching to fingolimod, numbers of new or newly enlarging T 2 and gadolinium (Gd) -enhancing T 1 lesions were significantly reduced compared with the previous 12 months of interferon beta- 1 a therapy (p< 0 · 0001 for T 2 lesions at both doses; p= 0 · 002 for T 1 at 0 · 5 mg; p= 0 · 011 for T 1 at 1 · 25 mg), and the pattern of adverse events shifted towards that typical for fingolimod. Over 24 months, in continuous fingolimod groups compared with the group that switched from interferon beta- 1 a to fingolimod, <b>we</b> recorded lower <b>ARRs</b> (0 · 18 [95 % CI 0 · 14 - 0 · 22] for 0 · 5 mg; 0 · 20 [0 · 16 - 0 · 25] for 1 · 25 mg; 0 · 33 [0 · 27 - 0 · 39] for the switch group; p< 0 · 0001 for both comparisons), fewer new or newly enlarged T 2 lesions (p= 0 · 035 for 0 · 5 mg, p= 0 · 068 for 1 · 25 mg), and fewer patients with Gd-enhancing T 1 lesions (p= 0 · 001 for 0 · 5 mg fingolimod vs switch group; p= 0 · 002 for 1 · 25 mg fingolimod vs switch group). There was no benefit on disability progression. Interpretation: Switching from interferon beta- 1 a to fingolimod led to enhanced efficacy with no unexpected safety concerns. Compared with patients switched from interferon beta- 1 a to fingolimod, continuous treatment with fingolimod for 2 years provides a sustained treatment effect with improved clinical and MRI outcomes.
