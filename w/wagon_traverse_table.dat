It is clear that in order to work up my eight o'clock chronometer sight I must have my eight o'clock latitude. Of course, if the Snark were sailing due west at six knots per hour, for the intervening four hours her latitude would not change. But if she were sailing due south, her latitude would change to the tune of twenty-four miles.

The Schenck family dates back to 1709 when they first arrived in America in an effort to escape religious persecution for being Protestant, specifically Mennonite. Just over a hundred years later they would find themselves in two covered <b>wagons,</b> <b>traversing</b> the Allegheny Mountains, and settling at the border between the City of Buffalo and Town of Amherst. Here they practiced the same farming techniques they had in Pennsylvania and earlier in Germany. These techniques by today’s standards could be termed “environmentally friendly", and Polyculture due to their use of crop rotation, production of multiple food products on a family farm, and the use of cow manure. The Schencks like other German settlers practiced the keeping and feeding of multiple types of animals; housing them in a barn through winter. This practice was considered unusual by farmers of British heritage. While the German idea of feeding and housing animals through winter was adopted by non-German farmers in the 19th century, the keeping of a variety of animals was not. Many 19th century farmers began to develop specialized farms, unofficially becoming a [...] "pig farmer" [...] or [...] "cattle rancher".

At intermediate torque values, when the force is high, the width of the coating is high, and its thickness is thin; and when the force is low, the width and thickness are low. The interaction effect between axial force (F) – <b>table</b> <b>traverse</b> speed (Vx) and spindle speed (N) – <b>table</b> <b>traverse</b> speed (Vx) produced an increasing effect on coating width and thickness, but other interactions exhibited decreasing influence.

40|$|A {{feedback}} position-control {{system has}} been developed for maintaining the concentricity of a turbofan {{with respect to a}} nacelle during acoustic and flow tests in a wind tunnel. The system is needed for the following reasons: Thermal and thrust loads can displace the fan relative to the nacelle; In the particular test apparatus (see Figure 1), denoted as a rotor-only nacelle (RAN), the struts, vanes, and other stator components of a turbofan engine that ordinarily maintain the required concentricity in the face of thermal and thrust loads are not present; and The struts and stator components are not present because it is necessary to provide a flow path that is acoustically clean {{in the sense that the}} measured noise can be attributed to the fan alone. The system is depicted schematically in Figure 2. The nacelle is supported by two struts attached to a two-axis <b>traverse</b> <b>table</b> located outside the wind-tunnel wall. Two servomotors acting through 100 : 1 gearboxes drive the table along the Y and Z axes, which are perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The Y and Z components of the deviation from concentricity are measured by four laser displacement sensors mounted on the nacelle and aimed at reflective targets on the center body, which is part of the fan assembly. The outputs of the laser displacement sensors are digitized and processed through a personal computer programmed with control software. The control output of the computer commands the servomotors to move the table as needed to restore concentricity. Numerous software and hardware travel limits and alarms are provided to maximize safety. A highly ablative rub strip in the nacelle minimizes the probability of damage in the event that a deviation from concentricity exceeds the radial clearance [< 0. 004 in. (< 0. 1 mm) ] between the inner surface of the nacelle and the tips of the fan blades. To be able to prevent an excursion in excess of the tip clearance, the system must be accurate enough to control X and Y displacements to within 0. 001 in. (. 0. 025 mm). One characteristic essential to such accuracy is sufficient rigidity in the mechanical components of the system to prevent excitation of vibrations in the strut/ nacelle subsystem. The need for such a high degree of accuracy prompted a comprehensive analysis of sources of measurement and control errors, followed by rigorous design efforts to minimize these errors. As a result, the design of the system incorporates numerous improvements in hardware, software, and operational procedures...|$|R

When porting existing algorithms from sequential or other parallel architecture models to shared memory many-core architectures, non-trivial modifications are often {{needed in order}} to match the execution patterns of the target algorithms with the characteristics of many-core architectures. 3 D curve traversal is a fundamental process in many applications, and is commonly accelerated by spatial decomposition schemes captured in hierarchical data structures (e. g., kd-trees). However, curve traversal using hierarchical data structures needs to conduct repeated hierarchical searches. Such search process is time-consuming on shared memory many-core architectures since it incurs considerable amounts of expensive memory accesses and execution divergence. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial decomposition based data structure, called Shell, which completely avoids hierarchical search for 3 D curve traversal. In Shell, a structure is built on the boundary of each region in the decomposed space, which allows any curve traversing in a region to find the next neighboring region to <b>traverse</b> using <b>table</b> lookup schemes, without any hierarchical search. While our 3 D curve traversal approach works for other spatial decomposition paradigms and many-core processors, we illustrate it using kd-tree decomposition on GPU and compare with the fastest known kd-tree searching algorithms for ray traversal. Analysis and experimental results show that our approach improves ray traversal performance considerably over the kd-tree searching approaches...|$|R

40|$|Extracting {{valuable}} {{information from the}} rapidly growing field of Big Data faces serious performance constraints, especially in the software-based database management systems (DBMS). In a query processing system, hash-based computational primitives such as the hash join and the group-by are the most time-consuming operations, as they frequently need to access the hash table on the high-latency off-chip memories and also to <b>traverse</b> whole the <b>table.</b> Subsequently, the hash collision is an inherent issue related to the hash tables, which can adversely degrade the overall performance. In order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we present a novel pure hardware-based hash engine, implemented on the FPGA. In order to mitigate the high memory access latencies and also to faster resolve the hash collisions, we follow a novel design point. It is based on caching the hash table entries in the fast on-chip Block-RAMs of FPGA. Faster accesses to the correspondent hash table entries from the cache can lead to an improved overall performance. We evaluate the proposed approach by running hash-based table join and group-by operations of 5 TPC-H benchmark queries. The results show 2. 9 ×– 4. 4 × speedups over the cache-less FPGA-based baseline.

40|$|A {{triangulated}} surface S with V vertices {{is sometimes}} stored as {{a list of}} T independent triangles, each described by the 3 floating-point coordinates of its vertices. This representation requires about 576 V bits and provides no explicit information regarding the adjacency between neighboring triangles or vertices. A variety of boundary-graph data structures may be derived from such a representation {{in order to make}} explicit the various adjacency and incidence relations between triangles, edges, and vertices. These relations are stored to accelerate algorithms that visit the surface in a systematic manner and access the neighbors of each vertex or triangle. Instead of these complex data structures, we advocate a simple Corner Table, which explicitly represents the triangle/vertex incidence and the triangle/triangle adjacency of any manifold or pseudo-mainfold triangle mesh, as two tables of integers. The Corner Table requires about 12 VlogxV bits and must be accompanied by a vertex table, which requires 96 V bits, of Floats are used. The Corner Table may be derived from the list of independent triangles. For meshes homeomorphic to a sphere, it may be compressed to less than 4 V bits by storing the "clers" sequence of triangle-labels from the set {C,L,E,$,S}. Further compression to 3. 6 V bits may be guaranteed by using context-based codes for the clers symbols. Entropy codes reduce the storage for large meshes to less than 2 V bits. Meshes with more complex topologies may require O(log 2 V) additional bits per handle of hole. We present here a publicly available, simple, state-machine implementation of the Edgebreaker compression, which <b>traverses</b> the corner <b>table,</b> computes the CLERS symbols, and constructs an ordered list of vertex references. Vertices are encoded, in the order in which they appear on the list, as corrective displacements between their predicted and actual locations.
