40|$|Voice {{imitation}} can {{be effective}} in different ways, both consciously and unconsciously, in situations such as language acquisition and for entertainment.

A professional impersonator, who reproduces another speaker’s voice and speech behaviour, has to be aware of how to change the vocal tract and get close to the voice of the target speaker. For an impersonator the aim of voice imitation is to entertain or cheat. He probably has to exaggerate some of the features of the target speaker’s speech behaviour, like a caricature, for it to be entertaining. One hypothesis is that if he is close to the target speaker in some critical features, he may yet fail with other less important features in his imitation and the audience will still have the impression of a successful voice imitation (Zetterholm 1997) ...|$|E

The third issue is how to modify the inkjet printer especially the feeding system in order to implement printing on other materials rather than paper. We obtain inspiration that building a synthetic polarization system that include positive feedback and mutual inhibition can generate artificial PIP 3 and CDC 42 poles in living cells. We program the proper genetic circuit inside yeast that leading polarization in specific spatial position. After building the exogenous polarization network, we found we cannot solve the upward/downward overlap of yeast cells for any ways that difficult to form single layer. The attempt solution of protecting cells is adding certain amount of sugars and salts into medium; as a result viscosity of medium, heat conductivity will decrease meanwhile the medium would not be toxic to yeast cells. The experimental results demonstrate glucose tends to decrease the surface tension of cells that help distribute cells monolayer in the physical way. Result shows yeast cells are growing well in the pattern that being set before printing, meanwhile, they are distributed in monolayer at a high possibility just as expected, the validity supports polarization could be a feasible way in 3 D tissue printing...|$|E

ELEMENTS THAT MAINTAIN OUR SPECIFIC ATMOSPHERE Before treating a Global Warming causes and consequences, let’s sum up how work our unique atmosphere (fig 1), which has created and maintain life. A. Solar Input When the sun energy travels to Earth, 40 % of the sun’s energy is reflected back into space after hitting Earth’s upper atmosphere, and 60 % gets through, supplying Earth’s weather engine. Fig. 1. How solar energy is reflected by Earth 1 all quoted text will be in italic font B. Oceans Oceans are the key source of moisture in the air and they store heat efficiently. The oceans and marine life also consume huge amounts of carbon dioxide. Fig. 2. great ocean conveyor belt Thermohaline circulation system(THC) : There are three main processes that make the oceans circulate: tidal forces, wind stress, and density differences. The density of sea wa-ter is controlled by its temperature (θρµo) and its salinity (ὰλινoς),. The circulation is created by density differences. The Figure 2 shows you the great ocean conveyor belt. And this is how it works [1]: In the North Atlantic it transports warm and salty water to the North. There the water is cooled and sinks into the deep ocean. This newly formed deep water is exported to south. This slow (' 0. 1 m/s), but giant circulation has a flow equal to about 100 Amazon Rivers. Together with the Gulfstream it contributes (2 / 3 and 1 / 3) to the comparatively warm sea surface temperature along the coast of western Europe and to the relative mild European winters. [2...|$|E

We actually never talk about form in the office. We for instance talk about context, or construction or we talk about sites, all the influences which come from the outside {{and we talk about}} materials. And sometimes we talk about sustainability. Avalon is a composition of light and darkness, of watching and being watched, of sound and silence, of old and young, rich and poor. A metabolism. We want to show how we try to come to obvious architecture. I'm going to do it by labelling our process and the process has three components. human context, physical context and then third, only when we have established all these preoccupations, we come to creating architecture. the so called form. But it is not really a form. It is a result. In analogy with Tissergat in Morrocco, the presence of private and public areas was very important and the guiding principle. But their where other goals we set ourselves in creating this project. Most importantly a social mix. A generation mix. We implemented this social mix by arranging a lot of different units, in both size and cost. Form 70 m 2 to 320 m 2, from 175. 000, 00 € to one million two hundred thousand €. It actually worked, we have a social mix in Avalon. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out if it really works. It’s a learning process, both for us and for the residents. This housing block had a very wide footprint of 33 meter, which means that there are always (less valued) north faced apartments and (more valued) south faced ones. We asked ourselves how to resolve this issue, and get direct sunlight in the north faced apartments. We did some extensive researching on the site based on the azimut of the sun. This led to recesses and cut-outs defined by this study. We made a lot of study models to test the results in three dimensions. To come to this final plan. Sunlight enters {{into the heart of the}} building. This ensures thermal gains while the openings and the generous terraces also allow light and sun in the flats. A lot of voids strengthen the light coming into the heart of the building even more. These holes and voids soften the monolithic and massive character of the building and provide a better connection with the smaller scale of the surroundings. It was also funny that the city hall supported this idea of open spaces in the building. They let us extract the voids from the B/T with the surface of the open spaces from B/T 1, 6 to B/T 2, 4 so we could build bigger what made the supervisor happy. status: publishe...|$|E

Further, she had a painful experience at the shopping mall when she used a hand drier after washing her hands. The blower directly heated up the ex-fix and caused intense temporary pain. Similarly, cold weather in the winter was uncomfortable as the metal in the ex-fix “froze.” Wearing a muff over her hand and hardware was helpful.
