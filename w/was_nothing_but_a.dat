5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children {{had a crush on}} Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the school}} {{concerned}} with ideological differences, another theory seeks clarification in externalization of the Spanish case; instead of pointing to unique Spanish character of Carlism, it highlights general European patterns of change. With ultramontanism gaining upper hand over more conciliatory political incarnations of Catholicism after the First Vatican Council, {{and with the}} new approach made popular in the neighboring France by Louis Veuillot, the 1888 schism <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> local Spanish manifestation of the trend. Defining the nascent Integrism as religious particularism striving for hegemony, this theory enjoys rather limited popularity.|$|E

Two years later, he told colleagues {{that if he could}} get the patent for $25million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted {{to sell the}} patent. Bell's investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.|$|E

25|$|In {{this short}} story, {{a man named}} Gunnar was {{suspected}} of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess. He helped her drive Freyr's wagon with the god effigy in it, but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar {{if he had not}} promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway. When Gunnar had promised this, a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. After a while he made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of Olaf Tryggvason.|$|E
25|$|In late 2008, Chessman {{made a move}} to {{seemingly}} unite {{with his}} former stable the Black Family, but double-crossed them instead. Chessman turned to the Psycho Circus and together they won the National Atómicos Titles from the Black Family. Chessman's third run with the Atómicos titles ended after just 16 days when AAA Commissioner Vampiro stripped Chessman and the Psycho Circus of the titles after they had attacked him the previous night. The feud with the Black Family continued into 2009 until Chessman segued into a feud with the new AAA World Champion El Mesias. The Feud with El Mesias started during a television taping where Chessman and El Mesias faced off in a match, the match got so out of hand that Chessman ended up being thrown {{over the side of}} the balcony and through a stack of tables. The show went to commercial with Chessman looking seriously injured as he received medical treatment. The following week another singles match between the two was scheduled but Chessman came out on crutches wearing a neck brace. Just as El Mesias thought Chessman was going to announce that he was too injured to wrestle Chessman attacked him with a crutch revealing that the injury <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> ruse to give Chessman an advantage. At Rey de Reyes (2009) Chessman challenged El Mesias for the AAA Mega title inside a Steel Cage but lost.|$|E

500|$|Joining the Maple Leafs for the 1929–30 season, 18-year-old Jackson was the {{youngest}} player in the National Hockey League (NHL). In his league debut, against the Montreal Canadiens, Jackson knocked over his idol Howie Morenz with a bodycheck. [...] Assessing the youngster's potential following the hit, Morenz offered, [...] "you'll do". Jackson appeared in 31 games for the Maple Leafs, scoring 12 goals and adding 6 assists. He missed some time due to injury, during which he earned his nickname from the team's trainer, Tim Daly. According to Jackson: [...] "Daly asked me to carry sticks for him. [...] I told him I wasn't a stick boy, I was a hockey player. So he said I <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> fresh busher [...] and the name stuck." ...|$|E
500|$|The Chinese {{philosophy}} of Confucius (551–479 BC) and the hierarchical social order his disciples adhered to had become embedded into mainstream Chinese culture since {{the reign of}} Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC). During the Song dynasty, the entire Chinese society was theoretically modelled upon this familial social order of superiors and inferiors. Confucian dogma dictated what was proper moral behavior, and how a superior should regulate rewards or punishments when dealing with an inferior member of society or one's family. This is exemplified in the Tang law code, which was largely retained in the Song period. Gernet writes: [...] "The family relationships supposed {{to exist in the}} ideal family were the foundation of the entire moral outlook, and even the law, in its total structure and its scale of penalties, <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> codified expression of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4.8/5 {{and said that}} he did not think the episode could have been {{executed}} better. Wolfe emphasized Ziva's back story with her father and speculated that many of her choices were based upon events that her family experienced, including her father's repeated absences and the breakup of her parents' marriage due to Eli's indiscretions with a young Orli Elbaz, which also explained Ziva's resentment of Elbaz. [...] Wolfe was touched by Ziva's dance with Tony, and her flashback to dancing with her father as a child while he tells her, [...] "My Ziva. One day you will dance with a man who deserves your love". In a TV Fanatic round table, Steve Marsi added, [...] "What an emotionally loaded quote from the Eli flashback, followed by the much-anticipated present-day dance." [...] He {{went on to say that}} Sirtis did well as the new Mossad director and that [...] "Counselor Deanna Troi <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> faint memory". Michelle Calbert from TV Equals praised the storyline and agreed that Marina Sirtis performed well in the role, saying that she found Orli to be a more likeable character than Eli David.|$|E
