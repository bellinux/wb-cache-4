40|$|The area of automata {{learning}} was pioneered by Angluin in the 802 ̆ 7 s. Her original algorithm, which applied to regular languages and deterministic automata, {{has been extended}} to various types of automata and used in software and hardware verification. In this talk, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> abstract perspective at automata learning. We show how the correctness of the original algorithm and many extensions can be captured in one proof using coalgebraic techniques. We also show that a novel algorithm for nominal automata {{can be derived from}} the abstract framework...|$|R

40|$|Both Java and C # are object {{oriented}} languages that have evolved from C++. Some even claim that C # is an evolution of Java. From a quick glance, the languages {{are very similar}} and essentially accomplish the same things. The point of our research {{is to focus on}} the nuances of the languages from an architectural perspective. Despite the marketing war between Java and Microsoft, or more generally, open source vs. big brother, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> objective view of the two languages to identify circumstances where one language might be ideal to the other...|$|R
40|$|Linear {{programming}} {{allows for}} the optimization of linear functions with several variables. Linear optimization proves to be useful in a linear setting. Unfortunately, we {{do not live in}} a linear world. In order to accurately represent certain applications, nonlinear objective functions and constraints may need to be introduced. As in linear programming, there are many methods to solve non-linear and quadratic programming problems. These programming problems and the solution methods allow for non-linear mathematical relationships to be studied in various fields. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> in depth look at non-linear programming and applications to both finance and medicine...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>we</b> <b>will</b> {{describe}} an open architecture for detecting earthquakes using the built in accelerometers available in some mobile phones. Although {{the idea of}} building a network of accelerometers for this application is not new, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> iterative approach starting with a prototype which exhibits some core functionality. Key questions include: what level of sophistication is required to be confident of the architecture and how does this conflict with {{the limitations of the}} mobile device and the network used? By examining these questions and evaluating results from our prototype we hope to build further iterations which increase the chances of generating an accurate alert...|$|R

40|$|Programming {{security}} vulnerabilities are {{the most}} common cause of software security breaches in current day computing. While these can easily be avoided by an attentive programmer, many programs still contain these kinds of vulnerabilities. This document will describe what the most commonly occuring ones are and will then explain how these can be abused to make a program do something it did not intend to do. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> then <b>take</b> <b>a</b> look at how a recent vulnerability in popular piece of software was exploited to allow <b>an</b> attacker to <b>take</b> control of the execution flow of that program. Several solutions exist to detect and prevent many, though not all, of the vulnerabilities described in this document in existing programs without requiring source code modifications, and in some cases without even requiring access to the source code to the applications. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> indepth look at how these solutions are implemented and what their effects are on legitimate programs, how they attempt to mitigate the restrictions they impose and what their impact is on the performance of the programs they attempt to protect. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> also describe if and how these solutions can be bypassed...|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of technology for collaborative learning has been developed, but only a fraction has been successfully integrated into local practices. Most technologies fail in being integrated not because of bad design or lack of functionality, but {{due to lack of}} awareness of the established practice where {{they are supposed to be}} integrated. Considering the introduction of new tools and practices as development of existing infrastructure will increase the chance of a successful entry that can change things to the better. In this paper <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> infrastructural perspective on the analysis of a project field trial where several tools were combined in order to constitute a digital environment for distributed collaborative learning. 1...|$|R
