During <b>willowing</b> the fibres are loosened; in lapping the dust is removed to create a flat sheet or lap of fibres. Carding combs the tangled lap into a thick rope or sliver of 1/2 inch in diameter, and removes the shorter fibres creating a stronger yarn.|$|E

50|$|A willy or twilly is {{a machine}} {{used in the}} textile industry, {{comprising}} a hollow cone or cylinder with internal spikes which revolves, opening and cleaning wool, cotton, or flax. Terms used have included wool-mill, willow (especially for cotton), willey, twilley, and devil. The process has been called <b>willowing,</b> willying, or woolleying.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the cotton {{industry}} the raw material was manually beaten with sticks after being placed on a mesh, a process known as <b>willowing</b> or batting, until the task was mechanised by the development of machines known as willowers. Scutching machines were introduced in the early 19th-century, and processed the raw material into a continuous sheet of cotton wadding known as a lap.|$|E
50|$|Before cotton is {{processed}} {{it has to}} be cleaned of its seeds and other impurities, which in the early days was done by spreading the raw cotton on a mesh and beating it with sticks, a process known as <b>willowing</b> or batting. A scutching machine for cotton, known as a scutcher, was invented in 1797, but did not get much attention until it was introduced in Manchester cotton mills in 1808 or 1809. By 1816 scutchers had been generally adopted.|$|E

50|$|Raw wool {{would be}} weighed and sorted {{according}} {{to a variety of}} classifications, and sent on for opening, <b>willowing</b> and pickering. Wool fibers would be spread into smooth open layers, cut into slices and cleared of large pieces of vegetativematter. It would be sent for cleaning, or scouring in large vats containing a solution of water, soap and carbonate of potash, and then dried. Scouring did not remove all vegetative particles. In a carbonizing process the wool passed through bowls or troughs containing a solution of sulfuric acid or aluminum chloride where the remaining burrs were burnt off.|$|E

Logistic regression models were built to describe probabilities of occurrence for five out of the seven <b>willow</b> species based on the habitat data collected. Multi-response permutation procedures were performed to describe differences between respective <b>willow</b> habitats.
