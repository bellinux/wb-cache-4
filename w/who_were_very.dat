5|$|After the war, the British Admiralty and the US Navy {{analysed}} {{the captured}} {{records of the}} Japanese navy to account {{for all of its}} vessels. Their reports do not list any Japanese submarine losses off the coast of the contiguous United States during the whole of the war. According to military records, the I-76 was destroyed off Buka Island in the western Pacific by USS Franks, USS Haggard and USS Johnston on 16 May 1944. Hubbard's crew however, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> loyal to him, shared his conviction that they had engaged an enemy submarine. His second-in-command, Thomas Moulton, later asserted that the Navy had hushed up the incident, fearing that the presence of Japanese submarines so close to the Pacific coast might cause panic.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the social}} {{programs}} involved during the event were {{the opening ceremonies}} at the Tipsport arena. Included were musical performances from the English rock band Deep Purple, who performed at the opening ceremony 18 February, and the Slovak band Elán, who performed on 20 February. Concerts {{took place on the}} Liberec main square where medal award ceremonies occurred. In addition, there were special themed days, including Italian Day, Czech Day, Norwegian Day and Slovak Day. One recurring theme of this was free beer for people from these countries in some pubs at happy hour.

25|$|The {{mission to}} Argentina {{was the second}} foreign field tended by German Congregationalists.

25|$|The dynastic female heiress {{reckoned}} most eligible {{according to}} the original law of primogeniture of Frederick III was Caroline of Denmark (1793–1881), the childless eldest daughter of the late king Frederick VI. Along with another childless daughter, Wilhelmine of Denmark (1808–1891), Duchess of Glücksburg; the next heir was Louise, sister of Frederick VI, who had married the Duke of Augustenburg. The chief heir to that line was the selfsame Frederick of Augustenburg, but his turn would have come only {{after the death of}} two childless princesses <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> much alive in 1863.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the appalling}} {{conditions}} at Theater an der Wien, the opera company leadership {{tried to raise}} significant quantities of money to speed up reconstruction of the original opera house. Many private donations were made, as well as donations of building material from the Soviets, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> interested in the rebuilding of the opera. The mayor of Vienna had receptables placed in many sites around Vienna for people to donate coins only.

25|$|Children {{who were}} born before the family immigrated to the United States may have more {{difficulty}} succeeding academically than children {{who were born}} after the move to the United States, or <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> young {{at the time of}} immigration. This is likely due to the fact children who were born in the United States, or immigrated at a very early age, {{are more likely to be}} assimilated into American culture and to possess greater levels of English language ability than children who were born before the family immigrated. Other research confirms the fact that second generation groups tend to have higher levels of academic achievement than first generation groups.|$|E

25|$|The medieval {{period of}} the history of the Tamil country saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms, some of whom went on to the extent of empires, exerting {{influences}} both in India and overseas. The Cholas <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> active during the Sangam age were entirely absent during the first few centuries. The period started with the rivalry between the Pandyas and the Pallavas, which in turn caused the revival of the Cholas. The Cholas went on to becoming a great power. Their decline saw the brief resurgence of the Pandyas. This period was also that of the re-invigorated Hinduism during which temple building and religious literature were at their best.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of Bai Bureh's {{war against the}} British {{is not a matter}} of whether he won or lost the war but that a man who had none of what could be called formal military training was able to show that for a significant number of months he was able to take on the British <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> proud of their great military successes across the globe. The British troops were led by officers trained at the finest military academies where war is studied in the same way that one studies a subject at university. The fact that Bai Bureh was not executed after his capture has led some historians to claim that this was in admiration for his prowess as an adversary to the British.|$|E
25|$|Engine 819 {{traveled}} {{more than}} 804,000 miles during its 10½ years of service, before being forced aside {{by the more}} modern diesel locomotives. On July 19, 1955 Cotton Belt's President H. J. McKenzie presented retired Engine 819 to the City of Pine Bluff to show the Cotton Belt's gratitude for the part the city had played in their steam locomotive operations. McKenzie commented that this model engine is generally conceded {{to be one of}} the best designed and most attractive of its type ever built. He recalled how the engine had been built by local craftsmen, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> proud of them and he hoped that the people of Pine Bluff would be equally proud to display it in their public park.|$|E

25|$|From Sydney to Canberra much of {{the route}} {{was similar to that}} of the Hume Highway. From the {{national}} capital it proceeded south – paralleling the coast, generally about 70kilometres inland – via Cooma and Bombala to Orbost; then west to Melbourne, very close to the coast. This route was chosen because it would provide better access for people in the coastal south-east of New South Wales and eastern Victoria, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> poorly served by transport links. Further, it would encourage decentralisation more than a wholly inland route would, because about 80 per cent of Australians choose to live within 50 kilometres of the coast. Despite VFT curves being 20 times broader than on the existing Sydney–Melbourne railway, the proposed route was able to go around mountains rather than going through them. The direction of valleys was favourable for the most part, minimising the cost of tunnelling and substantial earthworks.|$|E
25|$|Having conquered Drangiana, Arachosia, Gedrosia and Seistan in ten days, Alexander the Great (locally {{known as}} 'Iskander') crossed the Hindu Kush and was thus fully {{informed}} of the magnificence {{of the country and}} its riches in gold, gems and pearls. However, Alexander had to encounter and reduce the tribes on the border of Punjab before entering the luxuriant plains. Having taken a northeasterly direction, he marched against the Aspii (mountaineers), who offered vigorous resistance, but were subdued. Alexander then marched through Ghazni, blockaded Magassa, and then marched to Ora and Bazira. Turning to the northeast, Alexander marched to Pucela, the capital of the district now known as Pakhli. He entered Western Punjab, where the ancient city of Nysa (at the site of modern-day Mong) was situated. A coalition was formed against Alexander by the Cathians, the people of Multan, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> skilful in war. Alexander invested many troops, eventually killing seventeen thousand Cathians in this battle, and the city of Sagala (present-day Sialkot) was razed to the ground. Alexander left Punjab in 326 B.C. and took his army to the heartlands of his empire.|$|E
25|$|Omar {{was born}} in Riyadh, growing up there in a working-class environment, to a family of Hadhrami descent from the Hadhramaut Governorate. His father Abdulrahman Ahmed was a former player, he the {{youngest}} of two sisters and three older brothers, Ahmad, Khaled and Mohammed. He began playing football {{at a very young}} age and was playing most of his time in Riyadh neighborhoods. He drew attention from scout Abdulrahman Eissa, who saw him by chance at Al Malaz yard near Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium and admired his talent and asked about the club that he played for. The answer was that he was not playing for any club and also did not hold Saudi nationality. After Abdulrahman Eissa began to contact him and his brother, he then began participating in tournaments and courses alongside Yahya Al-Shehri. In 2000, he went on a trial with Al Hilal <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> interested in signing him. However, as full Saudi nationality was only offered to him and not his entire family, his father rejected the offer. Then a call came to Abdulrahman Eissa's friend Ahmed Al Garoon from Honorary member of Al Ain, Nasser bin Thaloub who was searching for young talented players. Abdulrahman Eissa told him about Omar's talent and his brothers Mohammed and Khalid. He asked for their passports and they joined the external Al Ain camp in Germany. Al Ain agreed to grant citizenship to his whole family who then moved to the United Arab Emirates. Omar joined the club with two of his brothers and enrolled in the club's youth academy.|$|E
