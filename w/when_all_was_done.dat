[...] They taught them that these six mountains were their principal mountains. [...] From the lower mesa lands they could see them. [...] Chants were made for them. Finally, a smoke was prepared for {{the mountains and the}} chants were sung.|$|E

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> {{when the}} coffers had been hoisted aboard the Flora Macdonald, Merton, {{for the first}} time, hailed the yacht.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>were</b> <b>done,</b> the major-domo of the Prince of Helium {{recalled}} to {{the block}} such as had favourably impressed him. For such {{he had made}} a fair offer.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Why, no,' said he, 'not so much. They are a {{very small}} affair, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done.</b> I can fancy people caring for them greatly, but not <b>doing</b> as you <b>are</b> just now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned to}} him <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> [...] And gave him her thin hand, Exclaiming like an enraptured one, [...] "This time it will be grand!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> I {{hurried to}} the palace to tell Otomie what had come to pass, and found her in our {{sleeping}} chamber lying on her bed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I loved him,' {{cried the}} old man, sinking {{down upon the}} grave <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b> 'He was very good to me. Oh, my dear old friend and master!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lie down, lie down," [...] True Thomas said. [...] "The God shall judge <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done.</b> [...] But I {{will bring}} you a better word [...] And lift the cloud that I laid on." ...|$|R
60|$|Wild. Were I as thou art, I would content {{myself with}} having but one fair flight at her, without wearying {{myself on the}} wing for a retrieve; for, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> the quarry <b>is</b> but a woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not; {{but time}} will show. After all, a good degree is not {{everything}} in the world. Who in London cares about senior wranglers and double-firsts? <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> I don't see the use of it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> Jason and Medea {{rose from}} their knees, {{and sat down}} on chairs in the hall, and Medea told Circe all her tale, except the slaying of Absyrtus.|$|E
6000|$|The {{wound was}} sewn {{up and then}} bandaged, as was that on the arm. The other and slighter wounds were simply drawn {{together}} by slips of plaster. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> Reuben said to Mr. Hudson: ...|$|E
6000|$|One September day he went slowly home, and, seeing Christie in the garden, joined her, {{helped her}} finish matting up some {{delicate}} shrubs, put by the tools, and <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> said with unusual gentleness: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take a dozen men, Shandy, {{and search}} yon hellhole. Bring out to me, alive, Peter of Colfax, and My Lady's cloak and a palfrey--and Shandy, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> as I say, you may apply the torch! But no looting, Shandy." ...|$|R
60|$|And yet, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> {{that very}} building, and the {{incredible}} height it was carried, is {{a demonstration of}} the vast knowledge of that infant age of the world, who had no advantage of the experiments or invention of any before themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Mr. Somers; [...] "and what we {{have now}} to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to see how we may best enable these workers to live on their wages, and how those others are to live, who, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> will get no wages." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{look just}} like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress," [...] cried Amy, {{surveying}} her with delight <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> and the {{servants}} departed, {{the young man}} deliberately locked the door, and putting the key in his pocket, faced about, and folding his arms on his bosom, looked Mr. Wilson full in the face.|$|E
60|$|And <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> {{and she was}} {{transformed}} into a little russet-robed, white-capped being, nothing would serve her, but to collect all the brightest cranesbill flowers she could find, and stick them in her own bodice and Rusha's.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{count them}} not a fly," [...] cried Hordle John; [...] "for {{who is the}} better for all their {{whipping}} and yowling? They are like other friars, I trow, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done.</b> Let them leave their backs alone, and beat the pride out of their hearts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is a disgrace,' the squire cried hotly. 'A {{shame and}} a disgrace. We must needs {{fight for the}} King and risk our skins, and then <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> down come a drove of lacqueys in waiting, and snap up the {{pickings}} before their betters are served.' ...|$|R
60|$|Nay, {{the very}} judges {{themselves}} (no reflection upon their learning) {{have been very}} much at a loss in giving instructions to a jury, and juries much more to understand them; for, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> juries, which <b>are</b> not always, nor often indeed, of the wisest men, are, to be sure, in umpires in causes so nice that the very lawyer and judge can hardly understand them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Listen again! I {{know that}} Attar Singh and Rutton Singh omitted no {{ceremony}} of the purifications, and <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> Baynes Sahib's revolver was thrown {{down from the}} housetop, together with three rupees twelve annas; and order was given for its return by post.' ...|$|E
60|$|And then, as we {{rode out}} into the open country, my {{thoughts}} were turned to tenderer matters, and it came to me that <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> that cry of Bianca's made it worth while to have been seized by the talons of the Holy Office.|$|E
60|$|The time {{occupied}} by these several proceedings {{was not much}} less than two hours. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> and she had smoothed his extemporized bed, and placed everything within his reach that she could think of, she took her leave of him, and locked him in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of my people--who {{lie under}} the leaf-roofs {{of the village}} yonder--of the young girls, and {{the young men who}} sing to them," [...] said Krishna. [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> what profit? To-morrow sees them at work. Ay, if ye swept the bridge out from end to end they would begin anew. Hear me!

50|$|Time passes. On a boat {{heading to}} Cuba, yet another foolhardy act by Jerry while inebriated {{leads to a}} head injury for his own father. Steven is summoned to come aboard and treat a dying patient. He does so with reluctance, urged by Paula to honor his Hippocratic oath. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> Jerry's guilty {{conscience}} finally persuades him to admit to all that has transpired previously. Steven's reputation is restored and Paula {{is in love with}} him.|$|R
60|$|I {{had burst}} open {{the ends of}} my fingers at the very first, and during the reefing I had worked with tears of pain running down my cheeks. And <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> I gave up like a woman and rolled upon the deck in the agony of exhaustion.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> Mrs. Ralston said, [...] "Now, I'm {{going to}} spread that {{tablecloth}} carelessly over the table. We {{will be going}} before daylight, probably, and in the hurry of getting off I hope that Mr. and Mrs. Joseph will not notice the difference till we're gone." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} was the first time that ever I was angry with Amy in all my life; and <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> though she was a devilish jade in having such a thought, yet it was all of it the effect of her excess of affection and {{fidelity}} to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well; it is a {{very pretty}} riddle. But I do not envy her who has its answering, for it might well trouble a maid's mind, neither <b>is</b> it certain <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> that she will guess best for her own peace. Would it not be wiser, then, that I should forbid them to ask this riddle?" [...] he added as though to himself and fell to {{thinking}} while they trembled, seeing that he was minded to refuse their suit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of my people--who {{lie under}} the leaf-roofs {{of the village}} yonder--of the young girls, and {{the young men who}} sing to them in the dark of the child that will be born next morn--of that which was begotten tonight," [...] said Krishna.

Bhairon is drunk always. Hanuman mocks his people with new riddles." ...|$|R
60|$|These letters {{occupied}} me for hours. That to Lucy, in particular, {{was very}} long, {{and it was}} not written wholly without care. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>were</b> <b>done,</b> and sealed, and enveloped to the address of the post-master, I went on deck. The pilot and Marble had not been idle while I had been below, for I found the ship just weathering the south-west Spit, a position that enabled me to make a fair wind of it past the Hook and out to sea.|$|R
