5|$|One type of inter-cellular {{communication}} by {{a molecular}} signal is called quorum sensing, which serves {{the purpose of}} determining <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Hemlock Hoax {{was based on}} a minor character from a film story that had been rejected. The finished film was released in April as a split reel, being presented with two other Lubin comedies. The black-and-white short received positive reviews with several journalists praising the film's humor. It is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a surviving print of the film, and the identities of the film's cast and crew are not recorded.|$|E

5|$|Today, the {{majority}} of all subway delays are caused by signal problems.

5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species was larger than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form {{has been reported in}} the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of melanism and leucism—or <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> indeed more than one species of living fossa.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Stephen E. Loeb {{proposed}} that accounting ethics education should include seven goals (adapted {{from a list}} by Daniel Callahan). To implement these goals, {{he pointed out that}} accounting ethics could be taught throughout accounting curriculum or in an individual class tailored to the subject. Requiring it be taught throughout the curriculum would necessitate all accounting teachers to have knowledge on the subject (which may require training). A single course has issues as to where to include the course in a student's education (for example, before preliminary accounting classes or near the end of a student's degree requirements), <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> enough material to cover in a semester class, and whether most universities have room in a four-year curriculum for a single class on the subject.|$|E

5|$|The Australian swellshark is oviparous. Males have larger teeth than females, {{with which}} to bite and hold onto them for copulation. <b>Whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{specific}} mating season is uncertain, though in terms of sperm production males are capable of breeding year-round. Females have a single functional ovary and two oviducts, ovulating a single egg into each at a time. They can store sperm for at least 15 months. Females produce eggs throughout the year, laying them in pairs approximately once every 20 days from January to June, and once every 30 days {{the rest of the}} year. The second egg in a pair is deposited 1224 hours after the first.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any real basis to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational nexus test is used, which requires a court to consider <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a reasonable nexus between the state action taken and {{the object of the}} law. Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).|$|E

5|$|There are {{questions}} about the external validity of the AS diagnosis. That is, it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA {{is partly due to}} a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a national security issue involved.|$|E
5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E

5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted the question of <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The {{answer to this question}} is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the {{many different}} forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.|$|E
25|$|Electromyogram and Nerve {{conduction}} studies (EMG/NCS): These tests {{measure the}} electrical impulse along nerve roots, peripheral nerves, and muscle tissue.
