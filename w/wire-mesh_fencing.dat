2500|$|... 6 May 1986 — {{the entire}} cemeteries site {{enclosed}} with a <b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence</b> {{to stop the}} repeated vandalism ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{tells the}} story of a lonesome cowboy and/or sheriff in English (with a few German words), with the audio sample of the woman saying [...] "Maschendrahtzaun" [...] (<b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence)</b> and [...] "Knallerbsenstrauch" [...] (common snowberry shrub / lit. bang snaps shrub) {{inserted}} fittingly into the song. The music video extends this with using footage from the TV-show. The song talks about the cowboy (as the first person) and things he does with a <b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence.</b> There is no obvious link between the song and the legal case however both stories indicate unusual misuse of such a fence. The song's story is a little lewd in some places and contains some strong language, even in the radio edit version.|$|R
5000|$|A {{chain-link fence}} (also {{referred}} to as wire netting, <b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence,</b> chain-wire fence, cyclone fence, hurricane fence, or diamond-mesh fence) {{is a type of}} woven fence usually made from galvanized or LLDPE-coated steel wire. The wires run vertically and are bent into a zig-zag pattern so that each [...] "zig" [...] hooks with the wire immediately on one side and each [...] "zag" [...] with the wire immediately on the other. This forms the characteristic diamond pattern seen in this type of fence.|$|R
5000|$|Waldsiedlung covered about 2km² {{although}} the area's perimeter {{was not immediately}} recognizable from the outside. The 5 km outer ring consisted of a <b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence,</b> on which there were signs indicating a 'wildlife research area'. The inner ring {{was surrounded by a}} two-metre high, green security wall and could only be entered with special passes.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a rose covered {{palm tree}} {{on the corner of}} a {{residential}} block(?), ca. 1920. The rose bush, quite large and extravagant, has its branches entwined around the tall palm tree next to it. The rose bush and the palm tree are behind a wooden <b>fence</b> and <b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence.</b> Small shrubs (or weeds) and other plants grow along the sidewalk. Residential house are visible in the background...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{northern}} California log road, {{known as the}} Corduroy Road, ca. 1895, next to a lake. The road is made of logs lied side by side along the shore of a lake. The narrow road enters a copse of large trees and vegetation further back. On the left side, there is a <b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence.</b> A light-colored (white?) dog stands on the shore between the road and lake {{looking out over the}} water. A gentle mountain slope rises in the distance...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a Christmas palm {{in front}} of a two-story house on Seventh Stree near Figueroa, Los Angeles, ca. 1920. The trunk of the palm has ridges up to about midway where there is a small cluster of fronds growing from it. A little further up the trunk is where the main palm fronds grow. On this palm, there are a dozen feather-like fronds. To the right of the palm, is second house, two- or three-stories high. A <b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence,</b> {{overgrown}} with small bushes and trees, runs between the two houses near the palm. The photoprint reads "Archontopheonix cunninghamiana. Australia"...|$|R
50|$|When the <b>wire-mesh</b> border <b>fence</b> {{was built}} in 2008 on the Mexico-United States border, with part of it {{bordering}} Chihuahuita, it blocked {{the view of the}} green Rio Grande and canal area. Residents say that the fence has stopped illegal immigration in the area. Some residents report that they miss being able to swim in the canal.|$|R
5000|$|The Kimmeridge 1 well site, {{is a small}} site, with {{a single}} beam pump or [...] "nodding donkey" [...] which has been pumping {{continually}} since 1961, making it the oldest working oil pump in the UK. The well once produced 350 barrels per day, but currently yields around [...] from the Jurassic strata that lie around 350 m below the cliff. The well has been operating this long because it is tapped into a network of connected reserves, however the yield is decreasing. The oil is transported by tanker to Wytch Farm, from where it is piped to the storage tanks at Hamble-le-Rice on Southampton Water before being shipped to the main refinery. The nodding donkey has a high <b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence</b> around it {{but it can be}} viewed clearly from all sides. The well provides views over the Kimmeridge Ledges and 8 km of coast where bedrock extends at least half a kilometre out to sea under the waves.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} {{the flowers}} and palm trees in Eastlake Park (later known as Lincoln Park), [s. d. ]. In the {{foreground}} is a beautiful garden of flowers surrounded by a short <b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence.</b> A footpath circles around this garden and branches off into a straight path that leads to a bench in the distance. Nearby on the footpath are two benches facing each other. On the grass behind the benches and {{all the way down to}} the bench at the end of the footpath is a column of palm trees (one on each side of the footpath). Other trees are visible behind the column of palm trees as well as in the distance.; "Lincoln Park (formerly East Lake Park), which was a major tourist destination, boasts a nearby zoo and an alligator farm in addition to boating and lavish gardens in the early part of the century. Today, the park is best known as the location of Plaza de la Raza, established in 1970 in response to a city plan to demolish the historic boathouse, the organization has become the leading multidisciplinary cultural arts center for Latinos in Los Angeles.

2500|$|Richard Morrison of The Times {{described}} Orbit as [...] "like {{an enormous}} <b>wire-mesh</b> <b>fence</b> that has got hopelessly snagged round the bell {{of a giant}} french horn", adding that it [...] "seems like {{an awful lot of}} trouble just to look at East London", in comparison to a music hall comedian's refrain at the $16 million cost of the Brooklyn Bridge. Morrison not only compared Johnson [...] to Ozymandias, but also to the 20th century dictators Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Nicolae Ceauşescu, in their acts of [...] "phallic politics" [...] in building grandiose monuments. Criticising the lack of public involvement, he described how it would be an [...] "undesired intrusion by the few into the consciousness of the many". He feared that it could become one of the many [...] "thousands of naff eyesores" [...] of recent public art in Britain, citing the embracing couple at St Pancras station (The Meeting Place), the Dockland's Traffic Light tree, and the proposed Rotherhithe Tunnel 'match-stick man' tribute to Isambard Kingdom Brunel, as London based examples. Fellow Times writer Tom Dyckhoff, while calling it [...] "a gift to the tabloids" [...] and a [...] "giant Mr. Messy", questioned whether the Olympic site needed another pointless icon, postulating whether it would {{stand the test of time}} like the London Eye and become a true icon to match the Eiffel Tower, or a hopeless white elephant. Suggesting the project had echoes of Tatlin's Monument to the Third International, and especially Constant Nieuwenhuys' utopian city New Babylon, he asked whether Orbit was just as revolutionary or possessed the same ideological purpose, or whether it was merely [...] "a giant advert for one of the world’s biggest multinationals, sweetened with a bit of fun".|$|R
