5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, and {{dream of being}} princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would have killed him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E
500|$|... "Quite frankly we were {{beginning}} to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> still had an album like this left in them," [...] said Greg Moffitt of the BBC. [...] "A few of the songs command the attention with the insistence of old… [...] a deliciously wicked ride." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek awarded the album {{three and a half}} stars, saying, [...] "In many ways it could be Reign In Blood Revisited… Some compositions on this new recording have more of the band's early–style melody in them, with lightning flare–up riffs between verses: quick unexpected guitar pyrotechnics; and blast beat power drumming from Dave Lombardo pushing it all into red." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Casual Friday" [...] {{was written}} by Anthony Q. Farrell and {{directed}} by Brent Forrester. The official website for The Office included two cut scenes from [...] "Casual Friday" [...] {{within a week of}} its original release. In the first 50-second clip, Jim welcomes Pam to her new sales desk with a gift of a model of an island with figures representing Jim, Pam and Dwight, who share the office pod together. Dwight insists he did not {{have anything to do with}} the gift and does not welcome Pam to the desk because she [...] "obscures my view of the shredder." [...] In the second 50-second clip, Dwight tells Andy, Stanley and Phyllis that they should [...] "put our balls in the guillotine, as they say," [...] by threatening to quit if Michael does not give their clients back. The others express doubt and <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> should keep quiet in order to protect their jobs.|$|E

500|$|Uncle David {{was filmed}} over {{five days in}} October 2009 on the Isle of Sheppey, a {{location}} chosen for its proximity to London. Hoyle commented that the profusion of barbed wire fences there made him <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "keeping people out or keeping people in?". Reich {{said that he had}} been [...] "obsessed" [...] with Sheppey, a place he had considered [...] "a truly Godforsaken wasteland" [...] since working on a television show there ten years previously. He remarked that the [...] "trailer trash setting" [...] of the film was influenced by Harmony Korine's Gummo (1997) and John Waters' Female Trouble (1974). He also said that the filming budget of under £1000 was a homage to [...] "the spirit of John Waters." [...] All the extras featured in the film were real inhabitants of Sheppey, and to film a scene in a local cafe, they walked in and asked the proprietors if they could shoot there. Although they had planned to tell any enquirers who approached them that they were shooting a horror film, during the shoot none of the locals expressed any interest in the crew's activities.|$|E
2500|$|Gary Arnold {{wrote in}} the Washington Post that as [...] "romantic leads, Paré and Lane are pretty much a washout," [...] and that [...] "most of the action climaxes are treated as such throwaways that you begin to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> bored the director." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{convenience}} {{that social}} network sites give users {{to communicate with}} one another can also damage their interpersonal communication. Sherry Turkle, the {{founder and director of the}} MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, stated, [...] "Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed--and only for the parts we find useful, comforting, or amusing". Furthermore, social network sites can create insincere friendships, Turkle also noted, [...] "They nurture friendships on social-networking sites and then <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are among friends. They become confused about companionship".|$|E

2500|$|In April 1997, {{during a}} pre-game interview, Gaston accused {{specific}} members of Toronto's sports media (Toronto Sun columnist Steve Simmons, Globe and Mail sports editor Dave Langford, and Fan 590 sports {{talk show host}} Bob McCown) of racism against him, stating [...] "There's a couple (of sports writers) who continue to take shots at me {{for no reason at}} all. I just <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would take the same shot at me if I was white." [...] After the game against the Oakland A's on April 17, Gaston spoke briefly about his pre-game comments. [...] "I've got one statement that I'm going to say, and I'm not going to say another word", Gaston said. [...] "Whatever has been said, whatever has been written, if it has offended someone and it's unjustly offended them, I apologize. If it hasn't, then I don't apologize." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Okie From Muskogee," [...] "The Fightin' Side of Me," [...] and [...] "I <b>Wonder</b> <b>If</b> <b>They</b> Think of Me" [...] (Haggard's 1973 {{song about}} an American POW in Vietnam) were hailed as anthems of the Silent Majority {{and have been}} {{recognized}} {{as part of a}} recurring patriotic trend in American country music that also includes Charlie Daniels' [...] "In America" [...] and Lee Greenwood's [...] "God Bless the USA." [...] Although Gordon Friesen of Broadside magazine criticized Haggard for his [...] " [...] Birch-type songs against war dissenters," [...] Haggard was popular with college students in the early 1970s, {{not only because of the}} ironic use of his songs by counterculture members, but also because his music was recognized as coming from an early country-folk tradition. Both [...] "Okie from Muskogee" [...] and [...] "The Fightin' Side of Me" [...] received extensive airplay on underground radio stations, and [...] "Okie" [...] was performed in concert by protest singers Arlo Guthrie and Phil Ochs.|$|E

500|$|Petroglyphs often {{depict the}} Marquesan Dog in exaggerated forms. Millerstrom noted that these {{representations}} deviated from the typical {{characteristics of the}} Polynesian dog and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{were meant to be}} realistic. She stated: ...|$|R
