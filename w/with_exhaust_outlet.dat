In this study, the effects of the location of exhaust diffusers where the warm and contaminant air is extracted and their relation to room heat sources on thermal comfort and energy saving were investigated numerically for an office served by a displacement ventilation system. The indoor air quality in the breathing level and the inhaled zone were also evaluated. The contaminants were released from window and door frames in order to simulate the contaminants coming from outside. The amount of energy consumption and the indoor thermal environment for various exhaust locations were investigated numerically using the computational fluid dynamics techniques. The results showed that the thermal indoor environment, thermal comfort, quality of indoor air and energy saving were greatly improved by combining the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets</b> <b>with</b> some of the room’s heat sources such as ceiling lamps and external walls. In particular, a 25. 0 % of energy saving was achieved by combining the <b>exhaust</b> diffuser <b>with</b> room’s ceiling lamps. In addition, locating the exhaust diffuser near the heat sources also reduced the cooling coil load by 13. 8 %. The risk of a large difference in temperature between the head and foot levels, increased particle concentration in the occupied zone, as well as increased energy consumption was also clearly demonstrated when the exhaust and recirculated air outlet (return opening) were combined in one unit in the occupied boundary area that is located at 2 m away from the occupants. Thus, for the optimum energy saving and better indoor environment, the combination of the indoor heat sources <b>with</b> the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> is necessary. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

500|$|Honda {{started to}} {{introduce}} their {{third and final}} round of upgrades ahead of the , focusing on {{the internal combustion engine}} and associated <b>exhaust</b> parts <b>with</b> the aim of improving the efficiency of the MGU-H and gradually introducing new parts over the next three rounds.

Honda chose to focus on the internal combustion engine instead of directly addressing the problems with the MGU-H as they felt that the problems could not be adequately addressed with their remaining allowance for in-season development, and instead deferred development of the MGU-H {{until the end of the}} season when the restrictions on development would be lifted. The upgrades were given to Alonso, with Button scheduled to receive them two rounds later at the [...] The updates were received positively by Alonso, who pointed out that he had been setting lap times that were faster than those recorded by Lewis Hamilton during the opening phase of the race, and that the team had identified the potential to gain two and a half seconds per lap in 2016 through further refining of the engine and by adopting aerodynamic design elements used by other teams. Button was less optimistic, pointing out that the engine would struggle in Mexico as the high altitude of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez—some [...] above sea level—would leave the turbine down on power given the low density of the air. Although the team's predictions of a difficult weekend were proven true after qualifying, they highlighted the deficit to the leading Mercedes through the less power-dependent sectors of the circuit as being consistently within three tenths of a second, the narrowest the margin had been over the course of the season.|$|R

For each test 30 mL of FC- 77 was infused into the model lung. Condensers were placed in the expiratory limb of the ventilator circuit and the amounts of PFC (FC- 77) and water recovered were measured five times. This was repeated with the condensers placed at the ventilator <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet.</b> Results When the condensers were used as the expiratory limb, the mean (± SD) volume of FC 77 recovered was 16. 4 mL (± 0. 18 mL). When the condensers were connected to the ventilator <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> the mean (± SD) volume of FC- 77 recovered was 7. 6 mL (± 1. 14 mL).

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study is}} performed into {{the effects of}} the location of exhaust diffusers in relation to the room heat sources on thermal comfort and energy saving. A new concept of the combination of indoor heat sources and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> was also employed in this investigation. The results showed that the indoor thermal environment and energy saving were greatly improved by combining the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlets</b> <b>with</b> some of the room’s heat sources. For further improvement, this concept was also used along with a novel local exhaust ventilation system in the modelled office room. This system was adopted and developed for use in office spaces, where the exhaust opening was combined with the office workstation into a single unit. The main aim was to help extract the warmed and contaminated air locally before it could disperse across the room. Three different amounts of recirculated air and three different heights of the combined system were analysed. The results showed a significant improvement in energy savings and inhaled air quality in the room using the new ventilation system. It was also found that the performance of this system was greatly influenced by the height factor. In addition, in this research, the LES method was employed to investigate the complex characteristics of airflow and temperature distribution in the office room which used the concept of combining the <b>exhaust</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>with</b> room heat sources.
