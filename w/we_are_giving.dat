Vettel acknowledged {{the support of his}} team, saying the set-up of the car perfectly suited the way the race developed. Other drivers congratulated Vettel; Hamilton said that [...] "with all that pressure it is easier to make mistakes, and he obviously didn't, so congratulations to him. He did a good job." [...] The Grand Prix also marked the first win by Toro Rosso, the first non-Ferrari Italian-based team to win since 1957.

Khorasani also said [...] "Our suicide bombers have entered the school, they have instructions not to harm the children, but to target the Army personnel.

2500|$|When {{we try to}} be definite, as to what we {{mean when}} we say that this or that is [...] "the Good," [...] we find {{ourselves}} involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case — or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to [...] "values" [...] — that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects — lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to [...] "values" [...] lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has [...] "value", <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>giving</b> expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.|$|E
