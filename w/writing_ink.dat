High quality paper, which has good consistency of absorption, enables cleaner lines, although parchment or vellum is often used, as a knife {{can be used to}} erase imperfections and a light-box is not needed to allow lines to pass through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a light box or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or half inch, although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with litterea unciales (hence the name), and college-ruled paper often acts as a guideline well.|$|E
6000|$|A curious method {{with paper}} and {{ordinary}} <b>writing</b> <b>ink,</b> lately contrived by Dr. Forgeot, {{is analogous to}} lithography. He has described {{in one of the}} many interesting pamphlets published by the [...] "Laboratoire d'Anthropologie Criminelle" [...] of Lyon (Stenheil, 2 Rue Casimir-Delavigne, Paris), his new process of rendering visible the previously invisible details of such faint finger prints as thieves may have left on anything they have handled, the object being to show how evidence may sometimes be obtained for their identification. It is well known that pressure of the hand on the polished surface of glass or metal leaves a latent image very difficult to destroy, and which may be rendered visible by suitable applications, but few probably have suspected that this may be the case, to a considerable degree, with ordinary paper. Dr. Forgeot has shown that if a slightly greasy hand, such for example as a hand that has just been passed through the hair, be pressed on clean paper, and if common ink be afterwards brushed lightly over the paper, it will refuse to lie thickly on the greasy parts, and that the result will be a very fair picture of the minute markings on the fingers. He has even used these productions as negatives, and printed good photographs from them. He has also sent me a photographic print made from a piece of glass which had been exposed to the vapour of hydrofluoric acid, after having been touched by a greasy hand. I have made many trials of his method with considerable success. It affords a way of obtaining serviceable impressions in the absence of better means. Dr. Forgeot's pamphlet describes other methods of a generally similar kind, which he has found to be less good than the above.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the discriminating power of analytical techniques used for the differentiation of <b>writing</b> <b>inks</b> can be useful when interpreting results. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometry, thin layer chromatography (TLC), and diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were used to examine a population of 21 black and 12 blue ballpoint <b>writing</b> <b>inks.</b> Based on corroborative results of these methods, the discrimination power for UV-VIS, TLC, and FT-IR {{was determined to be}} 100 % and 98 % for the black and blue inks, respectively. Generally, TLC and UV-VIS can be used to differentiate the colorant components (i. e., dyes and some pigments) found in inks. As FT-IR can be utilized to identify some of the noncolorant components, it was determined to be an excellent complementary technique that can be implemented into an analytical scheme for ink analysis...|$|R

40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the {{extremely}} popular but poorly developed scientific and forensic problem of the estimation of the actual dates of inscriptions placed on paper and made by ballpoint pens. It is shown that the degradation of <b>writing</b> <b>inks</b> with time may be controlled via Raman spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The time intervals for the implementation of each of these methods were determined using the ratios of the Raman peak intensities as degradation characteristics rather than their absolute values. In turn, this eliminates the effect of the concentration of a dye. The mutual influence of the volatile components and dyes of <b>writing</b> <b>inks</b> was also investigated and the time interval within which such influence is critical was found. According to the obtained results, a new methodological scheme for determining the age of documents, which were created at least 40 months ago, was proposed...|$|R

50|$|In the 15th century, a {{new type}} of ink had to be {{developed}} in Europe for the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg. According to Martyn Lyons in his book Books: A Living History, Gutenberg’s dye was indelible, oil-based, and made from the soot of lamps (lamp-black) mixed with varnish and egg white. Two types of ink were prevalent at the time: the Greek and Roman <b>writing</b> <b>ink</b> (soot, glue, and water) and the 12th century variety composed of ferrous sulfate, gall, gum, and water. Neither of these handwriting inks could adhere to printing surfaces without creating blurs. Eventually an oily, varnish-like ink made of soot, turpentine, and walnut oil was created specifically for the printing press.|$|E
