Melanie was writer, producer, artist, therapist, mentor, best friend, drink technician and drug partner on this album. She was everything a girl could be.” Further to this, Tairrie cited Makaiwi {{as the one who}} led Tairrie to explore a more restrained vocal style than what she was used to: “Working with Melanie was a very cool influence because when we started working together it started as a very casual, experimental vibe. She’d say, ‘You don’t need to scream on everything, you need to try something different’.” ...|$|E

You have to be very aware of how you work with yourself - it all comes from what you feel at that moment. When I do James, for instance, I actually say the lines to myself as I'm doing the mime. Not always, but... {{you have to have the}} overall feeling at that moment, in that scene; and then one scene leads into the next, and sometimes, if for instance in La Sylphide or Napoli something doesn't go how I want during the first act, then when I'm up in my dressing room in the intermission I try to work out what I felt, and <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to do now, to get it in a way so it still works. That way you don't always do it the same way - what I'm doing on Friday might be a little different from last night because suddenly things fall out a little differently in the first act. So I need the intermission to reflect. And this is what I think is so wonderful about the Royal Danish Ballet, that we work so strongly with the tradition of acting, and that is probably why I'm still here, that I get from our repertory the opportunity of going back to these parts and developing. (Translation by Jane Simpson)To celebrate the bicentenary of the birth of August Bournonville, the Danish Postal Service - Post Danmark - issuied on 4 May 2005 two commemorative postage stamps. On the DKK 4.50 stamp Lund was the silhouette performing the characteristic Bournonville leap, Grand Jeté, in Bournonville's ballet Napoli.|$|E
