The policy alternatives examined are a continuation of post- 1977 grains policy and management strategy (PA I); elimination of grain policy programs (PA II); replacement of the existing farmer-owned reserve program (FOR) with an FOR equivalent subsidy to private commercial storage at any price (PA III); and continuation of post- 1977 grains policy without authority to implement acreage reduction programs (PA IV);Results from estimation of the econometric model suggest that a l bushel increase in government carryover (FOR and CCC-owned stocks) displaces commercial carryover. 242 and. 259 bushels for <b>wheat</b> and <b>feed</b> grain, respectively.

FOR carryover for the 1977 - 80 period has been quite price elastic (estimated elasticities are 3. 63 and 3. 77 for <b>wheat</b> and <b>feed</b> grain). These estimates suggest that the reserve program as managed over 1977 - 80 has added to the elasticity of total demand for both <b>wheat</b> and <b>feed</b> grain, thus, significantly enhancing grain price stability;Mean grain and livestock prices generally follow each other fairly closely over the 1981 - 90 period for all policy alternatives. Wheat, corn, and livestock prices are 331, 38, and 17 percent more volatile, on average, over 1981 - 90 in the free market alternative (PA II) compared to the current policy alternative (PA I). These prices are 94, 29, and 13 percent more volatile when the FOR is replaced with a simple subsidy to all commercial storage at any price (PA III). Finally, results suggest that lack of acreage reduction authority (PA IV) requires FOR carryover to be 14 and 8 percent greater, on average, for <b>wheat</b> and <b>feed</b> grain (compared to PA I) to maintain market price volatility comparable to the current policy alternative...|$|R

Marketing loan provisions became mandatory for soybeans and other oilseeds, upland cotton, and rice and were permitted for wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, and honey under amendments made by the 1990 farm bill (P.L. 101-624).

50|$|The Agricultural Market Transition Act (AMTA) — Title I of the 1996 {{farm bill}} (P.L. 104-127) — allowed farmers who {{had participated in}} the <b>wheat,</b> <b>feed</b> grain, cotton, and rice {{programs}} in any one of the 5 years prior to 1996 to enter into 7-year production flexibility contracts for 1996-2002. Total national production flexibility contract payments (sometimes called AMTA payments, or contract payments) for each fiscal year were fixed in the law. The AMTA allowed farmers to plant 100% of their total contract acreage to any crop except fruits and vegetables, and receive a full payment. Land had to be maintained in agricultural uses. Unlimited haying and grazing and planting and harvesting alfalfa and other forage crops was permitted with no reduction in payments.

5000|$|In the United States, the Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) is a no-longer-authorized annual {{cropland}} retirement {{program for}} <b>wheat,</b> <b>feed</b> grains, cotton, or rice in which farmers {{participating in the}} commodity programs (in order {{to be eligible for}} nonrecourse loans and deficiency payments) were mandated to idle a crop-specific, nationally-set portion of their base acreage during years of surplus. The idled acreage (called the acreage conservation reserve) was devoted to a conserving use. The goal was to reduce supplies, thereby raising market prices. Additionally, idled acres did not earn deficiency payments, thus reducing commodity program costs. ARP was criticized for diminishing the U.S. competitive position in export markets. The 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) did not reauthorize ARPs. ARP differed from a set-aside program in that under a set-aside program reductions were based upon current year plantings, and did not require farmers to reduce their plantings of a specific crop.|$|E
