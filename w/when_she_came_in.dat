25|$|In 1944, Dora {{was still}} working for the Duke <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> contact with Opus Dei. Fr. Josemaria Escriva, founder of the then-new Opus Dei movement, had turned to the Daughters for Domestic Service for help in hiring {{household}} employees for a student dormitory he was opening called the Moncloa Residence. The Mother Superior of the Domestic Service Daughters recommended Dora, who happened to have some days off at the time. In spite of the low pay offered and her little desire to go, at the nun's insistence Dora agreed to help out the residence for a few days.|$|E
25|$|The pursuers skillfully took up {{position}} to limit South Carolinas options {{in trying to}} get away, the British windward ship attempted to mask the South Carolinas wind. For eighteen hours the British chased South Carolina. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> range, she fired her stern chasers at Diomede, which returned fire from her bow-guns. By 1500hrs the British ships were close enough to exchange shots and could each yaw, fire a broadside and return to the chase while preventing South Carolina from doing the same. The first of the British broadsides did major damage to South Carolina, leading Joyner to call his officers together to discuss whether to fight or to continue the flight. The decision was to continue the latter. By 1700hrs Quebec and Diomede came up alongside South Carolina, with Astrea behind in support, together with Hope and Constance. The British were soon in position to fire six broadsides, five from the Diomede and the other from the Quebec, all aimed at South Carolinas masts, sails and rigging, which within two hours were in tatters.|$|E
500|$|The role of Martha Kent was {{originally}} given to Cynthia Ettinger, but during filming everyone, including Ettinger, {{realized that she}} was not right for the role. O'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger was filming her scenes for the pilot. Around the time the creators were looking to recast the role of Martha Kent The Huntress was canceled, which allowed O'Toole the chance to join the cast of Smallville. Coincidentally, the actress had previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III. O'Toole thinks that the producers wanted someone older for the role of Martha, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> to talk to the producers everyone appeared {{to be on the same}} page with what the character and the show should be about. O'Toole characterizes Martha as really intelligent, but believes the character has to hide her intelligence at times [...] "to keep the peace".|$|E

500|$|For {{the role}} of Constance Welch—the Woman in White—production {{set out to find}} the [...] "perfect actress". Nutter, a fan of The L Word, had watched an episode {{featuring}} actress Sarah Shahi one night during the casting process. He felt she was [...] "really sharp" [...] and a [...] "fine actress", with a [...] "seductive quality about her". Surprised <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> to audition the following day, he knew she [...] "had the job when she walked in the door". Because the scene involving Constance's husband Joseph Welch merely discusses Constance's backstory, the scene hinged on the actors' performances. Seeking a [...] "great actor", Nutter recalled his previous experience working with Steve Railsback, and offered him the role. Other guest stars include Adrianne Palicki as Sam's girlfriend Jessica Moore, and Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. The latter felt she landed the part due to her joking around with Nutter during the audition.|$|E

[...] She was able to make some necessary changes in staff, and she has really put a new face on the athletic department. [...] She accepted the challenge as the school improved its rankings across the board... She has done a great job." [...] Head women's basketball coach Brenda Frese [...] said, [...] "I think the biggest strength for Debbie is that from top to bottom, she knows how to run a department and allows every unit and every coaching staff member to be successful." [...] Football coach Ralph Friedgen called Yow's accomplishments as AD at Maryland, [...] "unprecedented." ...|$|E
2500|$|People {{close to}} Zahau {{expressed}} {{doubt that she}} would have committed suicide. Zahau's elder sister {{said in an interview that}} [...] "I still believe my sister didn't take her life", and in a written statement on behalf of the family wrote that [...] "Rebecca valued her life and lived her life to its fullest. Rebecca loved God, her family and life." [...] Her younger sister commented more strongly by e-mail, [...] "Becky did not commit suicide. My sister was murdered." [...] Her former trainer also stated that [...] "She was always happy [...] always smiling <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>in.</b> I didn't see a problem or anything like that." [...] Family members disputed police characterizations of Zahau as depressed, describing her instead that as a happy person. Furthermore, they state that Zahau believed as a Christian that suicide was wrong. After the suicide ruling, Neil Nalepa was quoted as stating, [...] "I would not believe Rebecca would commit suicide. It’s out of character." [...] However, Sheriff Bill Gore, who investigated the death, stated of the family's reluctance to accept the suicide ruling, [...] "We laid out the case extensively to them in Missouri to answer their questions, and it’s unfortunate she can't accept the results." [...] On September 7, the family launched a website [...] seeking donations to fund their own investigation into Zahau's death. The site states: [...] "It was obvious that the Sheriff’s Department had worked too hard to paint this picture of suicide and they were not about to let the Zahaus ruin it." [...] In late September, they continued to demand that the case be re-opened.|$|E

2500|$|In 1911, Hasse {{was moved}} to the Documents Division of the NYPL where she was given the {{additional}} task of providing reference services, which greatly diminished the time she had available for working on NYPL's massive collection of government and municipal documents. [...] The Documents Division was closely related to the Economics Division, which was led by Charles Williamson. [...] It was at this point that Hasse's reputation as a misandrist and [...] "classic difficult woman, selfish, bad-tempered, and unreasonable" [...] began to unfold. [...] As she was passed over for promotions with some regularity, her less experienced male supervisors sought to undermine her authority and expertise in government documents at every turn. [...] In 1915, the Chief Reference Librarian, Harry Miller Lydenberg, under new NYPL Director Edwin Anderson, launched a campaign against her, claiming that her entries were [...] "erroneous or inconsistent." [...] This campaign gathered steam and continued until her termination from the NYPL in 1919. [...] The beginning of the end for Hasse was when Anderson and Lydenberg removed her from her special collection to the Cataloging Division because they claimed that she [...] "refused to 'coordinate' with the cataloging office on her work." [...] After twenty years of cataloging government documents on her own, she was now little more than just another cataloging staff member. [...] Anderson eventually fired Hasse [...] "via a two-sentence letter" [...] and denied her request for a meeting as to why she was fired as well as for a hearing. [...] Patrons of the library were even told not to associate with her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> as a patron after her dismissal, and her supporters working in the library, as well as those she hired, were fired soon after.|$|E
