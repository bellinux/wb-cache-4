5|$|By {{applying}} post-structuralist {{theory to}} anarchism, Newman presents {{an account of}} post-anarchism. His post-anarchism is more substantive than that of earlier thinkers, and has influenced later approaches to the philosophy. Released in a climate of an anarchist movement hostile to postmodern philosophy, From Bakunin to Lacan was criticised for its poor understanding of and engagement <b>with</b> <b>contemporary</b> anarchism.|$|E
5|$|Christian Lee Novetzke of the University of Washington {{suggests}} that Vithoba's worship migrated from Karnataka to the formerly Shaiva city of Pandharpur {{some time before}} 1000CE; but under the possible influence of a Krishna-worshipping Mahanubhava sect, the town {{was transformed into a}} Vaishnava center of pilgrimage. This proposal is consistent <b>with</b> <b>contemporary</b> remnants of Shaiva worship in the town.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Byzantine flavour to these images was also connected <b>with</b> <b>contemporary</b> attempts through diplomacy to achieve reconciliation with the Greek Orthodox Church, in which van Eyck's patron Philip the Good took a keen interest. Van Eyck's Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati (c. 1431) depicts one of the papal diplomats most involved with these efforts.|$|E
5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} <b>with</b> <b>contemporary</b> Christian music (CCM) often {{assume that}} Loder sings hymn-style music. Her career {{is unusual in}} that it began in CCM; most young musicians choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but {{they may also be}} interpreted as being about other subjects.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Richard's corpse {{was taken}} to Leicester and buried without pomp. His {{original}} tomb monument {{is believed to have}} been removed during the English Reformation, and his remains were lost for more than five centuries, believed to have been thrown into the River Soar. In 2012, an archaeological excavation was commissioned by the Richard III Society on a city council car park on the site once occupied by Greyfriars Priory Church. The University of Leicester identified the skeleton found in the excavation as that of Richard III as a result of radiocarbon dating, comparison <b>with</b> <b>contemporary</b> reports of his appearance, and comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of Richard III's eldest sister, Anne of York. Richard's remains were reburied in Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{in modern}} Scotland {{encompasses}} all building in Scotland, between {{the beginning of}} the twentieth century and the present day. The most significant architect of the early twentieth century was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who mixed elements of traditional Scottish architecture <b>with</b> <b>contemporary</b> movements. Estate house design declined in importance in the twentieth century. In the early decades of the century, traditional materials began to give way to cheaper modern ones. After the First World War modernism and the office block began to dominate building in the major cities and attempts began to improve the quality of urban housing for the poor, resulted in a massive programme of council house building. The Neo-Gothic style continued in to the twentieth century but the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 20th century, the {{building}} underwent three major renovations. In the first, from 1905 to 1907, Frank Lloyd Wright was retained to remake the interior spaces. In keeping <b>with</b> <b>contemporary</b> tastes, Wright's design covered Root's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved Carrara marble surfaces. Wright was highly regarded by the public at this point, and his changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery {{one of the most}} sought after buildings of Chicago. Some of Wright's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding his trademark style planters and light fixtures.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Carter {{began dating}} Dori Pierson, {{whom he had}} met through a cousin of hers {{who worked with him}} at Surfing Magazine. Pierson's {{connections}} at Walt Disney Studios led to chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg hiring Carter on a standard contract. Carter began writing television films for the studio, penning The B.R.A.T. Patrol in 1986 and Meet the Munceys in 1988. These scripts led to Carter being associated <b>with</b> <b>contemporary</b> youth comedy at the studio, and although he enjoyed the work he felt that his real strengths and interests lay in serious drama instead.|$|E

5|$|The Northrop F-20 Tigershark (initially F-5G) was {{a privately}} financed light fighter, {{designed}} and built by Northrop. Its development began in 1975 as a further evolution of Northrop's F-5E Tiger II, featuring a new engine that greatly improved overall performance, and a modern avionics suite including a powerful and flexible radar. Compared with the F-5E, the F-20 was much faster, gained beyond-visual-range air-to-air capability, and had a full suite of air-to-ground modes capable of firing most U.S. weapons. With these improved capabilities, the F-20 became competitive <b>with</b> <b>contemporary</b> fighter designs such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, but was much less expensive to purchase and operate.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations <b>with</b> <b>contemporary</b> adventure titles {{led him to}} make the player character's death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the Saluki in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club, has remained relatively stable over the past decade, with the breed ranked 107th in 1999, had decreased to 118th in 2008, but by 2008 had increased once again to 112th. Between 2000 and 2009, 1215 Salukis were registered with The Kennel Club in the UK, while this does not approach the numbers {{of the more popular}} breeds, it is in line with similar breeds in the Hound Group such as the Borzoi, which had 1399 puppies registered in the same period.
