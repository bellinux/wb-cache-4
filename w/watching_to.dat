25|$|Often in bleak moments do I cast back to Bob Barber's 185 {{in front}} of 40,000 on that sunny Friday in January 66. He batted without chance for five hours, {{starting}} decorously enough and then hitting the ball progressively harder and with a superb disdain to {{every corner of the}} field. One recalls the exceptional vigour of his driving and how he brought his wrists into the cut, making room for the stroke. It made blissful <b>watching</b> <b>to</b> English eyes – to one pair in particular, for by a wonderful chance father Barber had flown in from home that very day.|$|E
25|$|Jones and Taylor resumed on {{the second}} morning with {{everybody}} <b>watching</b> <b>to</b> see if the young New South Wales batsman Taylor, could add the four runs he needed for his maiden Test century {{and he did not}} disappoint, bringing up his ton shortly after the resumption. It was not the most glamorous of centuries, but filled the young batsman with the confidence he needed to secure his place in the team for much of the next decade. Jones and Taylor batted throughout the morning taking Australia to 273 for 4 when Taylor was finally dismissed for 136.|$|E

25|$|The soft spile in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile. The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by wiping the spile clean and then <b>watching</b> <b>to</b> see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with a hard one (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped up to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E

500|$|However, if {{the food}} is cooked in the oil for too long, much of the water will be lost and the oil will begin to {{penetrate}} the food. The correct frying temperature depends on the thickness and type of food, {{but in most cases}} it lies between [...] An informal test for a temperature close to this range involves adding a tiny amount of flour into the oil and <b>watching</b> <b>to</b> see if it sizzles without immediately burning. A second test involves adding one piece of food to deep fry and watching it sink somewhat and rise back up. Sinking without resurfacing indicates that the oil is too cold; not sinking at all indicates that the oil is too hot.|$|E

500|$|Feeling {{much more}} confident, D'Oliveira {{expected}} {{to be successful in}} the Oval Test match. Before the game, an unnamed MCC official circulated a story that D'Oliveira had been offered thousands of pounds to keep himself available for the South Africa tour. This was a similar story to that which D'Oliveira had told Oosthuizen; it had probably travelled back to the MCC via South Africa, but was not true. When the game began, Australia held a 1–0 lead after four Tests; England needed a win to level the series. England made a reasonable start on the first day, but a late wicket brought D'Oliveira in to bat with the game delicately poised. Oborne observes that D'Oliveira was under huge pressure, both for simple cricketing reasons and because the world was <b>watching</b> <b>to</b> see if he would be successful. Wisden reported: [...] "In the last hour D'Oliveira began his fine effort. He hooked the short ball superbly". At {{the end of the first}} day, he had scored 23 runs.|$|E
500|$|Their final ritual {{took place}} in the Mojave Desert in late February 1946, during which Parsons {{abruptly}} decided that his undertaking was complete. On returning to the Parsonage he discovered that a woman named Marjorie Cameron—an unemployed illustrator and former Navy WAVE—had come to visit. Believing her to be the [...] "elemental" [...] woman and manifestation of Babalon that he had invoked, in early March Parsons began performing sex magic rituals with Cameron, who acted as his [...] "Scarlet Woman", while Hubbard continued to participate as the amanuensis. Unlike the rest of the household, Cameron knew nothing at first of Parsons' magical intentions: [...] "I didn't know anything about the O.T.O., I didn't know that they had invoked me, I didn't know anything, but the whole house knew it. Everybody was <b>watching</b> <b>to</b> see what was going on." [...] Despite this ignorance and her skepticism about Parsons' magic, Cameron reported her sighting of a UFO to Parsons, who secretly recorded the sighting as a materialization of Babalon.|$|E

Metcalfe believed that this behaviour was typical of Mercedes. Malachy had died and rather than [...] "moping" [...] about she chooses {{to get on with}} her life. Riley filled the role of giving Mercedes some attention [...] "when she needs it most". The serial introduced complications with Riley and Mercedes' relationship with the introduction of Riley's father Carl (Paul Opacic). Carl's disapproval of Mercedes created tension between them and she [...] "hits a nerve" [...] by jibing Carl. Metcalfe explained that Mercedes asked Carl what he would do if she stayed with Riley. In an effort to [...] "wind him up", Mercedes suggested that she and Carl sleep together; Metcalfe stated that it was [...] "obvious he's tempted", and Mercedes and Carl start an affair. Opacic told a reporter from Inside Soap that Mercedes and Carl felt guilty about their tryst, but suggested that viewers keep <b>watching</b> <b>to</b> see if the two could [...] "stay away from each other". He added that while Riley believed Mercedes was [...] "the girl of his dreams", Carl believed that Mercedes was not [...] "good enough" [...] for his son.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker {{gave the}} episode an A, posing the question: [...] "Has there {{ever been a}} TV show more aptly named than Glee? It both embodies and inspires exactly that quality." [...] Glee was the top ranked topic on social {{networking}} site Twitter {{on the night of}} its initial airing. Alessandra Stanley for The New York Times called the show [...] "blissfully unoriginal in a witty, imaginative way", saying the characters are [...] "high school archetypes" [...] but noted [...] "a strong satiric pulse that doesn’t diminish the characters’ identities or dim the showmanship of a talented cast". The Daily News David Hinckley wrote that the show [...] "isn't close to perfect" [...] but [...] "has likable characters, {{a good sense of humor}} and a reasonably deft touch with music." [...] He called the pilot episode [...] "not very plausible" [...] but [...] "potentially heartwarming", writing of the musical choices: [...] "The duet of [...] "You're the One That I Want" [...] from Grease may be a little obvious, but setting a group dance routine to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] shows some inspiration. Whether Glee can hold that note remains a very unanswered question. But it will at least be worth <b>watching</b> <b>to</b> see." [...] USA Today Robert Bianco assessed: [...] "There's a lot to like here: the exuberance of the musical numbers, the bite to the comedy and the joy of seeing something different. It has casting and tone problems, but it has all summer to fix them." ...|$|E

The proportion of sugar and fruit varies according {{to the type of}} fruit and its ripeness, but a rough starting point is equal weights of each.
