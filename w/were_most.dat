5|$|In 2009, a Spanish {{research}} vessel {{conducted a study}} of the cephalopod population off the coast of Mozambique. The study found populations of V. togata across the entire study area, which ran most of the coast of Mozambique, with especially high concentrations at the very southern end of the Mozambiquan coast, in the waters near the city of Maputo. The study performed trawls in four depth groups, 200–400, 400–500, 500–600, and 600–700 meters below sea level. While V. togata was found in all four depth ranges, they <b>were</b> <b>most</b> abundant between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. The study also noted that males <b>were</b> <b>most</b> common in the shallower two groups, while females were more common in the deeper two groups.|$|E
