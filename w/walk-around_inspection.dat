40|$|This trainer's {{guide is}} {{designed}} as a reference manual. The purpose is to offer information and examples to skills trainers {{to assist them in}} structuring training for new operators of Walk-Thru roof bolting machines. Trainers can use this manual as a resource for helping trainees learn, understand, and apply knowledge and skills. In this sense, the guide is not prescriptive. It is designed to offer information and trigger ideas on what might be done to accelerate learning to those who are new to the roof bolting task. On-site trainers can modify this guide to fit their conditions, machines and equipment, and work procedures. They can integrate roof control plans, company policies and procedures, and operators' manuals from the manufacturers of the original equipment into this guide. Every trainee is different and will come to the job with varying levels of relevant knowledge and skills. The trainer's decisions on where to start, how to organize the on-the-job and classroom training portions, and when and how to offer different aspects of the training will be based on (1) a pretraining assessment of the trainee's knowledge and skills and (2) the trainer's experience in conducting skills training. The "Skill Check" section might be useful for deciding where training should start among miners who have underground experience but limited knowledge of roof-bolting techniques. Every job carries a learning curve and likely has a number of "teachable moments" where significantly new knowledge and skills can be learned. The videos on the DVD that accompany this guide can be shown at the beginning of training to give trainees an idea of what the job entails and related requirements. They can also be used within the training cycle (after the trainee has some experience in the job) to reinforce key points or as a trigger for eliciting questions about particularly difficult parts of the job. The video segments are meant to be visual models of good performance. They are designed to elicit discussion on good (lower risk) ways to do the job. In this context, they can be used very creatively at different times within the training cycle. The section on "Talking Points" offers a number of questions {{that can be used in}} the classroom to support and elaborate on certain aspects of the job duties. If the trainee has a fair amount of underground experience, some of the questions can also be used to support the pretraining assessment (i. e., skill check) of knowledge and skills. Likewise, some of the questions can also be used while teaching on the job to reinforce key points affecting safety, production, or maintenance. The section dealing with a mine's roof control plan should be used at various times in the training cycle to make sure the trainee understands the plan and knows how to apply it in performing the job. The supplemental materials offer additional resources that can be used to support initial job training or follow-up. Learning continues well after an individual has been trained. The supplemental materials can help reinforce good operating skills and provide an opportunity for further discussion on better ways to do the job.

50|$|Approximately 45 {{minutes before}} launch time, flight crews conduct <b>walk-around</b> <b>inspections</b> and man their {{aircraft}}. Approximately 30 minutes prior to launch, aircraft are started, and pre-flight inspections are conducted. Approximately 15 minutes prior to launch, ready aircraft are taxied from their parked positions and spotted on or immediately behind the catapults. The ship is {{turned into the}} natural wind. As an aircraft is taxied onto the catapult, the wings are spread and a large jet blast deflector (JBD) panel rises out of the flight deck behind the engine exhaust. Prior to final catapult hookup, Final Checkers (inspectors) make final exterior checks of the aircraft, and loaded weapons are armed by Ordnancemen.|$|R
40|$|NASA has {{set goals}} to {{increase}} safety by one hundred times while reducing cost tenfold {{over the next}} decade. This dramatic increase in safety will come by departing from a past emphasis on cost and performance to a new paradigm of safety and reliability, which, in turn, will drive down cost. To accomplish this, vehicle systems must be inherently reliable, functionally redundant wherever practical and designed to minimize or eliminate catastrophic failure modes. Over the next twenty-five years, NASA has set goals to increase safety ten thousand times while reducing cost one hundred fold. Safety will increase towards today's airline safety and the low price per flight {{has the potential to}} enable a 15 -fold increase {{in the size of the}} current projected space launch market. This level of improvement is comparable to the developments in the 1970 s in the computer microprocessor when microchips went from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands of dollars - hailing the era of the personal computer. In order to achieve such ambitious cost goals, today's partial and fully expendable rockets must be replaced by fully reusable systems. A RLV can eliminate assembly and checkout of the large number of complex interfaces on today's Space Shuttle. Full reusability will eliminate the necessity to throw away expensive hardware and the need for on-going production. Systems in ten years will have to accommodate 50 to 100 missions per year and could be commercially certified for hundreds of flights. In twenty-five years, the number of flights per year could jump to over 1, 000, which will require certification for thousands of flights. The large increase in flights per year will demand that current operations and maintenance procedures be revolutionized. Unlike the current shuttle, which requires several thousand personnel over five months to process, the next generation system must be turned around in one week with less than one hundred personnel. In contrast to the rigorous disassembly and inspections required for the Space Shuttle's subsystems, the next generation vehicle's on-board health monitoring systems will could tell the ground crews which systems need replacement before landing. In twenty-five years, vehicles will be re-flown within one with crews numbering less than one hundred. Fully automated ground processing systems must require only a handful of personnel to launch the vehicle. Due to the increased intelligence of on-board systems, only cursory <b>walk-around</b> <b>inspections</b> would be required between flights An assessment of the progress in breakthrough technologies toward these goals by the NASA Advanced Space Transportation Program is presented. These breakthrough technologies include combined rocket and air breathing propulsion, high strength lightweight structures, high temperature materials, vehicle health management, and flight operations...|$|R
40|$|The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Issues Management Program {{encompasses}} the continuous monitoring of work programs, performance and safety to promptly identify issues {{to determine their}} risk and significance, their causes, and to identify and effectively implement corrective actions to ensure successful resolution and prevent the same or similar problems from occurring. This document describes the LBNL Issues Management Program and prescribes the process for issues identification, tracking, resolution, closure, validation, and effectiveness of corrective actions. Issues that are governed by this program include program and performance deficiencies or nonconformances that may be identified through employee discovery, internal or external oversight assessment findings, suggested process improvements and associated actions that require formal corrective action. Issues may also be identified in and/or may result in Root Cause Analysis (RCA) reports, Price Anderson Amendment Act (PAAA) reports, Occurrence Reporting and Processing System (ORPS) reports, Accident Investigation reports, assessment reports, and External Oversight reports. The scope of these issues may include issues of both high and low significance as well as adverse conditions that meet the reporting requirements of the University of California (UC) Assurance Plan for LBNL or other reporting entities (e. g., U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, U. S. Department of Energy). Issues that are found {{as a result of}} a <b>walk-around</b> or workspace <b>inspection</b> that can be immediately corrected or fixed are exempt from the requirements of this document...|$|R
5000|$|On October 16, 2001, an EMB 145 was {{on final}} {{approach}} to Roanoke, Virginia. The captain had briefed a [...] "no go-around" [...] {{for a night}} visual approach to a [...] "Special Airport". The approach was not stabilized, and the airspeed decreased {{to the point of}} a stall. The airplane struck the runway in a nose high pitch attitude, the aft fuselage struck the runway first then settled on the landing gear. The first officer made initial call-outs of slow airspeed and then stopped when the captain failed to respond to her callouts. After landing, the airplane was taxied to the gate where a post-flight inspection limited to the main landing gear did not find the damage to the tail section. The incident was not reported by either pilot to the company and the airplane was allowed to be flown by the next crew the following morning on its scheduled service back to Charlotte, North Carolina, where a post flight inspection revealed the tail strike. When interviewed, the captain first denied having been involved in a hard landing and speculated that the tail strike must have been the result of an over rotation on takeoff from the morning crew. When faced with the CVR and FDR data, she eventually admitted to the incident. She reported that she briefed [...] "no go-around" [...] because no takeoffs were authorized on the runway at night or in IMC conditions; however, the first officer knew this was incorrect, but did not challenge the captain. Both pilots had received CRM training, which included crew member assertiveness, methods of fostering crew input, and situational awareness, and training on special use airports; however it was not followed by either pilot. The captain said the first officer was passive and quiet. The first officer reported the captain was defensive and did not take criticism very well. It is remarkable that the damage to the tail section was not discovered during the preflight visual inspection performed by the morning flight or ground crews. The aircraft had an MELed APU and needed the engines to be started with the assistance of an external air cart. The connection for the air cart is located at the aft bottom fuselage section where the damages were visible. The access panel was bent. Yet the ground crew did not notify the flight deck crew. When the <b>walk-around</b> visual <b>inspection</b> was performed by the morning crew's first officer, it was performed during the hours of darkness {{with the help of a}} flashlight. The air cart was already connected and forced the first officer to walk around the cart and away from the aircraft, missing the tail strike damages. [...] Both crews were terminated from employment; however, the first officer of the accident flight and the captain of the morning flight were eventually reinstated with help of their union (ALPA). The accident captain was able to recover her certificates and privileges but was not reinstated. The first officer from the morning crew died from illness prior to being reinstated.|$|R
