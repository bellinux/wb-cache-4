25|$|Viticulture {{in present-day}} Germany {{dates back to}} Ancient Roman times, to {{sometime}} from 70 to 270 CE/AD (Agri Decumates). In those days, the western parts of today's Germany made up the outpost of the Roman empire against the Germanic tribes {{on the other side}} of Rhine. What is generally considered Germany's oldest city, Trier, was founded as a Roman garrison and is situated directly on the river Moselle (Mosel) in the eponymous wine region. The oldest archeological finds that may indicate early German viticulture are curved pruning knives found in the vicinity of Roman garrisons, dating from the 1st century AD. However, it is not absolutely certain that these knives were used for viticultural purposes. Emperor Probus, whose reign can be dated two centuries later than these knives, is generally considered the founder of German viticulture, but for solid documentation of winemaking on German soil, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> to around 370 AD, when Ausonius of Bordeaux wrote Mosella, where he in enthusiastic terms described the steep vineyards on river Moselle.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{himself was}} {{ambiguous}} about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He {{wrote to the}} Dutch composer Julius Röntgen in 1909 [...] "I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What {{do you think about}} songs sung in unison? <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> back... to the pure and the clear." [...] On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 [...] "Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does... and it is impossible to deliver national music on request." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{its heavy}} use of irony, {{symbolism}} and metaphor, the novel also {{lends itself to}} less straightforward readings. As with many of Crane's fictional works, the novel's dialogue often uses distinctive local dialects, contributing to its apparent historicity; for example, Jim Conklin muses {{at the beginning of}} the novel: [...] "I s'pose <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> reconnoiterin' 'round th' kentry jest t' keep 'em from gittin' too clost, or t'develope'm, or something". The ironic tone increases in severity as the novel progresses, especially in terms of the ironic distance between the narrator and protagonist. The title of the work itself is ironic; Henry wishes [...] "that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of courage", echoing a wish to have been wounded in battle. The wound he does receive (from the rifle butt of a fleeing Union soldier), however, is not a badge of courage but a badge of shame.|$|E

Besides, your father will come home. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> let Fred <b>go</b> alone. He can tell Mary {{that you are}} here, and she will come back to-morrow." ...|$|R

2500|$|In late December, Scott Hoying {{stated that}} for 2015, [...] "Pentatonix is {{transitioning}} towards original music." [...] A {{release of a}} full-length album consisting of only original material is planned. Hoying also stated, [...] "We're at the point in our careers now [...] <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> to original music, {{and we want to}} go to original music; we have so much to say, and I think it's gonna be quite a journey." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{top panel}} first left, we see Mary and Joseph with Jesus {{lying in a}} manger. [...] "After the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another ‘Come <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> {{straight}} to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us’ so they went with all speed and {{found their way to}} Mary and Joseph and the baby lying in a manger."

6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] he said quietly. [...] "We {{have struck}} it, and didn't {{recognize}} it. In fact, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> have <b>gone</b> straight across {{and left it}} behind us." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "This day," [...] he (Yogananda) thundered, {{punctuating}} every word, [...] "marks {{the birth}} of a new era. My spoken words are registered in the ether, in the Spirit of God, and they shall move the West.... Self-Realization has come to unite all religions.... <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> on [...] not only those who are here, but thousands of youths must go North, South, East and West to cover the earth with little colonies, demonstrating that simplicity of living plus high thinking lead to the greatest happiness!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Since a chord may be {{understood}} as such even when all its notes are not simultaneously audible, {{there has been some}} academic discussion regarding the point at which a group of notes may be called a chord. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990, p.218) explains that, [...] "We can encounter 'pure chords' in a musical work," [...] such as in the Promenade of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition but, [...] "Often, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> from a textual given to a more abstract representation of the chords being used," [...] as in Claude Debussy's Première Arabesque.|$|E
2500|$|Motoring author L. J. K. Setright commented that, [...] "the {{simplest}} way {{to define a}} motorcycle is as a bicycle propelled by a heat engine; and if we accept this <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> on to admit that its prototype is unidentifiable, shrouded in the mists of industrial antiquity." [...] Both the Michaux-Perreaux and Roper machines have been assigned years of origin of 1867, 1868, and 1869 by different authorities, and which combination of these three years {{is given to the}} two steam motorcycles determines whether it was a tie, or whether one can be called the first.|$|E
6000|$|... "Haul in {{the main}} sheet," [...] Hawkins said quietly, and the men {{stationed}} there hauled on the rope until he said, [...] "That will do, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> not <b>go</b> too fast." ...|$|R

2500|$|Before reciting kiddush, the challah, {{which will}} be the next food item eaten in honor of the Shabbat or holiday, is first covered with a cloth. According to Halakha, the blessing over bread takes {{precedence}} to the blessing over wine. However, in the interests of beginning the meal with kiddush, the challah is covered to [...] "remove" [...] it from the table (some do not have the challah on the table at all during kiddush). Some interpret the covering of the challah allegorically, explaining that if we are supposed to go out of our way to protect even an inanimate object (the bread) from being [...] "insulted" [...] (by the blessing over wine taking precedence), then certainly <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> out of our way to display sensitivity toward the feelings of other people.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your {{father can}} be free within this week. He {{does not know}} it; <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> to him from here, to tell him of it. Your father will be free within a few days.

6000|$|... "By all means, sonny my boy! We will advance. But {{with common}} sense. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> never <b>go</b> {{so far that}} we can't {{get back to our}} base. Above all, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> never, unless it is life or death, fire off our guns." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, but, papa--dear papa, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>go.</b> The city missionary {{could never}} say how very, very sorry I am {{that he should}} have broken his leg while helping me.

5000|$|According to Anne Vallely: Jainism {{is not a}} {{religion}} of coming down. In Jainism it is <b>we</b> who <b>must</b> <b>go</b> up. <b>We</b> only have to help ourselves. In Jainism we have to become God. That is the only thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} too, Nelly, {{if we can}} manage {{to do it without}} leaving a track. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> not <b>go</b> much further, for the trees are getting thinner ahead and we should be seen by the canoes." ...|$|R
60|$|Lastly, Saumarez said <b>we</b> <b>must</b> all <b>go</b> home or the Station {{would come}} out to look for us, and WOULD I {{be good enough to}} ride home with Maud Copleigh? Nothing would give me greater pleasure, I said.|$|R
60|$|But <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>go</b> back, {{and see how}} Mr Lynch {{had managed}} to get up, and pass his morning.|$|E

6000|$|... "So now," [...] Chung continued, [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>go.</b> <b>We</b> <b>must</b> both <b>go</b> {{back to the}} house.

60|$|Thus {{suddenly}} aroused, and in {{the intense}} darkness which had been dispelled {{only long enough to}} dazzle a fellow's eyes, the gunners {{had not been able to}} take accurate aim, otherwise <b>we</b> <b>must</b> have <b>gone</b> to the bottom like a stone.|$|R
