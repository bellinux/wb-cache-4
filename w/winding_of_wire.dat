40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} Swedish manufacturers <b>of</b> insulated <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> and the market forces surrounding the industry between 1945 and 1980. As part of the chain <b>of</b> subcontractors, the <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> industry was linked to all three major electro-technical manufacturers of the time, ASEA, Electrolux and LM Ericsson. The Wallenberg Group’s initiatives to create boundaries for what the manufacturers were to produce also came to influence manufacturers <b>of</b> <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> and their subsequent focus on high- and low voltage current products and systems respectively. Increasing sales of electro-technical products that became the norm in industry {{as well as in}} private homes after 1945 to a great extent created the demand for winding wire. In response to an increasing demand for winding wire Ernst Dahrén developed the family company in Jonslund, a predominantly rural area that lacked job opportunities. The specialisation <b>of</b> <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> manufacturing enabled the company to carefully select loyal employees who accepted lower wages and were willing to work in three shifts, thereby creating a competitive advantage for the company. Product pricing was governed by the prices of copper and aluminium as well as costs and discounts for the rod wire used in the production <b>of</b> <b>winding</b> <b>wire.</b> Together with Ernst Dahrén’s entrepreneurial and patriarchal leadership style which highly influenced the company culture, the family’s tendency to re-invest profits became an important foundation for the company’s autonomy and expansion until its acquisition by the ASEA in 1973...|$|R

50|$|A bifilar coil is an {{electromagnetic}} coil that contains two closely spaced, parallel windings. In engineering, the word bifilar describes wire {{which is made}} of two filaments or strands.

50|$|Even if {{the demands}} for low {{tolerances}} <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> and the winding space had to be observed with correspondingly high technical effort, there would still remain the problem that the wire guiding on the machine side has to follow the previously described winding design also at high winding speeds. In practice, this is hardly possible at high winding speeds since, e.g., at 18.000 windings per minute, the wire guide for a wire with a thickness of 0.3 mm would need to perform a winding pitch in only 0.7 ms. The problem is amplified {{by the fact that}} in practice the ideal wire is never absolutely straight. These unevennesses and bends resulting from the <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> on delivery rolls have the effect that the wires are never completely close together according to their actual diameter but at a distance according to their unevenness.|$|R

30|$|One problem <b>of</b> this <b>wire</b> driven {{mechanism}} with right-angle type is that, as {{the output}} pulley rotates {{the point of}} separation <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> on the input pulley moves up and down because <b>of</b> the <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> as shown in Fig. 11. This motion changes the path length <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> and adds extra tension on the wire. Theoretically speaking in order to solve this problem, an input pulley or an output pulley must have sliding degree of freedom along its axis to absorb {{the up and down}} motion, but this makes the mechanism large and complicated. Therefore, we examined the elongation <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> in right-angle type wired driven mechanism. In Fig. 11, L is the length <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> between the input pulley and the output pulley in the standard posture where theoretically the wire is perpendicular to the input pulley. Now assuming the output pulley rotates θ, and the input pulley rotates ϕ = reduction ratio ×θ. Then the point of separation <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> is moved distance dl = d ×ϕ / 2 π, where d is diameter <b>of</b> the <b>wire.</b> Along with the moving of the point of separation <b>of</b> the <b>wire,</b> the length <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> between the input pulley and the output pulley is changed to L'. This new wire length L' can be expressed as √(dl^ 2 + L^ 2). As a result, wire elongation L'-L can be calculated. Since Axis 2 has larger reduction ratio of 8.46 than Axis 3 we will check elongation of Axis 2. Considering L is 40  mm and output pulley rotates ± 90 °, estimated elongation L'-L is only 0.06  mm. Thus we consider this elongation is sufficiently tolerable and does not need a complicated mechanism.|$|R

5000|$|Halfwound strings, ground wound strings, or {{pressure}} wound strings are a {{cross between}} roundwound and flatwound.

5000|$|When an {{external}} magnetizing field through {{a piece of}} ferromagnetic material is changed, for example by moving a magnet toward or away from an iron bar, the magnetization of the material changes {{in a series of}} discontinuous changes, causing [...] "jumps" [...] in the magnetic flux through the iron.

40|$|A radial heteropolar {{magnetic}} bearing capable of operating at a temperature {{as high as}} 1, 000 F (= 540 C) has been developed. This is a prototype of bearings for use in gas turbine engines operating at temperatures and speeds much higher than can be withstood by lubricated rolling-element bearings. It is possible to increase the maximum allowable operating temperatures and speeds of rolling-element bearings by use of cooling-air systems, sophisticated lubrication systems, and rotor-vibration- damping systems that are subsystems of the lubrication systems, but such systems and subsystems are troublesome. In contrast, a properly designed radial {{magnetic bearing}} can suspend a rotor without contact, and, hence, without need for lubrication or for cooling. Moreover, a magnetic bearing {{eliminates the need for}} a separate damping system, inasmuch as a damping function is typically {{an integral part of the}} design of the control system of a magnetic bearing. The present high-temperature radial heteropolar magnetic bearing has a unique combination of four features that contribute to its suitability for the intended application: 1. The wires in its electromagnet coils are covered with an insulating material that does not undergo dielectric breakdown at high temperature and is pliable enough to enable the <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wires</b> to small radii. 2. The processes used in <b>winding</b> and potting <b>of</b> the coils yields a packing factor close to 0. 7. a relatively high value that helps in maximizing the magnetic fields generated by the coils for a given supplied current.

Issues related to data size reduction and collection of the data set needed to properly train the learner are discussed, and the performance of the proposed method is compared against the standard visual servoing algorithm used for training the GMM.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} novel {{homogenization}} methods {{for the inclusion}} of skin and proximity effect in windings in finite-element (FE) models of electromagnetic devices. A general frequency-domain approach and its original extension to the time domain are proposed. In a preprocessing step the conductors (i. e. type of cross-section and packing, and fill factor) are characterized in the frequency domain by means of a reduced FE model, producing six dimensionless and frequency-dependent skin- and proximity-effect coefficients. The latter coefficients are readily taken into account in a frequency-domain FE analysis of a complete device. A time-domain FE analysis with homogenized winding requires the introduction of additional unknowns and equations; this extension to the time domain is analogous to the approximation of a frequency-dependent inductive impedance by a ladder circuit consisting of constant resistances and inductances. By way of illustration and validation, the homogenization methods are applied to a 2 D FE model of an inductor.

50|$|In 1800 Alessandro Volta {{invented the}} voltaic pile, {{allowing}} for a continuous current of electricity for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current {{that could be used}} to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an electrostatic machine, which with Leyden jars were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity. Another very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the German physician, anatomist and inventor Samuel Thomas von Sömmering in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish polymath and scientist Francisco Salva Campillo. Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von Sömmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each digit of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message. This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return). Hans Christian Ørsted discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field which will deflect a compass needle. In the same year Johann Schweigger invented the galvanometer, with a coil <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current. In 1821, André-Marie Ampère suggested that telegraphy could be done by a system of galvanometers, with one wire per galvanometer to indicate each letter, and said he had experimented successfully with such a system. In 1824, Peter Barlow said that such a system only worked to a distance of about 200 ft, and so was impractical. In 1825 William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet, with a single <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> uninsulated <b>wire</b> on a piece of varnished iron, which increased the magnetic force produced by electric current. Joseph Henry improved it in 1828 by placing several windings <b>of</b> insulated <b>wire</b> around the bar, creating a much more powerful electromagnet which could operate a telegraph through the high resistance <b>of</b> long telegraph <b>wires.</b> During his tenure at The Albany Academy from 1826 to 1832, Henry first demonstrated the theory of the 'magnetic telegraph' by ringing a bell through a mile <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> strung around the room. In 1835 Joseph Henry and Edward Davy invented the critical electrical relay. Davy's relay used a magnetic needle which dipped into a mercury contact when an electric current passed through the surrounding coil. This allowed a weak current to switch a larger current to operate a powerful local electromagnet over very long distances. Davy demonstrated his telegraph system in Regent's Park in 1837 and was granted a patent on 4 July 1838. He also developed an electric relay.|$|R
40|$|Changes <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> quality {{from one}} end <b>of</b> a <b>wire</b> web in a multi wire saw to the other are {{investigated}} by several methods: wire tension measurements in the wire saw, wire elongation during an industrial process and tensile tests <b>of</b> representative <b>wires.</b> Two mechanisms for the loss <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> tension are identified. First, the decrease <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> diameter causes a slow loss <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> tension along the whole wire web. Second, plastic deformation leads to a fast decrease <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> tension within the first few centimeters <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> web. Both effects are confirmed by modeling and calculations...|$|R
