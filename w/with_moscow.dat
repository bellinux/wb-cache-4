5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania became {{increasingly}} interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially {{to gain control}} of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely Lutheran, traditionally ruled by the Brothers of the Sword knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania on a collision course <b>with</b> <b>Moscow</b> and other regional powers, which had also attempted expansion in that area.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the breed in Russia increased after the early 1990s, <b>with</b> <b>Moscow</b> dog shows since that time annually including between 120 and 131 Russian Spaniels, which qualifies the breed {{as one of the}} most popular, along with the Irish Setter. In 2002, the Russian Spaniel Club was set up in the United States to increase the knowledge of the breed outside Russia and to enable owners to register their dogs.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund II's childlessness added {{urgency to}} the idea of turning the {{personal}} union between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into a more permanent and tighter relationship; it was also a priority for the execution movement. Lithuania's laws were codified and reforms enacted in 1529, 1557, 1565–1566 and 1588, gradually making its social, legal and economic system similar to that of Poland, with the expanding role of the middle and lower nobility. Fighting wars <b>with</b> <b>Moscow</b> under Ivan IV and the threat perceived from that direction provided additional motivation for the real union for both Poland and Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Treaty of Kraków of 1525, Albrecht (Albert) of Hohenzollern planned a Polish–Lithuanian fief in Livonia, seeking a {{dominant}} position {{for his brother}} Wilhelm, the Archbishop of Riga. What happened instead was {{the establishment of a}} Livonian pro-Polish–Lithuanian party or faction. Internal fighting in Livonia took place when the Grand Master of the Brothers concluded a treaty <b>with</b> <b>Moscow</b> in 1554, declaring his state's neutrality regarding the Russian–Lithuanian conflict. Supported by Albrecht and the magnates, Sigismund II declared a war on the Order. Grand Master Wilhelm von Fürstenberg accepted the Polish–Lithuanian conditions without a fight, and according to the 1557 Treaty of Pozvol, a military alliance obliged the Livonian state to support Lithuania against Moscow.|$|E
