5|$|In 2002 Boris Nemtsov, former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia who {{was then}} an elected member of the State Duma {{and leader of the}} Union of Rightist Forces, paid a visit to Bukovsky in Cambridge. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the {{strategy}} of the Russian opposition. It was imperative, Bukovsky told Nemtsov, that Russian liberals adopt an uncompromising stand toward what he saw as the authoritarian government of President Vladimir Putin.|$|E
5|$|The {{visit was}} largely {{ceremonial}} and mainly focused on mutual praise rather than specific policy planning and negotiations. Diệm {{stayed in the}} capital for four days, meeting with Eisenhower and high-ranking members of the State Department on the last of these days. However, the meeting with Dulles turned into a farce after the Secretary of State and his subordinates decided to visit Diệm at Blair House. Diệm, notorious for monologues that often lasted {{for up to six}} hours, talked endlessly and as a result the American diplomats were unable to raise whatever issues they had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1976, Bakshi {{learned that}} John Boorman was {{contracted}} to direct {{an adaptation of}} The Lord of the Rings, in which J. R. R. Tolkien's three-volume novel would be condensed into a single film. Bakshi arranged a meeting with Mike Medavoy, United Artists' head of production, who agreed to let Bakshi direct {{in exchange for the}} $3 million that had been spent on Boorman's screenplay. Down the hall from Medavoy was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Dan Melnick, who interrupted a meeting with Peter Bogdanovich when he learned that Bakshi <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> acquiring the rights to The Lord of the Rings. Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote a check to cover MGM's debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget for the first of what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two. Before production began, Bakshi and Zaentz insisted that the Tolkien estate receive residuals from the film.|$|E

5|$|The {{financial}} drain of the Imjin War in Korea {{against the}} Japanese {{was one of}} the many problems – fiscal or other – facing Ming China during the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1572–1620). In the beginning of his reign, Wanli surrounded himself with able advisors and made a conscientious effort to handle state affairs. His Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng (1572–82) built up an effective network of alliances with senior officials. However, there was no one after him skilled enough to maintain the stability of these alliances; officials soon banded together in opposing political factions. Over time Wanli grew tired of court affairs and frequent political quarreling amongst his ministers, preferring to stay behind the walls of the Forbidden City and out of his officials' sight. Scholar-officials lost prominence in administration as eunuchs became intermediaries between the aloof emperor and his officials; any senior official who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his demands or message relayed to the emperor.|$|E

Iraq also attempted to reach the U.S. through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services.|$|E

Having read the news of the Lavender Hill Mob's actions at the CDC, Kramer <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> such confrontational tactics as ringing the White House with protesters, disrupting congress, and shutting down Wall Street. Kramer told Petrelis he was giving a speech at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center on the upcoming Tuesday night, as a last-minute substitute for the scheduled speaker, writer Nora Ephron. Kramer urged Petrelis to invite everyone he knew.|$|E

25|$|In 1933 the Jewish mayor (Oberbürgermeister) Ludwig Landmann was {{replaced}} by NSDAP member Friedrich Krebs. This led to the firing of all Jewish officials in the city administration and from city organizations. A meeting of Frankfurt traders, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the boycott of Jewish businesses, was broken up and the participants arrested and intimidated. Although the Nazis had originally mocked the city as the Jerusalem am Main because of its high Jewish population, the city adopted a propagandistic nickname, the Stadt des deutschen Handwerks or the city of German craft.|$|E
25|$|Officials aggravated the Wanli Emperor {{about which}} {{of his sons}} should succeed to the throne; he also grew equally disgusted with senior advisors {{constantly}} bickering about how to manage the state. There were rising factions at court and across the intellectual sphere of China stemming from the philosophical debate for or against the teaching of Wang Yangming (1472–1529), the latter of whom rejected some of the orthodox views of Neo-Confucianism. Annoyed by all of this, the Wanli Emperor began neglecting his duties, remaining absent from court audiences to discuss politics, lost interest in studying the Confucian Classics, refused to read petitions and other state papers, and stopped filling the recurrent vacancies of vital upper level administrative posts. Scholar-officials lost prominence in administration as eunuchs became intermediaries between the aloof emperor and his officials; any senior official who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his demands or message relayed to the emperor.|$|E

500|$|In December 1940 Reich {{wrote to}} Albert Einstein {{saying he had}} a {{scientific}} discovery he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss,</b> and, in January 1941, visited Einstein {{at his home in}} Princeton, where they talked for nearly five hours. He told Einstein that he had discovered a [...] "specific biologically effective energy which behaves in many respects differently to all that is known about electromagnetic energy." [...] He said it could be used against disease, and as a weapon [...] "in the fight against the Fascist pestilence". (Einstein had signed a letter to President Roosevelt in August 1939 to warn of the danger of Nazi Germany building an atom bomb, and had urged the United States to establish its own research project.) Einstein agreed that if an object's temperature could be raised without an apparent heating source, as Reich was suggesting, it would be [...] "a bomb." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "No Russian" [...] was {{conceived}} {{during the initial}} brainstorming sessions for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 plot. The developers at Infinity Ward <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> how terrorists operate in the modern era, and sought to create an unimaginable, albeit plausible scenario that the player would feel uncomfortable in. Lead writer Jesse Stern noted that despite the grim subject matter, people instinctively {{want to know what}} it is like to experience these attacks, and cited documentaries about the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Columbine High School massacre as evidence. According to Stern: [...] "These are human beings who perpetrate these acts, so you don't really want to turn a blind eye to it. You want to take it apart and figure out how that happened and what, if anything, can be done to prevent it. Ultimately, our intention was to put you as close as possible to atrocity." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Jackie Battley Gingrich told The Washington Post {{that the}} divorce was a [...] "complete surprise" [...] to her. According to Jackie, in September 1980, Gingrich and their {{children}} visited her {{while she was in}} the hospital, recovering from surgery for cancer, and Gingrich <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the terms of their divorce. Gingrich has disputed that account. Although Gingrich's presidential campaign staff continued to insist in 2011 that his wife requested the divorce, court documents obtained by CNN from Carroll County, Georgia, indicated that Jackie had asked a judge to block the process stating that although [...] "she has adequate and ample grounds for divorce... she does not desire one at this time [...] does not admit that this marriage is irretrievably broken." [...] The daughter of the former Linda May Clay and Wilbur Allen Battley, Jackie Gingrich was a native of Columbus, Georgia.

500|$|On May 27, {{the website}} Talking Points Memo posted a {{handwritten}} letter by Sestak to candidates declaring his intent {{to run for}} Senate. Sestak did not dispute {{the authenticity of the}} letter, but told the press he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the matter with his family before making a formal decision. Sestak told media outlets he realized President Obama wished him not to run against Specter, but that he felt the choice should be with the voters of Pennsylvania rather than the president. Governor Rendell overtly tried to convince him not to run, believing it would damage Sestak's own political future, plus cost the Democratic Party both Sestak's House seat and possibly damage Specter's general election chances. Nevertheless, Sestak formally declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on August 4, 2009, in a speech before a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in his native Delaware County. Shortly after the announcement, Toomey issued a statement welcoming Sestak to the race, describing him as [...] "a consistent liberal who really believes in his values", as compared to Specter, who he called [...] "a career political opportunist who believes in nothing but his own re-election".|$|E

500|$|The {{conflict}} was generally seen locally as outside [...] "meddlers" [...] – state officials, rich [...] "out-of-state bleeding hearts", and historians – interfering with local plans that {{would improve the}} city. Robert P. Turk, director of the Redevelopment Agency, wrote a letter accusing preservationists of dealing in [...] "pure academic nonsense". Frank Scheetz, a Groton local and former submariner, attempted to buy the station {{for use as a}} submarine museum, with plans to berth a decommissioned submarine nearby. The Redevelopment Agency rejected Scheetz's offer, claiming he was a speculator; Scheetz alleged that the city duplicitously changed prices in order to refuse the legitimate offer. (Scheetz later funded the display of the USS Croaker in Groton from 1977 to 1987, and was [...] "instrumental" [...] in bringing the USS Nautilus to permanent display at Submarine Force Library and Museum at the Naval Submarine Base New London in the 1980s.) In September 1973, the City Council voted to allow demolition. Amtrak responded with a letter stating that the company <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the possibility of preservation and would be willing to contribute financially. That year, a number of the same local activists formed the Union Railroad Station Trust, intending to restore the station.|$|E
500|$|Letters between Nicholas and Jefferson {{indicate}} a different series of events. In a letter dated October 4, 1798, Nicholas informed Jefferson {{that he had}} given [...] "a copy of the resolutions you sent me" [...] to Breckinridge, who would introduce them in Kentucky. The letter also indicated {{that this was a}} deviation from the original plan to deliver the draft to a legislator in North Carolina for introduction in the legislature there. Nicholas felt that recipient was too closely associated with Jefferson, risking his being discovered as the resolutions' author. According to Nicholas, Breckinridge <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the draft with Jefferson, but Nicholas advised against the meeting, fearing it could implicate Jefferson. A subsequent letter from Jefferson expressed his approval of Nicholas' actions. Lowell Harrison notes that after Breckinridge left Virginia, his contacts with Jefferson were few until his election to the Senate in 1801. Harrison considered it unlikely that Jefferson was mistaken about a meeting between the two to discuss a matter as important as the resolutions, positing that Jefferson may have met separately with Breckinridge and Nicholas to discuss the resolutions, and that the meeting with Breckinridge was kept secret from Nicholas. Because of the uncertainty surrounding Breckinridge's activities in Virginia in 1798, the extent of his influence on Jefferson's original draft of the resolutions is unknown.|$|E
