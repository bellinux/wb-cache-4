[...] On whether they could return to the series at some point, Bell said, [...] "I can't answer that, but I can say it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{cheating}} to make Mack cry like that only to buy it back—not that we haven't brought characters back from the dead. We want to earn stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite earlier {{comments}} by Carruthers that [...] "Reese never wavered in {{her commitment to}} Bianca" [...] and was not bisexual, Pratt admitted that they were considering on [...] "turning" [...] Reese bisexual. [...] "...if Tamara decided to stay, keeping her on the show as an angry lesbian — with no other lesbian characters on the canvas — <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> insane," [...] said Pratt. [...] "So we thought about making Reese bisexual — kind of an Anne Heche who bounces back and forth — and maybe make her an opportunistic black widow, a real bad girl. And Tamara would have been really great at that. But, ultimately, we decided {{to stick with the}} message." ...|$|E

50|$|Belyakov's rival {{counselor}} Viktor Vladimirov {{estimated that}} in Finland there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> revolution and he supported it by sympathizing with the strikes and writing articles in Pravda about Finland's class exploitation.|$|R

6000|$|... "Guess it's your partner," [...] {{said the}} other man, with a grin. [...] "It seems Jake bought a horse from him; but you'd better go in and see. I decided to pull out {{when one of them}} got an ax. Struck me it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> safer in my shanty." ...|$|E

5000|$|Recollections {{fell from}} me in flakes, in scales. All that {{remained}} of me was all that remains <b>of</b> anyone: a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> iridescence.

6000|$|... "Well, then, we'll just {{go round}} there, and kill two birds with one stone. I ought {{to show off}} my new phaeton to Mr. Wilmington first of all; {{he gave it to}} me.

6000|$|... "I will be faithful, bey. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{you to take}} me.

6000|$|He cursed himself: [...] "Darned fool, what 'd I {{promise to}} go for? I'll {{have to keep}} my promise, or she'll feel hurt. She's a good, decent, affectionate girl, and Dave's a cheap skate, all right. She's got more life to her than Carol has. All my fault, anyway. Why can't I be more cagey, like Calibree and McGanum {{and the rest of}} the doctors? Oh, I am, but Maud's such a {{demanding}} idiot. Deliberately bamboozling me into going up there tonight. Matter of principle: ought not to let her get away with it. I won't go. I'll call her up and tell her I won't go. Me, with Carrie at home, finest little woman in the world, and a messy-minded female like Maud Dyer--no, SIR! Though there's no need of hurting her feelings. I may just drop in for a second, to tell her I can't stay. All my fault anyway; ought never to have started in and jollied Maud along in the old days. If it's my fault, I've got no right to punish Maud. I could just drop in for a second and then pretend I had a country call and beat it. Damn nuisance, though, having to fake up excuses. Lord, why can't the women let you alone? Just because once or twice, seven hundred million years ago, you were a poor fool, why can't they let you forget it? Maud's own fault. I'll stay strictly away. Take Carrie to the movies, and forget Maud. [...] . But it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hot at the movies tonight." ...|$|E

'It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{generosity}} which hardly {{amounts to}} more than justice (although they were purchased) from a recusant usurper to a dear friend--not that I am a usurper exactly; well, from {{a representative of the}} new aristocracy of internationality to a representative of the old aristocracy of exclusiveness.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with Charlie Rose he stated, [...] "I'd say I am {{somewhere in between}} being a libertarian and a liberal. So if I were to vote it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a Gary Johnson versus Mitt Romney decision, I suppose." ...|$|E

5000|$|Milo {{has stuck}} with me for almost nine years now, so I wouldn't exactly feel right about just {{continuing}} to call us the Descendents.

50|$|Jones {{presents}} the argument regarding the collaborative {{nature of the}} project.

5000|$|According to Christopher Sharrett in his 2005 book The Rifleman, “Peckinpah {{apparently}} {{wanted the}} series {{to focus on}} Mark, so that the series <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> bildungsroman, showing, in Peckinpah’s words, Mark’s 'discovery of what it’s all about.' Peckinpah’s vision, which would later show up in his films, was an “... essentialist, reductionist view of a violent world, one beset by the vile appetites of a new technocracy that was opposed by the hopelessly compromised yet relatively moral few. Such a vision … was not acceptable in any form to 1950s commercial television.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Bill Geddie, who {{originally}} served as co-executive producer, {{was the lone}} recurring male persona, sometimes shown as stepping out from behind camera {{to interact with the}} hosts. In an interview with Broadcasting & Cable he stated: [...] "I'm not an on-air personality and I think anybody who's seen me realizes that. But early on, the network thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fun to see there's this guy here in charge, but if you watch the show, you see that generally speaking I'm a side player and I'm basically there to get a laugh." ...|$|E
