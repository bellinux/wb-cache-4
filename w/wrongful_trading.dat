25|$|One {{limitation}} of the unlawful trading provisions is {{that the cause of}} action vests solely in the liquidator or administrator, as a matter of statute, unlike for a misfeasance proceeding. While both kinds of action can be pursued concurrently, a fraudulent or <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> case may not be assigned to a third party. In Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd the company's former directors sought to challenge a <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> claim because the liquidator had sold the right to sue them to a specialist litigation firm, London Wall Claims. The Court of Appeal held that such an assignment contravened the old common law prohibition on champertous causes, or ones which involve a party in litigation for payment when they have no interest. The disadvantage of this approach is that liquidators or administrators may be too cautious to bring claims, when a specialist firm could bring them.|$|E
25|$|The {{liquidator}} will {{normally have}} a duty to ascertain whether any misconduct has been conducted by those in control of the company which has caused prejudice to the general body of creditors. In some legal systems, in appropriate cases, the liquidator may be able to bring an action against errant directors or shadow directors for either <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> or fraudulent trading.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{misfeasance}} provision reflects {{causes of}} action vested in the company, any money recovered under it is held {{so that it}} will go to pay off creditors in their ordinary order of priority. In Re Anglo-Austrian Printing & Publishing Union this meant that a liquidator who had successfully sued directors for £7000 had to give up the funds to a group of debenture holders, who had not yet been paid in full, so there is no discretion to apply the assets in favour of unsecured creditors. A potential benefit is that because the causes of action are vested in the company, they may be assigned to third parties, who may prefer to take the risk and reward of pursuing litigation over the liquidator or administrator. These features are the reverse for money recovered through the statutory based causes of action of fraudulent and <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading.</b>|$|E
40|$|Multilateral {{free trade}} {{has taken on}} {{increasing}} global importance {{with the passage of}} such agreements as the NAFTA, the EU, the GATT, and the recent transformation of the latter into the WTO. The underlying principle of each is progressive trade liberalization in all fields of economic activity, including those which are more prone to protectionist forces such as agriculture, financial services, and foreign direct investment. In aiming to promote progressive trade liberalization, the GATT, the NAFTA and the EU contain rules designed to guard against <b>wrongful</b> <b>trade</b> practices, for example an exporter "dumping" cheap products in a foreign market. This paper critically examines the degree to which these agreements reach their objective, and concludes that although they facilitate the removal of trade restrictions and other barriers, they do not go far enough in a number of specific areas.

40|$|Encouraging {{entrepreneurship}} {{and trade}} by permitting {{free access to}} limited liability is a cornerstone emblem of UK enterprise policy. However, it comes at a price. The abuse of limited liability by dishonest, unscrupulous, incompetent, negligent, and occasionally deranged directors, who drive a company into insolvency – and the potential {{that it has to}} wreak financial havoc upon unsuspecting creditors – is all too well known. Yet, the state’s response to this abuse is not to limit access to limited liability. Instead, it has been, over a number of years, to create a wide-ranging regulatory regime in an effort to crack down on directorial misconduct. The mechanisms employed by the state for this purpose can crudely be split into two camps: ‘private’ and ‘public’ enforcement mechanisms. Those in the former category are powers of an insolvency officeholder under the Insolvency Act 1986, and have the primary effect of compensating creditors for misconduct that they have suffered at the hands of delinquent directors. This thesis turns its focus on <b>wrongful</b> and fraudulent <b>trading.</b> Public enforcement in this context means directors’ disqualification, pursuant to the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. The need for regulation, whether public and private, is shown to arise as a result of moral hazards created by this laissez-faire approach to accessing limited liability. The regulatory regime and limited liability are therefore inextricably linked. With that in mind, the thesis explores how effective these mechanisms are in preventing abuse. Effectiveness here is determined with reference to the original rationale and underpinning objectives of each respective mechanism. The thesis will however not confine itself to a doctrinal analysis of the mechanisms in pursuit of that aim. It will go further and introduce substantial empirical data, so as to understand their operation ‘on the ground’ insofar as is possible. It will be shown that each mechanism suffers its own significant difficulties which are inhibitive of their overall effectiveness. Ultimately the author will express the view that none of the mechanisms discussed appear to be working as intended. The thesis examines the recent reforms to this area following the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, but asserts that in reality {{they are likely to be}} of minimal significance. The final part of the thesis criticises the approach of the state in adopting an ex post facto system of regulation in the first place. It argues it to be misguided and inevitably resigned to at least partial failure because it does not deal with the underlying problem. The thesis therefore comes full circle in its conclusions by proposing for consideration a new, ex ante, alternative that deals with the issues at source: the curtailment of access to limited liability...|$|R
25|$|If {{a company}} {{has gone into}} an {{insolvency}} procedure, administrators or liquidators should aim to realise the greatest amount in assets to distribute to creditors. The effect is to alter orthodox private law rules regarding consideration, creation of security and limited liability. The freedom to contract for any consideration, adequate or not, is curtailed when transactions are made for an undervalue, or whenever it comes after the presentation of a winding up petition. The freedom to contract for any security interest is also restricted, as a company's attempt to give an undue preference to one creditor over another, particularly a floating charge for no new money, or any charge that is not registered, can be unwound. Since the Cork Report's emphasis on increasing director accountability, practitioners may sue directors by summary procedure for breach of duties, especially negligence or conflicts of interest. Moreover, and encroaching on limited liability and separate personality, a specific, insolvency related claim was created in 1986 named <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading,</b> so if a director failed to put a company into an insolvency procedure, and ran up extra debts, when a reasonable director would have, he can be made liable {{to contribute to the}} company's assets. Intentional wrongdoing and fraud is dealt with strictly, but proof of a mens rea is unnecessary in the interest of preventing unjust enrichment of some creditors at others' expense, and to deter wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|Corporate finance {{concerns}} the two money raising options for limited companies. Equity finance involves the traditional method of issuing shares {{to build up}} a company's capital. Shares can contain any rights the company and purchaser wish to contract for, but generally grant the right to participate in dividends after a company earns profits and the right to vote in company affairs. A purchaser of shares is helped to make an informed decision directly by prospectus requirements of full disclosure, and indirectly through restrictions on financial assistance by companies for purchase of their own shares. Debt finance means getting loans, usually {{for the price of a}} fixed annual interest repayment. Sophisticated lenders, such as banks typically contract for a security interest over the assets of a company, so that in the event of default on loan repayments they may seize the company's property directly to satisfy debts. Creditors are also, to some extent, protected by courts' power to set aside unfair transactions before a company goes under, or recoup money from negligent directors engaged in <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading.</b> If a company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, UK insolvency law requires an administrator to attempt a rescue of the company (if the company itself has the assets to pay for this). If rescue proves impossible, a company's life ends when its assets are liquidated, distributed to creditors and the company is struck off the register. If a company becomes insolvent with no assets it can be wound up by a creditor, for a fee (not that common), or more commonly by the tax creditor (HMRC).|$|E
25|$|Over the 20th century, {{reform efforts}} focused on three main issues. The first {{concerned}} setting a fair system of priority among claims of different creditors. This primarily centred upon {{the ability of}} powerful contractual creditors, particularly banks, to agree to take a security interest over a company's property, leaving unsecured creditors without any remaining assets to satisfy their claims. Immediately after Salomon's case and the controversy created {{over the use of}} floating charges, the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897 mandated that preferential creditors (employees, liquidator expenses and taxes at the time) also had priority over the holder of a floating charge (now IA 1986 section 175). In the Enterprise Act 2002 a further major change was to create a ring-fenced fund for all unsecured creditors out of around 20 per cent of the assets subject to a floating charge. At the same time, the priority for taxpayers' claims was abolished. Since then, debate for further reform has shifted to whether the floating charge should be abolished altogether and whether a ring-fenced fund should be taken from fixed security interests. The second major area for reform was to facilitate the rescue of businesses that could still be viable. Following the Cork Report in 1982, the Insolvency Act 1986 created the administration procedure, requiring (on paper) that the managers of insolvent businesses would attempt rescue the company, and would act in all creditors' interests. After the Enterprise Act 2002 this almost wholly replaced the receivership rules by which secured creditors, with a floating charge over all assets, could run an insolvent company without regard to the claims of unsecured creditors. The third area of reform concerned accountability for people who worsened or benefited from insolvencies. As recommended by the Cork Report, the Company Directors' Disqualification Act 1986 meant directors who breached company law duties, or committed fraud could be prevented from working as directors for up to 15 years. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 214 created liability for <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading.</b> If directors failed to start the insolvency procedures when they ought to have known insolvency was inevitable, they would {{have to pay for the}} additional debts run up through prolonged trading. Furthermore, the provisions on fraudulent conveyances were extended, so that any transaction at an undervalue or other preference (without any bad intent) could be avoided, and unwound by an insolvent company.|$|E

2500|$|By contrast, <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> is a {{cause of}} action that arises when {{directors}} have acted negligently. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 214 states that directors (including de facto and shadow directors) are culpable for <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> {{if they continue to}} trade when [...] "at some time before the commencement of the winding up of the company, that person knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid going into insolvent liquidation". To determine whether someone [...] "ought" [...] to have concluded this, a director is judged by the skills one ought to have for their office, and a higher standard if the director has special skills (such as an accountancy qualification). In Re Produce Marketing Consortium Ltd (No 2) two directors presided over the insolvency of a Spanish and Cypriot orange and lemon business. One had experience in bookkeeping. Knox J held that although in small companies procedures and equipment for keeping records will be less than in large companies, under section 214 [...] "certain minimum standards are to be assumed to be attained" [...] like keeping the accounts reasonably accurate. Here the accounts were done late even as debts were mounting. The basic measure of compensation payable by directors for <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> is assessed according to the loss a director creates from the point in time where insolvency was plainly unavoidable. However, the court has the discretion to take into account all appropriate factors. In Re Brian D Pierson (Contractors) Ltd Hazel Williamson QC held that the directors of a golf course business were culpable for <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading,</b> but reduced their contribution by 30 per cent because poor weather had made profitable golf business more difficult than normal.|$|E
2500|$|In practice, {{applications}} for orders {{in respect of}} fraudulent trading are rare {{because of the high}} burden of proof associated with fraud. [...] Usually, even where fraudulent trading is suspected, an application is made with respect to an allegation of [...] "wrongful trading" [...] (or [...] "insolvent trading") where the burden of proof is lower. [...] Where applications are brought for fraudulent trading it is usually because when the trading occurred, the company was not insolvent at that time (insolvency {{at the time of the}} trading is normally a requirement to establish <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading,</b> but not fraudulent trading).|$|E
2500|$|The first director's duty {{under section}} 171 {{is to follow}} the company's constitution, but also only {{exercise}} powers for implied [...] "proper purposes". Prior proper purpose cases often involved directors plundering the company's assets for personal enrichment, or attempting to install mechanisms to frustrate attempted takeovers by outside bidders, such as a poison pill. Such practices are improper, because they go beyond the reason for which directors were delegated their power. The all-important duty of care is found in section 174. Directors must display the care, skill and competence that is reasonable for somebody carrying out {{the functions of the}} office, and if a director has any special qualifications an even higher standard will be expected. However, under section 1157 courts may, if directors are negligent but found to be honest and ought to be excused, relieve directors from paying compensation. The [...] "objective plus subjective" [...] standard was first introduced in the <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> provision from the Insolvency Act 1986, and applied in Re D'Jan of London Ltd. The liquidator sought to recover compensation from Mr D'Jan, who failing to read an insurance policy form, did not disclose he was previously the director of an insolvent company. The policy was void when the company's warehouse burnt down. Hoffmann LJ held Mr D'Jan's failure was negligent, but exercised discretion to relieve liability on the ground that he owned almost all of his small business and had only put his own money at risk. The courts emphasise that they will not judge business decisions unfavourably with the benefit of hindsight, however simple procedural failures of judgment will be vulnerable. Cases under the Company Director Disqualification Act 1986, such as Re Barings plc (No 5) show that directors will also be liable for failing to adequately supervise employees or have effective risk management systems, as where the London directors ignored a warning report about the currency exchange business in Singapore, where a rogue trader caused losses so massive that it brought the whole bank into insolvency.|$|E
2500|$|English law draws a {{distinction}} between a [...] "debt", which is relevant for the cash flow test of insolvency under section 123(1)(e), and a [...] "liability", which becomes relevant for the second [...] "balance sheet" [...] test of insolvency under section 123(2). A debt is a sum due, and its quantity is a monetary sum, easily ascertained by drawing up an account. By contrast a liability {{will need to be}} quantified, as for instance, with a claim for a breach of contract and unliquidated damages. The balance sheet test asks whether [...] "the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities." [...] This, whether total assets are less than liabilities, may also be taken into account for the purpose of the same rules as the cash flow test (a winding up order, administration, and voidable transactions). But it is also the only test used for the purpose of the <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> rules, and director disqualification. These rules potentially impose liability upon directors as a response to creditors being paid. This makes the balance sheet relevant, because if creditors are in fact all paid, the rationale for imposing liability on directors (assuming there is no fraud) drops away. Contingent and prospective liabilities refer to liability of a company that arise when an event takes place (e.g., defined as a contingency under a surety contract) or liabilities that may arise in future (e.g., probable claims by tort victims). The method for computing assets and liabilities depends on accountancy practice. These practices may legitimately vary. However, the law's general requirement is that accounting for assets and liabilities must represent a [...] "true and fair view" [...] of the company's finances. The final approach to insolvency is found under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 183(3), which gives employees a claim for unpaid wages from the National Insurance fund. Mainly for the purpose of certainty of an objectively observable event, for these claims to arise, a company must have entered winding up, a receiver or manager must be appointed, or a voluntary arrangement must have been approved. The main reason employees have access to the National Insurance fund is that they bear significant risk that their wages will not be paid, given their place in the statutory priority queue.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> {{was introduced in}} the Insolvency Act 1986, to complement the concept of fraudulent trading. Unlike fraudulent trading, <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> needs no finding of 'intent to defraud' (which requires a heavy burden of proof). <b>Wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> is therefore a less serious, and more common offence than fraudulent trading.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was thought}} prior to 1997 {{that the amount}} paid by a {{director}} following a <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> claim was simply paid to the liquidator and it became available to swell {{the assets of the}} company generally. In most instances there would have been substantial bank borrowings secured by a debenture and personal guarantees given by the directors. Many directors chose not to fight the claims, reasoning that any amounts paid to company (hence the bank under its mortgage security) via a <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> claim, simply reduced the director’s liability under their personal guarantees. It was therefore irrelevant how the directors repaid the bank. This changed with the Court of Appeal’s decision in 1998 that a claim for wrongful (or fraudulent) trading, is different from a normal 'asset' of the company. [...] In particular, it held that such claim cannot be secured by a debenture. The Court held that the fruits of a claim for <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> are instead held in trust by the liquidation for the general body of unsecured creditors. It then followed that the costs of a <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> action could not be drawn from the company’s assets held by the liquidator, and fell to be paid personally either by the liquidator (which he would not do), or would require a unanimous decision of unsecured creditors. [...] The position has now been clarified with the Enterprise Act 2002 changing the law to allow the costs of <b>wrongful</b> <b>trading</b> actions to be included as a cost of the liquidation. These can be met from the company’s assets.|$|E
