Several things, one of them is {{materials}} for packaging, can affect the sterility of gauze. Parchment paper {{is one of the}} packaging materials for sterilization. The study was done to analyze the sterility of gauze packed <b>with</b> <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> one layer and three layers on the growth of microorganism. Method: This study was an experimental study with a quasi-experimental design. Samples were 60 gauze packed with one layer parchment paper and 60 gauze packed with three layers of parchment paper. The sterility of sterile gauze tested at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the sterility of gauze packed with 1 layer of parchment paper on the growth of microorganisms at 0, 2, 4 weeks (p = 0. 126). No significant difference in the sterility of sterile gauze packed with 3 layers of parchment paper at 0, 2, 4 weeks (p = 0. 675). There was a significant difference in the sterility of sterile gauze packed <b>with</b> <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> 1 layer and 3 layers on the growth of microorganisms (p = 0. 002). Conclusion There is a significant difference of sterile gauze packed <b>with</b> <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> 1 layer and 3 layers against the growth of microorganisms. The sterility of the packaged sterile gauze with a layer of parchment paper is better than the three layers...|$|E
40|$|Teaching {{students}} that have visual disabilities differ from others {{as they need}} other senses to unveil our extremely visual world. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} use specific didactical resources for properly teaching these students. In this work we described a tactical didactical material to teach the Fungi Kingdom topic, an important biological theme that involves diseases and biotechnological contents. The material was constructed <b>with</b> <b>parchment</b> <b>paper</b> and others simple materials that can be produced at school or even home. Its main advantage is the simple preparation and low cost, which allows the construction by anyone about any theme. To identify the effectiveness of this didactical material, we performed an evaluation with blind students, which confirmed its potentiality for using on teaching not only this complex topic but other regarding mycology or other biological themes...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{information}} on sex differences In callitrichid behaviour that includes the animals' performance in food tasks. For example, both reproductive and non-reproductive adult females {{have been found to be}} more successful than adult males in solving food tasks. In this study ten adult male and ten adult female common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), housed individually, were tested with an unfamiliar task that involved the extraction of an embedded food. The task was to open a plastic canister that contained a raisin; the open end was covered <b>with</b> <b>parchment</b> <b>paper.</b> Each marmoset was given 15 trials in three blocks of 5 consecutive days. We measured the latency for each animal to open the lid and get the raisin-by one of five strategies that spontaneously emerged. The females learned the task faster and more efficiently than males; all the females opened the canister on day 1, for instance, in contrast to seven of the males on the same day. Females also progressively decreased the time that they took to open the tube. The final latency on day 15, for instance, was significantly shorter for the females. These results are consistent with relevant literature for callitrichids and cannot be accounted for in terms of differences in mental abilities, strength, hand morphology, or energy requirements. Further investigation is necessary to clarify the reasons for these differences...|$|E

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} {{scholarly}} debate on the exact time and speed of replacement of <b>parchment</b> <b>with</b> <b>paper.</b> There are three different hypotheses {{about the time of}} change: the first one based on Sobolevskij research suggests that <b>paper</b> completely replaced <b>parchment</b> as early as in 14 th century; the second one put forward by Hunter is that parchment was still widely used during the 15 th century; and the third ones dates the change as late as 16 th century. Nowadays it is relatively easier to gather mass evidence on the writing materials using digital catalogues of European manuscripts; this allows to apply quantitative methods on a larger scale studying the process of replacement of <b>parchment</b> by <b>paper</b> on the wider European context. In this paper we present a statistical study based on the data within an electronic catalogue of manuscripts including 823 Bulgarian manuscripts currently stored in Bulgaria. We then extend our study with more than thousand parchment manuscripts from the Delorez’s Codicology, 45 volumes of documents in Dubrovnik archives and over 1000 parchment manuscripts from the Bodleian and British libraries. This study is based on the manuscript dating provided in the catalogues. Our basic conclusion is that while there is rare evidence of any Bulgarian parchment manuscripts dated after 1350, and this is in controversy with manuscript collections from libraries in Central and Western Europe...|$|R
