40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{three-phase}} five legged <b>wound</b> transformer <b>core</b> constructed of two high permeability Si-Fe <b>wound</b> <b>cores</b> and two conventional Si-Fe <b>wound</b> <b>cores.</b> The two large internal <b>wound</b> <b>cores</b> are manufactured of high permeability, grain-oriented electrical steel. The two small outer <b>wound</b> <b>cores</b> are manufactured of conventional, grain-oriented electrical steel. The specific arrangement {{is based on}} experimental evidence concerning the peak flux density non-uniformity of the typical three-phase five legged <b>wound</b> transformer <b>core,</b> constructed of the high magnetization grain-oriented steel. Since the peak flux density of the two outer cores {{is lower than the}} two internal cores, low cost, low permeability, conventional grain-oriented electrical steel can be used for the outer cores.

40|$|The present thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} numerical techniques and methods for the evaluation and minimization of <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> distribution transformer no load losses. The aforementioned numerical techniques are combined with deterministic and stochastic optimization algorithms for the minimization of the manufacturing and the total owing cost of <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> transformers. The no load loss evaluation is achieved by {{the application of a}} new technique that combines the computed peak flux density distribution with the experimentally determined local specific core losses. The computation of the peak flux density distribution is performed by a novel iterative procedure and nonlinear finite element magnetostatic analysis, avoiding in this manner the computationally expensive harmonic and transient analysis. The representation of the <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> material anisotropy is accomplished by a new elliptic anisotropy model specifically developed for wound cores, in contrast with conventional elliptic anisotropy models that have been developed so far which are suitable for stack core transformers. The advantages of the aforementioned technique, in contrast with conventional techniques appearing in the literature, are its accuracy and low computational cost which renders the proposed numerical technique ideal for industry application. Furthermore, a novel technique for the no load loss minimization has been developed. The specific technique is based on the <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> flux density non-uniformity and makes use of multiple grade lamination wound cores which are constructed of two different grades of grain oriented magnetic steel. By applying the multiple grade lamination <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> technique a further reduction of the total owing cost of <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> distribution transformers is achieved.
