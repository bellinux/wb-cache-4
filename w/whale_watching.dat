5|$|An {{estimated}} 13 {{million people}} went <b>whale</b> <b>watching</b> globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic. Rules and {{codes of conduct}} have been created to minimize harassment of the whales. Iceland, Japan and Norway have both whaling and <b>whale</b> <b>watching</b> industries. <b>Whale</b> <b>watching</b> lobbyists {{are concerned that the}} most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, {{will be the first to}} be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas. <b>Whale</b> <b>watching</b> generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. In contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commercial}} whaling does {{still take}} place in Icelandic waters today, dolphins are no longer hunted and <b>whale</b> <b>watching</b> is popular amongst tourists.|$|E

40|$|Most {{data used}} to assess the {{distribution}} and abundance of whales are derived from scientific surveys that are designed carefully to minimize sources of variation and reduce the potential for bias. Gathering data in this fashion tends to be both time consuming and costly. Similar data, however, can be collected from platforms of opportunity, including commercial vessels, ecotourism operations and <b>whale</b> <b>watch</b> vessels. The goal of the current project was to make recommendations for data collection procedures aboard <b>whale</b> <b>watch</b> vessels so that such observations are as comparable as possible to data collected from scientific surveys. To accomplish this goal, a sightings data set was obtained from three <b>whale</b> <b>watch</b> companies on Stellwagen Bank, Massachusetts during summer 2007. Vessel and sightings data were obtained via GPS for the duration of <b>whale</b> <b>watches</b> out of Gloucester and Boston, Massachusetts. Whale sightings data were combined with vessel trackline data to calculate species-specific sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE). These SPUE values were then compared to similar data derived from scientific surveys conducted in the same area. Additionally, sightings data from <b>whale</b> <b>watches</b> from 1994 - 2006 were analyzed for long-term trends in abundance and distribution. Whale watc...|$|R

5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} not the easiest of whales to watch, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long {{distances}} underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the <b>whale,</b> <b>watching</b> is increasingly popular. Sperm whale watchers often use hydrophones {{to listen to the}} clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for sperm <b>whale</b> <b>watching</b> include the town of Kaikoura on New Zealand's South Island, Andenes and Tromsø in Arctic Norway; as well as the Azores, where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore, and Dominica where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.|$|E
40|$|Southern {{resident}} {{killer whales}} seasonally inhabit the Salish Sea waters of British Columbia and Washington and are unique in their feeding behavior. This endangered subpopulation {{is also a}} valued resource {{that has led to}} a large <b>whale</b> <b>watch</b> industry. <b>Whale</b> <b>watch</b> boats are potentially a threat to the orcas’ well being. As a means of assessing alternative ways to view whales, I observed orcas from land, {{on the west side of}} San Juan Island, and from three vessels. Results showed no remarkable difference between platforms in ability to detect whales and behaviors, suggesting that <b>whale</b> <b>watch</b> boats are not the only way to see whales during summer. I also observed patterns in my data, correlating the whales’ movement with tides and currents...|$|R

5|$|Nunavut {{features}} {{a number of}} outdoor adventure activity opportunities {{as a result of}} the territory's vast uninhabited area. Wildlife watching is one particularly popular activity - the territory is home to walrus and belugas, as well as eleven bird sanctuaries housing millions of birds. Muskox are also spread throughout Nunavut, although the territory's tourism authority does not promote 'muskox watching' trips specifically. The territory is also home to a population of polar bears, and trips designed to increase tourists' chances of spotting a polar bear are common. A number of private operators offer wildlife, bird, polar and <b>whale</b> <b>watching</b> tours, in addition to other activities.|$|E

5000|$|Modular Puzzles: Each module is a {{separate}} trick puzzle and stands alone. However, the Trick center can be rearranged to fit inside other puzzles within its set. For example, the Marlin Mischief, Lobster Lubbers, and <b>Whale</b> <b>Watch</b> trick puzzles are a collection of modular puzzles. Each has an outside border that holds its own interior pieces in a single configuration. However, {{if you take the}} center pieces from Marlin Mischief, they can be re-arranged to fit inside Lobster Lubbers (or <b>Whale</b> <b>Watch).</b> Thus if you buy 1 puzzle, you get 1 solution, 2 puzzles, 4 solutions, and 3 puzzles, 9 solutions.|$|R

There are half a dozen small-boat marinas on the Bay side of Point Loma. There is also a commercial dock which services sport fishing cruises as well as seasonal <b>whale</b> <b>watching</b> expeditions. Point Loma hosts the biggest sport fishing fleet in Southern California. The Bay side hosts numerous other businesses related to yachting and fishing, such as marine supply stores, yacht brokerages, boat repair yards, and hotels and motels catering to fishing enthusiasts. Some restaurants and hotels have docks for customers who arrive by boat.|$|E
5|$|Once relentlessly {{hunted for}} their products, whales are now {{protected}} by international law. Some species are attributed {{with high levels}} of intelligence. At the 2012 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, support was reiterated for a cetacean bill of rights, listing cetaceans as non-human persons. The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and are considered functionally extinct by cetologists. The baiji is also considered functionally extinct by the IUCN with, the last sighting in 2004. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Small cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor. <b>Whale</b> <b>watching</b> has become a form of tourism around the world.|$|E

25|$|Several {{species of}} whale can be {{observed}} in the waters near shore, especially during migration in late December and late March, such as gray whale, orca, and humpback whale. Harbor porpoises are also relatively common. Because of this, <b>whale</b> <b>watching</b> is a common tourist attraction along the coast. Tour boats often take passengers on <b>whale</b> <b>watching</b> tours, though it is possible to do so from shore. It is sometimes the case that whale carcasses are beached on Oregon shores. One such beaching, which occurred near Florence in November 1970, was handled by blowing it up using dynamite. This has become the well-known exploding whale incident.|$|E
