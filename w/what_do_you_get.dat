Former England cricketer Derek Pringle has written about Agnew's sense of humour, describing him as [...] "hysterical". The pair toured Sri Lanka together on England B's 1986 tour. Pringle recalls that one hot day when England were in the field, Agnew came in for lunch: [...] "It's ****ing [...] red hot on the field, and when you come off it's ****ing red hot in the dressing-room," [...] Agnew screamed. [...] "Then, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> for lunch, ****ing red hot curry?" ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{story goes}} that {{once in the}} {{twilight}} undergrowth of a forest of nut-bearing trees a number of little purblind creatures wandered, singing for nuts. On some of these purblind creatures the nuts fell heavy and full, extremely indigestible, and were quickly swallowed; on others they fell light, and contained nothing, because the kernel had already been eaten up above, and these light and kernel-less nuts were accompanied by sibilations or laughter. On others again no nuts at all, empty or full, came down. But nuts or no nuts, full nuts or empty nuts, the purblind creatures below went on wandering and singing. A traveller one day stopped one of these creatures whose voice was peculiarly disagreeable, and asked [...] "Why do you sing like this? Is it for pleasure that you do it, or for pain? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> out of it? Is it {{for the sake of}} those up there?

The thief, whoever he is, is not likely to reveal what he knows. So here you have it in a nutshell. Let me go, and don't say a word about having found me here, and I will do the same for you. No one will know that the necklace is not genuine. I shall not mention the subject, and I imagine that you will not. Very well, then. Now, for the alternative. Give me up, give the alarm, and I get--well, whatever they give me. I don't know what it would be, exactly. Something unpleasant. But <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> out of it?

[...] "You did not kill him," [...] went on the other, [...] "and <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> for it? You might have had money from the Rajah, besides the loot of all the Bugis houses, and now you get nothing." [...] "You had better clear out from here," [...] growled Brown, without even looking at him. But Cornelius let himself drop by his side and began to whisper very fast, touching his elbow from time to time. What he had to say made Brown sit up at first, with a curse. He had simply informed him of Dain Waris's armed party down the river. At first Brown saw himself completely sold and betrayed, but a moment's reflection convinced him that there could be no treachery intended. He said nothing, and after a while Cornelius remarked, in a tone of complete indifference, that there was another way out of the river which he knew very well. [...] "A good thing to know, too," [...] said Brown, pricking up his ears; and Cornelius began to talk of what went on in town and repeated all that had been said in council, gossiping in an even undertone at Brown's ear as you talk amongst sleeping men you do not wish to wake. [...] "He thinks he has made me harmless, does he?" [...] mumbled Brown very low. [...] "Yes. He is a fool. A little child. He came here and robbed me," [...] droned on Cornelius, [...] "and he made all the people believe him. But if something happened that they did not believe him any more, where would he be? And the Bugis Dain who is waiting for you down the river there, captain, is the very man who chased you up here when you first came." [...] Brown observed nonchalantly that it would be just as well to avoid him, and with the same detached, musing air Cornelius declared himself acquainted with a backwater broad enough to take Brown's boat past Waris's camp. [...] "You will have to be quiet," [...] he said as an afterthought, [...] "for in one place we pass close behind his camp. Very close. They are camped ashore with their boats hauled up." [...] "Oh, we know how to be as quiet as mice; never fear," [...] said Brown. Cornelius stipulated that in case he were to pilot Brown out, his canoe should be towed. [...] "I'll have to get back quick," [...] he explained.|$|E
