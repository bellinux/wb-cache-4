500|$|The basic {{technique}} for GMAW is quite simple, since the electrode is fed automatically through the torch (head of tip). By contrast, in gas tungsten arc welding, the welder must handle a welding torch {{in one hand}} and a separate filler wire in the other, and in shielded metal arc welding, the operator must frequently chip off slag and change <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes.</b> GMAW requires only that the operator guide the welding gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded. [...] Keeping a consistent contact tip-to-work distance (the stick out distance) is important, because a long stickout distance can cause the electrode to overheat and also wastes shielding gas. Stickout distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications. The orientation of the gun is also importantit should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces; that is, at 45 degrees for a fillet weld and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface. The travel angle, or lead angle, is the angle of the torch with respect to the direction of travel, and it should generally remain approximately vertical. However, the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas usedwith pure inert gases, the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section, while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide.|$|E

5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the <b>weld</b> <b>electrode</b> metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the <b>weld</b> <b>electrode</b> metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given <b>weld</b> <b>electrode</b> diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|R
50|$|The {{resistance}} {{presented to}} the welder is complicated.
