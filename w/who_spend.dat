25|$|Around 1917-1920 social outsiders, the nostalgic loners <b>who</b> <b>spend</b> {{their lives}} in saloons or {{interiors}} with scanty furniture, replaced the earlier fishermen and their families, sailors, and merchants. Here we have a clear connection with the “miserable” trend of the young Picasso, such as his Saltimbanques of the blue period. At the same time, these sad themes are counterbalanced by representations of happy families in various configurations: a mother playing with a smiling child, a family playing with a puppet-theatre, etc. The paintings from his last period gain more light and life, while the artist does not eschew dissonances. Contours dissolve {{on the edges of}} bordering color areas and spot-lighting melts the surfaces of stylized forms.|$|E
25|$|TCKs {{who have}} {{parents or guardians}} {{affiliated}} with the military have varying levels of exposure to local culture. This {{is due to the}} possibility of living on base or off base. TCKs who live off base or who are not closely affiliated with the military (such as contractors) will have higher exposure and cultural shaping, while those <b>who</b> <b>spend</b> the majority of their time on the base will have lower exposure and minimal cultural shaping. Military children who are immersed in local culture from birth tend to show an extremely high level of cultural shaping, and upon relocation they are likely to cling to said culture for years, if not their lifetime. Relocation for these particular TCKs has shown to be particularly marring for them emotionally.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{control and}} {{vaccination}} programs have decreased {{the risk of}} rabies from dogs {{in a number of}} regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk. The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or <b>who</b> <b>spend</b> prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. Only six people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms, and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol.|$|E
