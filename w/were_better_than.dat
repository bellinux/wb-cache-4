5|$|A June 2011 poll {{result from}} Ipsos MORI put Labour 2 {{percentage}} points {{ahead of the}} Conservatives, but Miliband's personal rating was low, being rated as less popular than Iain Duncan Smith at a similar stage in his leadership. The same organisation's polling did find that Miliband's personal ratings in his first full year of leadership <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> David Cameron's during his first full year as Conservative leader in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Metacritic later {{noted that}} Ebert tended {{to give more}} lenient ratings than most critics. His average film rating was 71% if {{translated}} into a percentage, compared to 59% for the site as a whole. 75% of his reviews were positive and 75% of his ratings <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> his colleagues. Although Ebert rarely wrote outright scathing reviews, he {{had a reputation for}} writing memorable ones for the films he really disliked, such as North.|$|E
5|$|My Iron Lung, an EP {{and single}} {{released}} late in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album. It {{was their first}} time working with their future producer Nigel Godrich, then working under Leckie as an audio engineer. It was also Radiohead's first collaboration with artist Stanley Donwood, who has produced all of their artwork since. Promoted through alternative radio stations, My Iron Lungs sales <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> expected, and suggested {{for the first time}} that the band had found a loyal fanbase and were not one-hit wonders.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the example}} of several of his stage colleagues, Gielgud joined tours of {{military}} camps. He gave recitals of prose and poetry, and acted in a triple bill of short plays, including two from Coward's , but he found at first that less highbrow performers like Beatrice Lillie <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> he at entertaining the troops. He returned to filming in 1940, as Disraeli in Thorold Dickinson's The Prime Minister. In this morale-boosting film he portrayed the politician from ages thirty to seventy; this was, in Morley's view, {{the first time he}} seemed at home before the camera. Gielgud made no more films for the next ten years; he turned down the role of Julius Caesar in the 1945 film of Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra with Vivien Leigh. He and Leigh were close friends, and Shaw tried hard to persuade him to play the part, but Gielgud had taken a strong dislike to the director, Gabriel Pascal. Caesar was eventually played by Gielgud's former teacher, Claude Rains.|$|E
5|$|In April 1982, Mandela was {{transferred}} to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they {{believed that they were}} being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island. Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year. He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P. W. Botha. Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health, and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.|$|E
5|$|Now the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had {{to contend}} with a team thought to be disbanded forever: the Original Midnight Express, which {{consisted}} of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a brief run in the AWA. The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis Paul E. Dangerously, in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in Jack Victory as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian Army {{could muster}} 22 divisions, which {{contained}} 1,338 artillery pieces but just 10 AMC 35 tanks. However, the Belgian combat vehicles included 200 T-13 tank destroyers. These {{had an excellent}} 47mm antitank gun and a coaxial FN30 machine gun in a turret. The Belgians also possessed 42 T-15s. They were officially described as armoured cars but were actually fully tracked tanks with a 13.2mm turret machine gun. The standard Belgian anti-tank gun was the 47mm FRC, towed either by trucks or by fully tracked armoured Utilitie B-tractors. One report states that a round from a 47mm gun went straight through a Sd kfz 231 and penetrated the armour of the Panzer IV behind it. These Belgian guns <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the 25mm and 37mm guns of respectively the French and the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} moved westward {{due to a}} {{high pressure}} ridge while undergoing two eyewall replacement cycles: the first was around peak intensity and was completed when the hurricane moved over cooler waters, and the second was a brief cycle shortly after the hurricane began to weaken. The last advisory was issued while the hurricane was west of Mexico, {{but it was not}} until the remnants were west of Los Angeles, California that they finally dissipated. Elida's rapid intensification and unsteady weakening after reaching its peak intensity caused large errors in the intensity forecasting of the hurricane. Although the intensity forecasts were off, the track forecasts <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> usual compared to the ten-year period prior to that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} mainly used {{horses for}} logistical support; they <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> mechanized vehicles at traveling through deep mud and over rough terrain. Horses {{were used for}} reconnaissance and for carrying messengers, as well as pulling artillery, ambulances, and supply wagons. The presence of horses often increased morale among the soldiers at the front, but the animals contributed to disease and poor sanitation in camps, caused by their manure and carcasses. The value of horses, and the increasing difficulty of replacing them, was such that by 1917 some troops {{were told that the}} loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than the loss of a human soldier. Ultimately, the blockade of Germany prevented the Central Powers from importing horses to replace those lost, which contributed to Germany's defeat. By the end of the war, even the well-supplied U.S. Army was short of horses.|$|E

25|$|The {{main source}} of income for the {{community}} was by raising livestock. Most of their wealth was in livestock, vehicles, and shares of stock in corporate enterprises.

Eventually, Brigham Young ordered the community to diminish the financial gap that set them apart from the other communities.|$|E

On most other North Atlantic passenger ships at the time, Third Class accommodations consisted of little more than open dormitories in the forward end of the vessels, in which hundreds of people were confined, often without adequate food or toilet facilities.|$|E

50|$|As part of this, Dawkins emphasises {{the gradual}} nature of evolution.
