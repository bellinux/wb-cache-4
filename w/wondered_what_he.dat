500|$|Cheney {{has said}} {{his time at}} the Pentagon was the most {{rewarding}} period of his public service career, calling it [...] "the one that stands out." [...] In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W. Bush to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled The Peacemakers, which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. [...] "My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war," [...] Cheney said, [...] "and {{it occurred to me}} as I was in the room as I walked in to talk to the President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the accusations}} of {{nepotism}} that greeted his appointment on January 3, 1903, Sifton fast became a well-respected judge. [...] He served as {{chief justice of}} the Northwest Territories until September 16, 1907, when the Supreme Court of Alberta was established, whereupon he headed this new court, sitting in Calgary as the first Chief Justice of Alberta. [...] He was notoriously difficult for barristers to read: he generally heard arguments expressionlessly smoking a cigar, and it was as a judge that he first acquired his long-time nickname of the Sphinx for his inscrutability. [...] In one trial, he sat apparently vigorously taking notes during both sides' lengthy closing arguments and, once they concluded, immediately delivered his judgment. [...] The bewildered lawyers <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had been writing down, since he had obviously made up his mind before closing arguments; once Sifton had left the courtroom, they found their answer in the form of page after page covered with the judge's signature. [...] He rarely recorded his ratio decidendi but, despite this, few of his decisions were overturned on appeal. It has also been argued that his fellow judges had difficulty ruling on appeals from his decisions specifically because he rarely provided reasons. Much of his work was in criminal law, dealing especially with theft of livestock (in which cases he generally delivered a sentence of three years hard labour, severe {{by the standards of the}} day). By the end of his judicial career, he had convicted as many Americans as Canadians. His rulings were generally concerned with practicalities rather than legal theory, based more on social morality than legal precedent, and he did not establish any important precedents.|$|E
