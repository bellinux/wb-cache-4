40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women <b>who</b> {{reported}} <b>having</b> had sex with {{both men and women}} and women <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> had sex with men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both having had sex with a man in the 3 months before and having at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these women, 38 % <b>who</b> reported ever <b>having</b> had sex with a woman were compared with those <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> had sex with men only. RESULTS: Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women were more likely than women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a sex partner <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women had a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women were more likely than women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R
