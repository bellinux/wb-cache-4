5|$|Fielding <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the audience's {{reaction}} to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in {{the actions of the}} character Merital in Love in Several Masques in controlling the behaviour of Helen and that many of his characters believe that they are either actors or are performing on a stage. Also, this is a primary concern of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} studies led Planché to take {{an interest}} in heraldry. He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of Arms, or, Heraldry founded upon facts. As indicated by the subtitle, Planché <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> verifiable facts, as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. In the view of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote the early history of heraldry.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It has been argued that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E

Based on a literature review, this paper aims at structuring the overall discourse by proposing five Open Science schools of thought: The infrastructure school (which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the technological architecture), the public school (which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the accessibility of knowledge creation), the measurement school (which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> alternative impact measurement), the democratic school (which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> access to knowledge) and the pragmatic school (which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> collaborative research) ...|$|R

5|$|Orm <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> priests' {{ability to}} speak the vernacular, and {{developed}} an idiosyncratic spelling system to guide his readers in the pronunciation of the vowels. He used a strict poetic metre to ensure that readers know which syllables are to be stressed. Modern scholars use these two features to reconstruct Middle English as Orm spoke it (Burchfield 1987, p.280).|$|E
5|$|Other scholars, however, {{argue that}} {{hereditary}} illegitimacy is not listed among the indiscretions of the Wicked Priest, {{and that this}} interpretation has been foisted upon the text by decades of questionable interpretation. Collins argues further {{that there is no}} evidence in the Community Rule or the Damascus Document to support the view that the Qumran community <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the legitimacy of a non-Zadokite High Priest.|$|E
5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, geography, and geology.|$|E
5000|$|The theory presupposes {{that states}} <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> {{absolute}} gains, that is, {{states do not}} consider the gains or losses of other states in their utility analysis. In contrast neorealists argue that states <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> relative gains. That <b>is,</b> states <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the advantages they gain versus the advantages of other states in the anarchic system.|$|R

5|$|Waveguide filters were {{developed}} during World War II {{to meet the}} needs of radar and electronic countermeasures, but afterwards soon found civilian applications such as use in microwave links. Much of post-war development <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> reducing the bulk and weight of these filters, first by using new analysis techniques that led to elimination of unnecessary components, then by innovations such as dual-mode cavities and novel materials such as ceramic resonators.|$|E
5|$|Æthelric was carted from {{imprisonment}} to the Trial of Penenden Heath of Odo of Bayeux, earl of Kent. This {{took place}} sometime between 1072 and 1076. At that time, {{he was the}} most prominent legalist in England. He helped clarify Anglo-Saxon land laws, as the trial <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the attempts of Lanfranc to recover lands from Odo. The medieval writer Eadmer also consulted Æthelric for information on Eadmer's Life of St Dunstan.|$|E

This is distinct from shelter in relief, which <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> providing sufficient shelter to maintain life.|$|R
5|$|A week later, Marsh's {{action was}} again under {{scrutiny}} {{when he played}} his second shield match against Victoria in Melbourne. While Richard Callaway—the New South Wales umpire officiating the match—was satisfied with Marsh's bowling action, his Victorian counterpart Bob Crockett <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the twisting of the bowler's wrist. Crockett no-balled Marsh {{three times in the}} match, but was reluctant to elucidate on the reasons for his call. Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively, dismissing Test batsmen Peter McAlister, Warwick Armstrong, Jack Worrall and Frank Laver. Marsh bowled three of his victims.|$|E
5|$|Although McKinley enjoyed {{meeting the}} public, Cortelyou <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> his {{security}} due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe, {{such as the}} assassination of King Umberto I of Italy the previous year, and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President's rescheduled visit to the Exposition. McKinley refused, and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip. On September 5, the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds, before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In his final speech, McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. He intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term.|$|E
5|$|Director Colin Campbell <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the film's realism. He had sets {{constructed}} {{to represent the}} streets of Cairo, Baghdad, and Damascus, and used animals from the Selig Zoo. Scenes set in the Arabian and Sahara Deserts were filmed in the deserts of California. The Arab characters' clothing was genuine, and the actors portraying those roles were required to remain dressed in-character throughout the several days of desert filming to ensure they would appear more natural in the imported garments. Much of the film, including the desert scenes, was hand tinted. Production costs exceeded $35,000, the equivalent of over $ in present-day terms.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} a number of {{technology}} related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media).|$|R

5|$|In 1918 Davies {{sought the}} {{position}} of miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the SWMF. Against strong competition—his main opponent was William Mainwaring, later a long-serving Labour MP for Rhondda East—Davies was victorious by 100 votes. The main role of the agent was to represent miners in disputes with their employers; typically these would involve issues of pay, redundancy, working hours, and compensation for injuries. Davies's surviving day books reveal {{the extent to which}} he <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> cases where the mining companies denied liability for underground injuries.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia {{referred}} to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not {{very different from the}} traditional rational nexus standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon (1990). It held that the impugned Act <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch period {{ended in}} 1662 when Ming loyalist forces of Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) drove out the Dutch and {{established}} the short-lived Zheng family kingdom on Taiwan. The Zhengs brought 70,000 soldiers to Taiwan and immediately began clearing {{large tracts of}} land to support its forces. Despite the preoccupation with fighting the Qing, the Zheng family <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> aboriginal welfare on Taiwan. The Zhengs built alliances, collected taxes and erected aboriginal schools, where Taiwan's aborigines were first introduced to the Confucian Classics and Chinese writing. However, {{the impact of the}} Dutch was deeply ingrained in aboriginal society. In the 19th and 20th centuries, European explorers wrote of being welcomed as kin by the aborigines who thought they were the Dutch, who had promised to return.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, pre-production {{began again}} {{on a film}} with a treatment called Planet of the Titans and subsequent script produced by British writers Chris Bryant and Allan Scott {{with the intention of}} keeping costs down by filming in the United Kingdom. There were difficulties in ensuring that both William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy were signed to the film as Shatner's deal with Paramount had expired and Nimoy <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> unauthorized merchandising. Philip Kaufman was signed up to direct, after several others were asked first. The plot would have seen the crew investigating the homeworld of the mythical Titans, and in escaping through a black hole are hurled into the prehistoric past where they teach early man how to make fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the English Poor Law system {{can be traced back}} to late medieval {{statutes}} dealing with beggars and vagrancy but it was only during the Tudor period that the Poor Law system became codified. Monasteries, the primary source of poor relief, were dissolved by the Tudors Reformation causing poor relief to move from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level. Early legislation <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> vagrants and making the able-bodied work, especially while labour was in short supply following the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|While Kline <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> lighting, print quality, and color, Bonnie Prendergast, {{the script}} supervisor, took notes {{that would be}} written up after the company had {{finished}} for the day. Prendergast's role was to ensure continuity in wardrobe, actor position, and prop placement. Any changes in dialogue or ad-libbed lines were similarly written down. Assistant director Danny McCauley was responsible for collaborating with unit production manager Phil Rawlins to finalize shooting orders and assigning extras. Rawlins, McCauley, production manager Lindsley Parsons Jr., and Katzenberg were all tasked with keeping things moving {{as fast as possible}} and keeping the budget under control; every hour on stage cost the production $4000.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of workers at the Records Department in the Ministry of Truth, doublethink means being able to falsify public records, and then believe in the new history that they {{themselves}} have just rewritten. As revealed in Goldstein's Book, the Ministry's name is itself an example of doublethink: the Ministry of Truth <b>is</b> really <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> lies. The other ministries of Airstrip One are similarly named: the Ministry of Peace <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> war, the Ministry of Love <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> torture, and the Ministry of Plenty <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> starvation. The three slogans of the Party—War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength—are also examples.|$|R
