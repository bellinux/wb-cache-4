40|$|Moral {{dilemmas}} {{involving a}} choice between saving the lives of 1 versus 5 have long been debated through utilitarian (e. g., Bentham, 1789) and deontological theories of moral choice (Kant, 1965). According to Greene et al. ’s (2001) dual process moral utilitarian theory, moral involvement predicts utilitarian rationality in decision-making. Accordingly, Greene et al. proposed that emotional activations interfere with cognitive (rational) decision mechanisms. For example, personal involvement in moral scenarios (push a stranger) induces irrationality and decision time in choice. However, more psychological factors (e. g., <b>utility</b> <b>ratios)</b> {{have been found to}} predict rationality in personal dilemmas (Nakamura, 2012). Furthermore, theorists (Kusev et al. 2016) argued that elimination of moral uncertainty also predicts utilitarian responses. In one experiment we aimed to explore how (and whether) <b>utility</b> <b>ratios,</b> uncertainty, type of dilemma and involvement predict moral utilitarian choice. The results revealed that eliminated uncertainty and high <b>utility</b> <b>ratios</b> induced utilitarian (rational) decision preference...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the architecture optimization of a general 3 -PUU translational parallel manipulator (TPM) based on the performance of a weighted sum of global dexterity index and a new performance index-space <b>utility</b> <b>ratio</b> (SUR). Both the inverse kinematics and forward kinematics solutions are derived in closed form, and the Jacobian matrix is derived analytically. The manipulator workspace is generated by a numerical searching method with the physical constraints taken into consideration. Simulation results illustrate clearly the necessity to introduce a mixed performance index using space <b>utility</b> <b>ratio</b> for architectural optimization of the manipulator, and the optimization procedure is carried out with the goal of reaching a compromise between the two indices. The analytical results are helpful in designing a general 3 -PUU TPM, and the proposed design methodology can also be applied to architectural optimization for other types of parallel manipulators.

The computerized search included the main databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library). The studies included used the following quantitative sensory testing (QST) methods: mechanical detection threshold (MDT), mechanical pain threshold (MPT) (pinprick), pressure pain threshold (PPT), dynamic mechanical allodynia with a cotton swab (DMA 1) or a brush (DMA 2), warm detection threshold (WDT), cold detection threshold (CDT), heat pain threshold (HPT), cold pain detection (CPT), and/or wind-up <b>ratio</b> (<b>WUR).</b> The publications meeting the inclusion criteria revealed that only mechanical allodynia tests (DMA 1, DMA 2, and WUR) were significantly higher and pain threshold tests to heat stimulation (HPT) were significantly lower in the affected side, compared with the contralateral side, in AO patients; however, for MDT, MPT, PPT, CDT, and WDT, the results were not significant. These data support the presence of central sensitization features, such as allodynia and temporal summation. In contrast, considerable inconsistencies between studies were found when AO patients were compared with healthy subjects.

The differential responses of groundnut cultivars to drought are therefore assessed relative to the mean response of all genotypes to drought. S 2048 ince three major aspects of drought, (i. e. duration, intensity, and timing relative to crop phenophases) may vary independently, the main effects of these components on groundnut are described. The timing of drought has a large impact on the variation about the mean response. In general, the sensitivity of a genotype to drought increases with yield potential, increasing the closer the drought ends to final harvest. Genotypic variation in response to drought exists in the water-use <b>ratio</b> (<b>WUR)</b> of genotypes, with some being able to accumulate up to 30 % more shoot dry matter than others with the same total transpiration. Variations also exist {{in the proportion of}} this dry matter that is used for pod growth. Large variations in the response of genotypes to midseason droughts are due to recovery differences after the drought is relieved. In addition, a three-factor interaction of genotype, gypsum, and drought exists because the gypsum may increase early pod development, thus providing escape effects...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{subject of}} debate in cost-utility analysis {{of health care}} programmes is whether to include costs of unrelated medical care in life years gained. The inclusion of such costs {{is likely to be}} of consequence in the case of primary prevention. This paper presents different strategies regarding the inclusion not only of the costs, but also of the health effects of unrelated medical care in economic evaluations. Four different cost-utility ratios are presented and related to the criterion of internal consistency. In addition, the possibility to relate the ratios to a well-posed decision problem is analysed. An example computes the different ratios for smoking cessation interventions in different age groups. Including health care costs of unrelated medical care in life years gained increases cost <b>utility</b> <b>ratios,</b> but excluding unrelated medical costs favours smoking cessation interventions targeted at older smokers over those at younger smokers. We conclude that for primary prevention only a cost <b>utility</b> <b>ratio</b> that includes both the costs and effects of unrelated medical care meets the criterion of internal consistency and is related to a meaningful decision problem. Therefore, this type of cost-utility ratio should be preferred even if the data requirements may be substantial. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

IR values for the WUAs varied between 48 and 89 % each year, averaging 77 % in 2004 and 76 % in 2005. WUR values for the selected WUAs varied from month to month each year, with seasonal average values close to or greater than 1. NDVI ave values for all WUAs were higher in 2004 (0. 32 as against 0. 42). CV NDVI values for 2004 varied between 0. 14 and 0. 23 and for 2005 between 0. 14 and 0. 30. The IR indicator showed that a WUA located at the end of a main canal which served more than one WUA did not receive adequate water.

Methods 206 Adults who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for hip or knee osteoarthritis were included in an economic evaluation from the perspectives of the New Zealand health system and society alongside a randomized controlled trial. Resource use was collected using the Osteoarthritis Costs and Consequences Questionnaire. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the Short Form 6 D. Willingness-to-pay threshold values were based on one to three times New Zealand's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of NZ$ 29, 149 (in 2009). ResultsAll three treatment programmes resulted in incremental QALY gains relative to usual care. From the perspective of the New Zealand health system, exercise therapy was the only treatment to result in an incremental cost <b>utility</b> <b>ratio</b> under one time GDP per capita at NZ$ 26, 400 (−$ 34, 081 to $ 103, 899). From the societal perspective manual therapy was cost saving relative to usual care for most scenarios studied. Exercise therapy resulted in incremental cost <b>utility</b> <b>ratios</b> regarded as cost effective but was not cost saving. For most scenarios combined therapy was not as cost effective as the two therapies alone.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: This study {{proposed}} two utility accrual {{real time}} scheduling algorithms named as Preemptive Utility Accrual Scheduling (PUAS) and Non-preemptive Utility Accrual Scheduling (NUAS) algorithms. These algorithms addressed the unnecessary abortion problem that was {{identified in the}} existing algorithm known as General Utility Scheduling (GUS). It is observed that GUS is inefficient for independent task model because it simply aborts any task that currently executing a resource with lower utility when a new task with higher utility requests the resource. The scheduling optimality criteria are based on maximizing accrued utility accumulated from execution of all tasks in the system. These criteria are named as Utility Accrual (UA). The UA scheduling algorithms are design for adaptive real time system environment where deadline misses are tolerable {{and do not have}} great consequences to the system. Approach: We eliminated the scheduling decision to abort a task in GUS and proposed to preempt a task instead of being aborted if the task is preemptive able. We compared the performances of these algorithms by using discrete event simulation. Results: The proposed PUAS algorithm achieved the highest accrued utility for the entire load range. This is followed by the NUAS and GUS algorithms. Conclusion: Simulation results revealed that the proposed algorithms were more efficient than the existing algorithm, producing with higher accrued <b>utility</b> <b>ratio</b> and less abortion ratio making it more suitable and efficient for real time application domain.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the cost effectiveness of physiotherapy, manual therapy, and care by a general practitioner {{for patients with}} neck pain. DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: 183 patients with neck pain {{for at least two}} weeks recruited by 42 general practitioners and randomly allocated to manual therapy (n= 60, spinal mobilisation), physiotherapy (n= 59, mainly exercise), or general practitioner care (n= 64, counselling, education, and drugs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical outcomes were perceived recovery, intensity of pain, functional disability, and quality of life. Direct and indirect costs were measured by means of cost diaries that were kept by patients for one year. Differences in mean costs between groups, cost effectiveness, and cost <b>utility</b> <b>ratios</b> were evaluated by applying non-parametric bootstrapping techniques. RESULTS: The manual therapy group showed a faster improvement than the physiotherapy group and the general practitioner care group up to 26 weeks, but differences were negligible by follow up at 52 weeks. The total costs of manual therapy (447 euro; 273 pounds sterling; 402 dollars) were around one third of the costs of physiotherapy (1297 euro) and general practitioner care (1379 euro). These differences were significant: P < 0. 01 for manual therapy versus physiotherapy and manual therapy versus general practitioner care and P= 0. 55 for general practitioner care versus physiotherapy. The cost effectiveness ratios and the cost <b>utility</b> <b>ratios</b> showed that manual therapy was less costly and more effective than physiotherapy or general practitioner care.
