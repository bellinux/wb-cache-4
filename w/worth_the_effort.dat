5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> it takes to wait.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{when the}} {{children}} {{were told that they}} could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite removal of the threat of severe punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|E
500|$|Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler joined Tony Iommi and Cozy Powell {{in autumn}} of 1990 to begin {{working on the}} next Black Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell {{suffered}} a broken hip when his horse died, falling on the drummer's legs. Unable to complete work on the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, reuniting the Mob Rules era line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack. The year-long recording process was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Some songs were re-written multiple times. [...] "Dehumanizer took a long time, it was just hard work", Iommi said. [...] "We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous". Dio later recalled the album as difficult, but <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort.</b> [...] "It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works", he said. [...] "Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you end up making the Christmas album".|$|E

500|$|Sunset Studies {{critical}} reception, however, {{was very}} positive; Noel Mengel of The Courier-Mail {{said that on}} the album, [...] "songs of quiet reflection, starkly beautiful melodies and intimate poetry collide on the canvas without a thought to sales graphs or what radio program directors might think", while Allmusic's Jack Rabid told American readers [...] "it's <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to track down , particularly for those who think {{there are no more}} musical craftsmen out there". The album's production earned it the 2001 ARIA Award for Engineer of the Year, as well as nominations for [...] "Producer of the Year", [...] "Breakthrough Artist - Album" [...] and [...] "Best Cover Art". Of the album's six engineers, Paul McKercher, Chris Thompson, Richard Pleasance, and Chris Dickie were credited with the ARIA Award for best engineer. McKercher and Pleasance, as well as the band, were named producers.

500|$|Burnside {{gained a}} public library with a {{collection}} of 7,800 books in 1961 after it was first suggested in February 1959; the cost of establishing a library for the residents was more affordable since the Libraries Act 1955 had been passed. The Burnside Swimming Centre opened in 1966; the swimming centre was a pet project of then-Mayor George Bolton, who had a grand vision of what he wanted Hazelwood Park, where the centre was to be located, to become. Bolton met unprecedented public opposition in 1964 when the idea was first unveiled. The substantial elderly population of Burnside (15%) was wholly opposed to the idea, suggesting the influx of troublemakers and noise was hardly <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort.</b> The cost was estimated at £75,000 (£ as of [...] ). While architects were resigning over the scale of the proposed development and a number of residents were up in arms, the Adelaide newspapers had a ball; cartoonists throughout 1964 spent many of their daily cartoons covering the debacle. With the failure of a poll to decide the fate of the idea on 24 March the Sunday Mail published the headline [...] "Burnside Says NO to Swim Pool". Mayor Bolton was not dismayed by the result; he pushed ahead with his idea and announced new plans in December. After a strong public campaign and minor changes to the project a poll in February 1965 voted strongly in favour of the idea. The Mayor had won his battle and it was named the George Bolton Swimming Centre in his honour upon opening.|$|E

40|$|Negotiators in Geneva {{are still}} {{struggling}} to conclude the Doha Round of multilateral trade talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, {{after seven years of}} negotiations, many people - and especially many industrialists in Europe and the United States - are not convinced that <b>the</b> negotiations are <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> being put into them. These doubts have been fueled by the modesty of recent estimates of the gains on the table in the negotiations on Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA). This policy brief argues that a completed Doha Round has more to offer to the U. S. and European private sector than cuts to already low applied industrial tariffs. The real gold mine in the Doha negotiations is the increased certainty that would flow from large cuts to bound tariff rates...|$|R

In this excerpt, Lee Devin takes the dreamer’s view. He pushes us to envision what could be and to confront the perils of rushing headlong in the name of productivity. His contribution reads in one breath, his style and examples being quite different from what we are used to. But I caution you not to make the mistake of dismissing his analysis as utopia. While Lee takes a “big picture” approach and challenges us considerably, he also shows a path to truly develop an innovative frame of mind. The challenge he issues is certainly not an easy one to meet, particularly given our backgrounds and training, but the rewards {{have been shown to be}} <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>efforts...</b>|$|R

I argue that Sorensen’s model, though on the right track, is mistaken in three ways. First, it fails to capture the relevance of counterfactual effort to moral worth. Second, it wrongly implies that exerting unnecessary effort confers moral worth on an action. Third, it fails to adequately distinguish between cases in which effort is required because of defects of moral character and those in which effort is required because of barriers external to moral character, such as social pressures or non-moral cognitive deficits. I suggest three amendments to Sorensen’s model that correct these three defects...|$|R

Palmer played what he himself called the four best rounds of his career, shooting 71-69-67-69. His scores had the English excitedly claiming that Palmer may well be the greatest golfer ever to play the game. British fans were excited about Palmer's playing in the Open. Although he failed to win, losing out to Kel Nagle by a single shot, his subsequent Open wins in the early 1960s convinced many American pros that a trip to Britain would be <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort,</b> and certainly secured Palmer's popularity among British and European fans, not just American ones.|$|E
2500|$|By {{now having}} become a locally known comics {{collector}} and cartoonist, Rosa accepted {{an offer from}} {{the editor of the}} local newspaper to create a weekly comic strip. This led to his creation of the comic strip character Captain Kentucky for the Saturday edition of the local newspaper Louisville Times. Captain Kentucky was the superhero alter ego of Lancelot Pertwillaby. The pay was $25/week and not worth the 12+ hours each week's strip entailed, but Rosa did it as part of his hobby. Publication started on October 6, 1979. The comic strip ended on August 15, 1982 after the publication of 150 episodes.
