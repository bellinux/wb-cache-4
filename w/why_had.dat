5|$|Bessell, {{anxious to}} be of service to his party's highest-profile figure, flew to Dublin in April 1965. He found that Josiffe was being advised by a {{sympathetic}} Jesuit priest, Father Sweetman, who believed {{that at least some}} of Josiffe's allegations might be true; otherwise, he asked Bessell, <b>why</b> <b>had</b> he flown all the way from London to deal with them? Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure, but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the missing luggage and insurance card. He also hinted at the possibility of an equestrian job in America. Bessell's intervention appeared to contain the problem, particularly as Josiffe's suitcase was recovered shortly afterwardsâ€”although, according to Josiffe, letters implicating Thorpe had been removed. For most of the following two years Josiffe remained largely quiescent in Ireland, attempting to establish himself in various careers; part of this time was spent in a monastery. It was during this period that he formally adopted the name of Scott.|$|E
25|$|Warringah Council {{was formed}} in 1906, giving Dee Why {{residents}} a local government. In 1911 {{it was decided that}} the tram line that had expanded in sections from Manly since 1903 was to be extended from Brookvale on to Collaroy Beach via Pittwater Road, and soon after to Narrabeen. The line opened on 3 August 1912 with an hourly service, and it was perhaps this development that caused the Salvation Army in 1913 to progressively sell off most of its holdings on the Northern Beaches, starting with The Oaks Estate Auction, which gave its name to one of the main streets of Dee Why, Oaks Avenue. Another main street, Howard Avenue, commemorates Commissioner Thomas Howard, the first commissioner of the Salvation Army in Australia and New Zealand. By 1920, most of Dee <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> been subdivided. From the end of 1938, the trams, as a result of losses due to low population density and competition with new bus routes that duplicated their services, operated only at peak hours for commuters and on weekends for tourists, and finally ceased operating with the final run on 30 September 1939.|$|E
500|$|During the 12 {{days that}} {{he watched the}} court-martial proceedings, Thurgood Marshall began to {{formulate}} an appeal campaign. Marshall had noticed {{that none of the}} men's grievances had been aired in court. Directly after the court closed the case, Marshall sent a letter to Secretary Forrestal asking why only blacks were assigned the task of loading munitions; <b>why</b> <b>had</b> they not been trained for that task; why were they forced to compete for speed; why were they not given survivor's leaves; and <b>why</b> <b>had</b> they not been allowed to rise in rank. Forrestal replied weakly, saying that a predominance of black men were stationed at Port Chicago so of course they would be working there to load munitions. Forrestal pointed out that there was no discrimination because other naval weapons stations were manned by white crews loading munitions. The Navy Secretary said that the men had not been promoted because their time at Port Chicago had been a [...] "trial period", and that they were not given 30-day leaves because he thought it best for men to get quickly back to duty to prevent them from building up mental and emotional barriers.|$|E

The outrage was driven not least by the survivors themselves; even while they were aboard Carpathia on their way to New York, Beesley and other survivors determined to [...] "awaken public opinion to safeguard ocean travel in the future" [...] and wrote a public letter to The Times urging changes to maritime safety laws.|$|E
500|$|In {{his closing}} speech, defence counsel {{said that the}} key to the case was whether the Orsborne {{brothers}} intended to deprive the owners permanently of their vessel. The evidence, he said, was more suggestive of a [...] "joy-ride half-way round the world", than of theft or anything more sinister. Prosecuting counsel argued that if the month's joy-ride was the innocent explanation, <b>why</b> <b>had</b> it been necessary to introduce into the case the unfounded allegations of proposed insurance fraud [...] "against men whose reputations were above suspicion?". In his summing up, the judge condemned the arrangements whereby the Orsbornes were receiving money from the press for the rights to their story. This was unwarranted and undesirable: [...] "Whether the two prisoners be guilty or innocent , the property of someone else was being used by them without permission...George Orsborne clearly knew that he was acting directly against his employer's interests". The jury was out for only 35 minutes before returning guilty verdicts against both defendants. On 22 October George Orsborne was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, and James to 12 months.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial began}} in June 1934 before Justice William Ives with {{three days of}} {{testimony}} from MacMillan. [...] Brownlee's lawyer, Arthur LeRoy Smith, used his cross examination {{to call into question}} almost everything MacMillan said. [...] To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton, he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs, dated before she had even met Brownlee. [...] He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction, which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton, the city had been engulfed in a blizzard. [...] Moreover, the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until {{more than a year after}} that date. [...] In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid's room while staying with the Brownlees, Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee's room. [...] After MacMillan conceded her mistake, Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee's room had a large deadbolt on the door: if she had feared Brownlee, <b>why</b> <b>had</b> she not used it? [...] "Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said," [...] was the plaintiff's response. [...] MacMillan, when questioned, admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932, which she had initially placed at six weeks, was actually only four. [...] When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May, Smith showed that Brownlee had been out of town for all but ten nights of that period.|$|E

500|$|On January 25, 1994, the Chandlers' {{lawsuit was}} {{settled out of}} court with $15,331,250 to be held in a trust fund for Jordan, $1.5 million for each of his parents and the family's lawyer slated to receive $5 million for a total of {{approximately}} $23 million (although another source showed Feldman was to receive $3 million based on a September 1993 retainer, for a total of $21 million). According to a motion passed to Judge Melville in 2004, leading up to the 2005 trial, Evan Chandler himself is the one who initiated the settlement with Jackson's insurer. [...] Jackson's insurance company [...] "negotiated and paid the settlement, over the protests of Mr. Jackson and his personal legal counsel" [...] and was [...] "the source of the settlement amounts"; as noted in a 2005 memorandum in People v. Jackson. It also noted [...] "an insurance carrier has the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements", as established by a number of precedents in California. Defeating the right would involve convincing a court with the power to overrule the precedent that the earlier decision was either wrongly decided or more often, 'clearly' wrong (depending on the criteria of the court) or the court must be convinced to distinguish the case. That is, to make the ruling narrower than that in the precedent due to some difference in facts between the current and precedent case, while still supporting the result reached in the earlier case. In 2004, Jackson's attorney Thomas Mesereau in People v. Jackson said [...] "People who intended to earn millions of dollars from his record and music promotions did not want negative publicity from these lawsuits interfering with their profits. Michael Jackson now regrets making these payments. These settlements were entered into with one primary condition â€“ that condition was that Mr. Jackson never admitted any wrongdoing. Mr. Jackson always denied doing anything wrong...Mr. Jackson now realizes the advice he received was wrong." [...] Jackson explained <b>why</b> <b>had</b> he tried to settle: [...] "I wanted to go on with my life. Too many people had already been hurt. I want to make records. I want to sing. I want to perform again...It's my talent. My hard work. My life. My decision." [...] He also wanted to avoid a [...] "media circus".|$|E

The state courts refused to transcribe the proceedings, failed to keep Panetti's counsel apprised of the progress of Panetti's claim of incompetence, and arguably failed to hold the competency hearing required by Texas law. Most importantly, however, the Texas courts did not afford Panetti an opportunity to refute the opinions of the court-appointed experts. [...] Although counsel had asked the trial court to give him money to hire experts of his own, the trial court ended the case without ruling on that request. These deficiencies in the procedures the Texas courts used to determine that Panetti was competent to be executed led the Court to conclude that Panetti did not receive the minimal process due him under Ford.|$|E

Aaron asked Moses whether he should eat consecrated food on the day that his sons died. Aaron argued that since the tithe (which is of lesser sanctity) is forbidden to be eaten by a bereaved person prior to the burial of his dead, how much more certainly must the meat of the sin-offering (which is more sacred) be prohibited to a bereaved person prior to the burial of his dead. Immediately after Moses heard Aaron's argument, he issued a proclamation to the Israelites, saying that he had made an error in regard to the law and Aaron his brother came and taught him.
