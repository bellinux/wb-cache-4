40|$|CBD (Component Based Development) {{methodology}} is a {{cost effective}} software development paradigm in which encapsulated software modules are assembled via interface to perform required functions. The CBD process directly applicable to general software development projects {{in conjunction with}} UML (Unified Modeling Language) based OOD (object-oriented development) methodology. However, special projects, such as <b>war</b> <b>game</b> simulators development, may not directly employ the OOD methodology within the process due to limitation in modeling power for <b>war</b> <b>game</b> components as discrete event systems. This paper presents employment of DEVS (Discrete Event Systems Specification) methodology for development of <b>war</b> <b>game</b> simulators using the CBD process. Embedment of the DEVS methodology is not replacement, but complement of the UML-based OOD methodology.
