2500|$|Brussels waffles are {{prepared}} with an egg-white-leavened or yeast-leavened batter, traditionally an ale yeast; occasionally {{both types of}} leavening are used together. They are lighter, crisper and have larger pockets compared to other European waffle varieties, and are easy to differentiate from Liège Waffles by their rectangular sides. In Belgium, most waffles are served warm by street vendors and dusted with confectioner's sugar, though in tourist areas they might be topped <b>with</b> <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> soft fruit or chocolate spread. Variants of the Brussels waffles – with whipped and folded egg whites cooked in large rectangular forms – date from the 18th century. However, the oldest recognized reference to [...] "Gaufres de Bruxelles" [...] (Brussels Waffles) by name is attributed from 1842/43 to Florian Dacher, a Swiss baker in Ghent, Belgium, who had previously worked under pastry chefs in central Brussels. Philippe Cauderlier would later publish Dacher's recipe in the 1874 edition of his recipe book [...] "La Pâtisserie et la Confiture". Maximilien Consael, another Ghent chef, had claimed to have invented the waffles in 1839, though there's no written record of him either naming or selling the waffles until his participation in the 1856 Brussels Fair. It {{should be noted that}} neither man created the recipe; they simply popularized and formalized an existing recipe as the Brussels waffle.|$|E
