5|$|In 1947, at age 17, Armstrong began {{studying}} aeronautical engineering at Purdue University. He {{was the second}} person in his family to attend college. He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The only engineer he knew (who had attended MIT) dissuaded him from attending, telling Armstrong that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to go all the}} way to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a good education.|$|E

5|$|The first acyclic {{persistent}} carbene {{was reported}} in 1996, thus showing that a cyclic backbone <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for their stability. Unlike the cyclic derivatives, the acyclic carbenes are flexible with respect to rotation of the bonds to the carbenic atom. By measuring the barrier to rotation of these bonds, {{the extent of their}} double bond character could be measured, and the ylidic nature of this carbene could be determined. Like the cyclic diaminocarbenes, unhindered variants tend to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary.</b>|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, battle <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for either side; the main strategic theatre was mainland Greece itself. Although destroying the enemy navy {{would result in}} a clear strategic advantage for both sides, attempting this risked the loss of their own navy. The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their morale and confidence than on any strategic considerations. The Persians, seeing little to gain in battle, demoralised and riven with dissent, thus sought to avoid a naval battle. Conversely, the Allies, who had initially been as nervous of a battle as the Persians, sought to press home their morale advantage once they were informed {{of the state of the}} Persian fleet.|$|E

5|$|The 13 {{teams were}} drawn into four groups, with Group 1 {{containing}} four teams, {{and the others}} containing only three. Each group played a round-robin format, with two points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If two teams had tied on points to win a group, a play-off would {{have been used to}} decide the group winner; however, this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary.</b> The four group winners progressed to the knockout semi-final stage. Extra time was available in the knockout matches if the two teams were level after ninety minutes, but it was not required.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 also {{introduced}} section8B(2), {{which is an}} ouster clause providing that no judicial review of orders made under the ISA shall be available save in relation to questions relating to the procedural requirements of the ISA. In Teo Soh Lung, the Court of Appeal held that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for it to decide if the subjective test in Lee Mau Seng precluded judicial review in the case. Hence, the position remains to be confirmed by the courts. In addition, the Court {{decided that it was}} unnecessary to consider the effect of section8B(2) on issues not related to national security and the constitutionality of the 1989 amendments to the ISA.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to delve into {{the validity of the}} conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E

5|$|There {{were several}} {{differences}} between Sullivan's adaptation and Stevenson's novella. Stevenson used multiple narrators and a circular narrative (allowing material {{presented at the}} end to explain material presented at the beginning), but Sullivan wrote a linear narrative in chronological order. This linear approach and the onstage action conveyed a stronger impression of realism, eliminating uncertainties in Stevenson's narrative. Although making the story more straightforward and less ambiguous <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for a theatrical adaptation, Sullivan's approach {{was typical of the}} era's stage melodramas and made the material more acceptable to audiences. The stage presentation's realism also allowed Sullivan to drop the novella's scientific aspects. Although Stevenson used science to make the Jekyll-Hyde transformation plausible to readers, Sullivan could rely on the onstage transformation.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{stretched}} the traditionally ceremonial position of Germany’s president to reach across political, national, and age boundaries {{to address a}} wide range of controversial issues. He is credited with being largely responsible for taking the lead on an asylum policy overhaul after the arson attack by neo-Nazis in Mölln, in which three Turkish citizens died in 1993. He also earned recognition at home and abroad for attending memorial services for the victims of neo-Nazi attacks in Mölln and Solingen. The services were snubbed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who dismayed many Germans by saying it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for the government to send a representative.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. {{military}} was considering future {{operations in the}} Bonin Islands during August 1944 the planners assessed that an occupation of Iwo Jima might be necessary to protect the Marianas from attack, {{and after the war}} this was given as one of the justifications for the costly invasion of the island. However, this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> due {{to the success of the}} Seventh Air Force and the USN's campaign against Iwo Jima's airfields as well as the Japanese military's shortage of long-ranged aircraft. In any event, the decision to invade Iwo Jima was made a month before the major attacks on the B-29 bases began, and there were no raids on the Marianas in the seven weeks before the landings began on February19.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast {{and the federal government}} did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E
5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E

5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The Final Chapter because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to The Final Chapter, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The Final Chapter.|$|E
5|$|The Privy Council's primary {{function}} was judicial, {{but it also}} acted as a body of advisers to the king {{and as a result}} its secondary function was as an executive in the absence or minority of the monarchy. Although the monarch might often attend the council, their presence <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessary</b> for the council to act with royal authority. Like parliament, it had the power to issue acts that could have the force of law. After James VI's departure to England in 1603, it functioned as a subservient executive carrying out his instructions from London. Although the theoretical membership of the council was relatively large, at around 30 persons, most of the business was carried out by an informal inner group, consisting mainly of the officers of state. Before 1610 the council was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, but in 1610 James VI decreed that the President of the College of Justice should preside in the Chancellor's absence, and by 1619 the additional title of President of the Privy Council had been added. The two presidencies were separated in 1626 as part of Charles I's reorganisation of the Privy Council and Court of Session. The Lord President of the Council was accorded precedence as one of the King's chief officers in 1661. After the Restoration, Charles II nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, a situation that continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–9. The council was abolished after the Act of Union on 1 May 1708.|$|E
