50|$|A <b>waterstop</b> is {{an element}} of a {{concrete}} structure, intended to prevent the passages of fluids (such as water) when embedded in and running continuously through concrete joints. Waterstops are grouped in two distinct categories. Waterstops for joints without any movement of the adjoint concrete sections (construction cold joints) and waterstops for joints with movement of the adjoint concrete sections (dilation joints).|$|E
5000|$|... 4. Hydrophilic or [...] "water-loving" [...] waterstops are {{strips of}} rubber, {{modified}} with a hydrophilic agent (such as bentonite) so they swell {{in the presence}} of moisture to effectively seal concrete construction joints. Hydrophilic strip applied waterstops should not be used in contraction or expansion joints per the instructions of most commercial manufacturers. Hydrophilic waterstops can only be effective if they are allowed to swell; therefore, water must be present to activate the hydrophilic agent. Initial leaking is possible until the <b>waterstop</b> expands to seal the joint. The American Concrete Institute recommends against the use of hydrophilic waterstops for hazardous fluids such as fuels, acids, and process chemicals, as the products may not swell as intended in fluids other than water.|$|E

Splices can be welded, overlapped or joined with a sealant. A subcategory of metal <b>waterstops</b> is coated with polymeric and/or hydrophilic materials {{in order to provide}} a higher bond to the concrete and form a secondary barrier against waterseapage.These <b>waterstops</b> come in 25 m coils or in 2.0 - 2.5 m sections. Multi-purpose customized <b>waterstops</b> may also function as shuttering or crack-inducer for cold joints.|$|R

Hydrophobic Polymer <b>waterstops</b> such as PVC, PE, TPV, or rubber are {{supplied}} {{to the construction}} site in coils (usually 25 m long), and are generally anywhere from 120 mm to 320 mm wide {{in a variety of}} profiles that are designed to simultaneously provide an interlock with the concrete they are installed in and to provide for a limited amount of movement within the joint. PVC, PE and TPV <b>waterstops</b> are made continuous for the length of the concrete joint by heat welding, using simple thermoplastic welding equipment. PE and TPV <b>waterstops</b> are generally installed in joints of secondary containment structures to prevent the passage of hazardous fluids other than water such as fuel oils, acids, or process chemicals.The German national standards DIN 18541 [...] and DIN 7865 [...] regulate dimensions and material properties of polymeric <b>waterstops.</b>|$|R

All joints in the secondary containment facilities will be of water tight construction conforming to the requirements of the attached specifications. Attached to this letter is the above-referenced concrete specifications with QA/QC plans and example vendors' information for <b>waterstop</b> and joint seal products proposed.

40|$|The 105 -K East and 105 -K West fuel storage basins (105 -K Basins) were {{designed}} and {{constructed in the}} early 1950 `s for interim storage of irradiated fuel following its discharge from the reactors. The 105 -K- East and 105 -K West reactor buildings were constructed first, and the associated storage basins were added about a year later. The construction joint between each reactor building structure and the basin structure included a flexible membrane <b>waterstop</b> to prevent leakage. Water in the storage basins provided both radiation shielding and cooling to remove decay heat from stored fuel until its transfer to the Plutonium Uranium Extraction (PUREX) Facility for chemical processing. The 105 -K West Reactor was permanently shut down in February 1970; the 105 -K East Reactor was permanently shut down in February 1971. Except for a few loose pieces, fuel stored in the basins {{at that time was}} shipped to the PUREX Facility for processing. The basins were then left idle but were kept filled with water. The PUREX Facility was shut down and placed on wet standby in 1972 while N Reactor continued to operate. When the N Reactor fuel storage basin began to approach storage capacity, {{the decision was made to}} modify the fuel storage basins at 105 -K East and 105 -K West to provide additional storage capacity. Both basins were subsequently modified (105 -K East in 1975 and 105 -K West in 1981) to provide for the interim handling and storage of irradiated N Reactor fuel. The PUREX Facility was restarted in November 1983 to provide 1698 additional weapons-grade plutonium for the United States defense mission. The facility was shut down and deactivated in December 1992 when the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) determined that the plant was no longer needed to support weapons-grade plutonium production. When the PUREX Facility was shut down, approximately 2. 1 x 1 06 kg (2, 100 metric tons) of irradiated fuel aged 7 to 23 years was left in storage in the 105 -K Basins pending a decision on final disposition of the material.
