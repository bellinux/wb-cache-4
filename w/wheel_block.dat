40|$|The {{temperature}} rise of wheels and blocks due to frictional heating during railway tread braking {{along with the}} transfer of heat through the wheel–rail contact is studied in this paper. In particular, heat partitioning between block, wheel and rail for stop braking cycles is considered. The wheels are of interest because they are a limiting factor for railway tread braking systems. Two types of thermal models are employed to investigate the maximum temperatures over the wheel tread. In a circumferential (plane) model of <b>wheel,</b> <b>block</b> and rail, the heat transfer problem is studied by use of a finite element formulation of the two-dimensional time-dependent convection–diffusion equation. The hot spot phenomenon is simulated by introducing a prescribed wheel-fixed contact pressure distribution between wheel and block. In an axisymmetric (axial) model of <b>wheel,</b> <b>block</b> and rail, the lateral movements of the wheel–rail contact are studied. A general {{result is that the}} cooling effect provided by the rail is important when local temperatures on the tread are considered, but not when studying bulk temperatures created in a single stop braking event. Furthermore, it is found from the lateral movements of the wheel–rail contact that slow oscillations result in maximum temperatures over the wheel tread that are somewhat lower than for travelling on straight track (rolling at the rolling circle) ...|$|E

40|$|Tread (block) braking {{is still}} one of the most common braking systems on railway vehicles. The action is carried out by {{pressing}} brake blocks against the tread of a wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The extensive use of tread brakes in metro and suburban applications has created a need for design guidelines or standards for wheels exposed to repeated stop braking. The thermal capacity of the wheels puts a limit to railway tread braking systems. With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the thermal capacity limits for wheels. In the present work, an extensive literature survey has been made with special focus on the braking capacity of wheels. Several aspects of the tread braking system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, have been assessed, such as brake block materials and residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. Additionally, two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop braking. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. It was concluded that even though the same nominal routes were simulated in the brake rig tests as those the field tests, the braking efforts are different. Therefore, simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. Heat partitioning between <b>wheel,</b> <b>block</b> and rail has been numerically studied in a broad parametric study to investigate the influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution. By use of a plane model, the implication of temperature variations around the wheel circumference (hot spots) is studied in detail. Even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures, they were found to have only a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system. By use of an axisymmetric model, it was found that a presumed constant axial position of the wheel-rail contact towards the flange side of the tread leads to substantially higher maximum tread temperatures than a wheel-rail contact centred at the brake block position...|$|E

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of railway vehicle braking {{processes}} it is an important requirement to maintain the roll-ing-motion-state of the wheels, i. e. the macro-sliding-free rolling contact between the vehicle wheels and the rail-head, since in the course of rolling in the presence of creep-dependent contact forces, the braking force transmittable on the vehicle through the rail/wheel contact patch is considerably greater, than the braking force transmittable on the vehicle in the case of <b>wheel</b> <b>blocking</b> and on the railhead continuously sliding non-rotating wheels. In this study some control strategies will be introduced that have been elaborated for developing anti-slip-device systems of railway vehicles, and that meet the requirement of treating the always present uncertain-ties in the force transfer conditions through the wheel/rail rolling contact by a stochastic model. With such mod-els it is possible to develop anti-slip-devices having advantageous braking effectiveness in the operation also in case of uncertain tribological characteristics along the track...|$|R

40|$|Tread braking of railway wheels {{results in}} the kinetic energy of the train being {{dissipated}} into the <b>wheel</b> and <b>blocks</b> {{in the form of}} heat. This heat is further conducted into adjacent structures, notably the cold rail, and also transferred into the surroundings by convection and radiation. Heat partitioning between <b>wheel</b> and <b>block</b> is, for short time periods, controlled by local thermal interactions at the contact point and by the conductive properties of the bodies. However, for a metro train that performs longer periods of intermittent braking (or for drag braking) convective and radiation cooling properties of the components come into play. In the present study, results from brake rig tests and from in-field testing of a metro train are presented and used to calibrate a simulation model. It is found that the cooling level of the wheels of the metro train is substantially lower than for the wheels of a freight wagon. Moreover, it is found that the first axle on the metro train is exposed to higher cooling levels than the remaining axles. In a numerical example, temperatures of tread braked wheels are calculated using the new findings for a metro train, and the results obtained are compared with wheel temperatures as calculated assuming freight wagon conditions...|$|R
