50|$|The block uses a {{bedplate}} {{featuring a}} perimeter wall with transverse webbings for durability and quiet operation at high engine speeds. The pistons {{are attached to}} fracture-split forged powdered metal connecting rods using semi-floating press-fit pins. A gerotor oil pump is driven directly from the crankshaft {{on the front of}} the engine. A timing belt is used to drive the valvetrain. Early production 2.0 L engines used a hydraulic tensioner to tension the timing belt. 2000 and 2001 engines used a mechanical spring-loaded tensioner that tended to wear out prematurely, causing serious valve and piston damage upon belt failure due to the interference design of the engine. 2002+ engines utilized a different mechanical tensioner. The water pump is driven from the timing belt, with the <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> cast partially into the engine block itself.|$|E
