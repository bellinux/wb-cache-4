5|$|Plans for a {{link between}} Bømlo and Stord were first {{launched}} as a pontoon bridge in the 1960s. In the late 1980s, the plans evolved into a triangular project. There was controversy surrounding the project, in particular from environmentalists. The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1996, and construction started the following year. The bridges and link between Stord and Bømlo opened on 28 December 2000, while the tunnel opened on 30 April 2001. The link cost 1.8 billion Norwegian krone (NOK) after substantial cost overruns and <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> toll road until 30 April 2013.|$|E

He filed his Certificate of Candidacy (COC) at the Commission on Elections office in Palacio del Gobernador, Intramuros, Manila on October 14, 2015. He said he aims to create a “strong middle class” by promoting higher education and lowering income tax rates. He was also endorsed by Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, who won the presidential election. Romulo, however, didn't win the race and was ranked 22nd on the tally. His sister, Mons, who ran in Pasig City's lone district and lost to Richard Eusebio, said in her Instagram post that their family <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> helping hand in Pasig and the country despite losing the elections.|$|E

25|$|Violent {{crime is}} limited, but increasing, and public {{perception}} associates this with returns of ethnic Tongans {{who have been}} raised overseas.

Burbank's City Manager, Mike Flad, estimated the city's 2009–10 fiscal budget will suffer a 5% shortfall. For the city's 2010–11 fiscal year, the city projected a deficit of $5.8 million and projected the deficit <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> problem at least until 2014–15, when it is projected to be $6.9 million.

All of Jazani's books were written in prison from 1970 to 1974. They discussed the establishment of the independent leftist movement in the two decades of the 1960s and '70s.

25|$|In 2005 3J Development {{purchased}} {{the building and}} planned to convert the building into residential units. The renovation plan, abandoned in 2007, would have altered the facade and removed the distinctive blue panels. The structure was one of seven downtown buildings targeted by Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert for numerous code and fire hazards in 2009, resulting in a cleanup of the ground floor and updated safety systems. After failed redevelopment plans, efforts to demolish the building were renewed in 2012 when it was reported the building may be purchased and donated to the City of Dallas. Recommendations from an updated Downtown Dallas Parks Master Plan may call for removal of the building, but {{the high cost of}} demolition and abatement may influence the outcome. Until that time, 211 North Ervay <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> colorful landmark in the heart of downtown Dallas.|$|E
25|$|In the inscription, the runes aukrimulfʀ {{are to be}} read as auk krimulfʀ and the k rune, , thus {{represents}} {{two letters}} at the same time. The runes represent the common Norse name Grímulfr, which was in use all over Scandinavia. It is of note that the name appears in such an old runestone as the other runic attestations of the name are considerably younger, and the name was common in medieval Norway. The name of the deceased, Eyvindr, is a common name in Swedish runic inscriptions, but not Eivísl, {{the name of the}} chieftain of the expedition. The only other secure attestation appears on the contemporary Sparlösa Runestone in Västergötland. Since the name appears on two runestones from roughly the same time and in two districts that were culturally closely connected, the name may refer to the same person on the two runestones. Unfortunately, the Sparlösa Runestone is damaged in several places and although it mentions a battle and although there are images like birds hovering above the rigging of a ship, scholars cannot be certain that it refers to a chieftain who had fallen in battle. The idenfication between the name Eivísl on the two runestones <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> hypothesis.|$|E
