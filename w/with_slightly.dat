5|$|Head: The head {{should be}} broad <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> {{pronounced}} eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining {{around the eyes}} should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and set slightly above the eyes.|$|E
50|$|Both the Eraser and Chaser markers are {{of similar}} {{construction}}. The Eraser is an all-aluminum construction <b>with</b> a <b>slightly</b> longer design, while the Chaser has aluminum and composite material (grip frame), <b>with</b> a <b>slightly</b> shorter body.|$|R
50|$|In a {{collisionless plasma}} the {{particle}} velocities are often {{taken to be}} approximately a Maxwellian distribution function. If {{the slope of the}} function is negative, the number of particles <b>with</b> velocities <b>slightly</b> less than the wave phase velocity is greater than the number of particles <b>with</b> velocities <b>slightly</b> greater. Hence, there are more particles gaining energy from the wave than losing to the wave, which leads to wave damping.If, however, the slope of the function is positive, the number of particles <b>with</b> velocities <b>slightly</b> less than the wave phase velocity is smaller than the number of particles <b>with</b> velocities <b>slightly</b> greater. Hence, there are more particles losing energy to the wave than gaining from the wave, which leads to a resultant increase in the wave energy.|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} in Telugu and Tamil languages (the latter titled Devadas) <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> different casts. Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Savitri, and Lalitha played the lead roles in both versions; supporting roles were played by S. V.

5|$|The precise {{demographics}} of the readership of street newspapers is unclear. A pair of 1993 surveys conducted by Chicago's StreetWise suggested that the paper's readers at the time tended to be college-educated, <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> over half being female, and slightly over half unmarried.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{variants}} of the $10 million denomination, the primary difference being the typeface {{and size of}} the serial number. Those <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> larger serial numbers bear the prefix DA. The $25 million banknote is larger in dimension out {{of the rest of the}} 2008 series.|$|E
5|$|A British {{edition of}} the {{magazine}} ran for four issues on a bimonthly schedule starting in November 1953 and finishing in May 1954. These copied the first four issues of the US version, <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> cut contents. They were numbered 1 to 4 but were not dated. Ten years after the magazine folded, nine stories from Beyond were collected into the 160-page paperback Beyond, published in 1963 by Berkley Books (F712) and edited by Thomas Dardis (who was not credited on the book).|$|E

5|$|Due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms {{chemical}} {{bonds with}} almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides. The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized {{in the presence}} of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> less metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is written as , where x is usually around 0.05.|$|E
5|$|Humidity {{levels are}} usually very high all year round. Manila has a {{distinct}} dry season from December through May, and a relatively lengthy wet season that covers the remaining period <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> cooler temperatures. In the wet season, it rarely rains all day, but rainfall is very heavy during short periods. Typhoons usually occur from June to September.|$|E
5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} {{the uniqueness of the}} solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, but they can be completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. <b>With</b> <b>slightly</b> more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the uniqueness of the solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E
50|$|The Winter of Our Discontent is {{an album}} by The Echoing Green, {{originally}} released on April 14, 2003, on A Different Drum.

5|$|Outdoor air pollutants, {{especially}} chemicals {{released from}} the burning of fossil fuels, {{increase the risk of}} lung cancer. Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> increased risk. For nitrogen dioxide, an incremental increase of 10 parts per billion increases the risk of lung cancer by 14%. Outdoor air pollution is estimated to account for 1–2% of lung cancers.|$|E
5|$|The Art Ross Trophy {{is awarded}} to the National Hockey League (NHL) player who leads the league in points {{at the end of}} the regular season. It was {{presented}} to the league by former player, General Manager, and head coach Art Ross. The trophy has been awarded 65 times to 27 players since its introduction in the 1947–48 NHL season. Ross is also known for his design of the official NHL puck, <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> bevelled edges for better control.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell Douglas A-4G Skyhawk is {{a variant}} of the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk attack {{aircraft}} developed for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The model was based on the A-4F variant of the Skyhawk, and was fitted <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> different avionics as well as the capacity to operate AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The RAN received ten A-4Gs in 1967 and another ten in 1971, and operated the type from 1967 to 1984.|$|E

5|$|The {{geologic}} {{story of}} the Kootenay is strongly connected to the geology of the Columbia, Selkirk and Rocky Mountains. The mountains {{in much of the}} Kootenay River catchment are composed of Precambrian sedimentary rock of the Belt Supergroup, in turn stratified into several subgroups <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> different characteristics and ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{king vulture}} soars for hours effortlessly, only {{flapping}} its wings infrequently. While in flight, its wings are held flat <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> raised tips, {{and from a}} distance the vulture can appear to be headless while in flight. Its wing beats are deep and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed {{it could be a}} part of courtship behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{translucent}} (hyaline), smooth, have {{an ellipsoid}} shape, with dimensions of 12–16 by 3–5µm. Spores contain {{one or two}} oil droplets. The imperfect (conidial) form of the fungus produces smooth, hyaline spores that are 3–3.5 by 1–2µm. The asci – sexual spore-bearing cells – have a cylindrical shape, with dimensions of 115–125 by 8–10µm. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous cells interspersed among the asci) are cylindrical <b>with</b> <b>slightly</b> swollen tips, and few branches.|$|E
