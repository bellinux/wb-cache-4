6000|$|Of the notices {{which have}} {{appeared}} regarding Lord Macaulay, {{up to the}} day when the present lines are written (the 9th of January), the reader should not deny himself the pleasure of looking especially at two. It is a good sign of the times when such articles as these (I mean the articles in The times and Saturday Review) appear in our public prints about our public men. They educate us, as it were, to admire rightly. An uninstructed person in a museum or at a concert may pass by without recognizing a picture or a passage of music, which the connoisseur by his side may show him is a masterpiece of harmony, or a wonder of artistic skill. After reading these papers you like and respect more the person you have admired so much already. And so with regard to Macaulay's style there may be faults of course--what critic can't point them out? But for the nonce <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> faults: we want to say nil nisi bonum. Well--take at hazard any three pages of the [...] "Essays" [...] or [...] "History;"--and, glimmering below the stream of the narrative, as it were, you, an average reader, see one, two, three, a half-score of allusions to other historic facts, characters, literature, poetry, with which you are acquainted.

Your neighbor, who has HIS reading, and his little stock of literature stowed away in his mind, shall detect more points, allusions, happy touches, indicating not only the prodigious memory and vast learning of this master, but the wonderful industry, the honest, humble previous toil of this great scholar.

Perhaps the most exciting element is the fact that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> in futuristic terms. The advent of the personal computer means that almost any library can afford an in-house database as well as access to outside databases.

This promises local access to the online catalog, an automated circulation control system, serials check-in, and the ability to store and manipulate library statistics and other types of management information. Libraries will have much better control of their own statistics and have surer methods to determine collection usage, user satisfaction, employee performance, etc. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

40|$|This case {{looks at}} {{the long history of}} racism on and off the {{football}} pitch. Although this case focuses on UK football, the issue does not exist solely within the UK – it is found in many countries and even threatens to disrupt the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The case highlights the poor attempts by clubs and by football (and other) authorities to stamp out racism. The examples demonstrate the lack of consistency in dealing with the problem and the apparent unwillingness of people at the top to deal with this issue. Perhaps business needs to be drawn into the furore to ensure action – hit racists where it hurts (and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> footballs here).

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{scholars}} and journalists {{have observed that}} something strange is happening to our planet {{as well as at}} social, cultural and political levels.

50|$|Philosophers who favour the B-view of time tend to find McTaggart’s {{argument}} against the A-series to demonstrate conclusively that tense involves a contradiction. On the other hand, philosophers who favour the A-view of time struggle to see why the argument should be considered to have any force. Two {{of the most commonly}} invoked objections are, first, that McTaggart is mistaken about the phenomenology of time; that he is claiming to see a contradiction in the appearance of time, where none is apparent. Second, that McTaggart is mistaken about the semantics of tensed discourse. The idea here is that claims like “M is present, has been future, and will be past” can only imply a contradiction if it is interpreted as saying that M is all at once future in the past, present in the present, and also past in the future. This reading, it is argued, is absurd because “has been” and “will be” indicate that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> how M currently is, but instead of how M once was, but is no longer, and how it will be, but is not yet. Hence it is wrong to think of the expression as an attribution to M of futurity, presentness, and pastness, all at once (Marhenke 1935; Broad 1938; Mink 1960; Prior 1967; Christensen 1974; Lloyd 1977; Lowe 1987).|$|E

What <b>we</b> <b>are</b> interested in emphasizing the other modality of ruling an entity: the mismanagement.
