5|$|As {{with all}} long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent ear infections. The breed {{does have an}} {{inclination}} to gain weight easily, which can be prevented by controlling food intake. The Russian Spaniel can be prone to food allergies, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> identified at between 1 and 5 months of age with the most common allergens being chicken and carrots. There are no other breed-specific health issues currently known.|$|E

5|$|For {{the primary}} deposits, the source pegmatites, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> {{obtained}} by mining, {{are divided into}} small parts and then undergo flotation. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with hydrogen chloride; then follow thickening, filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, {{with a series of}} magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.|$|E

The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> associated with stables. The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above-ground floors, and there was a basement underneath.|$|E

5|$|Furry {{conventions}} {{are usually}} run and staffed by volunteers, though venues may require certain activities to be contracted out. Event funding typically relies on convention registrations. Many {{of the larger}} conventions are incorporated as non-profit organizations, usually to achieve tax-exempt status and safeguard the organizers' personal assets - in the US, some are 501(c)(3) charities, while others are registered as recreational clubs. The largest events may require up to a hundred volunteers, not including gofers. Volunteers are thanked for their participation during the closing ceremonies, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> well-attended, and often receive T-shirts or other benefits.|$|E
5|$|In his text, An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion, author Derek Hicks {{suggest that}} “through gumbo, traditions and values are transmitted.” This quote {{represents}} his larger claim that gumbo does this for African American culture, uniting {{a group of}} people by one very powerful dish. According to Hicks, it is not just that gumbo is a cultural and historical food in the black community, but that it continues to foster that community through its flavors, colors and eating methods, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> in large groups where it can be shared among many people.|$|E

5|$|On Lanzarote a {{somewhat}} {{larger number of}} these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain.

On Tenerife they seem relatively numerous {{but on the other}} islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.|$|E

The men's General Congress also elects the Prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts. After the death of a Prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to become the next Prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.|$|E

Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.|$|E
