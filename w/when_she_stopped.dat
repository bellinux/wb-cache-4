5|$|In 1979, Rodham {{became the}} first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm. From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband. During 1978 and 1979, while looking to {{supplement}} their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stopped</b> trading after ten months. At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal. Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The fall of Amalfi and Salerno to Robert Guiscard were {{influenced}} by his wife, Sichelgaita. Amalfi probably surrendered {{as a result of}} her negotiations, and Salerno fell <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stopped</b> petitioning her husband on behalf of her brother (the prince of Salerno). The Amalfitans unsuccessfully subjected themselves to Prince Gisulf to avoid Norman suzerainty, but the states (whose histories had been joined since the 9th century) ultimately came under Norman control.|$|E

500|$|The {{child was}} {{identified}} as Bella Neveah Amoroso Bond on September 18, 2015. [...] The identification was made after the sister of one of Rachelle Bond's neighbors reported to police a link between Bond and the Jane Doe. Apparently, the neighbor had noticed Bella was absent from the household and had confronted Rachelle Dee Bond and her boyfriend Michael P. McCarthy. They stated that the girl had been [...] "taken away by the Department of Children and Families" [...] (this was later disproved). Subsequently, the neighbor told his sister that he believed that [...] "Baby Doe" [...] was Bella Bond, and she contacted authorities. One witness told authorities she grew concerned <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stopped</b> seeing the child at her mother's apartment and when the girl's toys were disposed of. On September 17, 2015, a search warrant was executed {{at the home of}} Rachelle Bond, 40, the child's mother, in Dorchester, Massachusetts.|$|E

She sailed from Gibraltar on 7 March in company with the gun-brig [...] but the two vessels did not coordinate. Crafty carried too much sail and Confounder too little, with the result that they separated. The next day Crafty {{encountered}} gunvessels from the Algeciras flotilla and although she escaped, she had a gun dismounted. She sailed towards the Barbary coast and on 9 March anchored in a small bay at north of Tetuan, awaiting a favourable wind.|$|E

2500|$|On 29 November 1824 Admiral Cockburn {{stopped at}} Tristan da Cunha. There {{she picked up}} the artist Augustus Earle, who had been {{inadvertently}} marooned there earlier in the year on 29 March. He left Admiral Cockburn on 18 January 1825 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stopped</b> at Hobart Town,Van Dieman's Land. On 16 February 1829 Captain Peter Kemp sailed Admiral Cockburn to Timor and New Zealand on a whaling voyage. She was reported to have been at Timor in July with 200 barrels of sperm oil. Then she and the whaler Ranger were reported to have been off Japan in May 1830. In October Admiral Cockburn was at Guam with 1200 barrels. In August 1831 she was at the Bay of Islands with 1700 barrels. Lastly, on 12 January 1832 she was at the Bay of Islands with 2200 barrels. She returned to England on 3 June 1832 with 2200 barrels of sperm oil.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the Olav Tryggvason took part in neutrality protection duties. Her first armed action came on 3 November 1939, when the US merchant ship City of Flint entered Norwegian territorial waters. The City of Flint had been taken as a prize by the German pocket battleship Deutschland in the Atlantic and {{was on its way to}} Germany with the American crew as prisoners. According to public international law, the ship could have passed through Norwegian waters without interference, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stopped</b> and anchored in the port of Haugesund, the Germans broke Norwegian neutrality regulations. The German prize crew had brought the City of Flint into Haugesund to escape the British naval forces which searched for them. When the British cruiser [...] approached the City of Flint on 2 November the escorting Olav Tryggvason had confronted the British warship and made it leave Norwegian waters. Olav Tryggvason boarded the City of Flint with one officer and thirty armed sailors, who returned control of the ship to the American captain, Joseph H. Gainard, on 6 November. He unloaded his cargo in Bergen and set sail in ballast for the US. The German prize crew was interned at Kongsvinger Fortress. In response, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs received several strongly worded and threatening notes from its German counterpart.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} drug-related dysgeusia {{can often be}} {{reversed}} by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication. In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from hypertension was being treated with valsartan. Due to this drug's inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of eprosartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stopped</b> taking the medication. When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned. In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed amlodipine in order to treat his hypertension. After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of taste sensation and numbness in his tongue. When {{he ran out of}} his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking amlodipine. Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his taste sensation. Once he refilled his prescription and began taking amlodipine a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred. These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the [...] "de-challenge" [...] and [...] "re-challenge" [...] that took place in both instances. It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug's dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.|$|E

Her power recharges <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>stops</b> attacking; <b>when</b> fully charged, it {{allows her to}} unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|R
