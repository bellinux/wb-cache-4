As a result, what my FIS could reasonably <b>want</b> me to <b>want</b> is limited by what information my FIS could reliably convey to me. And therefore what my FIS could reasonably <b>want</b> me to <b>want</b> cannot be grounded in changes in desires that my FIS cannot publicly justify. The fourth interpretation limits the scope of what my FIS could <b>want</b> me to <b>want</b> {{in a way that}} avoids these problems, but conflicts with standard intuitions about what is a non-moral good...|$|R
