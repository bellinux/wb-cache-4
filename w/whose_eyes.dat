5|$|As Yonah's illness, the Black Scrawl, is terminal, Nier {{sets out}} {{to look for a}} cure. As he does, Nier finds a talking book, Grimoire Weiss, which {{suggests}} that the two team up to use Weiss' magic and to find a cure for Yonah's disease. In their search, they encounter Kainé, a hot-tempered and foul-mouthed swordswoman; and Emil, a blindfolded boy <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> petrify anyone they see. After journeying for a time, the village is attacked by a giant shade; the battle culminates in Yonah being carried away by a master Shade that suddenly appears—the Shadowlord—who carries his own book, Grimoire Noir.|$|E
5|$|Defendants Irving Potash and Benjamin J. Davis {{were among}} the {{audience}} members attacked as they left a September 4 concert headlined by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York. It was given to benefit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses. Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles without interference by the police. Over 140 people suffered injuries, including Potash, <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> were struck by glass from a broken windshield. The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries.|$|E

5|$|Kreia {{is shown}} as an elderly blind woman, <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> have atrophied {{from lack of}} use in {{preference}} of viewing things through the Force, viewing normal sight as a distraction. Dialogue in The Sith Lords establishes her past as a Jedi historian {{and one of the}} teachers of Revan, who became a Sith Lord and was the player character of , and how her teachings were blamed for his fall. The Sith Lords reveals she as Sith trained two antagonists of the game, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus, before they cast her out. She is initially depicted in earth-brown hooded Jedi robes with empty white eyes, though after the revelation of her identity as Darth Traya, both a Sith and a being of betrayal, both her robes and eyes are changed to black, and she becomes more pale.|$|E
5|$|To {{convince}} {{the rest of}} the colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a piece of mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be supposedly born {{when it was time to}} leave. Such a dog had been born several days ago but has yet to open his eyes. Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to {{convince the}} colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated on global warming and the dangers of staying in their colony.|$|E
5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples {{of the use of}} an unreliable narrator in film is the German expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, from 1920. In this film, an epilogue to the main story is a twist ending revealing that Francis, through <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> we see the action, is a patient in an insane asylum, and the flashback which forms the majority of the film is simply his mental delusion.|$|E

25|$|Toradora! is an anime {{television}} series {{adapted from the}} light novel series of the same title written by Yuyuko Takemiya and illustrated by Yasu. The series was directed by Tatsuyuki Nagai and produced by J.C.Staff, Masayoshi Tanaka serving as the character designer and Mari Okada serving as the primary scriptwriter. The series follows Ryūji Takasu, {{a high school student}} <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> make him look like an intimidating delinquent, and Taiga Aisaka, a diminutive girl in his class who is known for her negative attitude towards nearly everyone. The two of them spend their days of high school with their three close friends named Minori Kushieda, Yūsaku Kitamura and Ami Kawashima.|$|E
25|$|One of Boring's best-known {{projects}} is his 1940 {{study of the}} moon illusion. Boring and fellow researcher A. H. Holway hypothesized that the moon appears larger on the horizon because the eyes view it directly at a leveled position, while the moon overhead appears smaller because the eyes must look up. They tested this experimentally, and found that for an observer <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> were kept in a fixed position while a circle representing the moon moved up (through {{the use of a}} pulley system), the moon appeared to increase in size. This illusion did not occur when participants were lying down while viewing the moon, and they also found some evidence of it not occurring when viewing the moon with only one eye. These results led the researchers to conclude that the illusion of moon shrinkage depends on the movement of the eyes in the head, not the movement of the actual head, and that it depends on binocular vision, that is, the use of both eyes together. This study exemplifies Boring’s interest in misperceptions of sensory experience.|$|E

500|$|Despite the work's {{commemorative}} value, {{no details}} about its first exhibition are known, {{and it is}} not mentioned in any surviving contemporaneous accounts. [...] This lack of commentary may be due to FernandoVII's preference for neoclassical art, and to the fact that popular revolts of any kind were not regarded as suitable subject matter by the restored Bourbons. A monument to the fallen in the uprising, also commissioned in 1814 by the provisional government, [...] "was stopped by FerdinandVII, in <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> the senators and heroes of the war of independence found small favour, on account of their reforming tendencies".|$|E

500|$|The {{physical}} {{design of}} Jason Voorhees {{has gone through}} changes, some subtle and some radical. For Friday the 13th, the task of coming up with Jason's appearance was the responsibility of Tom Savini, whose design for Jason was inspired by someone Savini knew as a child <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> and ears did not line up straight. The original design called for Jason to have hair, but Savini and his crew opted to make him bald, so he would look like a [...] "hydrocephalic, mongoloid pinhead", with a dome-shaped head. Savini created a plaster mold of Ari Lehman's head and used that to create prosthetics for his face. Lehman personally placed mud—from {{the bottom of the}} lake—all over his body to make himself appear [...] "really slimy." ...|$|E

500|$|Contextually, the {{painting}} forms {{part of the}} Northern Renaissance, a resurgence of classical humanism and culture in northern Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. The Renaissance induced {{a new kind of}} social individualism which Altdorfer expressed through the heroic emphasis on Alexander and Darius, and which is reflected in the specifics of {{the painting}}'s commission and by the subjects of its companion pieces: [...] "During the Renaissance people no longer saw themselves solely as members of a social group, as the citizens of a town, or as sinners before God in <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> all were equal. They had become aware of the unique qualities that distinguished one person from another. Unlike the Middle Ages, the Renaissance celebrated the individual. Altdorfer may have painted row after row of apparently identical warriors, but the spectators themselves would identify with Alexander and Darius, figures who had names, whose significance was indicated by the cord which hung down from the tablet above them." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in 1848, Smetana {{wrote to}} Franz Liszt, {{whom he had}} not yet met, asking him to accept the {{dedication}} of a new piano work, Six Characteristic Pieces, and recommend it to a publisher. He also requested a loan of 400gulden, to enable him to open a music school. Liszt replied cordially, accepting the dedication and promising to help find a publisher, but he offered no financial assistance. This encouragement {{was the beginning of a}} friendship that was of great value to Smetana in his subsequent career. Despite Liszt's lack of financial support, Smetana was able to start a Piano Institute in late August 1848, with twelve students. After a period of struggle the Institute began to flourish and became briefly fashionable, particularly among supporters of Czech nationalism in <b>whose</b> <b>eyes</b> Smetana was developing a reputation. Proksch wrote of Smetana's support for his people's cause, and said that he [...] "could well become the transformer of my ideas in the Czech language." [...] In 1849 the Institute was relocated to the home of Kateřina's parents, and began to attract distinguished visitors; Liszt came regularly, and the former Austrian emperor Ferdinand, who had settled in Prague, attended the school's matinée concerts. Smetana's performances in these concerts became a recognised feature of Prague's musical life. In this time of relative financial stability Smetana married Kateřina, on 27August 1849. Four daughters were born to the couple between 1851 and 1855.|$|E
