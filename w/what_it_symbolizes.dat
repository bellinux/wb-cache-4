The first documented evidence of use of the symbol in a vigilante scenario occurred in November 1879 in Helena when it was mentioned in a newspaper article.

40|$|Interactive documentaries are {{achieving}} {{fame and}} many people are engaging in the technology. However minimal research means the benefits of interactive documentaries remain unexplored. This project investigates the actual benefit of interactive documentaries. It also relates to exploring the benefits of this genre and studying how interactive media can engage youths.            The hypothesis studies how films implement interactive functions and whether this implementation is a positive or proactive influence on the user’s engagement. Additionally, it will {{be argued that the}} interactive narrative gave a more positive effect on the young audience than was recorded for the TV documentary.   In particular, and since it is the targeted audience of the research project, the study will discuss how youths paid more attention to the narrative, were motivated to explore the artifact or object in question, and facilitated mood change allowing greater expression and understanding of the subject. It is argued that interactive functions can provide these effects because they allow a user to go inside the content (Manovich 2000, 206). In other words, the user’s participation becomes active rather than passive within interactive media content. To address the research question, a research plan was put in place and is as follows: A short web documentary was created, with Interactive functions, and evaluated with the target audience. An identical film was produced without interactive functions. Both versions were presented to the target audience, and interviews were conducted to monitor and evaluate audience participation.   The results were summarized with comparison and analysis for study presentation. The production of a film was required to describe interactive functions. Another film formed content for a chosen short documentary about the cultural history of an archeological item. This documentary is available in Västra Götaland Museum at Skara and focuses on when, where and how the archaeological item was found and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>symbolized</b> in terms of cultural significance. The documentary film had a chronological narration, including archive photographs, videos materials, and also featured an interview. One particularly interesting story was chosen from a number of Museum pieces. It {{should be noted that the}} Västra Götaland Museum had a website which was popular viewing for a significant numbers of teenagers. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this article}} we revisit two {{different}} temporal phases related to the main publication of Serge Moscovici's book La Psychanalyse, son image et son public together with two key promissing notions of the theory, cognitive polyphasia and anchoring. The first phase, initiated by the durkheimian cercle, will give us the occasion to retrieve the traces of the fascinating intellectual debate about collective psychology that was involved in producing ¨frontier¨ propositions and renewing their perspectives in today's light, namely throught cognitive polyphasia. The second phase, more recent, inspired by classical and modern research into the social representation's field, will serve us {{as a basis for}} a new hypothesis about anchoring. We will attempt to suggest that traditional familiarization allocated to anchoring can also work in the opposite sense, transmitting and guaranteeing the non-familiar, establishing strangeness. Finally, we are arguing that social representations are more than a simple theory, just as the symbol is always more than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>symbolizes...</b>|$|E

She concludes this short chapter by describing the moment in which she allowed the Coatlicue state to take control after years of attempting to rule herself. She states that she is never alone and that she is no longer afraid after this moment, when she finally feels complete.|$|R

Though providing a general theory of symbol systems (from which this paper borrows), Goodman fails to give an adequate account of what marks pictorial systems. After an examination of his account this paper presents continuous correlation as the distinguishing feature of pictorial systems. In addition there will be noted a phenomenological correlate of this feature, what I call metaphorical identification...|$|E

40|$|Menopause is {{a complex}} {{phenomenon}} which encompasses physiological, psychological, and social aspects of this midlife experience. The meaning of menopause or <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>symbolizes</b> to women in American society depends on multiple factors and differs among women. The assumption is that although menopause is a biological event, social meanings determine how a woman perceives and interprets the reality of that event. How this transition is experienced by women may depend on their cultural norms, social influences and personal knowledge about menopause. ^ The purpose of this phenomenological study is to Understand {{the complexities of the}} human experience of menopause in American women from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. The research question is “What is the meaning of menopause as experienced by American women?” The specific aims of this phenomenological study were to (a) examine and interpret the reality of the menopausal transition as experienced by American women and (b) identify common elements and themes that occur {{as a result of the}} complexities of this experience. Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with fifteen women who had experienced natural menopause. Three major themes were extracted during the data analysis: (a) expectations and realization, (b) sorting things out, and (c) a new life phase. Although some women expressed similar thoughts in particular categories, no two women had the same experience of menopause. The data from this study support the premise that the experience of menopause in American women is unique and individualized and that the meaning or perspective differs among women. The data revealed the complexities of this human experience by explicating personal meanings related to experiences, expectations, attitudes and beliefs about menopause. ...|$|E

Para isso, será levada em conta a teoria de Joseph Campbell em O Herói de Mil Faces (2007), em que desenvolve um estudo da jornada heroica, possibilitando a compreensão de como Frodo se estabelece como herói, de que maneira ocorre sua jornada e sua busca pela liberdade. O “Um Anel”, objeto responsável pela jornada de Frodo, será analisado de acordo com o poder que representa na história a fim de justificar o papel que o objeto anel desempenha e o que simboliza conforme as definições de Vries (1976) e Chevalier (2006).

40|$|This master thesis investigates how tattoos {{can affect}} teachers’ {{professional}} {{appearance in the}} Norwegian school. How are tattoos perceived in encounters with other teachers, principals, pupils and parents, {{as well as how}} does the tattooed teacher reflect around the probability that their position as a role model can be challenged because of their tattoos. Through this study I also reflect around what the position of tattoos is in todays society, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>symbolizes</b> to be visibly tattooed and what boundaries the tattooed must relate to. The aim is to understand the limits of acceptance {{in the context of the}} expectations to the teacher role, and thereby create an awareness of how being tattooed can affect the individuals professional role in the workplace. A focus that has not been researched to such an extent in other papers and books. The main questions in this paper is: 1) How is being a tattooed teacher perceived in the face of their own and others expectations of the teacher role, and what consequences do the tattoos have for their professional role? 2) What significance does the teachers base their tattoos on and which elements do they emphasize as important? 3) Which differences have the teachers experienced in gender expectations with regard to the use and attitudes towards being tattooed? In this paper I have used qualitative depth- and group interviews with tattooed teachers and non-tattooed principals. By interviewing both teachers and principals I was able to compare the teachers’ understandings with the principals, and I was also able to identify the attitudes of authorities, given their position as the norm setters in the institution. My theoretical inspiration in this paper is based on micro sociology, and especially the interactional perspective. The findings show that there are some normative boundary issues in terms of what is considered acceptable in the face of the teacher role, which also means tattoos can have an impact on whether one emerges as professional or not. The problems associated with the teacher role is that the established expectations of what the teacher role involves relate to individuals subjective interpretations. Specifically, the analysis shows that the tattooed boundaries mainly includes design-related limits and location/visibility of tattoos, but it can also be influenced by the tattoo quantity and size. Teachers internalises the expectations to the teacher role and professional identity as a part of their personal identity. Although informants believe that they haven’t taken their occupational position in account in the choice of tattoos. I will argue that they have done it, but then more unconsciously. Tattoos that have negative connotations aren’t interesting for the teachers, because it challenges not only their professional identity, but also a part of their personal identity. Furthermore, my findings suggest that the difference in gender expectations also results in that the tattooed women and men probably have to negotiate professionalism differently, because of varying expectation...|$|E
