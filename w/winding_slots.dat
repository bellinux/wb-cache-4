The thesis includes {{a number of}} main tasks related to the application of {{permanent magnet}}s in concentrated <b>winding</b> open <b>slot</b> machines. Suitable analytical methods are required for the first design calculations of a new machine. Concentrated winding machines differ from conventional integral <b>slot</b> <b>winding</b> machines {{in such a way}} that adapted analytical calculation methods are needed. A simple analytical model for calculating the concentrated winding axial flux machines is provided. The next three main design tasks are discussed in more detail in the thesis. The magnetic length of the rotor surface magnet machines is studied, and it is shown that the traditional methods have to be modified also in this respect. An important topic in this study has been to evaluate and minimize the rotor permanent magnet Joule losses by using segmented magnets in the calculations and experiments. Determination of the magnetizing and leakage inductances for a concentrated winding machine and the torque production capability of concentrated winding machines with different pole pair numbers are studied, and the results are compared with the corresponding properties of integral <b>slot</b> <b>winding</b> machines.

The tooth tips and slotting effects during open-circuit, armature reaction, and on-load conditions are considered when deriving the model and developing its solutions. The model derivations and field solutions are extended from a previous model, and {{can be applied to}} PM machines with any combinations of slot and pole numbers and any magnetization patterns in the magnets. This model is initially formulated according to Laplace 2 ̆ 7 s and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s equations in 2 -D polar coordinates by the separation of variables technique in four subdomains, such as magnet, airgap, <b>winding</b> <b>slots,</b> and slot-openings. The field solution of each subdomain is obtained applying the appropriate boundary conditions and interface conditions between every two subdomains, respectively, which can precisely account for the mutual influence between slots. Finite element analysis (FEA) is later deployed to validate the analytical results in a surface-mounted PM machine that has nonoverlapping winding arrangement. For validation purposes, PM machines having 3 -slot/ 2 -pole with parallel magnetization and 12 -slot/ 10 -pole with either parallel or radial magnetizations are used for comparisons. Computation of global quantities for the motor which include the phase back-EMF and cogging torque is also included.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} stator design that {{consists}} {{of a combination of}} an alternate <b>slot</b> <b>winding</b> and dummy <b>slots</b> to minimize pulsating torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors. The alternate arrangement of winding coils is designed to eliminate a harmonic component of back electromotive force that gives rise to a harmonic component of pulsating torque. However, the non-uniform arrangement of slots decreases the frequency of the cogging torque by half and may aggravate torque pulsation. To compensate for the drawback or the decrease in the frequency of the cogging torque, dummy slots are introduced in the alternately slotted stator. A theoretical method is developed for the proposed stator combination. The proposed stator design is applied to a prototype in combination with other rotor magnet design techniques, such as magnet shifting and the adjustment of magnet width, to minimize pulsating torque. The results show that the designed motor reduces the ripple factor of the torque by approximately 30 % relative to the original value. In addition, the proposed alternate <b>slot</b> <b>winding</b> is validated by comparing the design with equal slot-winding designs optimized through finite-element method analysis...|$|R
