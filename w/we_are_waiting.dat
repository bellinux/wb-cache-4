2500|$|Cao Cao {{turned to}} Tian Chou, who was {{familiar}} with the area and had run-ins with the Wuhuan before, for advice regarding this situation. Tian Chou notified Cao Cao of a disused road that led to the abandoned Former Han frontier lands. From there the army can march through undefended territory and attack the Wuhuan where they least expect it, and by doing so [...] "Tadun's head can be taken without a single battle", Tian Chou said. Cao Cao, most pleased, accepted the plan and led his army back (presumably to Wuzhong). He had his men erect signs on the roads by the water, which wrote [...] "It is the middle of summer, and the road is impassable. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for autumn or winter to resume the advance." [...] Enemy scouts saw the sign and apparently believed that Cao Cao really retreated. As Tian Chou had predicted, the Wuhuan were convinced that any force that could not advance through the plains had to turn back, which was a miscalculation most grave.|$|E
