In the wake of a famous battle, especially one that marked the culmination of a war such as Ulundi on 4 July 1879, every European involved in the battle appeared to want to own an object that could serve as a reminder of the event.|$|E

As recording progressed, [...] "Yellow" [...] {{was one of a}} couple of songs that they [...] "couldn't quite get on analogue". They recorded different versions but it did not satisfy their taste. So Nelson used Pro Tools [...] "to get the feel of [...] just right"; once all takes were recorded into the computer, [...] "we then put it down to the 2-inch, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> was a great way to do it", according to Nelson.|$|E

And then something drives him to fight up, and that moment when he comes up and grasps for breath, he is reborn again, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> weirdly reflective of the scene where Dany is held aloft at the end of season three." ...|$|E

500|$|The Yeates {{case was}} {{mentioned}} during a Parliamentary debate {{on a private}} member's {{bill that would have}} imposed a sentence of six-months imprisonment on any journalist who names an uncharged suspect. The proposed legislation was introduced into the House of Commons in June 2010, by Anna Soubry, the Conservative MP for Broxtowe, a former journalist and criminal law barrister. In a debate on 4 February 2011 Soubry told the House: [...] "What we saw in Bristol was, in effect, a feeding frenzy and vilification. Much of the coverage was not only completely irrelevant, but there was a homophobic tone to it <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> deeply offensive. The slurs on the man were out of order." [...] She withdrew the proposal after encountering opposition from the Conservative-led coalition government.|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E
500|$|As {{confirmed}} in January 2014, a new court show conceived by Sheindlin titled Hot Bench debuted on September 15, 2014. The courtroom series features {{a panel of}} three judges debating and deciding on cases brought to their TV courtroom. Stated Sheindlin, [...] "When my husband Jerry and I were in Ireland recently, we visited the courts and watched a three judge bench, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> both fascinating and compelling. I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds {{to serve as the}} judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench." [...] The panel of judges consist of New York State Supreme Court judge Patricia DiMango, and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman. As with Judge Judy, Hot Bench is executive-produced by Randy Douthit, and produced by CBS Television Distribution. It {{is important to note that}} Sheindlin originally desired the title of her personal courtroom series to be [...] "Hot Bench" [...] before producers ultimately settled on [...] "Judge Judy." ...|$|E

500|$|After Bradfield {{sent her}} a demo of the album track [...] "I Don't Need Anyone", Minogue was {{dissatisfied}} with the lyrical content and re-wrote the track herself. Despite this, Minogue found it [...] "difficult" [...] to write the song so Bradfield had taken pieces of the original demo lyrics and mixed them with other lyrics she had written to create the finishing product of [...] "I Don't Need Anyone". She found this method of writing [...] "intriguing" [...] and {{wanted to do it}} again, so she decided to do this with [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", writing it alongside Bradfield and Sean Moore. Minogue commented about this method, saying [...] "He took one half of one set [...] and took another half from another set of lyrics and merged them together, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> interesting because it was something I wouldn't have done because, in my mind they're two separate things." [...] She later commented that she felt it worked together. Lyrically, the song is about her being happy and said [...] "To me the song is about being able, not necessarily shut your eyes and feel that someone is there but they way where you are close to someone [...] the ability to feel like they're with you even if they are a million miles away." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Ray Parkin edited a {{definitive}} account of Cook's voyage of 1768–1771, transcribing the Endeavour's original log, Cook's Journal and accounts by {{other members of}} the crew. Parkin transcribed the relevant Journal entry as [...] "...anchored in 4 fathom about a mile from the shore and then made a signal for the boats to come onboard, after which I went myself and bouy’d the channel <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> very narrow and the harbour much smaller than I had been told but very convenient for our purpose." [...] The log for 14 June also mentions the ship's boats sounding the way for the crippled Endeavour. Nevertheless, the influence of McIntyre's interpretation can still be seen in contemporary Australian school curriculum materials.|$|E

The advance south of the road reached as far as the churchyard, but was driven back. The attack north of the road could not break the Confederate line. Wilcox described the action as [...] "a bloody repulse to the enemy, rendering entirely useless to him his little success of the morning at Fredericksburg." [...] Hooker expressed his disappointment in Sedgwick: [...] "my object in ordering General Sedgwick forward ... Was to relieve me from the position in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself at Chancellorsville. ... In my judgment General Sedgwick did not obey the spirit of my order, and made no sufficient effort to obey it. ...

2500|$|Molotov and Hitler {{resumed their}} discussions the next morning. [...] Molotov {{demanded to know}} why German troops were occupying Finland, while Hitler replied that they were {{traveling}} through Finland to Norway and wondered whether the Soviets intended {{to go to war}} over Finland. While Hitler agreed that Finland was within the Soviets' sphere of influence, he also stressed that Germany had a legitimate wartime interest in Finland's nickel and wood supply and that any new conflict in the Baltics would lead to a severe strain in relations. [...] Molotov concluded that nothing good could come from further talks about Finland and stated that he saw no signs of any resumption of a Soviet-Finland conflict. According to Hitler, however, Molotov stated that [...] "Russia felt herself again endangered by Finland, Russia should be able to liquidate Finland" [...] which for him [...] "was the first question <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> difficult to answer.

[...] He had no more than got the words out of his mouth before he yelled, [...] "My God, I am shot." [...] I heard this cry and looked around, Buffalo Chips was falling over into the hole where the Indians were hiding. [...] Bat was looking into the cave where the Indians were, and about five seconds afterwards jumped out with an Indian’s scalp in his hand, telling me that he had scalped one of the redskins alive, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out to be true. [...] He had seen the Indian that killed Buffalo Chips, and he jumped down onto him as the Indian was reaching to get White’s six-shooter. [...] Bat had jumped right down on top of him and scalped him and got out of the cave before anybody knew what he was doing." [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] White was a boyhood friend of Col. Cody and also a scout. He wanted to be like Buffalo Bill and acquired the sobriquet [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] when Gen. Phillip Sheridan said he was more like Buffalo Chips than Buffalo Bill. Major Bourke described him as a [...] "good-natured liar who played Sancho Panza to Buffalo Bill’s Don Quixote." [...] Gen. [...] Charles King said he was a good man.|$|E

2500|$|Across that {{threshold}} I {{had been}} afraid to cross, things suddenly seemed so very simple. There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will. [...] I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> myself, and let myself be ruled by it. [...] God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things. [...] To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust. [...] Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him. [...] The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me {{no matter what it}} might bring. [...] The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained to remind me of the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self. [...] But it no longer depressed me. [...] I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.|$|E

I mean, he doesn’t look like a normal guy. And {{when you read the}} book, you think, ‘Who on the planet can live up to this description?’ But I think he does. He’s just got that chiseled face that photographs exactly like it’s described in the book. When you read about the sculptured cheeks and chiseled jawbone and everything, it’s like, ‘Wow. Did she write this for Rob?" [...] Pattinson, in a detailed interview on how he perceives the character, admitted to having incorporated aspects of Rebel Without a Cause into his portrayal of Edward, assessing; [...] "I guess kind of the thing <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> interesting is that he is essentially the hero of this story but violently denies that he is the hero. Like at every point even when he does heroic things he still thinks that he’s [...] the most ridiculously selfish evil creature around. [...] He refuses to accept Bella’s love for him {{but at the same time}} can’t help but just kind of needs it, which is kind of what the essential storyline is." [...] Appearing at ComicCon in July 2008 while the film was in post-production, Pattinson surmised the Twilight experience as: [...] "bizarre. You kind of know that it is essentially the book. The book has so many obsessive, obsessively loyal fans. It's strange because people just immediately relate you to the character right away rather than you as an actor." [...] Pattinson reprised his role as Edward in all of the Twilight sequels.|$|E
