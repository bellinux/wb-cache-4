5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, {{the only option}} was to record the music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit.

After the film's second preview screening, McQueen <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> <b>with</b> the music and used his clout to hire Quincy Jones to rescore the film. Jones's music had a jazzier edge and featured harmonica solos by Toots Thielemans and vocals by Don Elliott, both {{of whom had been}} his associates. Peckinpah <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> <b>with</b> this action and took out a full-page ad in Daily Variety on November 17, 1972, including a letter he had written to Fielding thanking him for his work. Fielding would work with Peckinpah on two more films, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974) and The Killer Elite (1975). Jones was nominated for a Golden Globe award for his original score.|$|E

Although the series' first 20 segments were successful, Bakshi wanted to leave Terrytoons to form his own company. In 1967, he drew up presentation pieces for a fantasy series called Tee-Witt, with help from Anzilotti, Johnnie Zago and Bill Foucht.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{initially}} envisioned Toy Story 2 as a direct-to-video sequel. The film began {{production in}} a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, {{as most of the}} main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar <b>was</b> <b>unhappy</b> <b>with</b> the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.|$|E

The 1551–52 sessions convened by Pope Julius III at the supposedly ecumenical Council of Trent solved none of the larger religious issues but simply restated Catholic teaching and condemned Protestant teaching as heresies.|$|E
