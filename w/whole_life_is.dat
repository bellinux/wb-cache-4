25|$|The storyline {{reached its}} climax in March 2003. On-screen the character’s plans to abscond with Ricky {{and her son}} (on the night of her {{surprise}} birthday party) were thwarted by Barry’s discovery of the affair – leading to a public confrontation between the three protagonists. Shaun Williamson who played Barry has commented “Barry is absolutely devastated as his <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> ripped apart. He can’t believe Nat has betrayed him. He loves his life with Natalie and Jack, and {{would do anything to}} make it work as a family again. Losing Natalie is going to be really difficult for Barry, but I think the hardest thing will be losing his son.” The storyline signified the end of the characters’ three-year marriage and in a final plot twist Natalie opted to finish with Ricky and leave Walford alone, having discovered that he had recently slept with his ex-wife Samantha.|$|E

[...] The move was delayed for ten years, during which she travelled whenever possible, and when it took place in 1955, she perceived {{it to be a}} mistake. Her brother Ewald's death in 1956 left her the only survivor of the fourteen children of Anne-Marie and Johann Heinrich Bosse. [...] "How I long desperately for Stockholm", she wrote to a friend in 1958. [...] "My <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> there."

In terms of his character Jackman views Wolverine as [...] "the ultimate outsider" [...] and that [...] "the great battle, I always thought with Wolverine, is the battle within himself". Regarding Logan's struggle with extreme life longevity, Jackman said, [...] "He realizes everyone he loves dies, and his <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> full of pain. So it's better that he just escapes. He can't die really. He just wants {{to get away from}} everything." [...] Jackman stated that he ate six meals a day in preparation for the role. Jackman contacted Dwayne Johnson for some tips on bulking up for the film. Johnson suggested that for six months, he gain a pound a week, by eating 6,000 calories a day which consisted of [...] "an awful lot of chicken, steak and brown rice".|$|E

2500|$|Reading the First Meditation as {{an effort}} to coax Aristotelians away from their {{customary}} opinions allows us to read different interpretations into the different stages of doubt. For instance, there is some debate as to whether Descartes intended his famous [...] "Dream Argument" [...] to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming—that though there is waking experience, I can never know which moments are dreams and which are waking—or the possibility of a universal dream—that my <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> a dream and that there is no waking world. If we read Descartes as suggesting the universal possibility of dreaming, we can explain an important distinction between the Dream Argument and the later [...] "Evil Demon Argument". The latter suggests that all we know is false and that we cannot trust the senses one bit. The Dream Argument, if meant to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming, suggests only that the senses are not always and wholly reliable. The Dream Argument questions Aristotelian epistemology, while the Evil Demon Argument does away with it altogether. The Painter's Analogy, which draws on the Dream Argument, concludes that mathematics and other purely cerebral studies are far more certain than astronomy or physics, which is an important step away from the Aristotelian reliance on the senses and toward Cartesian rationalism.|$|E

[...] Her approbation and unremitting kindness, when we were both very young indeed, kindled the latest sparks of genius to a flame, which she now gazes on with wonder and delight. [...] Let this not appear like vanity. [...] Recollect what I am, and you will find it proceeds from a better source. [...] She cannot have so much pleasure in seeing the plant she has so kindly cherished in such a thriving state, as I have in seeing the plant she has so kindly cherished in such a thriving state, as I have in seeing her united to a man every way worthy of her, and whose <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> devoted to her happiness in short, they form a harmony seldom to be met with – their souls are in unison. [...] The end of this history is, that it is impossible to me to go to Lord Harcourt's this summer how I shall excuse myself I know not; but I know everything forbids me refusing to stay with my earliest friend." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1891, Chamberlain visited Bosnia and Herzegovina as a journalist. In 1878, the Ottoman {{provinces of}} Bosnia-Herzegovina were {{occupied}} by Austria-Hungary; {{though the two}} provinces remained nominally Ottoman until 1908, in practice {{they were part of}} the Austrian empire from 1878 onwards. Because Bosnia-Herzegovina was still officially part of the Ottoman Empire, neither province was represented in the Austrian Reichsrat or the Hungarian Diet, and instead the two provinces were in practice a colony of Austria-Hungary. Chamberlain had been commissioned by the Austrian government to write propaganda glorying its colonial rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina for a Geneva newspaper. Chamberlain's Bosnia articles reveal his increasing preference for dictatorship over democracy with Chamberlain praising the Austrians for having utterly no democratic aspects to their rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Chamberlain wrote that what he had seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the perfect example of Wagner's dictum: [...] "Absolute monarch-free people!" [...] Chamberlain declared that the Bosnians were extremely lucky not to have the shambles and chaos of a democratic [...] "parliamentary regime", instead being ruled by an idealist, enlightened dictatorship that did what was best for them. Equally important in Chamberlain's Bosnian articles was his celebration of [...] "natural man" [...] who lived on the land as a small farmer as opposed to what Chamberlain saw as the corrupt men who lived in modern industrial, urban society. At the time Chamberlain visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, the provinces had been barely touched by modernization, and for the most part, Bosnians continued to live much as their ancestors had done in the Middle Ages. Chamberlain was enchanted with what he saw, and forgetting for the moment that the purpose of his visit was to glorify Austrian rule, expressed much sadness in his articles that the [...] "westernization" [...] being fostered by the Austrians would destroy the traditional way of life in Bosnia. Chamberlain wrote about the average Bosnian: He [...] builds his house, he makes his shoes, and plough, etc; the woman weaves and dyes the stuffs and cooks the food. When we have civilized these good people, when we have taken from them their beautiful costumes to be preserved in museums as objects of curiosity, when we have ruined their national industries that are so perfect and so primitive, when contact with us has destroyed the simplicity of their manner-then Bosnia will no longer be interesting to us. Chamberlain's awe and pride in the tremendous scientific and technological advances of the 19th century were always tempered with an extremely strong nostalgia for what he saw as the simpler, better and more innocent time when people lived on the land in harmony with nature. In his heart, Chamberlain was always a romantic conservative who idealised the Middle Ages and was never quite comfortable with the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution. In Bosnia, Chamberlain saw an essentially medieval society that still moved to the ancient rhythm of life that epitomized his pastoral ideal. Remembering Bosnia several years later, Chamberlain wrote: The spirit of a natural man, who does everything and must create everything for himself in life, is decidedly more universal and more harmoniously developed than the spirit of an industrial worker whose <b>whole</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> occupied with the manufacturing of a single object…and that only with the aid of a complicated machine, whose functioning is quite foreign to him. A similar degeneration is taking place amongst peasants: an American farmer in the Far West is today only a kind of subordinate engine driver. Also among us in Europe it becomes every day more impossible for a peasant to exist, for agriculture must be carried out in [...] "large units"-the peasant consequently becomes increasingly like an industrial worker. His understanding dries up; there is no longer an interaction between his spirit and surrounding Nature. Chamberlain's nostalgia for a pre-industrial way of life that he expressed so strongly in his Bosnia articles earned him ridicule as many believed that he had an absurdly idealized and romanticized view of the rural life that he never experienced first-hand.|$|E
