In this project a couple of sub-routines that are considered to be of particular interest in HYDA are refined.

Moreover, motion responses of three different platforms are evaluated and optimization of the non-conventional unit is assessed using HYDA. The results before and after optimization are listed and compared in this report. From the comparison it can be concluded that the width of the platform after optimization is significantly reduced while the eigenperiod increases.

40|$|The {{turbulent}} mixing in thin ocean surface boundary layers (OSBL), which occupy the upper 100 m {{or so of}} the ocean, control the exchange of heat and trace gases between the atmosphere and ocean. Here we show that current parameterizations of this {{turbulent mixing}} lead to systematic and substantial errors in the depth of the OSBL in global climate models, which then leads to biases in sea surface temperature. One reason, we argue, is that current parameterizations are missing key surface-wave processes that force Langmuir turbulence that deepens the OSBL more rapidly than steady <b>wind</b> <b>forcing.</b> <b>Scaling</b> arguments are presented to identify two dimensionless parameters that measure the importance of wave <b>forcing</b> against <b>wind</b> <b>forcing,</b> and against buoyancy forcing. A global perspective on the occurrence of waveforced turbulence is developed using re-analysis data to compute these parameters globally. The diagnostic study developed here suggests that turbulent energy available for mixing the OSBL is under-estimated without forcing by surface waves. Wave-forcing and hence Langmuir turbulence could be important over wide areas of the ocean and in all seasons in the Southern Ocean. We conclude that surfacewave- forced Langmuir turbulence is an important process in the OSBL that requires parameterization...|$|R

The objective of this experiment was to describe the coastal buoyancy jet formed by the outflow of water from Chesapeake Bay, its dispersion into midshelf, and the optical property changes that accompany these events. <b>Wind</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>scales</b> of 3 – 5 days were responsible for formation of the jet (downwelling favorable winds) and its dispersion (upwelling favorable winds). During downwelling favorable events the jet established itself along the coast with speeds exceeding 0. 5 m s⁻¹, slowing and becoming more stable as it progressed. Downwelling circulation helped maintain the jet against the coast, and variations in wind strength produced wavelike variations in jet width. During upwelling favorable events, water from the jet was dispersed into midshelf in a thin near-surface layer. Optical surrogates for dissolved organic matter (DOM), chlorophyll, and suspended particles were formed using data from a pumped optical absorption/attenuation meter (ac- 9). High loads of these materials were associated with the buoyancy jet and were subsequently dispersed into midshelf during upwelling events. During mature upwelling states, nearshore increases in chlorophyll and suspended particles mimicked the plume load, although relatively low levels of DOM made it separable from plume water by analysis of the optical signature.

40|$|International audience[1] Recent {{studies suggest}} that the {{variability}} in Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) properties in the Scotia Sea on time scales up to decadal may be linked to changes in the baroclinicity of the Weddell gyre, with vertical variations in the density structure at the gyre's northern edge acting to control the export of AABW over the South Scotia Ridge and toward the mid‐latitude South Atlantic. We test this hypothesis by analysing the AABW properties in fifteen occupations of the SR 1 b hydrographic section (1993 – 2009) in eastern Drake Passage alongside possible forcings as derived from atmospheric reanalysis data. We show that variability in the wind stress over the Weddell gyre leads changes in AABW properties in the SR 1 b section by approximately five months. The sign of the lagged correlation is consistent with the notion of the AABW export from the Weddell Sea being controlled by the gyre's baroclinic adjustment to <b>wind</b> <b>forcing</b> on time <b>scales</b> of several months.

To solve this problem, this paper presents a real-time whitecap rendering method applied to the visual system of a maritime simulator. The method takes the vertical acceleration on the wave crest as the criterion of whitecap generation. The Fourier coefficient of the vertical acceleration is provided, and a continuous mathematical model computing the whitecap coverage is built. The vertical acceleration is the variable of the model. The life time of the whitecap’s existence can be controlled by the parameter of the model, and the parameter is computed with the genetic algorithm. The average of the computed whitecap coverage {{is equal to the}} whitecap coverage computed by the stochastic method and is close to the whitecap coverage computed by the empirical formula.
