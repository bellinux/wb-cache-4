500|$|The game's four campaigns {{received}} {{criticism from}} reviewers. Simon Parkin from Eurogamer was divided over the campaigns, citing Leon's campaign as {{the strongest and}} [...] "the closest <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series' survival horror roots", along with Ada's as having [...] "diverse flavour". However, Parkin criticised the other two campaigns, stating that Jake's campaign [...] "rarely delights" [...] while citing that Chris' was a [...] "second-rate third-person sprint" [...] with [...] "idiotic" [...] cutscene dialogue. A reviewer from Edge also felt that the campaigns noticeably contrasted in quality more than others. Similarly, Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot concluded that the game's campaigns were the ultimate test of patience for [...] "even the most dedicated", while Destructoid cited Resident Evil 6 as not only a [...] "step back" [...] for the series due to the game's new and unconventional features, but a [...] "step back for commonplace, unassuming action-shooters".|$|E

500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finale, that time frame." ...|$|E

[...] Rihanna then shows her dressing room, makeup artists and costumes. She explains how she loves wearing black on stage because she is [...] "good girl gone bad and black is kind of gothic and rock n' roll". Rihanna explains how she is nervous before the beginning of the show because of the atmosphere where all of her fans are screaming her name. According to her, the beginning of the show is up-tempo and loud, before becoming a little bit [...] "mellow" [...] at the middle of it. The show then gets [...] "on party" [...] again with their techno club set-list. The encore consists of [...] "Question Existing" [...] and [...] "Umbrella". According to Rihanna, [...] "Question Existing" [...] is a very personal song which American singer Ne-Yo wrote [...] "on behalf of entertainers". She concluded that it is very hard for her to call herself a superstar. The Documentary Feature ends with Rihanna announcing that in the end of 2008 she will be hitting the studio again and [...] "she won't be away for too long".|$|E
500|$|The {{books have}} also been widely critiqued as promoting, normalizing, and idealizing an emotionally and {{physically}} abusive relationship. Sci-fi website io9 noted that Bella and Edward's relationship meets all fifteen criteria set by the National Domestic Violence Hotline for being in an abusive relationship. L. Lee Butler of Young Adult Library Services Association commented how he was unusually hesitant to stock the Twilight books in his library because he felt the books were [...] "robbing [...] of agency and normalizing stalking and abusive behavior." [...] Many female-oriented and feminist media outlets, like Jezebel, The Frisky, and Salon.com have decried Twilight as promoting an anti-woman message. Bitch magazine stated the novels [...] "had created a new, popular genre of [...] "abstinence porn", concluding that, [...] "In reality, the abstinence message—wrapped in the genre of abstinence porn—objectifies Bella in the same ways that 'real' porn might. The Twilight books conflate Bella losing her virginity {{with the loss of}} other things, including her sense of self and her very life. Such a high-stakes treatment of abstinence reinforces the idea that Bella is powerless, an object, a fact that is highlighted when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sex scenes in Breaking Dawn." [...] Ms. declared that Twilight promotes a physically abusive relationship and an anti-abortion message. [...] However, writer Angela Aleiss of Religion News Service said that contrary to popular opinion, Mormons do permit abortion when the mother's life is in danger. [...] Bella's refusal to abort her fetus, along with her quick marriage and pregnancy, instead underscore the Mormon emphasis on family.|$|E

500|$|In September 2015, after Marvel Studios was {{integrated}} into The Walt Disney Studios with Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter, {{it was reported}} that the studios' creative committee would have [...] "nominal" [...] input on the films moving forward, though would continue to consult on Marvel Television productions, which remained under Perlmutter's control. All key film decisions going forward will be made by Feige, D'Esposito and Victoria Alonso. At the end of the month, on how much story is developed for future films of the universe, Feige said there are [...] "broad strokes" [...] though sometime [...] "super-specific things. But for the most part, in broad strokes that are broad enough and loose enough that, if through the development of four of five movies before <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> culmination ... we still have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up. So that all the movies, hopefully when they're finished, will feel like they're all interconnected and meant to be and planned far ahead, but really can live and breathe enough as individual movies to be satisfying each and of themselves." [...] The studio also has various contingency plans for the direction of all of their films, in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, or re-acquire the film rights to a character, such as was done in February 2015 with Spider-Man.|$|E

2500|$|We can {{demonstrate}} {{there must be}} at least two people in London with the same number of hairs on their heads as follows. Since a typical human head has an average of around 150,000 hairs, {{it is reasonable to assume}} (as an upper bound) that no one has more than 1,000,000 hairs on their head [...] holes). There are more than 1,000,000 people in London ( [...] is bigger than 1million items). Assigning a pigeonhole to each number of hairs on a person's head, and assign people to pigeonholes according to the number of hairs on their head, there {{must be at least}} two people assigned to the same pigeonhole by the 1,000,001st assignment (because they have the same number of hairs on their heads) (or, [...] ).

2500|$|Wesley {{undergoes}} {{yet another}} drastic personality change in Angels fifth season {{following the death}} of his love, Fred. Denisof believes that the loss of Fred caused Wesley to become understandably [...] "unbalanced". [...] "By the time <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last few episodes, he's got a handle on the grief and is functioning in a more level-headed way," [...] says Denisof. [...] "But underlying it is a huge hole in his heart and it makes it possible for the decision that they make in the final episode. For him emotionally, the stage is set for a life or death battle, possibly for the last time, because at this point, there's nothing more for him to lose." [...] Denisof talked with Whedon about what storylines would have been in place had the television series received another season; Wesley would not have died, and he and Illyria would have featured in an arc in which the transformation of Illyria to Fred would have been extended over many episodes and taken to a [...] "much deeper, darker place" [...] than it briefly was in the late fifth-season episode, [...] "The Girl in Question". Denisof continues, They would have progressed the relationship between Wesley and Illyria in such a way it would conflict with his own feelings for Fred, in a much more profound way. And then we would have gone into the switching of Fred and Illyria and having these two people that he was having these strong feelings about. That {{was going to be a}} fairly long journey in the following season, all of which got abbreviated tremendously when [...] decided to cancel the show. The cancellation of the show was the inspiration for Wesley's death; Whedon gave Denisof the option of keeping the character alive, but Denisof believed killing the character was right for the story, [...] "It was very upsetting to read. It's too good a story because it hurts." ...|$|E
