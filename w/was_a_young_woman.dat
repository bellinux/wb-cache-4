5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12 on the usual cost plus fixed fee basis, with a fee of $22,500 per month plus $7,500 per {{racetrack}} for the first seven racetracks and $4,000 per additional racetrack. Workers were recruited in the Knoxville area. The typical recruit <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> a recent graduate of a local high school. Training was initially conducted at the University of Tennessee. Training switched to Berkeley from April to September 1943, where it {{was conducted on the}} XA calutron and a 1:16 scale model of the Alpha racetrack, and then to Oak Ridge when the XAX calutron became available. Some 2,500 operators would be required once all the Alpha II calutrons were available. The Tennessee Eastman payroll at Y-12 ballooned from 10,000 in mid-1944 to 25,000 in mid-1945. For security reasons, the trainees were not informed of the purpose of the equipment they were taught to operate.|$|E

25|$|Polyphonte <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> {{who fled}} home preferring {{the idea of}} a {{virginal}} life with Artemis to the conventional life of marriage and children favoured by Aphrodite.

She {{was raised in}} {{prosperity}} in Amherst, Massachusetts, in a 24-room house with half-siblings from her mother's previous marriage. The money in the family came from her mother's side. In 1852, Vorse's mother married Captain Charles Bernard Marvin, a wealthy shipping magnate and liquor merchant, more than 20 years her senior, when she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> of 18.

25|$|Sobhraj and Chowdhury {{committed}} {{their first}} (known) murders in 1975. Most {{of the victims}} had {{spent some time with}} the duo before their deaths and were, according to investigators, recruited by Sobhraj and Chowdhury to join the pair in their crimes. Investigators state that the victims had threatened to expose Sobhraj, which was his motive for murder. The first victim <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> from Seattle. Teresa Knowlton (named Jennie Bollivar in the book Serpentine) was found drowned in a tidal pool in the Gulf of Thailand. She was wearing a flowered bikini. It was only months later that Knowlton's autopsy, as well as forensic evidence, proved that her drowning, originally believed to be a swimming accident, was murder.|$|E
25|$|When Alice Liddell <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> {{she set out}} on a grand tour of Europe with Lorina and Edith. One {{story has}} it that she became a romantic {{interest}} of Prince Leopold, the youngest son of Queen Victoria, during the four years he spent at Christ Church, but the evidence for this is sparse. It is true that years later, Leopold named his first child Alice, and acted as godfather to Alice's second son Leopold. (A recent biographer of Leopold suggests it is far more likely that Alice's sister Edith was the true recipient of Leopold's attention.) Edith died on 26 June 1876, possibly of measles or peritonitis (accounts differ), shortly before she was to be married to Aubrey Harcourt, a cricket player. At her funeral on 30 June 1876, Prince Leopold served as a pall-bearer.|$|E

500|$|During the 2002 campaign, Fortuyn {{was accused}} {{of being on the}} [...] "extreme right", {{although}} others saw only certain similarities. While he employed anti-immigration rhetoric, he was neither a radical nationalist nor a defender of traditional authoritarian values.

500|$|Winnie Winkle is an American {{comic strip}} which {{appeared}} over a 76-year span (1920–96).
