5|$|Between his {{coronation}} and 1071, William consolidated {{his hold}} over England, defeating {{a number of}} rebellions that arose particularly {{in the north and}} west of the country. Immediately after Hastings, only those English noblemen who fought in the battle lost their lands, which were distributed to Normans and others from the continent who had supported William's invasion. The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh confiscations of English land, again distributed to William's continental followers. By 1086, <b>when</b> <b>William</b> ordered the compilation of Domesday Book to record landholders in England, most of the native English nobility had been replaced by Norman and other continental nobles.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{was first}} {{reported}} by Cyrus Lundell in 1931. A year later he informed Sylvanus Morley of the site's existence {{and the presence}} of more than 60 stelae. Morley visited the ruins himself on behalf of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1932. In the 1930s surveys mapped the site core and recorded 103 stelae. Investigations stopped in 1938 and archaeologists did not return to the site until 1982 <b>when</b> <b>William</b> J. Folan directed a project on behalf of the Universidad Autónoma de Campeche, working at Calakmul until 1994. Calakmul is now the subject of a large-scale project of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) under the direction of Ramón Carrasco.|$|E
5|$|Cassel was {{the capital}} of a chatellany (an {{administrative}} district) during the Middle Ages, serving as the administrative centre for an area comprising about fifty towns and villages. It {{was the site of}} a second battle that took place on 23 August 1328 involving Philip VI of France and a rebel force led by Nicolaas Zannekin. The rebels had driven the ruling Count Louis I out of Flanders and sought to press their advantage by occupying Cassel and attacking the French royal army nearby. Although they achieved some initial successes, the rebels were decisively defeated <b>when</b> <b>William</b> I, Count of Hainaut lent his support to the French side.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his age and}} ill health, Brown {{was able}} to speak only once per week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted {{on behalf of his}} campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. <b>When</b> <b>William</b> Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused to comment on the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term, Cleveland {{successfully}} nominated two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The first, Lucius Q.C. Lamar, {{was a former}} Mississippi Senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. <b>When</b> <b>William</b> Burnham Woods died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator, his service under the Confederacy two decades earlier caused many Republicans to vote against him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.|$|E
5|$|Gerard (died 21 May 1108) was Archbishop of York between 1100 and 1108 and Lord Chancellor of England from 1085 until 1092. A Norman, he was {{a member}} of the cathedral clergy at Rouen before {{becoming}} a royal clerk under King William I of England and subsequently his son King William II Rufus. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the Bishopric of Hereford in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king's hunting party <b>when</b> <b>William</b> II was killed, as he is known to have witnessed the first charter issued by the new king, Henry I of England, within days of William's death.|$|E

5|$|Rebuilding work did {{not begin}} in earnest until 1863, <b>when</b> <b>William</b> Gibbs had the {{property}} substantially remodelled in a Gothic Revival style. William Cubitt & Co. were the builders and John Norton was the architect. Norton's design enveloped the original house. He added an extra floor, two new wings and towers. Norton emphasised the importance of architectural continuity in restoration and rebuilding relating to several historical periods. As a result, while some walls remained plain, others were adorned with Gothic and naturalistic carvings {{to fit in with}} the previous architectural styles.|$|E
5|$|The Rode Estate {{had been}} {{owned by the}} Rode family {{since at least the}} 14th century, <b>when</b> <b>William</b> de Rode bore arms for Edward II. The estate was {{purchased}} in 1669 by Roger Wilbraham for the sum of £2,400 (equivalent to £ in 2015), from his cousin Randle Rode. The Wilbrahams were prominent local landowners and descended from Sir Richard de Wilburgham, the Sheriff of Cheshire in the mid13th century. The estate passed through the male line until 1900 when General Sir Richard Wilbraham died, leaving it to his only daughter Katherine. Katherine's husband, George Baker, assumed by royal licence the surname Wilbraham. In 1910, George succeeded to the Baker baronetcy on the death of his elder brother.|$|E
5|$|The state {{legislature}} decided during Houston's third senatorial term not to re-elect him, so {{he ran for}} the office of Governor of Texas, losing to Hardin Richard Runnels. He was still in Washington <b>when</b> <b>William</b> (Willie) Rogers Houston was born on May 25, 1858, their last child born in the Woodland home. In order to satisfy creditors of his gubernatorial campaign debts, Houston was forced to sell the house to his political supporter J. Carroll Smith. He subsequently defeated incumbent Runnels with a second bid for the office during a period when the populace was bitterly divided over the issue of secession from the United States, and was sworn in December 31, 1859.|$|E

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>William</b> Ogilvy, 8th Lord Banff, died on 4 June 1803, {{the estate}} was {{inherited}} by his sister Jean (sometimes named Jane), who had married George Abercromby (Abercrombie) of Birkenbog. Her son, Sir Robert Abercromby succeeded her. Sir Robert was appointed member of Parliament for the Banff constituency in 1812 but {{four years later}} claimed financial difficulties prevented him seeking re-election. In 1820 he asked George IV to allow the Banff peerage, which had become dormant or extinct when the 8th Lord Banff died, to continue by declaring his mother Baroness Banff, or granting him the title of Lord Banff, but the request was denied.|$|E
5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, <b>when</b> <b>William</b> Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E
5|$|Astley {{emerged during}} the Early Middle Ages as a {{township}} in the parish of Leigh. It was mentioned in documents in 1210, when Hugh of Tyldesley, Lord of the Manors of Tyldesley and Astley, granted land to Cockersand Abbey. In 1212, he was recorded as tenant of Astley Hall, the manor house for both Astley and Tyldesley, located just inside the Tyldesley township. After his death, his son Henry inherited the manors. He was succeeded by his son, another Henry, who, {{when he died in}} 1301, divided the lands between three of his six sons. It is from this division that the manors of Astley and Tyldesley were separated. Tyldesleys lived at the Astley manor until April 1353 when Richard Radcliff bought it for 100 marks. The Radcliffs remained there until 1561 <b>when</b> <b>William</b> Radcliff died childless and the land passed to his half-sister Anne, who married Gilbert Gerard.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{retired in}} 1967. In the 1980s, Scuderia made a {{comeback}} <b>when</b> <b>Williams</b> entered her in West Coast nostalgia drag races, crashing at Fremont. He restored {{the car and}} returned to racing in the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{however, the}} company was left without a partner <b>when</b> <b>Williams</b> chose to switch to Toyota power, and Scuderia Toro Rosso made the switch to Ferrari engines (as used in 2006 by their mother team Red Bull Racing).|$|R
