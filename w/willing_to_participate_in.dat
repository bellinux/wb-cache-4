5|$|For much of {{its first}} century, {{enrollment}} at Texas A was restricted to white men who were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> the Corps of Cadets and receive military training. During this time, {{a limited number of}} women were allowed to attend classes but forbidden from gaining a degree. During World War I, 49% of A graduates were in military service, and in 1918, the senior class was mustered into military service to fight in France. During World War II, Texas A produced over 20,000 combat troops, contributing more officers than both the United States Military Academy and United States Naval Academy combined.|$|E
5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> the plot, to {{distract}} Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference {{with him after}} school. Since Susan {{is one of his}} better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.|$|E

Russian Empire was very <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> efforts to resolve the crisis because it was afraid that Austria-Hungary might increase its influence in Montenegro and use the crisis to invade and annex Albania. Serbia and Italy also believed that Austria-Hungary {{was responsible for the}} revolt in Albania and suspected that Austria had plans to intervene in Albania.|$|E
25|$|Nevada State Prison {{had been}} the state-designated {{facility}} for hangings since 1903. At the urging of the Mormon population, the Nevada Legislature passed a statute in 1910 that became effective in January 1911, which allowed condemned prisoners to choose between execution by shooting or hanging. Only Mircovich and one other inmate selected shooting. However, the other prisoner's sentence was commuted. Warden Cowing tried to talk Mircovich out of his decision. Mircovich {{did not want to}} be hanged and insisted on being shot, claiming it would be quicker. Cowing was faced with a predicament in meeting the scheduled execution date of August 29, 1912, because he was unable to find five marksmen <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> a firing squad.|$|E
25|$|Less {{is usually}} {{known about the}} {{pressures}} models in the industry face, but striving hard {{to meet the requirements}} of their agency or brand is a main facet. Among the group, 69% were told to tone up, while 62% cited that their agencies required them to lose weight or change their body shape. Another 54% of models; however, revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply.  Hence, models habitually weigh themselves under the healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) level. A study published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, discovered that a majority of models had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.41, which qualifies for anorexia. In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6-8 to 0-2. The average weight of a typical model in the United States was also recorded to be twenty-three percent less than an average woman in society. This phenomenon has caused countless of models to suffer from illness such as eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. In extreme cases, some models have died due to complications caused by eating disorders. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely death of two models; Luisel Ramos, and Ana Carolina Reston. Both girls suffered complications from their eating disorders, and were severely underweight. Owing to the intensifying burdens, an high number of models are therefore <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> intensive exercise regimes, diets, fasts, and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse, while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{also had}} {{problems}} recruiting men from Pennsylvania: lingering resentment {{due to the}} recently settled border dispute between Virginia and Pennsylvania meant that few Pennsylvanians were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> an expedition headed by a Virginian. Clark's controversial attempt to draft Pennsylvanians into service created even more ill will. One Pennsylvanian who supported Clark was Colonel Archibald Lochry, commander of the Westmoreland County militia. On July 4, 1781, Lochry wrote to Joseph Reed, the President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania: ...|$|E
500|$|Elements of the {{expedition}} departed in mid-July from the Saint Lawrence River. [...] As the Quebec party ascended the Saint-François River, a Huron died in an accident. This {{was viewed as a}} bad portent by many of the Indians, and the Hurons turned back. [...] Among the Iroquois from Montreal, who traveled via Lake Champlain, some men fell sick and the rest refused to continue, in what some contemporaries thought was a ruse by the Iroquois to avoid conflict. [...] Vaudreuil believed this was the case, and reports reached the English at Albany that the Iroquois had deliberately chosen to abandon {{the expedition}} [...] "not to join war against New England." [...] Despite these setbacks, Vaudreuil ordered Hertel de Rouville to press on, even if he received no further reinforcements. [...] When his company reached Lake Winnipesaukee, he found that no eastern Indians <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> the expedition had been found. [...] Hertel de Rouville was consequently left with a band of about 160 men, which limited his options for raiding targets to places that were less fortified.|$|E

500|$|After the {{supporting}} tour for 9, Mercyful Fate {{was put on}} hiatus. King Diamond focused on his eponymous band, along with guitarist Mike Wead, who joined the group during the European House of God tour. Hank Shermann and Bjarne T. Holm reunited with Michael Denner to form Force of Evil, while Sharlee D'Angelo joined the band Arch Enemy. When asked about {{the current state of}} the band in 2008, Diamond stated that Mercyful Fate is currently [...] "hibernating", and that [...] "it's definitely not finished, at least in my book." [...] In August 2008, King Diamond was asked by Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich if Mercyful Fate would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> Activision's [...] video game. Ulrich requested the original masters for two of the band's songs, so they could be used in the game. Unable to locate them, Diamond suggested to Activision the band re-record the songs, and as a result, King Diamond, Hank Shermann, Michael Denner, Timi Hansen and Bjarne T. Holm reunited to re-record the songs [...] "Evil" [...] and [...] "Curse of the Pharaohs". King Diamond was also made into a playable character in the game.|$|E
500|$|Irons {{proposed}} that costly signalling theory could explain costly religious behaviour. He argued that hard-to-fake religious displays enhanced trust and solidarity in a community, producing emotional and economic benefits. He showed that display signals among the Yomut Turkmen of northern Iran helped to secure trade agreements. These [...] "ostentatious" [...] displays signalled commitment to Islam to strangers and group members. Sosis demonstrated {{that people in}} religious communities are {{four times more likely}} to live longer than their secular counterparts, and that these longer lifespans were positively correlated with the number of costly requirements demanded from religious community members. However, confounding variables may not have been excluded. Wood found that religion offers a subjective feeling of well-being within a community, where costly signalling protects against free riders and helps to build self-control among committed members. Iannaccone studied the effects of costly signals on religious communities. In a self-reported survey, as the strictness of a church increased, the attendance and contributions to that church increased proportionally. In effect, people were more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> a church that has more stringent demands on its members. Despite this observation, costly donations and acts conducted in a religious context does not itself establish that membership in these clubs is actually worth the entry costs imposed.|$|E
