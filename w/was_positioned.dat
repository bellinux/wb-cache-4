5|$|The castle {{was built}} {{as part of}} this {{programme}} of work.

5|$|The castle's deer park, which {{merged into}} the larger Rising Chase, <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> behind the castle {{in a similar way}} to that at Devizes Castle. The castle {{effectively}} formed an interface between the town and the park; the great hall in the keep faced the settlement, and the lord's chamber overlooked the park, creating a symbolic divide between the public and private aspects of the building.|$|E
5|$|The final {{official}} designation, assigned in 1938, was PanzerkampfwagenI (M.G.) {{with special}} ordnance number Sd.Kfz. 101. The first 150 tanks (1./LaS, 1st series LaS, Krupp-Traktor), produced in 1934, {{did not include}} the rotating turret and were used for crew training. Following these, production was switched to the combat version of the tank. The Ausf.A was under-armoured, with steel plate of only 13millimeters (0.51in) at its thickest. The tank had several design flaws, including suspension problems, which made the vehicle pitch at high velocities, and engine overheating. The driver <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> inside the chassis and used conventional steering levers to control the tank, while the commander <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> in the turret where he also acted as gunner. The two crewmen could communicate by means of a voice tube. Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five bins, containing various numbers of 25-round magazines. 1,190 of the Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. A were built in three series (2.-4./LaS). Further 25 were built as command tanks.|$|E

The hull was subdivided by three transverse and three longitudinal watertight bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|The station <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> on the {{southern}} edge of Rushbeds Wood, a surviving part of the Bernwood Forest. It was on the western side of the level crossing over Kingswood Lane.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 17th century, {{possibly}} around 1600, a new hall was built in stone to replace the older timber-framed one; it <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> to the south, replacing the earlier 15th-century extension. The new hall was slightly anachronistic, having only one floor, unlike most new halls from this period which had two storeys. The old hall was then probably adapted for use as a service area.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes parallel with the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them <b>was</b> <b>positioned.</b>|$|E

5|$|Documents {{regarding}} the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece, the artist, patron, place of installation and {{date of completion}} are all known. It was intended as the centrepiece for the chapel, and Rolin approached van der Weyden around 1443, when the hospital was founded. The altarpiece was ready by 1451, the year the chapel was consecrated. Painted in van der Weyden's Brussels workshop– most likely {{with the aid of}} apprentices – the completed panels were then transported to the hospice. The altarpiece is first mentioned in a 1501 inventory, when it <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> on the high altar.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle was not {{a primary}} {{strategic}} target for Scottish attack, as it <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> away from the main routes through the region, but it was kept well garrisoned during the Scottish wars. The surrounding manor of Embleton had nonetheless suffered from Scottish raids and Gaunt had concerns over {{the condition of the}} castle's defences, ordering the building of additional fortifications around the gatehouse. Part of the surrounding lands around the castle may have been brought into agricultural production at this time, either to feed a growing garrison, or to protect the crops against Scottish attacks.|$|E
5|$|Establishing {{themselves}} {{along the}} Mersing–Jemaluang road, 'D' Company was deployed {{to the north}} {{on the western side}} of the road as the lookout force, while 'B' Company <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> further to the south {{on the opposite side of}} the road. South of them, 'A' Company formed the blocking force, with their position stretched across the road oriented to the north. Behind them, 'C' Company <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> in reserve, further south. The plan had been for the ambush to be sprung during the day, but the Japanese advance had proceeded more slowly than thought, and it was not until after dark that they entered the ambush site. In order to inflict as many casualties as possible, the Japanese force, which was estimated to be battalion-sized, was allowed to pass through 'D' and 'B' Companies. By 3:00am they came up against 'A' Company's blocking position and the ambush was finally initiated. Devastating indirect fire from artillery and mortars inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese; however, as the northernmost company—'D'—turned south to attack the Japanese from the rear, they came up against determined resistance from a force of Japanese that had managed to infiltrate the ambush site and dig in on a small feature to the east of the estate's pig farm, north of 'B' Company. This effectively cut them off from the rest of the battalion.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941, the British Government {{anticipated}} {{an invasion}} of Greece by the Germans and decided to send troops to support the Greeks, who were already engaged against the Italians in Albania. The 2nd New Zealand Division {{was one of a}} number of Allied units dispatched to Greece in early March. The 18th Battalion was the first New Zealand unit to depart Egypt, and sailed for Greece on 7 March aboard the Royal Navy cruisers HMS Orion and Ajax. The 2nd New Zealand Division was tasked with the defence of the Aliakmon Line in northern Greece and <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> on the northern side of Mount Olympus; the 4th Brigade manned the left side of the New Zealand section of the line while the 6th Brigade took the right. The 18th Battalion was the first complete unit in the line; one company <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> in Olympus Pass itself while the remainder started digging in the sector allocated to 4th Brigade. By 5 April, the battalion's defensive work was completed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} main match, Goldberg faced Chris Jericho. In {{the early stages}} of the match, Jericho and Goldberg fought at ringside. During this tussle, Goldberg {{attempted}} to execute a spear on Jericho, who <b>was</b> <b>positioned</b> on the security barricade; Jericho, however, avoided the attack as Goldberg broke through the security barricade. Goldberg was billed as being injured, prompting Jericho to apply several submission holds on Goldberg's injured shoulder. After remaining in control for the duration of the match, Goldberg was able to counter Jericho's Wall's of Jericho and execute the Jackhammer on him. Goldberg then covered Jericho for the pinfall.|$|E
