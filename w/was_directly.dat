5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, <b>was</b> <b>directly</b> across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings {{seem to have lost}} most of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city <b>was</b> <b>directly</b> affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} between {{the death of}} Cnut the Great in 1035 {{and the death of}} Edward the Confessor in early 1066, the {{independent}} Kingdom of Cornwall was annexed by the neighbouring Kingdom of Wessex, a part of the Kingdom of England. In late 1066 Cornwall, {{along with the rest of}} the lands under the control of the English king, was conquered by the Normans and came under the control of William the Conqueror. By the late 12thcentury the metal mines were brought under the control of the Crown; operation of the tin mines was devolved to the Lord Warden of the Stannaries, and mining of other metals <b>was</b> <b>directly</b> controlled by the Crown as Mines Royal.|$|E

5|$|Before 1707, the Kingdom of Scotland was a {{sovereign}} independent state {{which had its}} own legislature—the Parliament of Scotland—which met, latterly, at Parliament House on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The Treaty of Union, signed in 1707, created an incorporating political union between the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England. The two previous Acts of Union (one for the British Parliament {{and one for the}} Parliament of Scotland) had dissolved the previous parliaments. The Treaty of Union created the Parliament of Great Britain which was housed in the Palace of Westminster in London. As a consequence, Scotland <b>was</b> <b>directly</b> governed from London for the next 292 years without a legislature or a Parliament building of its own.|$|E
5|$|Composer Friedrich Silcher <b>was</b> <b>directly</b> {{influenced}} by Pestalozzi and Nägeli.

In 1827 at Plochingen, Baden-Württemberg, several male-voiced choirs combined for a regional liederfest. Sängerfests were part of the Hambach Festival of 1832.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the project}} was closely tied to the other two games, and Sneak Kings {{development}} <b>was</b> <b>directly</b> led by Burger King. The game started as a tile-based puzzle game, but quickly became a Spy vs Spy-style caper until Burger King made design choices that removed conventional hazards and competition elements in favor of a stealth game with no human opponents. Sneak King did not win critical acclaim and its reviews often reflected its unusual design elements, but the project was a financial success and resulted in millions of units being sold. Collectively, the games ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Burger King's Russell Klein would attribute the three game project as being {{the driving force behind the}} company's 40% quarterly sales increase.|$|E

The Chinese opposed immediate reunification and to that end, began making economic agreements with the Provisional Revolutionary (Communist) Government of South Vietnam (PRGSV). PRGSV head Nguyễn Hữu Thọ was treated well by the Chinese. This policy further damaged relations. China and Vietnam drifted further apart; eventual Chinese aid did not improve relations.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Highfield {{location}} of the College meant it <b>was</b> <b>directly</b> in the war zone itself.
