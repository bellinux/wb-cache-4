30|$|Watershed {{development}} has been problematic when applied in a rigid and conventional manner. This is true when applied without community participation and using only hydrological planning units, where a range of interventions remained limited and post-rehabilitation management aspects were neglected. This resulted in various failures or serious shortcomings difficult to correct. Some examples can be cited in Ethiopia and elsewhere. For instance, {{the case of the}} large Borkena dam in South Wollo in the 1980 ’s where the dam was constructed before sufficient conservation measures was in place. Besides, runoff and sedimentation rates were seriously underestimated. It resulted in the filling with silt and coarse materials of the multi-million Birr dam within one rainy season (MoARD (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) 2005). Other examples in Ethiopia include large-scale watershed planning using top-down approaches and rigid technical packages during the 1980 s that resulted in the unsatisfactory performance of several conservation efforts. This shows that a poorly planned watershed approach could result in complete failure. In India, there have been cases of over-exploitation of <b>water-tables</b> resulting from an intensive watershed treatment where some of the major benefits have been reduced, particularly for the poor, because of the competitive use of water resources by richer farmers for irrigation. Other cases of failure included upper ridges planted with monocultures of eucalyptus trees, which depleted <b>water-tables</b> and had a negative ecological effect on soils.|$|R

These peat bogs are rain-fed, receiving all their water through precipitation alone. After death, the mosses are remarkably well preserved, since they are resistant to decay, and micro-organisms that are capable of decomposing them are inhibited by the acidity and lack of oxygen in the peat pore water. Continual growth of the peat bog surface and burial of dead organic matter has led to peat sequences that can exceed 10 m in depth. Because the age of these deposits can be accurately determined by measuring their residual radiocarbon activity, they have been used by peatland scientists to reconstruct changes in climate, given the sensitivity of bog mosses to changes in temperature and rainfall. This research provides long-term evidence for climate change, given that the oldest instrumental temperature record (Central England Temperature record) goes back only as far as 1659 CE (Common Era), while the majority of instrumental records only extend to the late 19 th century...|$|R

Conventional linear approaches to sanitation- the "flush-and-discharge " model and the "drop-and-store " model- can cause both environmental and health problems. The "flush-and-discharge " model wastes scarce resources of freshwater and can contaminate water sources, causing serious health health risks (Esrey and Andersson, 1999).

There is a risk that groundwater will be contaminated with pathogens from pit latrines, threatening the water supply. Furthermore, certain disease vectors breed in humid pits causing diseases such as filariasis, yellow fever and arboviruses (Esrey et. al. 2001).

Within most temperate and tropical areas the stream discharge and chemistry, during periods of rapid runoff, {{is dominated by the}} exfiltration of water and solutes from stream-side soils. The movement of water to stream-side or ‘riparian’ areas remains, however, an enigma. This paper attempts to explain how the riparian area might be rapidly recharged during storm events. Two analytical techniques, the free-surface method and tangent-continuity method, are applied to hydrological properties monitored on a steep coniferous hillslope, during a selected storm event. Comparison of the ionic concentrations of waters within each component of the hydrological system, is used to verify the hydrological analysis. Perched <b>water-tables</b> developed within the basal zones of the O/Ah and Eag soil horizons of the steep podzolic hillslope, during all major storm events. Most of the rapid response within the riparian zone could be explained by lateral flow in these near-surface soil horizons, particularly in the saturated basal zones. This pathway is corroborated by the similarity of riparian zone and near-surface (or topsoil) chemistries. Relatively low concentrations of monomeric aluminium and relatively high concentrations of chloride, sodium and hydrogen ion were observed within these zones, compared with the subsoil (Bsl and B/C) horizons...|$|R

In one. study, 92 % of cored soil samples of the affected fields showed SAR values above 5, while 42 % had values above 15. One ameliorative approach, bio-drainage using different desert vegetations, was used to control the high <b>water-tables</b> and reverse the observed salinity/sodicity trends in the border area of the Manas Alluvial Fan. The ground-water table dropped to below 2. 28 m {{in the summer of}} the fifth year, which was sufficient to prevent secondary salinization. A related plot study showed that Lycium barbarum and Puccinellia Chinamponsis consumed large amounts of soil water while leaving most of the salts behind.

Soil profile salt distributions for the deep-rooted and shallow-rooted systems were different in two of the three years after planting.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that, {{over the course of}} the Neolithic period, settlements in the Yangtze coastal plain gradually moved seawards and concentrated to the east of Lake Taihu, probably responding to the effects of sea-level change during the middle to late Holocene. To test this hypothesis, sediment cores adjacent to six Neolithic settlement sites across the study area were collected and analyzed for pollen and other microfossils. These records reveal details of the environmental conditions before, during and after the Neolithic occupation at each site. Results show that a freshwater marsh environment became established before each human occupation and persisted throughout and after it. There is no evidence at any site of a sudden or drastic change in environmental conditions towards the end of human settlement. After c. 7000 cal. yr BP the study area had become a wetland enclosed by Chenier ridges on the east (the southern shore of the Yangtze) and the south (the northern shore of Hangzhou Bay). During the Neolithic period (c. 7000 - 3000 cal. yr BP) sea level rose slowly by c. 2 m, and elevated <b>water-tables</b> saw the inland Taihu area become lacustrine, while to seaward on slightly higher ground enhanced sedimentation maintained freshwater marshes, fens and swamp-woodland, particularly near the Chenier ridges.

40|$|Drought {{conditions}} {{are expected to}} increase in frequency and severity as the climate changes, representing a threat to carbon sequestered in peat soils. Downstream water treatment works are also at risk of regulatory compliance failures and higher treatment costs due {{to the increase in}} riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) often observed after droughts. More frequent droughts may also shift dominant vegetation in peatlands from Sphagnum moss to more drought tolerant species. This paper examines the impact of drought on the production and treatability of DOC from four vegetation litters (Calluna vulgaris, Juncus effusus, Molinia caerulea and Sphagnum spp.) and a peat soil. We found that mild droughts caused a 39. 6 [*]% increase in DOC production from peat and that this DOC was harder to remove by conventional water treatment processes (coagulation/flocculation). Drought had no effect on DOC production from vegetation litters, however large variation was observed between typical peatland species (Sphagnum and Calluna) and drought tolerant grassland species (Juncus and Molinia), with the latter producing more DOC per unit weight. This would therefore suggest the increase in riverine DOC often observed post-drought is due entirely to soil microbial processes and DOC solubility rather than litter-layer effects. Long term shifts in species diversity may, therefore, be the most important impact of drought on litter layer DOC flux, whereas more immediate effects are observed in peat soils. These results provide evidence in support of catchment management which increases the resilience of peat soils to drought, such as ditch-blocking to raise <b>water-tables...</b>|$|R

This natural process leads to the remobilization of previously accumulated organic matter (OM) which is redistributed within soil profiles and exported towards rivers, hence their typical black coloration. We investigate the fate of OM in the soil-water continuum in the Rio Negro basin through description of the composition of OM potentially mobile at different stages of podzol development and exploration of evidence for contributions from different soil horizons to the exportation of OM into waters. OM was water-extracted from seven key soil samples from a sequence representative of the transition between latosol and podzol on the low elevation plateaux of the Rio Negro basin, thus enabling following both vertical and lateral differentiations.

The bulk features of water extracts were first compared with samples collected in the <b>water-tables</b> and rivers draining the soil sequence. A molecular level comparison was then performed with groundwater draining the well-developed podzol. This approach evidenced a contribution from deep horizons of well-developed podzols.

40|$|Drainage of peat-dominated {{catchments}} {{across the}} world has caused widespread degradation of peat and freshwater ecosystem services. In the UK, an estimated £ 500 million has been spent {{over the last decade}} blocking drains to reverse these changes. The practice raises <b>water-tables</b> to induce rewetting and promote peat aggradation. However, the potential benefits for impacted ecosystems such as streams remain unknown. This study examined stream physicochemistry and benthic macroinvertebrates across peatland catchments with artificial drainage networks, or drains that have recently been blocked, and compared these with intact peatland sites having no history of drainage. Streams in artificially drained catchments were characterised by more benthic fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), higher suspended sediment concentrations and finer bed sediments (D) than in drain-blocked and intact catchments. Drained sites had higher abundance of Diptera (Simuliidae and Chironomidae) larvae, and lower abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera larvae, than drain-blocked sites. In contrast, streams in drain-blocked catchments had macroinvertebrate communities broadly similar to intact sites in terms of taxon richness, overall species composition and community structure. These changes were associated with lower suspended sediment and benthic FPOM concentrations following drain-blocking. Synthesis and applications. This study has shown changes in the structure of stream benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages linked to increases in benthic particulate organic matter and suspended sediment following peatland drainage. However, these effects seem to be reversible following catchment-scale restoration by drain-blocking. Drain-blocking therefore appears to benefit not only peatland soil, vegetation and hydrological ecosystem services but also stream water quality and biodiversity. The numerous agencies undertaking peatland restoration should consider implementing detailed pre- and post-blocking monitoring of streams to further improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which peatland management affects stream biodiversity and biological recovery dynamics, refine drain-blocking practices, and inform aquatic conservation and management strategies...|$|R
