He served {{as a member of the}} target {{committee}} established by Groves to select Japanese cities for atomic bombing, and on Tinian with Project Alberta as a special consultant. Along with Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, sent by Wilson as a British representative, he watched the bombing of Nagasaki from the observation plane Big Stink. He also formed part of the Manhattan Project's post-war scientific mission to Hiroshima and Nagasaki that assessed the extent of the damage caused by the bombs.|$|E
5|$|In May 1890, Maria—who {{retained}} societal {{influence as}} {{the widow of}} a nobleman—persuaded the authorities to allow Lenin to take his exams externally at the University of St Petersburg, where he obtained {{the equivalent of a}} first-class degree with honours. The graduation celebrations were marred when his sister Olga died of typhoid. Lenin remained in Samara for several years, working first as a legal assistant for a regional court and then for a local lawyer. He devoted much time to radical politics, remaining active in Skylarenko's group and formulating ideas about how Marxism applied to Russia. Inspired by Plekhanov's work, Lenin collected data on Russian society, using it to support a Marxist interpretation of societal development and counter the claims of the Narodniks. He <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> peasant economics; it was rejected by the liberal journal Russian Thought.|$|E
5|$|Millhouse was a vocal {{advocate}} of his broader constituency, championing their {{case in a}} party dominated by rural conservatives. He <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> the 'Liberal Case for Electoral Reform', arguing for a fairer electoral system, as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city, Adelaide, whether they be progressive or conservative, Liberal or Labor. Many younger urban middle class voters, who would have normally been attracted to the LCL, were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned electoral system known as the 'Playmander'. But this concerned the rural conservatives little, who hoped to retain their hold on power through the present system, which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership, resulting in a body dominated by the ruling class and the rural landholders, and a 16–4 LCL majority. Millhouse's paper was quickly ignored.|$|E

5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of {{his interest in the}} subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E
5|$|William Penney, {{one of the}} Tube Alloys scientists, was {{an expert}} in shock waves. In June 1944, he went to America {{to work at the}} Los Alamos Laboratory as part of the British delegation.

After graduation from Gymnasium in 1923, he studied medicine at the University of Vienna and later specialized in neurology and psychiatry, concentrating on the topics of depression and suicide. His early development was influenced by his contacts with Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, although he would later diverge from their teachings.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Harry Ricardo <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> the sleeve valve design {{that led to}} the USAAC's hyper engine efforts. He claimed that the 1hp/in³ goal was {{impossible}} to achieve with poppet valve type engines. The USAAC engineering team at Wright Field decided to test this claim by beating it. The I-1430 was the result of an experimental effort at Wright Field to build a high-power cylinder using conventional poppet valves. The engineers, led by Sam Heron, used a variety of techniques to raise the allowable RPM, which was the key to increased power without requiring a larger engine.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to captain on 2 May 1848, Ryder became {{commanding}} officer of the frigate HMS Dauntless in the Channel Squadron, in December 1853. In HMS Dauntless he saw action in the Black Sea and then {{took part in the}} Battle of Kinburn in October 1855 during the Crimean War. During the War Admiral Sir Charles Napier threatened to court-martial him for letting an enemy ship escape but the Admiralty refused to support this course of action. After the war Ryder sought leave and travelled to Malta to meet his wife, who was dying of tuberculosis only to find that she had died before his arrival, leaving a two-year-old child. He was awarded the Turkish Order of the Medjidie, fourth class on 3 April 1858. At this time he also <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> methods of ascertaining the distance between ships at sea.|$|E
25|$|In 1831, Faraday (and {{independently}} Joseph Henry) {{discovered the}} reverse effect, {{the production of}} an electric potential or current through magnetism– known as electromagnetic induction; these two discoveries are {{the basis of the}} electric motor and the electric generator, respectively. In 1834, Carl Jacobi discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating ellipsoids. In 1834, John Russell observed a nondecaying solitary water wave (soliton) in the Union Canal near Edinburgh and used a water tank to study the dependence of solitary water wave velocities on wave amplitude and water depth. In 1835, William Hamilton stated Hamilton's canonical equations of motion. In the same year, Gaspard Coriolis examined theoretically the mechanical efficiency of waterwheels, and deduced the Coriolis effect. In 1841, Julius Robert von Mayer, an amateur scientist, <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> the conservation of energy but his lack of academic training led to its rejection. In 1842, Christian Doppler proposed the Doppler effect. In 1847, Hermann von Helmholtz formally stated the law of conservation of energy. In 1851, Léon Foucault showed the Earth's rotation with a huge pendulum (Foucault pendulum).|$|E
50|$|He {{investigated}} {{construction of}} long-span bridges, <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge, before becoming the engineer {{for the first}} Lambeth Bridge (1860-1862).

25|$|He was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant in the Madras Sappers in November 1846, he was then trained in military engineering with the Royal Engineers at Chatham from 1 January 1847 (holding temporary rank as an ensign in the British Army). He then arrived in India in November 1848. After two years of service at Mercatur, he officiated in 1850 as Superintending Engineer at Nagpur. During this time he made a small collection of fossils of Glossopteris from the Nagpur district and <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> the geology of the region in 1854. The collection was moved from the Museum of Practical Geology to the British Museum in 1880. In 1856, he was promoted as the Superintendent of the East Coast Canal at Madras. In May 1857, he was promoted Under-Secretary of the Public Works Department under Col. William Erskine Baker in Calcutta. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, he {{was commissioned}} as the Captain of the Calcutta Cavalry Volunteers, but was soon despatched to Allahabad where he led the construction of several embankments and bridges across the Yamuna and Ganges. He {{was involved in the}} construction of shelters to advancing troops along the Grand Trunk Road to aid the quelling of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. He arrived in course of this work at Cawnpore (now Kanpur) a day before the attack by Tantya Tope (Second Battle of Cawnpore). He also was involved in crucial civil works that aided the quelling of the rebellion by bridging the Gogra and Gomti rivers at Gorakhpur and Phulpur that enabled the Gorkha regiment to cross these rivers. He received several commendations from his commanders here and later in the taking of the fort at Jumalpur, Khandua nalla and Kaisar Bagh, vital actions in the breaking of the Siege of Lucknow. For his actions at Jumalpur he was recommended for the Victoria Cross, although he did not receive this honour. He received the a medal for the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and was promoted to second captain on 27 August 1858, and given brevet promotion to major the following day for his services in the quelling of the rebellion. He was sent to the Nilgiris due to ill-health during this time.|$|E

No larger than a flight according to the official history of the pre-war RAAF, Seaplane Squadron was part of No.1 FTS and operated Supermarine Southampton flying boats and de Havilland Gipsy Moth floatplanes, among other types. During this posting Headlam was promoted to flying officer, on 1July 1935, and <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> national defence in which he suggested that with [...] "strong air forces, naval forces (including submarines), and fixed defences, Australia may be made practically invulnerable".

500|$|Belevitch also <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>On</b> the Statistical Laws of Linguistic Distribution, {{which gives}} a {{derivation}} for the well-known empirical relationship, Zipf's law. [...] This law, {{and the more}} complex Mandelbrot law, provide {{a relationship between the}} frequency of word occurrence in languages and the word's rank. [...] In the simplest form of Zipf's law, frequency is inversely proportional to rank. [...] Belevitch expressed a large class of statistical distributions (not only the normal distribution) in terms of rank and then expanded each expression into a Taylor series. [...] In every case Belevitch obtained the remarkable result that a first order truncation of the series resulted in Zipf's law. [...] Further, a second-order truncation of the Taylor series resulted in Mandelbrot's law. [...] This gives some insight into the reason why Zipf's law has been found experimentally to hold in such a wide variety of languages.|$|E
