50|$|Plaxton had refined the Panorama with subtler {{detailing}} and inward sloping pillars {{above the}} <b>waistrail</b> for the 1961 season. Like Harrington they also offered {{a more conservative}} option, in their case an Embassy body with twice as many side windows.|$|E
50|$|The Harrington Legionnaire was a square-rigged {{body with}} {{straight}} <b>waistrail</b> and five deep windows per side. It also {{differed from the}} Harrington Cavalier and Harrington Grenadier by having plated window surrounds, {{there was a large}} brightwork grille and twin headlights, a Harrington Grenadier-style front windscreen was used with a similar sized one at the rear. Above the windscreen was a destination box of illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak.|$|E
50|$|During 1961 Vauxhall Motors told British coachbuilders {{about their}} new design to be {{produced}} {{from the end of}} 1962. The Bedford VAL was a twin-steering chassis with a long front overhang designed for an entrance ahead of the steering axles, a unique feature of the type was that the wheels were only 16-inch in diameter, which in turn reduced the floor height of bodied examples, the radiator was mounted at the front and immediately behind it was the 125 bhp Leyland O.400 engine. The Harrington Legionnaire was a square-rigged body with straight <b>waistrail</b> and five deep windows per side, one less than the Duple Vega Major and one more than the Plaxton Val. It also differed from the Cavalier and Grenadier by having plated window surrounds, there was a large brightwork grille and twin headlights, a Grenadier style front windscreen was used with a similar sized one at the rear. Above the windscreen was a destination box or illuminated nameboard and above that a prominent peak.|$|E

50|$|During 1962 the {{original}} Cavalier was still offered {{as was the}} Cavalier 36, to the new maximum length. The 315 carried most of its extra length in a longer first side window, whilst the 36 ft version had this plus an extra shallower window just aft of the first bay which {{unlike the rest of}} the side glazing had a horizontal lower edge, the <b>waistrail</b> now resuming its dip at the third bay, this saved on the cost of extra tooling and made the Cavalier a truly modular range of coach bodies although it certainly did not look that way, the longer first bay window, to the same depth as the windscreen and with a forward sloping pillar made the front of the 315 coach look better balanced. Although the longer version was not as happy as the extended Panorama, tending to look slightly 'droopy' it neither looked as fussy as Blackpool's Continental, or Addlestone's Castillian nor was it quite as distracting as the Europa or Fiesta at the new length.|$|E
5000|$|From 1953 to 1969 former Tilling-Stevens factory {{built the}} Commer TS3, a compact, if noisy, {{two-stroke}} opposed-piston diesel engine adopted in Commer commercials and later marks of their Avenger bus chassis. Harrington (like Beadle) employed units from the Avenger {{together with a}} mid-mounted TS3 engine in its Contender range of integral buses and coaches of the mid-1950s, some of these resembled the Wayfarer and others had the standard bus outline of the time, {{but there was a}} special design built for BOAC this had a straight <b>waistrail</b> and a multi-paned lantern-type windscreen. (One at least of these were powered by an eight-cylinder Rolls-Royce petrol engine of military pattern, driving torque-converter transmission. An odd choice of propulsion in the fuel-economy obsessed 1950s but they were probably a lot lighter on petrol than a Boeing Stratocruiser or a Lockheed Super Constellation). This style of Contender was sold in 1:76.8 [...] scale model by Dinky Toys as their 'BOAC Coach' [...] BOAC took 28, of which nineteen were used overseas making them the largest customer for the Contender, Maidstone and District were second with 11 buses and one coach.|$|E
2500|$|The Plaxton coach range which {{appeared}} at the 1964 Commercial Motor Show had been extensively revised with assistance from the Ogle design consultancy. <b>Waistrails</b> were virtually straight, and rooflines distinctly shallower. On the new Panorama (later to become Panorama I), a wide chrome trim band wrapped around the front and encompassed the first window bay on either side. The trim then swept upwards to the roof line and neatly terminated on the air scoop at the roof line. The window pillar on the first bay was noticeably thicker than the others and {{gave the impression of}} size that managed to enhance the appearance of the whole vehicle. The front grill was revised and basically split in two horizontally. Twin headlights were on each side of a panel that contained ventilation louvres at the top with the lower part being the actual grill that spanned the width of the vehicle. This grill was to become standard with little change until the Supreme IV of 1978. Again a bit of a Plaxton that was instantly recognisable and a familiar sight throughout Britain. The rear featured two large 9" [...] circular rear lights each side arranged vertically, and the entrance door was now the forward in-swinging type.|$|R
