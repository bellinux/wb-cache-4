5|$|As players {{walk through}} the level, they are stopped by groups of enemies <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> {{defeated}} before they can continue. The level ends when all the enemies are defeated. Each level contains many identical groups of enemies, making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} level.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes {{in vitro}} {{fertilisation}} (IVF), saying that the artificial process replaces the love between a husband and wife. In addition, it opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> treated as such. For this reason, the church also opposes abortion.|$|E
5|$|Campbell Playhouse (CBS Radio, March 31, 1939). Directed and {{introduced}} by Orson Welles. This was a non-musical {{version of the}} story that was based more closely on Edna Ferber's novel than on the musical. From the original stage cast Helen Morgan repeated her portrayal of Julie, here singing one song not from the musical. Welles portrayed Cap'n Andy, Margaret Sullavan was Magnolia, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. This version made Julie into an illegal alien <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> deported.|$|E

5|$|Heroes {{will appear}} {{at various points}} and times, {{sometimes}} accompanied by a tunneller dwarf, who, like imps, are able to dig. The dungeon can be protected from being breached by having the imps fortify the walls. Heroes include giants, wizards, and samurai warriors. Most levels have a 'Lord of the Land', a heavily armoured knight, <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> defeated. In the final level, the Avatar (resembling the Avatar from Ultima VIII), the most powerful hero, appears as the Lord of the Land, and is resurrected after being defeated. He must be defeated again when he reappears with a large army.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustrated}} English devise {{another way}} to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip her clothes and give her men's clothing to wear. They then state she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear, suggesting {{that she is a}} witch <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> burned. Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate, and she is burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen, though a postscript adds that she was canonized as a saint in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E

5|$|Later {{texts of}} Hinduism declare Ahimsa {{one of the}} primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against dharma (moral life). Finally, the {{discussion}} in Upanishads and Hindu Epics shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs. The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> strictly non-violent. Sushruta Samhita, a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women, and the Charaka Samhita describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.|$|E
5|$|The Gazel Ministry {{uses the}} Gaetia Key, an {{artifact}} that manipulates the DNA of {{massive amounts of}} humans around the world, turning them into mutants called Wels in order to collect flesh to reconstruct their god, an all-powerful Gear called Deus that crash-landed on the planet ten thousand years ago. During this time, Elly and Fei become romantically involved with each other. They learn {{that they are the}} reincarnations of Sophia and Lacan. Lacan was a painter while Sophia was the Holy Mother of Nisan {{around the time of the}} war between Shevat and Solaris five-hundred years earlier. Lacan blamed himself for Sophia's death during the war and, with the help of Miang, became Grahf and sought to destroy the world. Although defeated, he and Miang have transmigrated their minds into other humans since. Krelian and Miang dispose of the Emperor and the Gazel Ministry because they are no longer necessary and kidnap Elly, the Mother, <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> sacrificed in order to revive Deus. Miang is killed by an enraged Ramsus as he realizes he has been used, and Elly turns into Miang, becoming absorbed by Deus. Fei, as Id, attempts to make contact with the Zohar. Wiseman, who reveals himself to be Fei's father, stops him, giving peace to Fei's other personalities. Fei's gear transforms into the Xenogears and Grahf appears, revealing that he had been inside Fei's father's body. At this time, Fei makes contact with the Wave Existence—an extra-dimensional being who is trapped inside Deus and is the source of power for all gears—and learns that he must destroy Deus to free humanity. Grahf tries to merge with Fei and is defeated.|$|E

25|$|Section 72 creates Presiding Judges {{for each}} circuit {{to handle the}} {{administration}} of circuit courts. The act provides for one Senior Presiding Judge, <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> a Lord Justice of Appeal, {{and at least two}} Presiding Judges for each circuit, <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> judges of the High Court. This was simply the codification of existing practices, however, since judges already existed who would deal with the administrative work of circuit courts.|$|E

25|$|On the inscribed healing amulets of the Near Eastern and European magico-medical tradition, {{illness or}} affliction is often personified and {{addressed}} directly; the practitioner may be instructed to inscribe or chant {{a phrase that}} orders the ailment to depart: for example, “Flee, Fever!” The ailment may also be conceived of as caused by a demon, <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> identified correctly by name and commanded to depart. In this mode, magico-healing practice bears comparison to exorcism.|$|E

25|$|Apostolic {{succession}} is {{the belief}} that the pope and Catholic bishops are the spiritual successors of the original twelve apostles, through the historically unbroken chain of consecration (see: Holy orders).

He is elected by the College of Cardinals who may choose from any male member of the church but <b>who</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> ordained a bishop before taking office.
