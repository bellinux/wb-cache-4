Since the 1970s, the Grantham Canal Society have been working towards its restoration, and two stretches are navigable to small vessels. Full restoration <b>will</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> new route where the canal joins the Trent, as road building has effectively severed the original route.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, 8,000 people {{commuted}} between Sotra and Bergen, and {{the bridge}} {{had an average}} daily traffic of 22,000 vehicles. On National Road 555 between Straume, the municipal center of Fjell, and Storavatnet, where National Road 555 becomes a motorway, there are long queues during rush hour. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has proposed a four-lane motorway along National Road 555 from Stoavatnet to Straume. This <b>will</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> new crossing across Knarreviksundet. Such a motorway extension is estimated to cost between NOK3 and 4 billion, {{and the government has}} allocated NOK400 million in National Transport Plan 2010–2019 for the project. It is presumed that most of the project will be financed as a toll road.|$|E

5|$|Just {{south of}} Oslo Central Station, {{each of the}} two tracks will diverge, and follow {{different}} routes. The inbound track will hook up with the Østfold Line at Sjursøya, while the outbound track will diverge at Loenga. An additional connection to the Østfold Line will be made at Nordstrand. The Østfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loenga–Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (OsloS). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Østfold Line will be rebuilt to follow a similar path to the Kolbotn station, which <b>will</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> new station building to accommodate the two lines. For this alternate route the two lines will enter the Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Østfold Line running at-grade above.|$|E

For example, a regular expression inherently cannot find an arbitrary number of matched pairs of parentheses, {{because it is}} not recursive, but a PEG can. However, <b>a</b> PEG <b>will</b> <b>require</b> <b>an</b> amount of memory proportional to the length of the input, while a regular expression matcher <b>will</b> <b>require</b> only <b>a</b> constant amount of memory.|$|R

25|$|If {{the laser}} use {{is for a}} show or display in the U.S., {{there is a more}} {{stringent}} regulatory process. In the U.S., any use of lasers in a show or display requires pre-approval from the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health. This is required both for the laser equipment, and separately for the show itself (site, audience configuration, beam effects, etc.). As part of the CDRH's show approval ("variance") process, the CDRH <b>will</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> letter of non-objection from the FAA. Without this, the laser show cannot legally proceed.|$|E

If the number can be represented exactly in the floating-point format then the conversion is exact. If there is not an exact representation then the conversion requires a choice of which floating-point number to use to represent the original value. The representation chosen will have a different value from the original, and the value thus adjusted is called the rounded value.|$|E
