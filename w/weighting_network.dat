Further, based on the concept adopting superelement patterns to approximately express original subarray patterns, the simplified GSP-based method is proposed. So the dimension of each matrix required for creating the <b>weighting</b> <b>network,</b> which was originally {{the same as the}} element number, could be reduced to the same as the subarray number. Consequently, we achieve remarkable reduction of the computation burden; simultaneously, the PSL mitigation performance is degraded slightly.

Recent work by Winograd on high-speed convolution techniques for computing short length DFT's, has motivated the development of more efficient algorithms, compared to the FFT, for evaluating the transform of longer sequences. Among these, prime factor algorithms appear suitable for special purpose hardware implementations. Architectural considerations in designing DFT computers based on these algorithms are discussed. With the availability of monolithic multiplier-accumulators, a direct implementation of IIR and FIR filters, using random access memories in place of shift registers, appears attractive. The memory addressing scheme involved in such implementations is discussed. A simple counter set-up to address the data memory in the realization of FIR filters is also described.

40|$|Object {{proposal}} {{is essential for}} current state-of-the-art object detection pipelines. However, the existing proposal methods generally fail in producing results with satisfying localization accuracy. The case is even worse for small objects which however are quite common in practice. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel Scale-aware Pixel-wise Object Proposal (SPOP) network to tackle the challenges. The SPOP network can generate proposals with high recall rate and average best overlap (ABO), even for small objects. In particular, in order to improve the localization accuracy, a fully convolutional network is employed which predicts locations of object proposals for each pixel. The produced ensemble of pixel-wise object proposals enhances the chance of hitting the object significantly without incurring heavy extra computational cost. To solve the challenge of localizing objects at small scale, two localization networks which are specialized for localizing objects with different scales are introduced, following the divide-and-conquer philosophy. Location outputs of these two networks are then adaptively combined to generate the final proposals by a large-/small-size <b>weighting</b> <b>network.</b> Extensive evaluations on PASCAL VOC 2007 show the SPOP network is superior over the state-of-the-art models. The high-quality proposals from SPOP network also significantly improve the mean average precision (mAP) of object detection with Fast-RCNN framework. Finally, the SPOP network (trained on PASCAL VOC) shows great generalization performance when testing it on ILSVRC 2013 validation set.

During the opening conference of the health hazard evaluation, it was discovered that the company had already fabricated an enclosure for the rotary knife blade of the paper cutter in question and was planning to install it. It was agreed to measure the sound from the machine {{both before and after the}} installation of the enclosure. Noise surveys were conducted in July and November, 1986, to investigate the effects on the noise levels from the enclosure which was installed between the two survey dates. Area sampling was performed with a stationary GenRad Model 1982 Precision Sound Level Meter with octave band capabilities mounted on a tripod. The personal noise dosimetry used Metrosonic Model db- 301 Metrologgers which were worn by the paper cutter operators throughout the entire work shift.

40|$|The {{human brain}} is a {{heterogeneous}} network of connected functional regions; however, most brain network studies {{assume that all}} brain connections {{can be described in}} a framework of binary connections. The brain is a complex structure of white matter tracts connected by a wide range of tract sizes, which suggests a broad range of connection strengths. Therefore, the assumption that the connections are binary yields an incomplete picture of the brain. Various thresholding methods have been used to remove spurious connections and reduce the graph density in binary networks. But these thresholds are arbitrary and make problematic the comparison of networks created at different thresholds. The heterogeneity of connection strengths can be represented in graph theory by applying weights to the network edges. Using our recently introduced edge weight parameter, we estimated the topological brain network organization using a complimentary weighted connectivity framework to the traditional framework of a binary network. To examine the reproducibility of brain networks in a controlled condition, we studied the topological network organization of a single healthy individual by acquiring 10 repeated diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image datasets, over a one-month period on the same scanner, and analyzing these networks with deterministic tractography. We applied a threshold to both the binary and weighted networks and determined that the extra degree of freedom that comes with the framework of <b>weighting</b> <b>network</b> connectivity provides a robust result as any threshold level. The proposed weighted connectivity framework provides a stable result and is able to demonstrate the small world property of brain networks in situations where the binary framework is inadequate and unable to demonstrate this network property...|$|E
