Bob and I had some long discussions, and I would say, “Well Bob, why is this the actual state space in this model?” [...] That question came up ... after I came to Penn.

He has criticized claims that the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip {{are in the midst of}} a humanitarian crisis as a result of Israel’s blockade citing that, “Gaza receives equivalent of 40% of goods imported by Israel. It's absurd for Israel to take care of Gazans while Hamas fires rockets.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The work of Abramović and Ulay {{tested the}} {{physical}} {{limits of the}} body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, transcendental meditation and nonverbal communication. While some critics have explored the idea of a hermaphroditic state of being as a feminist statement, Abramović herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with gender ideologies, Abramović/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: [...] "The main problem in this relationship was {{what to do with the}} two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that <b>we</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> death self." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to their}} low social status and {{language}} barrier, Korean Americans received very {{little if any}} aid or protection from police authorities. David Joo, a manager of the gun store, said, [...] "I {{want to make it}} clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed." [...] Carl Rhyu, a participant in the Korean immigrants' armed response to the rioting, said, [...] "If it was your own business and your own property, would you be willing to trust it to someone else? We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning <b>we</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> police every five minutes; no response." [...] At a shopping center several miles north of Koreatown, Jay Rhee, who estimated that he and others fired five hundred shots into the ground and air, said, [...] "We have lost our faith in the police. Where were you when we needed you?" [...] Koreatown was isolated from South Central Los Angeles, yet despite such exclusion it was the heaviest hit.|$|E

60|$|The {{owner of}} the lasso, who had good-naturedly lent it to us, roused himself on hearing this. He was a very big, rough-looking man, his face covered with an immense shaggy black beard.
