5|$|When the President of the Massachusetts Senate, <b>William</b> <b>M.</b> Bulger, {{announced}} his resignation from his 1st Suffolk seat in late 1995, Lynch filed nomination papers {{for the special}} election to replace him. Bulger's son, attorney <b>William</b> <b>M.</b> Bulger, Jr. ran for the seat. Another lawyer, Patrick Loftus, also ran for the Democratic primary. The race grew from the grassroots of South Boston, with neighborhood issues such as development, crime, and education ruling the debate. The candidates declared their mutual respect. In a stunning victory, Lynch won the Democratic primary in March 1996, defeating Bulger Jr. and Loftus 56–35–9%. In April, he defeated Republican Richard William Czubinski 96–4% and was inaugurated on May 1, 1996. He won re-election unopposed in 1996, 1998, and 2000.|$|E

5|$|Noted {{hurricane}} expert <b>William</b> <b>M.</b> Gray and {{his associates}} at Colorado State University issue forecasts of hurricane activity each year, separately from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
