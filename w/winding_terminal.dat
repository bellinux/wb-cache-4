The ill-convergence of multiparameter estimation due to the rank-deficient state equations of permanent-magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) is investigated. It is verified that the PMSM model for multiparameter estimation under id = 0 control is rank deficient for simultaneously estimating winding resistance, rotor flux linkage, and winding inductance and cannot ensure them to converge to the correct parameter values. A new method is proposed based on injecting a short pulse of negative id current and simultaneously solving two sets of simplified PMSM state equations corresponding to id = 0 and id ≠ 0 by using an Adaline neural network. The convergence of solutions is ensured, while the minimum |i d| is determined from the error analysis for nonsalient-pole PMSMs. The proposed method does not need the nominal value of any parameter and only needs to sample the <b>winding</b> <b>terminal</b> currents and voltages, and the rotor speed for simultaneously estimating the dq-axis inductances, the winding resistance, and the rotor flux linkage in nonsalient-pole PMSMs. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method can eliminate the estimation error caused by the variation of rotor flux linkage and inductance {{as a result of}} state change due to the injected d-axis current in the surface-mounted PMSM. The method is verified by experiments, and the results show that the proposed method has negligible influence on output torque and rotor speed and has good performance in tracking the variation of PMSM parameters due to temperature variation. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} mainly {{focused on the}} {{development}} of (i) phase shifting transformers (PSTs) mathematical and simulation models {{that can be used for}} the short-circuit and protection studies, and (ii) new phase shifting transformers protection methods that provide more secure and sensitive solutions than the standard current differential protection. The first part of this thesis describes and presents the modeling of the single-core standard-delta, and two-core symmetrical and asymmetrical PST for protection and short-circuit studies. The models already available for such types of PSTs have limitations and require detailed test report data from the manufacturers. However, winding test data at each tap position is seldom available from the manufacturers. Moreover, they are confined to the balanced system conditions. The proposed modeling approach is based {{on the development of}} positive, negative and zero-sequence networks. Derived mathematical relations are further used to develop the relations of <b>winding</b> <b>terminal</b> voltages, currents and impedances as a function of tap position. Accuracy of the presented models is verified mathematically with the manufacturer’s test report data. Furthermore, electromagnetic transients program (EMTP) modeling, in commercially available simulation tools such as PSCAD/EMTDC and RTDS, is done in order to further verify the proposed models. The proposed modeling approach does not rely on the availability of the manufacturer test report data and only requires the nameplate information. It can also be used for both balanced and unbalanced system conditions. The second part of the thesis presents two protection principles: (a) electromagnetic differential protection, and (b) directional comparison-based protection. The main motive behind the development of new protection principles is to develop a solution that is more secure, sensitive and offers high-speed protection. Correct implementation of these techniques for the protection of various kinds of PSTs comes across various problems and hence leads us to the proposed solution of those issues. Both techniques solve the problems of conventional challenges such as magnetizing inrush current, core saturation, non-standard phase shift, external fault with current transformer (CT) saturation, etc. The electromagnetic differential protection principle can only be applied to the PST it represents and it requires tap position tracking. A directional comparison-based approach can be applied to any kind of PST without tracking the tap position...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Internal winding faults comprise 70 - 80 % of modem transformer breakdown. In this era of deregulation, this phenomenon is likely to increase since loading transformers to their optimum capacity is becoming normal practice. These internal faults result from degradation of the transformer winding insulation, which tends to cause a breakdown in the dielectric strength. This breakdown either causes adjacent windings to short or a winding to be shorted to a grounded part of the transformer. Such faults can be very catastrophic and hence expensive. Utilities therefore welcome inexpensive methods employed to detect such faults in the incipient stage. The long-term objective of this research is the development of an inexpensive technique for the detection of transformer incipient winding faults. As part of this research, the thesis presents: 1. Internal winding models of single-phase, distribution transformers. These models are adapted from an earlier work of modeling internal winding faults of three-phase power transformers. They are compatible with the Alternative Transients Program and enable the transformer <b>winding</b> <b>terminal</b> parameters to be monitored. They allow the simulation of faults between any turn and the earth or between any two turns of the transformer windings. 2. Simulation of various internal winding faults of a single-phase distribution transformer using the models. 3. A general methodology to experimentally verify simulation models for distribution transformer internal winding faults including details of the design and layout of a field experimental setup containing a 25 kVA, 7200 V/ 240 V/ 120 V single-phase, custom-built transformer and a 25 kW resistor load bank. 4. A comparison of the simulation and corresponding field experiment results. Although the simulation models neglected factors such as saturation and consequently transformer nonlinearities, the simulation and field results were very similar. As a contribution, the experimental setup presented in this work could generally be used for simulation model verification by following the proposed methodology with appropriate modifications. The validated models can be utilized to generate fault data for all kinds of scenarios including those that would be impossible to stage experimentally due to high levels of fault currents.

40|$|MU LT I L E V E L {{inverters}} {{are becoming}} the preferred choice for medium voltage high power applications. Multilevel inverters {{have a number}} of inherent advantages over conventional two level inverters. The output voltage has multiple steps or levels, resulting in reduced dV/dt, which leads to lower electromagnetic interference, making it easier to meet electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulations. Multilevel inverters have a much lower effective switching frequency, which leads to a reduction in switching losses. The output voltage of multilevel inverters has a much lower harmonic content. In applications such as power conversion or grid-connection, filters need to be much smaller, or can be eliminated. In motor drive applications, the low harmonic content results in smoother, ripple-free shaft torque. The neutral-point clamped (NPC), cascaded H-bridge (CHB) and flying capacitor (FC) topologies were among the earliest multilevel topologies. NPC topologies require additional clamping diodes to clamp the output to the DC bus midpoint. CHB topologies use a number of isolated DC suplies to generate multilevel output. FC topologies work with a single DC link but use additional floating capacitors. Since then, a number derivatives and improvements to these topologies have been proposed. Topologies with low switch counts are desirable because of the corresponding reduction in system size and cost. A low total component count is also desirable since it results in better reliability. Induction motors in high power applications are often operated in the open-end configuration. Here, the start terminals of the motor phase windings are connected to one three phase inverter, while the end terminals are connected to a second three-phase inverter. The two inverters are typically powered by isolated supplies to prevent the flow of common mode currents through the motor. The open end configuration has a number of advantages It can be used with nearly all high power motors with no need for electrical or mechanical modification, since all six <b>winding</b> <b>terminal</b> are available externally. The two inverters driving the open-end motor are effectively cascaded. As a result, two inverters of lower voltage and power rating can replace a single inverter with higher voltage and power rating. In addition, if one of the inverter fails, it can be bypassed and the system can be operated at reduced power. In many applications such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), the load power is proportional to the cube of the shaft speed, so a 50 % reduction in power translates to only 20 % reduction in speed, thereby improving overall system reliability. The cascading of inverters also enables multilevel operation, which is exploited for the topologies proposed in this thesis. In the open-end configuration it is important to ensure that both the DC supplies deliver power to the load. Otherwise, power can circulate through the motor windings. In addition, if the two inverters are powered by rectifier supplies, the DC bus of one inverter can charge uncontrollably, resulting in distortion of phase voltages and currents. If DC bus overcharging continues unchecked the DC bus voltage can even exceed the system rating, resulting in permanent damage. This thesis proposes two novel topologies for open-end induction motor drives with low switch counts. Both topologies are powered by two unequal, isolated DC sources having DC voltages in a 3 : 1 ratio. Multiple levels in the output voltage are obtained using a number of floating capacitors in each phase. Modulation and control schemes are also proposed for both topologies to ensure that DC bus overcharging never occurs, while all the capacitor voltages are kept balanced at their nominal values. The first of these two topologies is a nine level inverter for open end induction motor drives. It consists of two three-level flying capacitor inverters connected to the induction motor in the open end configuration. The two inverters are powered by DC sources of voltage 6 VDC/ 8 and 2 VDC/ 8, which generates an effective phase voltage having nine levels in steps of VDC/ 8. This topology has only eight switches and two floating capacitors per phase. The space vector structure for this topology is hexagonal, and has 217 space vector locations. A space-vector based formulation is used to determine the pole voltage of the inverter such that DC bus over charging is prevented. In addition, selection of switching states is used to balance the voltages of all floating capacitors. This scheme allows the floating capacitors to be charged up during system startup, thereby eliminating the need for separate pre-charging circuitry. A level-shifted carrier PWM based modulation scheme has been developed, which can be used with both scalar and vector control schemes. The gating signal for switches turning on must be delayed by a small amount (to allow the complementary switch to turn of), failing which current shoot through can occur. This delay is called dead time, during which gate signals to both complementary devices are turned of. Under certain conditions in the flying capacitor topology, the pole voltage can contain large undesirable transients during the dead time which result in phase current distortion, and electromagnetic noise. A novel scheme to eliminate this problem is proposed using a digital state machine approach. The switching state for each subsequent switching interval is determined based on the present switching state such that the pole voltage does not contain a transient, without affecting the phase voltage of the inverter, and irrespective of the current magnitude or direction. The state machine was implemented using an FPGA, and required an additional computation time of just 20 ns, which is much smaller than the inverter dead time duration of typically 2. 5 µs. The second novel topology proposed in this thesis is a seventeen level inverter for an open end induction motor drive. Here, one three-level inverter and one seven-level inverter are connected to the two ends of the induction machine. The three-level inverter is a flying capacitor inverter. The seven-level inverter is a hybrid topology – it consists of an H-bridge cascaded to each phase of a three level flying capacitor inverter. This scheme is also powered by two isolated DC sources in 3 : 1 ratio with magnitudes 12 VDC/ 16 and 4 VDC/ 16. The effective phase voltage has seventeen levels in steps of VDC/ 16. This topology has a total of twelve switches and three floating capacitors per phase. The space vector structure for this topology is hexagonal, and has 817 space-vector locations. Space vector analysis was used to determine the pole voltages, and the switching states such that DC bus overcharging is prevented while also balancing the voltages of the floating capacitors. A non-iterative algorithm was developed for determining the switching states, suitable for implementation in digital logic using an FPGA. The scheme is able to charge the all capacitors at startup as well, eliminating the need for separate pre-charging circuits. Hardware prototypes were built for both the topologies described above for experimental verification, and used to drive a three phase 50 Hz, 1. 5 kW, four pole induction motor in V/f control mode. The inverters topologies were built using 1200 V, 75 A IGBT half-bridge modules (Semikron SKM 75 GB 12 T 4) with hybrid opto-isolated gate drivers (Mitsubishi M 57962). Three phase rectifiers were used to create the asymmetric DC supplies Hall effect sensors were used to sense the DC link and floating capacitor voltages and phase currents (LEM LV 20 P voltage sensors and LA 55 current sensors). Signal conditioning circuitry was built using discrete components. The PWM signals and V/f controller were implemented using a digital signal processor (Texas Instruments TMS 320 F 28335). Synchronous PWM with was used to eliminate sub-harmonics from the phase voltage, and to ensure three-phase and half-wave symmetry. The internal ADC of the DSP was used for sampling all voltages and currents. The remaining digital logic for switch state selection was implemented on a FPGA (Xilinx Spartan 3 XC 3 S 200). Dead time functionality was also implemented within the FPGA, eliminating the need for separate dead time hardware. Both topologies were first tested for steady state operation over the full modulation range, and the pole voltages, phase voltages and phase currents were recorded. System startup, and the ability of the controllers to balance all the capacitors at startup was tested next. The capacitor voltages were also observed during sudden loading, by quickly accelerating the motor. Finally, the phenomenon of DC bus overcharging was also demonstrated. These results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed topology for a number of applications, including industrial drives, alternate energy systems, power conversion and electric traction...|$|E

By means of the resulting data and incorporating additional datasets from alternative studies, we investigate the properties of OB-supergiants and compare our findings with theoretical predictions. As a result we find that due to the combined effects of line- and wind-blanketing, the temperature scale of Galactic B-supergiants needs to be revised downwards, by 10 to 20 percent, the latter value being appropriate for stronger winds. In fair accordance with recent results, our sample furthermore indicates a gradual decrease in <b>wind</b> <b>terminal</b> velocities over the bi-stability region, where the limits of this region are located at lower temperatures than the predicted ones. Introducing a distance-independent quantity Q' related to wind-strength, we also show that this quantity is a well defined, monotonically increasing function of Teff outside this region.

Using our results, we evaluate the likely outcomes for the most massive stars. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures. IAUS 279 : Death of Massive Stars: Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Burst...|$|R
40|$|O and B {{stars in}} the LMC and SMC have been {{observed}} with the IUE in order to compare their winds and mass loss rates with those of their galactic counterparts. It is found that while the <b>wind</b> <b>terminal</b> velocities are generally about 20 percent lower than in galactic stars of the same spectral type, {{it is not clear}} that the mass loss rates are significantly lower. This conclusion differs from the conclusions of other studies, and the reasons are discussed. The most important reason is that a less luminous set of stars with new spectral types determined from slit spectra is being examined. The discussion of stellar winds rests heavily on a comparison of relevant wind parameters observed in O stars using both high and low dispersion IUE spectra...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultraviolet}} {{spectra of}} all “weak emission line central stars of planetary nebulae ” (WELS) with available IUE data are presented and discussed. We performed line identifications, equivalent width and flux measurements for several features in their spectra. We {{found that the}} WELS can be divided in three different groups regarding their UV: i) Strong P-Cygni profiles (mainly in C IV λ 1549); ii) Weak P-Cygni features and iii) Absence of P-Cygni profiles. The last group encompasses stars with a featureless UV spectrum or with intense emission lines and a weak continuum, which are most likely of nebular origin. We have measured <b>wind</b> <b>terminal</b> velocities for all objects presenting P-Cygni profiles in N V λ 1238 and/or C IV λ 1549. The results obtained were compared to the UV...|$|R

In general, film capacitors are not polarized, so the two terminals are interchangeable. There are {{two different types of}} plastic film capacitors, made with two different electrode configurations: ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of new optical and ultraviolet spectra of the mass donor star in the massive X-ray binary LS 5039. The optical band spectral line strengths indicate that the atmosphere is N-rich and C-poor, and we classify the stellar spectrum as type ON 6. 5 V((f)). The N-strong and C-weak pattern {{is also found in}} the stellar wind P Cygni lines of N V λ 1240 and C IV λ 1550 (narrow absorption components in the former indicate that the <b>wind</b> <b>terminal</b> velocity is V ∞ = 2440 ± 190 km s − 1). We suggest that the N-enrichment may result from internal mixing if the O-star was born as a rapid rotator, or the O-star may have accreted N-rich gas during a common envelope interaction with the progenitor of the supernova. We re-evaluated the orbital elements to find an orbital period...|$|R
40|$|High-dispersion spectra {{taken with}} the IUE are {{used to examine the}} {{temperature}} stratification of the wind of the hybrid atmosphere star Alpha TrA (K 4 II). C IV emission is shown to have a line width of 150 - 200 km/s, with Si III and C III exhibiting 100 km/s widths. It is suggested that the line widths reflect wind expansion, with C IV formed in an extended region flowing near the <b>wind</b> <b>terminal</b> velocity of 85 km/s. It is shown that the observed line widths can be accounted for by the stellar wind theory of Hartmann and MacGregor, in which the schematic dissipation of Alfven waves drives the outflow in addition to heating the wind. The observations of the warm expanding corona in Alpha TrA suggest a continuous progression between the high temperature low-mass-flux solar wind and the winds of luminous cool stars...|$|R
40|$|Consideration {{is given}} to the {{spectrum}} of particles accelerated at a stellar <b>wind</b> <b>terminal</b> shock and, at the same time, modulated by convection and diffusion in the stellar wind and decelerated by adiabatic expansion of the unshocked wind. It is noted that a proper study of this problem combines the whole of the cosmic-ray modulation problem with first-order Fermi acceleration at the shock due to repeated diffusive scattering across the shock. The modulation aspect of the model described here is much simpler than modern models of modulation alone; this makes it possible to derive illustrative analytical expressions for the accelerated spectra. Particular cases of monoenergetic and truncated power laws are computed. Energy losses and convective modulation compete with acceleration at the shock so effectively in this model that enhancement of the background cosmic-ray flux by a factor of more than 2 is extremely unlikely...|$|R
40|$|A {{kinematic}} {{model of}} the interplanetary magnetic field in the heliosheath beyond the solar <b>wind</b> <b>terminal</b> shock is presented in order to evaluate the possible importance of MHD effects in that region of space. The need for this evaluation arises because the interplanetary magnetic field is compressed across the terminal shock and further amplified by the decreasing flow speed beyond the shock. Streamlines which approach the stagnation point before turning in the downstream direction lead to the strongest effects due to the extreme slowing of the solar wind and consequent compression of the embedded magnetic field. The magnetic volume force therefore cannot be neglected on streamlines that approach the heliopause in the upstream direction, where the volume containing them is a large fraction of the overall of the heliosheath in the upstream direction. The increase in the magnetic pressure may act to bring the upstream terminal shock significantly closer to the sun, potentially reconciling a conflict between models and observations...|$|R
40|$|A subset (∼ 10 %) {{of massive}} stars present strong, {{globally}} ordered (mostly dipolar) magnetic fields. The trapping and channeling of their stellar winds in closed magnetic loops leads to magnetically confined wind shocks (MCWS), with pre-shock flow speeds that are some {{fraction of the}} <b>wind</b> <b>terminal</b> speed. These shocks generate hot plasma, a source of X-rays. In the last decade, several developments took place, notably {{the determination of the}} hot plasma properties for a large sample of objects using XMM and Chandra, as well as fully self-consistent MHD modeling and the identification of shock retreat effects in weak winds. Despite a few exceptions, the combination of magnetic confinement, shock retreat and rotation effects seems to be able to account for X-ray emission in massive OB stars. Here we review these new observational and theoretical aspects of this X-ray emission and envisage some perspectives {{for the next generation of}} X-ray observatories. Peer reviewe...|$|R
