5|$|After riding {{together}} in Thor's goat-driven chariot, the two, disguised, arrive in Jötunheimr. Þrymr commands the jötnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived {{to be his}} wife. Þrymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that he was missing in his wealth.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Grigorievich Zamyotov (Александр Григорьевич Заметов)– Head {{clerk at}} the police station and friend to Razumikhin. Raskolnikov arouses Zamyotov's suspicions by {{explaining}} how he, Raskolnikov, would have committed various crimes, although Zamyotov later apologizes, believing, much to Raskolnikov's amusement, that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> a farce to expose how ridiculous the suspicions were.|$|E
5|$|Arguing for {{the defence}} was lawyer Jagmal Singh. He {{asserted}} {{that there was}} no evidence against the accused and that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> contrived by the media, no evidence that the khap panchayat ever met to discuss the fate of the couple, and no evidence indicating that Manoj and Babli were dead. The cremated bodies recovered from the canal were never confirmed to be those of Manoj and Babli.|$|E

5|$|He {{said that}} he {{understood}} my impatience with such small demands as a few hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week.... But what were men of his age to do? They were not likely to {{live to see the}} ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Historically, in-water {{recompression}} was {{the usual}} method of treating decompression sickness in remote areas. Procedures were often informal and based on operator experience, and used air as the breathing gas as it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that was available. The divers generally used standard diving gear, which was relatively safe for this procedure, as the diver was at low risk of drowning if he lost consciousness.|$|E

5|$|I needed {{somebody}} who could perform, and {{who also had}} a lot of endurance, because we were shooting in Atlanta at the end of July. Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> glued down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, the Supreme Court {{continued}} {{hearings on}} the PLI case about the statues.

50|$|A {{subset of}} a {{population}} that shares one or more additional properties is called a subpopulation. For example, if the population <b>is</b> <b>all</b> Egyptian people, a subpopulation <b>is</b> <b>all</b> Egyptian males; if the population <b>is</b> <b>all</b> pharmacies in the world, a subpopulation <b>is</b> <b>all</b> pharmacies in Egypt. By contrast, a sample is a subset {{of a population}} that is not chosen to share any additional property.|$|R
50|$|Godzilla Game was a {{board game}} {{released}} by Mattel in 1978. Between two and four people could play. Each player controlled six spaceships.

Occasionally Godzilla would appear and eat {{one of the}} spaceships. The last player to have a spaceship left would be the winner.|$|R
5|$|In January 1976 {{the band}} {{took a break}} from their live {{performances}} to prepare for recording at Plaza Sound studio. Sessions began in early February 1976 and were completed within a week for $6,400; the instruments took three days and the vocal parts were recorded in four days. In 2004, Leon admitted that they recorded Ramones quickly due to budget restrictions, but also that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the time they needed.|$|E
5|$|In a {{difficult}} return leg, Celtic toiled {{to break down}} a dour Boavista side who knew that a scoreless draw <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the Portuguese side required to reach the final. However, an opportunistic strike by Larsson on 80 minutes won the match and the tie for Celtic, meaning that Celtic would go through to the UEFA Cup Final, preventing an all-Portugal, and all-Oporto, final.|$|E
5|$|Senegal's {{independence}} was declared on August 20, 1960, {{and after the}} dissolution of the short-lived Mali Federation, Casamance saw the arrival of officials coming from the north. Although many of them were Wolofs and Muslims, they did not know the Jola country and its traditions. The periods of drought that ravaged the Sahel in the 1970s forced peanut farmers to move to regions where rice <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that grew.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Somme was the regiment's {{first major}} engagement, and during an assault that lasted {{approximately}} 30 minutes the regiment <b>was</b> <b>all</b> but wiped out.

5|$|The {{first day}} we were to work {{together}} I was nervous as a school girl. We were shooting a Junkanoo Festival with noisy drums and hundreds of extras.

5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was therefore spurred {{in part by a}} desire to form a stronger political current, rather than being seen as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union.
