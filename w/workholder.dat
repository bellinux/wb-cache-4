5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a <b>workholder,</b> which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the <b>workholder,</b> then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fixture design {{contributes}} {{highly to}} manufacturing safety and quality. Computer aided ®xture design (CAFD) facilitates more cost e ective and e cient <b>workholder</b> design. However, heuristic and case-based approaches are still common. This paper addresses CAFD using the computational geometry approach. The correctness of a ®xture design {{will be determined}} through vector-theoretic immobilization checking of the ®xture points (i. e. location and clamping points) proposed. Details of the translational and rotational immobilization checking theory are explained, which are also applicable to general three-dimensional shapes. In real life, perfect geometry does not exist. As contemporary CAFD systems cannot cater for non-ideal geometry satisfactorily, the paper also develops an interval analysis scheme for toleranced immobilization checks. A real-life case study is presented to demonstrate the procedure...|$|E

Nevertheless, current modelling of this expert knowledge does not allow us to represent the different semantics (imprecision, uncertainty [...] .) that are related to it. In this paper, we present a method based on fuzzy reasoning that is able to support the modelling of these different knowledge semantics...|$|E

In an FMS, individual part movements are practical because of the automated transportation system.
