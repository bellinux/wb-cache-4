25|$|The Metropolitan Police {{approved}} {{the use of}} name badges in October 2003, and new recruits started wearing the Velcro badges in September 2004.

25|$|A very {{important}} point that is routinely overlooked by many modern commentators is that even those Muslim women who wear {{what has come to}} be regarded as stereotypically Islamic clothing – ḥijābs, chādors, and burqas – typically <b>wear</b> <b>these</b> in public only. In private, it is common for women to wear Western-style clothing, and the proliferation within OIC member states of global fashion retail chains from Zara to Victoria's Secret – both of which have branches even in Wahabbi Saudi Arabia – is testament to this.|$|E
25|$|Lint is {{the common}} name for visible accumulations of textile fibers and other {{materials}}, usually found on and around clothing. Certain materials used {{in the manufacture of}} clothing, such as cotton, linen, and wool, contain numerous, very short fibers bundled together. During the course of normal <b>wear,</b> <b>these</b> fibers may either detach or be jostled out of the weave of which they are part. This is the reason that heavily used articles like shirts and towels become thin over time, and why these particles collect in the lint screen of a clothes dryer.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Rome, {{the word}} persona meant 'a mask'; it also {{referred}} to an individual who had full Roman citizenship. A citizen could demonstrate his or her lineage through imagines, death masks of the ancestors. These were wax casts kept in a lararium, the family shrine. Rites of passage, such as initiation of young members of the family, or funerals, were carried out at the shrine under the watch of the ancestral masks. At funerals, professional actors would <b>wear</b> <b>these</b> masks to perform deeds {{of the lives of}} the ancestors, thus linking the role of mask as a ritual object and in theatre.|$|E

25|$|One cannot {{speak of}} fashion trends without {{mentioning}} {{the importance of}} hair styles, particularly for women. In {{the past few years}} there has been a resurgence of the asymmetrical hair cut with a contemporary spin. Stars such as Rihanna, Cassie and Kelis have all dared to be different by setting the new trend of the half-shaven head. The reemergence of Adidas track jackets and the use of fashion scarves have been some of the latest trends to hit the hip hop fashion scene. Adidas track suits are certainly not new to hip hop culture as they have been around essentially since commercialized hip hop was created, however they have recently once again become popular. Fashion scarves have also become popularized in recent years. Kanye West is the most recent artist to launch his own line of products by selling decorative scarves with provocative depictions, named Risque Scarves. Skateboarding fashion has been used in the Hip-Hop scene since the early 2010s including Knit Caps, Bonnets, Fitted Pants or Shorts, Vans, Nike SB (Skateboarding), Shirts with sleeves and Printed Tees (brands like OBEY, Supreme, Stussy, Adidas, Supra, Circa, DC, RDS and Emericas). Chris Brown, Tyler The Creator & Lil Wayne <b>wear</b> <b>these</b> on their music videos & concerts.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Football League first {{introduced}} {{the use of}} a permanent third jersey on September 6, 1994 when the Calgary Stampeders wore black uniforms for the Labour Day Classic against the Edmonton Eskimos. The CFL did not have a rule for use of alternate uniforms and teams were able to wear them as often or as little as they liked, a rule that is still in effect today. Teams are also able to wear multiple alternate jerseys within the same season, as seen with the Montreal Alouettes during their 2009 campaign when they wore alternate black, blue, and throwback jerseys, in addition to their regular home and away uniforms. Teams are also permitted to wear their third jerseys as the away team, provided that they do not clash with the home team's uniforms. Despite teams having no restrictions with third jerseys, only the Stampeders chose to wear them during the 1990s, presumably due to the league's financial struggles during this decade. As such, no CFL USA team ever wore an alternate uniform. The Alouettes were the next team to introduce third uniforms in 2001 when they also wore black uniforms; a colour that {{was not part of the}} team's colour scheme. The Saskatchewan Roughriders first wore their black alternates in 2002 as it became more normal for teams to <b>wear</b> <b>these</b> jerseys. The BC Lions wore orange retro uniforms twice during the 2003 season as part of the celebrations for their 50th season, but those were only worn for that season.|$|E

Procopius, writing on the Persian wars circa 550 CE, [...] "stated that the five hereditary satraps (governors) of Armenia who received their insignia from the Roman Emperor were given chlamys (or cloaks) made from lana pinna.

500|$|Pussy Riot {{released}} {{their first}} song and video in English in February 2015. [...] "" [...] {{is named for}} the last words that Eric Garner said as New York City Police held {{him to the ground}} in a chokehold. In their music video for this song, band members wear Russian riot police uniforms and are slowly buried alive as they sing. They <b>wear</b> <b>these</b> specific uniforms because they are worn by Russian police during clashes between police and protesters for change, and to make the statement that illegal violence not only kills the oppressed, but slowly kills the oppressors. According to Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova, [...] "Policemen, soldiers, agents, they become hostages and are buried with those they kill, both figuratively and literally". The symbolism behind the [...] "Russian Spring" [...] brand cigarettes in the video is that the brand name is the same phrase used by supporters of Russian invasion of the Ukraine. Pussy Riot was responsible for concept and production of the video, while vocals and lyrics were performed by two other Russian bands, Jack Wood and Scofferlane. With this song, Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova begin to show the parallels between police brutality and state oppression in Russia and the United States.|$|E
