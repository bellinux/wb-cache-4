500|$|Virginia's {{condition}} {{might have}} been what prompted the Poe family to move, {{in the hopes of}} finding a healthier environment for her. They moved several times within Philadelphia in the early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site in Spring Garden. In this home, Virginia was well enough to tend the flower garden and entertain visitors by playing the harp or the piano and singing. The family then moved to New York sometime in early April 1844, traveling by train and steamboat. Virginia waited on board the ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on Greenwich Street. By early 1846, family friend Elizabeth Oakes Smith said that Virginia admitted, [...] "I know I shall die soon; I know I can't get well; but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> happy as possible, and make Edgar happy." [...] She promised her husband that after her death she would be his guardian angel.|$|E
2500|$|Randi {{has never}} smoked, taken {{narcotics}} or become inebriated, because, {{as he has}} explained, [...] "that can easily just fuzz the edges of my rationality, fuzz the edges of my reasoning powers, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> aware as I possibly can. That means giving {{up a lot of}} fantasies that might be comforting in some ways, but I'm willing to give that up in order to live in an actually real world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked by Bill O'Reilly if {{his movie}} would [...] "upset Jews", Gibson responded, [...] "It's not meant to. I think it's meant to just tell the truth. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> truthful as possible." [...] In a Globe and Mail {{newspaper}} interview, he added: [...] "If anyone has distorted Gospel passages to rationalize cruelty towards Jews or anyone, it's {{in defiance of}} repeated Papal condemnation. The Papacy has condemned racism in any form. ... Jesus died {{for the sins of}} all times, and I'll be the first on the line for culpability".|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Higgins was a {{political}} opponent of the Irish government's re-run of the Treaty of Lisbon referendum. He said the guarantees did not change the Treaty. Higgins said, [...] "The overall agenda here is quite simply the ruling classes, or the classes of Europe intend to stride on to the world stage as a powerful economic entity. And they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> powerful as the US, meaning they want a stronger foreign policy and a military wing to back them up." [...] He also spoke out against Ireland's Catholic bishops, who claimed neither a [...] "Yes" [...] nor a [...] "No" [...] vote would threaten the unborn, saying that EU spending on arms ought to be enough for the bishops to join the [...] "No" [...] campaign.|$|E

50|$|Countercultural {{model is}} a model of contextual {{theology}} which <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> engaging of and relevant to the context {{while at the same time}} remaining faithful to the gospel. This model recognizes the deep ambiguity and even antigospel character of context. In regard to so much of western culture, it seems that Christianity today must speak a word of radical dissent and offer an alternate way of living.|$|R
