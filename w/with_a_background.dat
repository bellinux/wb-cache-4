5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> {{in the hotel}} industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.|$|E
5|$|It {{was thought}} at the time that empty space was filled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>background</b> medium called the luminiferous aether in which the {{electromagnetic}} field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore {{it should be possible to}} measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.|$|E
