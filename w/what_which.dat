25|$|In linguistics, wh-movement (also {{known as}} wh-fronting or wh-extraction or long-distance dependency) {{concerns}} special rules of syntax—rules observed in many languages around the world—involving {{the placement of}} interrogative words. The special interrogatives, whatever the language, are known within linguistics as wh-words (so named because most interrogative words in the English language start with a wh-; for example, who(m), whose, <b>what,</b> <b>which,</b> etc.). Wh-words are used to form questions, and can also occur in relative clauses. In languages exhibiting wh-movement, sentences or clauses containing a wh-word show a special word order that has the wh-word (or phrase containing the wh-word) appearing {{at the front of}} the sentence or clause, e.g. Who do you think about?, instead of in a more canonical position further to the right, e.g. I think about you. The opposite is called wh in situ.|$|E
25|$|Prior to January 1972, {{if someone}} asked Genie a {{question}} using the interrogative word where she invariably responded {{by saying the}} last word of the speaker's sentence. In early January 1972 she began to give accurate, grammatical responses to where questions in conversations. By February 1972, in everyday interactions Genie clearly understood and appropriately acted on most questions using the interrogative words who, what, where, when, why, which, and how. Unlike most children, who grasp who, <b>what,</b> <b>which,</b> and where questions much earlier than when, how, or why questions, {{the only one of}} these which took longer for Genie understand was why and even this took much less time than linguists expected. Because the latter group of questions require more cognitive sophistication to properly answer, the scientists offered this as additional proof that Genie had a higher level of cognitive functioning than most children in similar phases of language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|After {{a lot of}} songwriting {{sessions}} in Europe, Deep Purple decided to record through the summer of 2012, and the band announced the release of their new studio album in 2013. Steve Morse announced to French magazine Rock Hard that the new studio album would be produced by the highly respected Bob Ezrin, {{who is known for}} his works with Alice Cooper, Kiss, and Pink Floyd. On 16 July 2012, the band's co-founding member and former organ player, Jon Lord, died in London, aged 71. In December 2012, Roger Glover revealed in an interview that the band has completed work on 14 songs for a new studio album, with 11 or 12 tracks set to appear on the final album to be released in 2013. On 26 February 2013, the title of the band's nineteenth studio album was announced as Now <b>What?!,</b> <b>which</b> was recorded and mixed in Nashville, Tennessee, and released on 26 April 2013.|$|E

25|$|Result: Kinetic {{immediately}} left Tussauds, but initially {{suffered a}} lack of organization, with Haya not setting a specific list of who should buy <b>what,</b> <b>which</b> nearly resulted in the team buying two three-piece suits for Tussauds' Justin Bieber waxwork. However, the team generally negotiated well, with James in particular being a stand-out. One item which caused the team trouble was a Dashiki, which they spent the day fruitlessly searching for, with Harry H. being mistakenly told it was an Arabic garment instead of an African one. Despite being initially more organized, Atomic's sub-team, Zara and Hayley, wasted time travelling to and from Croydon {{in order to obtain}} a pocketwatch which they paid wildly over the odds for, under the mistaken belief that they were required to purchase one made of gold. On top of that, Harry M. led the team on a wild chase to buy the suit, continually asking adult tailors even after repeatedly being told that they would need to ask a children's tailor for a suit in Bieber's dimensions. Lizzie also made a serious mistake by deciding not to negotiate any discount on a set of shoes {{near the end of the}} day, resulting in a massive fine, with Lord Sugar noting that they would have actually received less of a fine by just not buying the shoes. Kinetic spent £969.10, while Atomic spent £1,480.87.|$|E
2500|$|Kobolds may {{manifest}} as animals, fire, human beings, and objects. Fiery kobolds {{are also}} called drakes, draches, or puks. A tale from the Altmark, recorded by Anglo-Saxon scholar Benjamin Thorpe in 1852, describes the kobold as [...] "a fiery stripe {{with a broad}} head, which he usually shakes {{from one side to}} the other..." [...] A legend from the same period taken from Pechüle, near Luckenwald, says that the kobold flies through the air as a blue stripe and carries grain. [...] "If a knife or a fire-steel be cast at him, he will burst, and must let fall <b>what</b> <b>which</b> he is carrying." [...] Some legends say the fiery kobold enters and exits a house through the chimney. Legends dating to 1852 from western Uckermark ascribe both human and fiery features to the kobold; he wears a red jacket and cap and moves about the air as a fiery stripe. Such fire associations, along with the name drake, may point to a connection between kobold and dragon myths.|$|E

That was the object of scholasticism, and, so far as I am aware, the object of modern science may be expressed in the same terms. In pursuit of this end, modern science takes into account all the phenomena of the universe which are brought to our knowledge by observation or by experiment. It admits {{that there are two}} worlds to be considered, the one physical and the other psychical; and that though there is a most intimate relation and interconnection between the two, the bridge {{from one to the other}} has yet to be found; that their phenomena run, not in one series, but along two parallel lines.|$|E
60|$|I see myself, very distinctly, lashing {{the tiller}} to iron rings that were screwed in the deck beams, {{and know that}} I did this because I {{was too weak to}} hold it any longer and desired to set it so that the Blanche should {{continue}} to drive straight before the gale. I see myself lying in the deck-house of which I have spoken, while Kari fed me with food and water and sometimes thrust into my mouth little pellets of I knew not <b>what,</b> <b>which</b> he took from the leathern bag he wore about him. I remembered that bag. It had been on his person when I rescued him at the quay, for I had seen it first as he washed himself afterwards, half full of something, and wondered what it contained.
