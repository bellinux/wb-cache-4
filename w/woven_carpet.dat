5|$|Carpet weaving {{represents}} a traditional art, {{dating back to}} pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and craft of the <b>woven</b> <b>carpet</b> has integrated different cultural traditions. Traces of Byzantine design can be detected, Turkic peoples migrating from Central Asia, as well as Armenian people, Caucasian and Kurdic tribes either living in, or migrating to Anatolia, brought with them their traditional designs. The arrival of Islam {{and the development of}} the Islamic art also influenced Turkish carpet design. The history of its designs, motifs and ornaments thus reflects the political and ethnic history and diversity of the area of Asia minor. However, scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village tradition.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his essay}} on [...] "Centralized Designs", Thompson relates the central {{medallion}} pattern of oriental carpets to the [...] "lotus pedestal" [...] and [...] "cloud collar (yun chien)" [...] motifs, {{used in the}} art of Buddhist Asia. The origin of the design thus dates back to pre-Islamic times, probably Yuan time China. Brüggemann and Boehmer further elaborate that it might have been introduced to Western Anatolia by the Seljuk, or Mongol invaders in the 11th or 13th century. [...] In contrast to the manifold variation of patterns seen in other carpet types, the Ghirlandaio medallion design has remained largely unaltered from the 15th to the 21st century, and thus exemplifies an unusual continuity of a <b>woven</b> <b>carpet</b> design within a specific region.|$|E
2500|$|Decades {{prior to}} the book's opening, the Seerkind {{combined}} all of their powers to create a secret world known as [...] "The Fugue" [...] – a carpet into which they wove their most beloved locations, animals, possessions and indeed themselves as a safe haven. [...] Their aim was to avoid persecution by humans (who call them demons and fairies) as well as eradication by a destructive being known as The Scourge. This creature's nature is entirely unknown to the Seerkind, given that none of those assaulted by the Scourge survived to describe it.

2500|$|On a knotted {{pile carpet}} (formally, a [...] "supplementary weft cut-loop pile" [...] carpet), the {{structural}} weft threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises {{at right angles}} {{to the surface of the}} weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the warp by one of three knot types (see below), such as shag carpet which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or nap of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in oriental rugs and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The warp threads are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in <b>woven</b> <b>carpet</b> is usually cotton and the weft is jute.|$|E
