As all his own people were asleep, the mates excepted, and the boats could just be discovered by himself, who knew their position, he was in hopes that, should any of the barbarians be near, the presence of his own party could hardly be known. It is true, the alteration in the appearance of the <b>wreck,</b> by the <b>removal</b> of the spars, must strike any one who had seen it before, but this change might have been made by another party of marauders, or those who had now come, if any there were, might see the vessel for the first time.|$|R

5000|$|A {{marine policy}} {{typically}} covered only three-quarter of the insured's liabilities towards third parties. The typical liabilities arise {{in respect of}} collision with another ship, known as [...] "running down" [...] (collision with a fixed object is a [...] "allision"), and <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> (a wreck may serve to block a harbour, for example). In the 19th century, shipowners banded together in mutual underwriting clubs known as Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&I), to insure the remaining one-quarter liability amongst themselves. These Clubs are still in existence today and have become the model for other specialized and noncommercial marine and non-marine mutuals, for example in relation to oil pollution and nuclear risks. Clubs work {{on the basis of}} agreeing to accept a shipowner as a member and levying an initial [...] "call" [...] (premium). With the fund accumulated, reinsurance will be purchased; however, if the loss experience is unfavourable one or more [...] "supplementary calls" [...] may be made. Clubs also typically try to build up reserves, but this puts them at odds with their mutual status.Because liability regimes vary throughout the world, insurers are usually careful to limit or exclude American Jones Act liability.|$|E

40|$|The Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks {{came into}} {{force on the}} 14 of April 2015 and {{provides}} a framework for <b>wreck</b> <b>removal.</b> Three central questions arise when dealing with shipwrecks; Who is responsible? What measures can and are to be taken based on such a responsibility? And lastly; how can the responsibility be enforced? The Nairobi Convention on the Removal of Wrecks addresses these questions. The registered owner of a ship bears strict liability according to the convention but can be exonerated by certain limited defenses. Measures {{that are to be}} taken include locating, marking and subsequently removing the wreck. The onus to remove the wreck is on the registered owner, but there are also options available for the State affected by the wreck should the registered owner not cooperate or be unable to contact. Finally the convention strives to ensure enforceability by compulsory insurance for ships, wherever registered, with a gross tonnage of 300 tons and above calling any port or offshore facility in a State Party. The convention also enables an Affected State to claim the insurer directly. This article will analyze the convention by the use of the convention text, its preparatory works and legal writing. The article suggests that even though the convention provides a unified framework for <b>wreck</b> <b>removal,</b> it has inclusions that may actually inhibit harmonization. The convention is also in part unclear and ambiguous. Despite this the article concludes in the convention being a natural step forward in unifying the regulation of wrecks and providing a platform to deal with <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> in the future...|$|E

40|$|Of {{concern to}} a number of states are wrecks, {{particularly}} those from the two World Wars, which pose a pollution or navigation hazard but which also have historic or broader cultural value. The issue of hazardous wrecks was addressed in 2007 with the adoption of the Nairobi <b>Wreck</b> <b>Removal</b> Convention (“WRC”), which allows states to remove, or have removed, a wreck that poses a hazard to the environment, to navigation or to the broader economic interests of the state. Designed to apply primarily in the exclusive economic zone, but also potentially in the territorial sea, the Convention clarifies states’ powers of intervention with regard to pollution hazards and extends existing powers to cover navigation hazards. This article examines the relationship between the WRC and hazardous historic wrecks. In particular, it considers how the WRC regime might be used to assist states in determining how to remove the hazard {{while at the same time}} protecting the historic value of the wreck.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{environmental}} monitoring of the Concordia <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> project, measurements of currents, winds and sea level height were made along the eastern coast of the Giglio Island, Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), during 2012 – 2013. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effect of atmospheric forcing and periodic sea-level changes on the coastal currents. Normalised Cross-Correlation Function analysis allowed us to correlate these observations. A marked inter-seasonal variability was found in both current and local wind velocity observations but a significant level of correlation between the data was only found during strong wind events. Current and wind directions appeared to be uncorrelated and current measurements showed a predominant NW–SE direction, presumably linked to the shape and orientation of Giglio Island itself. During strong winds from the SSE, current flow was towards the NNW but it suddenly switched from the NNW to the SE at the end of wind events. The results show that, at Giglio Island, currents are principally dominated by the general cyclonic Tyrrhenian circulation, and, secondly, by strong wind events. The sea level had no effects on the current regime...|$|E
40|$|This {{volume is}} the fifth {{in a series of}} six related {{publications}} that make up the U. S. Navy Salvage Manual. Each volume in the family addresses a particular aspect of salvage. The family collectively replaces the three volumes of the U. S. Navy Salvage Manual issued between 1968 and 1973. The increasing importance of preventing pollution at sea, and the fact that major oil spills often result from ship casualties, has made spill prevention and response a specialized adjunct to ship salvage. Having accepted responsibility for a casualty, salvors are expected to endeavor to stop or reduce spillage in progress, to conduct salvage in a manner that minimizes the risk of further spillage, and to respond to spills that occur as a result of salvage work. Additionally, ship salvage or <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> may be conducted separately to limit or prevent pollution. In recognition of these responsibilities, the Navy maintains as part of its salvage assets the ability to respond to major Navy and salvage-related oil spills. This capability is also a national resource.

40|$|A complex {{framework}} of chemical, biological and oceanographic activities was immediately activated after the Costa Concordia shipwreck, to assess possible contamination {{events and the}} environmental impact during both emergency and <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> operations. In the present paper, we describe the results obtained with caged mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, chosen as bioindicator organisms to detect variations of bioavailability and the early onset of molecular and cellular effects (biomarkers). Seven translocation experiments were carried out {{during the first year}} from the incident, with organisms deployed at 2 depths in 3 different sites. After 4 - 6 weeks, tissue concentrations were measured for the main classes of potentially released chemicals (trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile and aliphatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, halogenated pesticides, organotin compounds, brominated flame retardants, anionic surfactants); a wide battery of biomarkers covered responses indicative of exposure, detoxification, oxidative stress, cell damage and genotoxic effects. Results excluded serious contamination events or a consistent increase of environmental pollution although some episodic spills with reversible effects were detected. Data were elaborated within a quantitative weight of evidence (WOE) model which provided synthetic hazard indices for each typology of data, before their overall integration in an environmental risk index, which generally ranged from slight to moderate. The proposed WOE model was confirmed a useful tool to summarize large datasets of complex data in integrative indices, and to simplify the interpretation for stakeholders and decision makers, thus supporting a more comprehensive process of "site-oriented" management decisions...|$|E
40|$|Whenever a major {{accident}} occurs to a ship – whether a fire or an explosion on {{board of the}} ship, or a collision with another ship, or the ship running aground or sinking and becoming a wreck – {{it is likely that}} this casualty will result in considerable physical damage to the ship and its cargo, and in some cases also in loss of life or personal injury to crew members and passengers aboard the ship. Obviously this may have huge financial implications for parties interested in ship and cargo and for crew members, passengers and their relatives. However, a maritime casualty not only affects parties involved in the ship's operation but also third parties. Depending on the circumstances of the incident {{and the nature of the}} resulting damage, (many) third parties from various countries are likely to suffer losses as well. A few examples may help to draw the picture. States may be affected, e. g. if <b>wreck</b> <b>removal</b> and clean-up operations become necessary, but also the financial interests and livelihoods of private individuals and businesses, such as local hotels and restaurants who lose earnings from tourists when the coast line becomes covered by a thick layer of crude oil or fisheries who temporarily or permanently lose access to their fishing grounds. Indirectly, the financial interests of many more parties will be affected by the disaster as its consequences ripple on through the local and national economy. This group includes the sub-buyers and final users of the goods as well as underwriters, whether Hull and Machinery (H&M) underwriters or Protection & Indemnity (P&I) insurers of the ship or marine cargo underwriters. Besides the multitude of interests likely to be affected by a maritime casualty involving a ship, there is also a potential for exceptional financial losses resulting from it. It was reported in 2008 that the costs of clean-up operations in Alaska following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 had reached the figure of US$ 3, 5 billion and still counting. But not only oil tankers and ships carrying other hazardous cargoes are capable of generating such enormous losses. Modern container vessels with over 12, 000 TEU capacity may easily have cargoes on board worth hundreds of millions of Euros, as is illustrated by the fires involving the m. v. “Hanjin Pennsylvania” in 2002 and the m. v. “Hyundai Fortune” in 2006, and the voluntary grounding of the “MSC Napoli” in 2007...|$|E
