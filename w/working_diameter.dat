For most machines, figure on four to six inches of insulation thickness.

Microwave plasma activation substantially widens the range of potential applications compared to conventional atmospheric CVD, because {{it is capable of}} processing temperature-sensitive substrates. A cylinder-type microwave cavity was scaled-up to different <b>working</b> <b>diameters.</b> The half-meter range has already been achieved, and further scale-up potential can be demonstrated. The microwave source offers access to a spatially extended, homogeneous, stable, non-thermal plasma, even in the downstream region. A range of gases can be used for plasma excitation, and the emanating plasma is clean because there is negligible wall interaction. Fluid dynamics modeling was used as a tool for both reactor design and process optimization. In-situ process characterization was provided by spectroscopic methods (optical emission spectra (OES), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)) and a range of atomic and molecular intermediates, precursor fragments, and reaction products were identified. A deep precursor fragmentation occurs in the remote plasma region leading to inorganic layer materials. Silica layers were deposited on stainless steel and glass. Deposition rates were in the range 15 - 100 nm s- 1 (static) and 0. 3 - 2. 0 nm m s- 1 (dynamic).

40|$|The {{development}} of microdrilling technology, nominally defined as drilling technology for 1 -in. -diameter boreholes, shows potential {{for reducing the}} cost of drilling monitoring wells. A major question that arises in drilling microholes is if downhole logging and monitoring in general [...] and downhole seismic surveying in particular [...] can be conducted in such small holes since the inner <b>working</b> <b>diameter</b> of such a seismic tool could be as small as 0. 31 in. A downhole three-component accelerometer package that fits within a 031 -in. inner diameter tube has been designed, built, and tested. The package consists of three orthogonally mounted Entran EGA- 125 - 5 g piezoresistive silicon micromachined accelerometers with temperature compensation circuitry, downhole amplification, and line drivers mounted in a thin-walled aluminum tube. Accelerometers are commercially available in much smaller package sizes than conventional geophones, but the noise floor is significantly higher than that for the geophones. Cross-well tests using small explosives showed good signal-to-noise ratio in the recorded waveform at various receiver depths with a 1, 50 -ft source-receiver well separation. For some active downhole surveys, the accelerometer unit would clearly be adequate. It can be reasonably assumed, however, that for less energetic sources and for greater well separations, the high accelerometer noise floor is not acceptable. By expanding the inner <b>working</b> <b>diameter</b> of a microhole seismic tool to 0. 5 in., other commercial accelerometers {{can be used with}} substantially lower noise floors...|$|E

Recently, we have modeled this disease in mice (Eln+/–) {{and found that}} Eln haploinsufficiency results in unexpected changes in cardiovascular hemodynamics and arterial wall structure. Eln+/– animals {{were found to be}} stably hypertensive from birth, with a mean arterial pressure 25 – 30 mmHg higher than their wild-type counterparts. The animals have only moderate cardiac hypertrophy and live a normal life span with no overt signs of degenerative vascular disease.

Because the Eln+/– mouse is hypertensive, however, the effective arterial <b>working</b> <b>diameter</b> is comparable to that of the normotensive wild-type animal.

Design/methodology/approach: The simulation of metal flow in the asymmetric roll bite region was performed using the program FORGE 2 D. The development of numerous branches of the steelmaking industry imposes increasingly high demands on steel product manufacturers, which can only be met by products manufactured according to the state-of-the-art plastic working technologies. One of the major plastic working technologies is asymmetric rolling. Findings: The analysis shows that the band bends most often toward the lower-speed roll.

In this regard a relevant task is to choose the most effective way of threading. Introduction of multi-coordinate CNC machines considerably extended the use of thread mills, instead of taps, roll burnishers, dies and thread turning tools. The article reviews manufacturer’s production programs of thread mills (Carmex, Emuge, Jel, Sandvik, Vargus) to show that, presently, there is a significant diversity of thread mill designs for processing. The analysis allowed to reveal the main nomenclature and standard sizes of thread mills, including combined tools on their base, as well as to reveal classification signs and to develop classification of thread mills. Classification comprises also combined tools based on design of thread mill, which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types of thread mills and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data of thread mills two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge thread mills with the spiral chip flutes and drill thread mills made from hard alloy. The analysis of design data was made in the closed "system of the tool", i. e. in advance assuming that there is a connection between diameter of the tapping part of the tool and diameter of the cut thread. The parameter analysis of the chosen designs allowed us to develop the sketches of tools with the specified parameters to be calculated.

The SPEs consist of a 4 mm <b>diameter</b> <b>working</b> electrode surface (carbon, platinum or gold) with a silver reference and C/Pt/Au counter electrode. No obvious voltammetric response was observed for NH 3 oxidation on the carbon SPE, however, clear oxidation peaks were observed on Pt and Au.

The voltammetry on Au was complicated by additional peaks (most likely due to water impurities in the RTIL), which leads us to suggest that Pt is the preferred electrode surface material. The conditions of the experiment were chosen to be as close to real conditions as possible (no pre-vacuuming of the RTIL and no polishing/electrochemical cleaning of the SPE surface before experiments) suggesting that Pt SPEs in conjunction with non-volatile RTILs may provide cheaper alternative sensing materials compared to those currently used in commercial amperometric gas sensing devices...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{we suggest}} {{a kind of}} {{metallic}} planar microlenses, consisting of finite-sized two-dimensional nanohole arrays with a triangular lattice distribution. When the lens size and the spacing between two adjacent microlenses become comparable to the working wavelength, the diffraction effect cannot be ignored anymore, which is normally out of consideration for the conventional microlens arrays. Based on the FDTD numerical simulation method, the focusing performance of the microlenses in an array is investigated in detail as the spacing between adjacent microlenses, the <b>working</b> wavelength, the <b>diameter</b> of microlenses, and the array size are changing. The results show that a larger spacing, a larger lens size, a shorter wavelength, or a smaller array scale {{can lead to a}} weaker focusing coupling effect. This research provides a valuable reference to design an array of metallic planar microlenses and to have a good control over its focusing performance. Nevertheless, a further study on this topic is needed to verify the simulation results by the experiments, and also some other problems like the polarization-related coupling and the fringing effect of the focusing remain to be investigated further. The broadband focusing capabilities and the miniaturization of microlenses and their arrays proposed opens a great potential for such applications as high-resolution imaging, flat panel displays, beam collimating for optical fibers, and high-efficiency solar cells.|$|R
