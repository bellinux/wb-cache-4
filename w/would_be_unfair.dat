5|$|Whether a {{timeframe}} {{should be}} imposed for the calling of by-elections has {{been subject to}} much debate. Several arguments have been advanced by the Government. First, when a voter casts a vote for a candidate, he is also voting for the political party that the candidate is a member of. Thus, once the party has received the voter's mandate, a vacant seat will not affect this mandate. Requiring the other members in a GRC to vacate their seats so that a by-election can be called <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to them. Secondly, the Government believes that a GRC can function if it is lacking a member, as MPs from other constituencies can help {{to address the needs}} of residents in that GRC.|$|E

25|$|Police {{disciplinary}} {{charges were}} abandoned when Duckenfield retired on health grounds and, {{because he was}} unavailable, it was decided it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to proceed with disciplinary charges against Bernard Murray. Duckenfield took medical retirement on a full police pension.|$|E
25|$|When Li Chengqi, {{whose name}} had been changed to Li Xiàn {{at this point and}} who was greatly honored by Emperor Xuanzong as an older brother, {{recommended}} a relative named Xue Sixian (薛嗣先) as an official, Song pointed out that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> favoritism as well, and recommended that Xue's service be reexamined.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Guste {{announced}} that his office {{would no longer}} enforce blue laws after a federal judge, Charles Schwartz of New Orleans, ruled that three particular department stores could open on Sundays. Guste said that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to give some businesses an advantage over their competitors by allowing only those given court permission to open on Sunday.|$|E
50|$|The closure was {{subsequently}} brought forward {{and the channel}} closed down on Friday 23 December 2005 at 18:00 (GMT). The reason given <b>was</b> that it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>unfair</b> to expect the channel's staff to work long hours over Christmas knowing that the channel <b>would</b> soon <b>be</b> closing.|$|R

25|$|Passenger fare {{subsidies}} are unpopular outside Metro Manila, with subsidy opponents claiming that their taxes {{are being used}} to subsidize Metro Manila commuters without any benefit to the countryside, and that the fare subsidies should be used for infrastructure improvements {{in the rest of the}} country. In his 2013 State of the Nation Address, President Benigno Aquino III claimed that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> for non-Metro Manila residents to use their taxes to subsidize the LRT and MRT. However, supporters of the subsidies claimed that the rest of the country benefits economically from efficient transportation in Metro Manila.|$|E
25|$|Rolf Bech-Sørensen {{stated that}} advance tolls <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair,</b> {{as it was}} {{taxation}} of people which would not receive the benefit and that it essentially would be taxation of commuting. He therefore proposed that a referendum about advanced tolls {{be held at the}} same time as the 1983 municipal election. The National Roads Administration stated that the advanced tolls would reduce the capital need for the bridge by NOK30 million. State Secretary Karl-Wilhelm Sirkka of the Ministry of Transport and Communications stated that the ministry would in general approve advanced tolls if they had municipal and county support. The proposal was followed up by the county council without much debate.|$|E
25|$|Failure to enjoin the unconstitutional statute {{would require}} the person subject to a {{potential}} violation to either pay the increased rate or face the threat of prosecution. Therefore, the Court determined that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to require challengers of a law to wait until they faced a harsh sanction before they could bring any kind of action questioning the validity of that law. The Court also noted that, although {{a number of cases}} had held that the state itself could not be sued, those cases did not prohibit enjoining a state official, as an individual, from carrying out some task on behalf of the state.|$|E
5000|$|The {{developer}} {{decided to}} start creating the game after complaining across several game developer forums about the [...] "extreme hand-holding of the player" [...] in current generation games and as such {{he set out to}} create a game that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> brutally <b>unfair</b> to the player.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a public}} {{authority}} so conducts itself as {{to create a}} legitimate expectation that a certain course will <b>be</b> followed it <b>would</b> often <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> if the authority were permitted to follow a different course {{to the detriment of}} one who entertained the expectation, particularly if he acted on it. ... The doctrine of legitimate expectation is rooted in fairness.|$|R

25|$|Constantia's {{poems are}} few and far between, yet the ones still in {{circulation}} are seen as proof of her intelligence. Many poems, epigrams, and occasional pieces flowed from her facile pen—written in Latin, Greek, or English; but as they did not come up to her standard of excellence, she burnt them all before her death. None of her poems have been preserved, save a few which she addressed to various friends, notably to Mrs. Barber, and which are too personal to be quoted as they could not possess any interest for the general reader; and, on the other hand, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to give them as specimens of Mrs. Grierson's poetical abilities.|$|E
25|$|Wilson was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the June 1915 King's Birthday Honours, {{having been}} {{passed over for}} the honour in February. He was invited to speak at a Cabinet meeting in summer 1915. In the summer of 1915 Wilson {{believed}} that the French government might fall, or France herself seek peace, unless the British committed to the mooted Loos offensive. He declined French’s offer of a corps command (20 August) claiming it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to divisional commanders who deserved promotion. His efforts {{to be the main}} go-between of French and Joffre ended in September 1915, when it was decided that these contacts should go through Sidney Clive, the British liaison officer at GQG.|$|E
25|$|In 260, {{the fourth}} Wei emperor, Cao Mao, {{attempted}} a coup to seize back {{power from the}} regent, Sima Zhao, who had been monopolising state power since 255. Sima Zhao's younger brother, Sima Gan (司馬幹), heard of the coup and tried to enter the palace to help his brother. However, he was denied entry by Sun You (孫佑), an officer guarding the main gate, {{so he had to}} enter the palace through another gate. When Sima Zhao found out why Sima Gan showed up late, he wanted to execute Sun You and his family. However, Xun Xu advised him against it by pointing out that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> and unjust to punish Sun You's family as well. Sima Zhao heeded Xun Xu's advice and punished Sun You only, by demoting him to the status of a commoner.|$|E

25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E
25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E
500|$|The {{other main}} {{argument}} was an alternative argument, {{that if the}} court decided that the admissions were in fact voluntary, {{they should not have}} been admitted anyway on the basis that to do so <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair,</b> because of factors including Thomas' lack of access to legal advice even where he had a right to obtain it, his vulnerability in the circumstances, and [...] "the contamination of the record of interview by the previous joint team interrogations, and their potential or actual use as levers to remind the applicant of his earlier answers." ...|$|E

500|$|Branson also later thanked local {{residents}} {{for their help}} at the accident site, describing how he [...] "was very impressed to hear how those kind people rallied round, opening their hearts and opening their doors to strangers in distress". Local farmers assisted the emergency services by transporting equipment using quad bikes and four-wheel drive vehicles. Sergeant Jo Fawcett of the Cumbria Constabulary also offered thanks, saying that [...] "There {{are so many people}} who have given up their own time to contribute in some way to dealing with the aftermath of the derailment that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to name them for fear of missing someone out." ...|$|E
500|$|Fonville {{competed in}} the Olympic trials in Evanston, Illinois in mid-July 1948, {{but he was not}} able to meet his own {{standards}} as a result of the injury. He finished fourth and, despite having broken the world record just three months earlier, did not qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. There were some who suggested that Fonville should be named to the Olympic team despite his fourth-place finish at the trials; others argued it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to the third-place finisher to take away his spot on the team. And [...] "there was also a suspicion that Fonville's ailing back hadn't healed and that his performance at Evanston represented the best he can do at this time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{end of each}} issue, {{with the}} {{exception}} of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various Watchmen characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of Watchmen, which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory. Moore said, [...] "By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it." ...|$|E

25|$|For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, {{thinking}} {{they would have}} 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 to bat for 20 overs, it <b>would</b> clearly <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.|$|R
25|$|In Taiwan, Guoyu (national language) {{continues}} to be the official term for Standard Chinese. The term Guoyu however, is less used in the PRC, because declaring a Beijing dialect-based standard to be the national language <b>would</b> <b>be</b> deemed <b>unfair</b> to speakers of other varieties and to the ethnic minorities. The term Putonghua (common speech), on the contrary, implies nothing more than the notion of a lingua franca.|$|R
