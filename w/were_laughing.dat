To make matters worse, his mother punished him whenever {{he tried to make}} friends. Despite his poor social development, he did fairly well in school, particularly in reading.|$|E
25|$|Meinhof's last {{appearance}} in court was on 4 May 1976 when the defendants requested to {{provide evidence about}} the participation of West Germany in the Vietnam war, claiming {{that this was the}} cause of their radicalization, and making the novel request to be granted the status of prisoners of war (see above). According to Jutta Ditfurth, the last days before Meinhof's death went smoothly. The prisoners (including Meinhof) spent their meeting time (30 minutes, twice per day) discussing various philosophers and political issues. One of the guards noted that they <b>were</b> <b>laughing.</b>|$|E
500|$|The kiss between Michael and Oscar in {{the conference}} room was not scripted. The scene had been shot a couple of times with Steve Carell not kissing Oscar Nunez. Then on one take, Oscar saw [...] " [...] lips coming closer and closer". Nunez {{recalled}} [...] "I'm like, 'Dear God, he's going to kiss me.' And sure enough, he planted one on my face." [...] The other cast members <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> during the kiss but because the camera stays focused on Carell and Nunez, the scene was still usable.|$|E

500|$|The exact {{genre of}} Nightcrawler {{has been the}} subject of debate. While most critics agree that the film {{predominantly}} features thriller elements, other descriptions have been used, including dark comedy, drama, horror, and neo-noir. When asked about the film's genre, Gilroy stated: [...] "I see Nightcrawler as having genre elements in the sense that it’s a thriller. It also has some strong dramatic elements and I think I understand the question as there's some really strong elements of drama." [...] Gyllenhaal particularly noted the comedic elements, commenting: [...] "Gilroy and I <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> pretty much the whole movie." ...|$|E

[...] "People <b>were</b> <b>laughing.</b> They were crying. My first impression {{was that it was}} a comedy show and the guy who was lying on the stage was faking it," [...] said Dolphin in a statement to the New Haven Journal-Courier. Dolphin's ambulance partner, Tony Deluise of the New Haven Ambulance Company, said to the Boston Phoenix that he witnessed odd behavior while responding to Slee: [...] "They were all in seats, just sitting there and facing the stage, like an audience. Most were quiet; a few you could hear crying, a few laughing." ...|$|E

Fourteen years later, in 2005, Agnew's line, [...] "Just didn't quite get his leg over" [...] was voted [...] "the greatest sporting commentary of all time" [...] by listeners to BBC Radio 5 Live. The other eight finalists included Kenneth Wolstenholme's [...] "They think it's all over – it is now!" [...] and Ian Robertson's [...] "This is the one. He drops for World Cup glory... It's up! It's over! He's done it! Jonny Wilkinson is England's hero yet again". Agnew and Johnston secured 78% of the votes.|$|E

500|$|In one {{sequence}} {{the character}} Martin Vanger plays the song [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] by Enya before beginning his torture of Mikael Blomkvist. David Fincher, the director, {{said that he}} believed that Martin [...] "doesn’t like to kill, he doesn’t like to hear the screams, without hearing his favorite music" [...] so therefore the character should play a song during the scene. Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said [...] "And we all almost pissed ourselves, we <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> so hard. No, actually, it’s worse than that. He said, ‘Orinoco Flow!’ Everybody looked at each other, like, what is he talking about? And he said, ‘You know, “Sail away, sail away...”’ And I thought, this {{guy is going to}} make Blomkvist as metro as we need." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which O'Malley's colleagues <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> at his funeral was one of Vernoff's {{favorite}} scenes. She added: [...] "Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors… damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. And {{then there are the}} editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck. And that’s what I feel like we had with this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E
500|$|This classic {{scene was}} born {{when the film}} started to focus too much on Harry. Crystal remembers saying, [...] "'We need {{something}} for Sally to talk about,' and Nora said, 'Well, faking orgasm is a great one,' and right away we said, 'Well, the subject is good,' and then Meg came on board and we talked with her {{about the nature of}} the idea and she said, 'Well, why don't I just fake one, just do one?'" [...] Ryan suggested that the scene take place in a restaurant, and it was Crystal who came up with the scene's classic punchline – [...] "I'll have what she's having." [...] In 2005, the quote was listed 33rd on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list of memorable movie lines.

500|$|The {{scene of}} the crime was visited by Father Michael Lewis of the Stella Maris Church, who was {{accompanied}} by Williamson's sister Gradryn Williams; she was convinced not to look at the body by Williamson's friends. Crowds assembled outside the apartment block, made up of individuals who <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> and celebrating Williamson's death. Some of the assembled people shouted out statements such as [...] "This is long overdue", [...] "Battyman he get killed", [...] "Let's get them one at a time", [...] "That's what you get for sin", and [...] "Batty man fi dead!" [...] ("Faggots should die!"). Others sang [...] "Boom Bye Bye", a line from a dancehall song by Buju Banton that discusses shooting and burning gay men. Rebecca Schleifer, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher, had a meeting with Williamson planned for that day, and arrived at his home to find the assembled crowd; she noted that [...] "It was like a parade.

500|$|On September 16, 2013, {{the song}} was {{unexpectedly}} used during player introductions by the Cincinnati Bengals in their home opener against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday Night Football, to tie in the song's jungle theme with the team's nickname. Throughout the game, {{the song was}} also played sporadically during game breaks. Although the Bengals won the game 20-10, the song drew much criticism by Bengals fans {{and even some of}} the team's players. One Bengals fan even told the Wall Street Journal that Steeler fans sitting near him <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> at the Bengals fans throughout the game; the Steelers themselves have used the Styx song [...] "Renegade" [...] frequently at Heinz Field since 2001. Four days after the game, the team publicly apologized, announcing that while the song would not be nixed from Paul Brown Stadium's playlist completely, the team would use a hard rock or classic rock song for player introductions moving forward.|$|E

Very casually I told him that John wasn’t really in and that sent us both into hysterics. We <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> and chatting. I made a nice lunch for Marianne and a bunch of her friends but they never showed up. Paul and I sat together and ate it instead. I’ll never forget the meal – it was chicken casserole. It was such a funny introduction that it threw us both off guard. It could have been very embarrassing, but there was an immediate rapport and we just couldn’t stop talking.” ...|$|E

500|$|The {{core of the}} album's {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} organ, honky-tonk piano, and electronic bass played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered Baldwin organ during the album's recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements {{in addition to the}} album's central timbre. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, varispeed being applied to a few miscellaneous vocals. On [...] "She's Goin' Bald", a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer was used to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo. The album continued Brian's exploration of [...] "party tracks"—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, as if at a party. Mike Love, recalling how [...] "She's Goin' Bald" [...] was a song about fellatio, commented: [...] "We were stoned out of our heads. We <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> our asses off when we recorded that stuff." [...] Brian had previously enacted this approach with Beach Boys' Party! in 1965, thereby mixing that record's style with the modular composition method he devised for [...] "Good Vibrations".|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they <b>were</b> <b>laughing.</b> I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E
500|$|Both Dozier and Yuricon {{president}} Erica Friedman {{wrote about}} the sexual nature of Honey, including the lesbian desire of the Jewel Princess (one of Honey's enemies) {{for her in the}} second episode. Friedman—who had looked for such [...] "implied yuri" [...] in Cutie Honey manga—called the Princess's appearance [...] "*just* what I was hoping for", and praised Honey's change to her S Queen form in response. Ross said about the series: [...] "It's seemingly exploitative, it's incredibly sexist, and the female members of my household - you'd expect them to be indignant, but, no, they <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> their butts off because it was so blatant, and yet Honey was actually never objectified in the whole series." [...] He further writes, [...] "Honey Kisaragi is an extremely strong character who is no damsel in distress. If anyone needs help in this series, it's the guys!" [...] Toole said that Jessica Calvello [...] "gives the character a growling, tough-girl charm that was conspicuously absent from the original version", while Dozier said that Calvello captured [...] "the combination of innocence and bravado [...] that is both so confusing and yet so appropriate". Beveridge said the [...] "fight sequences are pretty well done and provide some fun moments watching Honey battle the various demonic forms", but concluded that Honey main goal is to showcase the lead heroine's changes: [...] "Oh, lets face it. it's all about the half to completely naked transformation sequences. They're grrreat!" ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about {{the inspiration for the}} song. Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I was listening to the words and me and [...] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what people want to do, but are afraid to do." ...|$|E
