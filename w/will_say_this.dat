500|$|Within {{weeks the}} Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C. Marshall, {{implemented}} sweeping {{changes to the}} War Department designed {{to reduce the number}} of people reporting to him so as to free his time for planning and conducting a global war. Three huge new commands were created by Executive Order Number 9082 of 28 February 1942, [...] "Reorganizing the Army and the War Department": the Army Air Forces under Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the Army Ground Forces under Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair and the Services of Supply, under Somervell. As such, he was not only promoted to the rank of lieutenant general over the heads of many more senior officers, but some of them, including Reybold, now found themselves his subordinates. He was answerable to two men: Marshall, and Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson. Somervell built up a good working relationship with both. Senator Harry S. Truman of the Truman Committee disapproved of Somervell's cost overruns, declaring: [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for General Somervell, he will get the stuff, but it is going to be hell on the taxpayer. He has a WPA attitude on the expenditure of money." [...] The Services of Supply were renamed the Army Service Forces in March 1943, as the term [...] "supply" [...] was felt to be too narrow a description of the broad range of logistic activities carried out by the organization. As head of Army Service Forces, Somervell became responsible for the implementation of the Army Supply Program.|$|E
500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about you. People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E

He was a better singer than me, and I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> – that no one came even close to him! He deserved everything he got! We had a great understanding and it was never about one-upmanship". Veteran actor Shammi Kapoor said, [...] "I am incomplete without Mohammad Rafi. I used to often go for the recording of my song, which was sung by Mohammad Rafi, only because I used to like telling him how I would perform on this song on screen so that he can sing it that way. Even he liked my involvement".|$|E
