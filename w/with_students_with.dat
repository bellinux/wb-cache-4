New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has proposed educational reform in New Jersey that pressures teachers not only to [...] "teach to the test," [...] but also have their students perform at the potential cost of their salary and job security. The reform calls for performance-based pay that depends on students' performances on standardized tests and their educational gains. However, students vary based on cognitive, developmental, and psychological abilities, so it is unfair to teachers <b>with</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> difficulties on the test.|$|E

[...] There are five lower elementary schools, Fernway, Mercer, Boulevard, Lomond and Onaway; an upper elementary school, Woodbury Elementary School; Shaker Heights Middle School; and Shaker Heights High School.
