5|$|Horvath {{grew up in}} {{a suburb}} of Cleveland, Ohio and became a {{standout}} high school athlete despite his small stature. He entered Ohio State in 1939 on a work scholarship, but tried out for and made the football team the following year. He played as a reserve halfback on a 1942 team coached by Paul Brown that won Ohio State's first-ever national championship. Horvath graduated that year and moved to Ohio State's dental school. In 1944, however, acting Ohio State football coach Carroll Widdoes asked Horvath to rejoin the team, taking advantage of a World War II-era rule allowing graduate students <b>with</b> <b>remaining</b> eligibility to play. Horvath agreed, and helped lead the Buckeyes to a 9–0 record and a second-place showing in the AP Poll. He won the Heisman and was named an All-American after the season.|$|E

5|$|Production of {{electricity}} in the station ceased in 1919, ushered in by the completion of an extension to generating equipment at Newburn Steelworks. The building was retained and continued {{to be used to}} supply power to the tram route by housing a sub-station, which used rotary converters. The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when the tram route was closed. The station's chimney was demolished in 1949, along <b>with</b> <b>remaining</b> structures of the Tyne Iron Works, which had stood next to the power station throughout its operation.|$|E
5|$|Suitable {{work for}} the class began to decline under British Railways {{ownership}} after the widening of bridges and tunnels on the Hastings line, which enabled Bulleid's powerful Q1class 0-6-0 to be used on freight trains between Hastings and Tonbridge. Following {{the completion of the}} Kent Coast electrification in 1959, the class was congregated at Tonbridge shed alongside members of the U1class to haul local services throughout the Central section. The reduction of work over the Brighton main line and the prevalence of the N class precipitated another move to Stewarts Lane shed in London. However, <b>with</b> <b>remaining</b> work being allocated to Bulleid's Light Pacifics, the class was withdrawn from service in November 1962.|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of 9 Zeros and 18 D3As, {{one of each}} aborting with mechanical problems. The former strafed Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay {{before moving on to}} attack Bellows Army Airfield. They strafed the airfield, and shot down two Curtiss P-40 fighters attempting to take off when the Zeros arrived and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber that had earlier diverted from Hickam Army Airfield, and also destroyed a Stinson O-49 observation aircraft on the ground for the loss of one of their own. The fighters <b>with</b> <b>remaining</b> ammunition expended it strafing MCAS Ewa, the rendezvous point for the second-wave fighters.

5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries <b>with</b> <b>remaining</b> polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake vaccination program {{in order to help}} find Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some people believe that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the group will continue to keep doing these kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} storyline angle, Rated-RKO {{attacked}} Ric Flair {{with steel}} chairs to enrage DX on November 27. At New Year's Revolution in January 2007, Rated-RKO faced DX in a title defense, but the match was declared a no-contest when Triple H suffered a legitimate injury during the match. At Royal Rumble, Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he lasted the longest in the match {{with a time of}} 44:02 and eliminated 5 men and made it to the final 4 in the match before getting eliminated by Shawn Michaels, With Triple H out of action, the team continued their on-screen rivalry <b>with</b> <b>remaining</b> DX member Shawn Michaels. Michaels teamed with John Cena to defeat Rated-RKO for the tag team championship on January 29, 2007. Edge and Orton suffered a series of losses to Cena and Michaels in the following months, In April 2007, Edge competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23. During the match, Matt Hardy threw him onto a ladder and encouraged Jeff Hardy, who was close to the winning briefcase, to finish him off. Hardy then leaped off the 20-foot-high (6.1 m) ladder, and drove him through the ladder with a leg drop, seemingly injuring both Edge & himself. The two were unable to continue the match and were removed from ringside on stretchers. After this Edge and Orton also became rivals in their goals of achieving the WWE Championship. Neither Edge nor Orton won the championship, and they lost their claims as number one contenders after a failed match with Cena at Backlash in April.|$|E
5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, <b>with</b> <b>remaining</b> audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E
