5|$|When the {{air-cooled}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi {{was on hand}} just in {{case something}} went wrong. The technicians <b>woke</b> <b>him</b> early {{so that he could}} see it happen. Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for DuPont staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.|$|E

25|$|Despite an {{outstanding}} season, Paige {{had a strong}} competitor for best Negro league pitcher of 1934, the 21-year-old Slim Jones of the Philadelphia Stars, who went 22–3 in league games. In September, a four-team charity benefit doubleheader was played at Yankee Stadium, with the second game featuring a faceoff between Paige and Jones. Paige recalled driving all night from Pittsburgh and parking near the stadium, then falling asleep in the car. A batboy found and <b>woke</b> <b>him,</b> and he got into uniform {{just in time for}} his scheduled start. In a game that was sometimes described as the greatest game in Negro league history, Paige and Jones battled to a 1–1 tie that was called because of darkness. A rematch was scheduled, and this time Paige and the Crawfords beat Jones and the Stars 3–1.|$|E

As Cook and his men marched the ruler out of the royal enclosure, Cook himself had hold of the elder chief as they walked away from the town towards the beach. Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favorite wife, Kānekapōlei, saw them as they were leaving and yelled after her husband but he did not stop. She called to the other chiefs and the townspeople to alert them to the departure of her husband. Two chiefs, Kanaʻina (Kalaimanokahoʻowaha), the young son of the former ruler, Keaweʻopala and the king's personal attendant named Nuaa followed the group to the beach with the king's wife behind them pleading along the way for the aliʻi nui to stop and come back.|$|E
25|$|Bragg met {{individually}} {{with his}} subordinates and informed {{them that he}} was reorganizing the Army of Tennessee into two wings. Leonidas Polk, the senior lieutenant general on the field (but junior to Longstreet), was given the right wing and command of Hill's Corps, Walker's Corps, and Cheatham's Division. Polk was ordered to initiate {{the assault on the}} Federal left at daybreak, beginning with the division of Breckinridge, followed progressively by Cleburne, Stewart, Hood, McLaws, Bushrod Johnson, Hindman, and Preston. Informed that Lt. Gen. James Longstreet had just arrived by train from Virginia, Bragg designated him as the left wing commander, commanding Hood's Corps, Buckner's Corps, and Hindman's Division of Polk's Corps. (Longstreet arrived late on the night of September 19, and had to find his way in the dark to Bragg's headquarters, since Bragg did not send a guide to meet him. Longstreet found Bragg asleep and <b>woke</b> <b>him</b> around 11 p.m. Bragg told Longstreet he would take charge of the left wing, explained his battle plan for September 20, and provided Longstreet a map of the area.) The third lieutenant general of the army, D.H. Hill, was not informed directly by Bragg of his effective demotion to be Polk's subordinate, but he learned his status from a staff officer.|$|E
500|$|Halcyon House (3400 Prospect Street NW) is a [...] mansion {{originally}} {{built in}} 1787 by Benjamin Stoddert, the first Secretary of the Navy. Halcyon House {{was owned by}} several individuals in the 19th century, and {{is alleged to have}} served as part of the Underground Railroad. The home was sold in 1900 to Albert Clemens, a nephew of Mark Twain. The original structure was heavily altered over the next 38 years. Clemens believed that perpetually rebuilding the house would extend his life. The coach house was joined to the building, apartments added to the north face and rear, rooms built within rooms, hallways added and then walled off, and even a small crypt added in one room. Clemens died in 1938. Halcyon House is allegedly haunted by the spirits of numerous runaway slaves who died there during their escape to freedom, and whose moans and cries can be heard in the basement. Others claim that the ghost of Benjamin Stoddert has been seen, heard walking through the house, sitting in a chair, or whispering unintelligibly. The spirit of a woman has also been spotted in an upstairs window. A six-year-old visitor claimed that the woman frequently <b>woke</b> <b>him</b> at night by rearranging his covers. Two residents say they have experienced levitation during the night, with their bodies being reversed so that their feet were on the pillow. Unnamed residents have told about lights mysteriously going out and sounds in the attic.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Björk starred on {{her acting}} debut Dancer in the Dark. Whilst {{she worked on}} the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music and teaming with new collaborators. She {{had to go to}} Denmark to work on the film and there was nothing going on. She was lying on the beach whilst looking at the ocean, with a ghetto blaster listening to producer Thomas Knak's music. When she realised he was from Copenhagen, she called him up". [...] "Cocoon", produced by Knak, {{was one of the last}} songs to be written for the album; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him. She made a long-distance, late-night phone call to Knak in Denmark, and <b>woke</b> <b>him</b> up. [...] "I didn't have any track of time so she didn't really know that I was asleep. She was explaining that she had this melody in her head and maybe, if I had the time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put down the phone, he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something. I don't really make music so I'm not really used to thinking could the singer really sing in a tempo. From there she started working on the lyrics and one more melody for the vocal".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} for The New York Times, Gilbert Millstein wrote, [...] "its {{publication}} {{is a historic}} occasion {{in so far as}} the exposure of an authentic work of art is of any great moment in an age in which the attention is fragmented and the sensibilities are blunted by the superlatives of fashion" [...] and praised it as [...] "a major novel." [...] Millstein was already sympathetic toward the Beat Generation and his promotion of the book in the Times did wonders for its recognition and acclaim. [...] Not only did he like the themes, but also the style, which would come to be just as hotly contested in the reviews that followed. [...] "There are sections of On the Road in which the writing is of a beauty almost breathtaking...there is some writing on jazz that has never been equaled in American fiction, either for insight, style, or technical virtuosity." [...] Kerouac and Joyce Johnson, a younger writer he was living with, read the review shortly after midnight at a newsstand at 69th Street and Broadway, near Joyce's apartment in the Upper West Side. They took their copy of the newspaper to a neighborhood bar and read the review over and over.

In 1885, a band of 100–150 of Chief Little Shell’s Ojibwe warriors left the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and came to Devils Lake on a Sunday morning before day break while the town was sleeping. The Ojibwe were in a serious dispute with the U.S. government and were angry because white settlers were breaking treaties, stealing Indian timber and killing Indian game. They came to Devils Lake to protest, determined to right a grievance and threatening the settlers. [...] McCreight was the “Indian Man” in Devils Lake, and his roommate doctor <b>woke</b> <b>him</b> before sunrise saying: [...] "Get up quick, the Indians are out there; they are holding a war-dance; they mean devilment and will burn the town; hurry, {{and see what you}} can do with them!" [...] McCreight was sympathetic to Ojibwe grievances and understood their anger and frustration. He immediately went to the Ojibwe camp, parleyed with Little Shell and eventually persuaded the natives to return to Turtle Mountain. McCreight reported, “ It was all over before the town folks stirred about after their late Sunday morning breakfast; and over their own late breakfast, the doctor and the writer decided it best to say nothing, to avoid publicity, for it might interfere with business, and perhaps bring the wrath of General George Armstrong Custer's troops at the fort, against the suffering natives, and so the incident was closed and soon forgotten — forgotten except for the life-long humiliation at failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to intercede for and protect the rights of these abused natives.” ...|$|E
