5|$|At 12, Westenra {{entered a}} {{professional}} recording studio to record Walking in the Air, a demo album originally created {{for friends and}} family. At first, her parents paid for 70 copies; soon after, 1,000 more were cut for sale, hand-out, and publicity. After finishing her album, Westenra and her sister Sophie busked in Christchurch, giving away {{a few of the}} original 70 albums (at the behest of passersby) and selling some of the latter 1000. The pair drew large crowds, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. The woman, a journalist with Canterbury Television, asked Westenra to appear on air. Gray Bartlett, the director of a concert promotion company, saw the show and became interested in working with Westenra. Shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand. On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School, released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>My</b> Gift to You, a CD of Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame Malvina Major.|$|E
25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
500|$|After Charles's death, Lucinda Dalton {{applied to}} cancel her temple sealing to Charles in 1884: [...] "though I {{know he had}} many imperfections... now the brethren say he is unworthy, (though I know not who {{appointed}} them to judge him,) they urge that I stand in a very insecure position, and that for my children's sake, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> own, I ought to marry again." [...] Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her [...] "brethren" [...] considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931.|$|E

I was picking up on things like Chesterton and Conan Doyle, and the sense (which is also in Jane Austen) {{of what it was}} to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place". In particular, [...] "it's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible {{about the rest of the}} world", which connects Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes to Clarke's Jonathan Strange.|$|E
500|$|On March 25, 2008, Gravel {{announced}} that he would leave the Democrats and join the Libertarian Party, saying: [...] "My libertarian views, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> strong stance against war, the military industrial complex and American imperialism, seem not to be tolerated by Democratic Party elites who are {{out of touch with the}} average American; elites that reject the empowerment of American citizens I offered to the Democratic Party at the beginning of this presidential campaign with the National Initiative for Democracy." [...] The following day Gravel entered the race for the 2008 Libertarian presidential nomination, saying that he would have run as a third-party candidate all along except that he needed the public exposure that came from being in the earlier Democratic debates. Gravel's initial notion of running as a fusion candidate with other parties was met with skepticism and not pursued.|$|E

Her sister, Ali (who plays herself, according to Lohan), goes to her bedroom after coming home from ballet class, breaks into tears, saying a rosary. The three rooms are shown behind a department store window, outside which a crowd of observers form. At the end of the video, Lohan stands behind the glass and photographs of memories fly up onto it, from which she breaks out. As a response to the video, Lindsay's father {{wrote a letter to the}} New York Daily News, saying, [...] "while I always considered and expressed how truly blessed Lindsay, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> other children are, I never realized how blessed I am to have a daughter as amazing as Lindsay.

500|$|The film's {{score was}} {{performed}} by the London Symphony Orchestra with Belgian composer Dirk Brossé conducting. It was recorded in the United Kingdom at the Watford Coloseum and the London AIR Lyndhurst Hall and was mixed at the Manhattan Center Studios in the United States. In the liner notes to the album, Goldenthal describes the soundtrack as combining [...] "orchestration techniques associated with the late 20th-century Polish avant-garde, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> own experiments from Alien 3, and 19th-century Straussian brass and string instrumentation." [...] In the film's 'Making of' featurette, Goldenthal states he used [...] "ghostly choral" [...] music when the Phantoms are emerging, {{in an attempt to}} give a celestial feeling, and focused on low brass clusters and taiko drum rhythms for violent scenes. When Aki talks about a dying girl, Goldenthal used a piano in order to give a domestic home-like feeling to a completely foreign environment, also choosing to use a flute each time Aki focusses on Gaia, as he believed it to be the most [...] "human kind of instrument".|$|E

[...] When asked how she now felt about the songs on 2.0, she stated [...] "a lot of the songs were transitional.

2500|$|Qizhou {{was a major}} {{fortress}} city situated {{near the}} Yangtze and a 25 thousand strong Jin army advanced on it in 1221. News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand [...] "great leather bombs" [...] (皮大炮), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, {{they were unable to}} match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, [...] "The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb , whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [...] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their cheeks were exploded to bits, and only one half [...] was left." [...] Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: [...] "The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [...] at the eastern gate, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> own quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, {{to the point that they}} struck even on top of [...] sleeping quarters and [...] nearly perished! Some said there was a traitor. If not, how would they have known the way to strike at both of these places?" [...] Zhao was able to examine the new iron bombs himself and described thus, [...] "In shape they are like gourds, but with a small mouth. They are made with pig iron, about two inches thick, and they cause the city's walls to shake." [...] Houses were blown apart, towers battered, and defenders blasted from their placements. Within four weeks all four gates were under heavy bombardment. Finally the Jin made a frontal assault on the walls and scaled them, after which followed a merciless hunt for soldiers, officers, and officials of every level. Zhao managed an escape by clambering over the battlement and making a hasty retreat across the river, but his family remained in the city. Upon returning at a later date to search the ruins, he found that the [...] "bones and skeletons were so mixed up that there was no way to tell who was who." ...|$|E
