5|$|The series began {{development}} in January 2007. HBO acquired the TV {{rights to the}} novels, with Benioff and Weiss as its executive producers, and Martin as a co-executive producer. The intention was for each novel to yield a season's worth of episodes. Initially, Martin <b>would</b> <b>write</b> one episode per season while Benioff and Weiss <b>would</b> <b>write</b> {{the rest of the}} episodes. Jane Espenson and Bryan Cogman were later added to write one episode apiece the first season.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{literary}} and theatrical {{activities of the}} Round Table members, it was perhaps inevitable that they <b>would</b> <b>write</b> and stage their own revue. No Sirree!, staged for one night only in April 1922, was a take-off of a then-popular European touring revue called La Chauve-Souris, directed by Nikita Balieff.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow often {{wrote in}} his first-floor study, {{formerly}} Washington's office, surrounded by portraits of his friends, including charcoal portraits by Eastman Johnson of Charles Sumner, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Cornelius Conway Felton. Longfellow <b>would</b> <b>write</b> either at the center table, at the desk, or in the armchair by the fire.|$|E

5|$|Some mathematicians (e.g., Isaac Newton) used exponents {{only for}} powers greater than two, preferring to {{represent}} squares as repeated multiplication. Thus they <b>would</b> <b>write</b> polynomials, for example, as ax + bxx + cx3 + d.|$|E
5|$|At a {{rehearsal}} {{for one of}} these entertainments, Ages Ago (1869), the composer Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer Arthur Sullivan. Two years later, Gilbert and Sullivan <b>would</b> <b>write</b> their first work together. Those two intervening years continued to shape Gilbert's theatrical style. He continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas Our Island Home (1870) and A Sensation Novel (1871), and the blank verse comedies The Princess (1870), The Palace of Truth (1870), and Pygmalion and Galatea (1871).|$|E
5|$|May 4, 2017, the United States House of Representatives {{voted to}} pass the American Health Care Act (and thereby repeal most of the Affordable Care Act) by a narrow margin of 217 to 213, sending the bill to the Senate for deliberation. The Senate Republican {{leadership}} announced that Senate Republicans <b>would</b> <b>write</b> {{their own version of}} the bill, instead of voting on the House version.|$|E

5000|$|Before Mandarin gained {{popularity}} among Malaysian Chinese {{in the late}} 20th century, Malaysian Chinese romanised their names according to their respective Chinese varieties.

5|$|Meyer found {{writing the}} script to be a smooth process. He <b>would</b> <b>write</b> a few pages, {{show it to}} Nimoy and Bennett for consultation, and return to his office to write some more. Once Nimoy, Bennett, and Meyer were happy, they showed the script to Shatner, who offered his own notes for another round of rewrites. The {{completed}} script was shown to Paramount executives, who were very pleased.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to eschew scripts for storyboards {{is one that}} Hillenburg made {{early on in the}} series' development. Rocko's Modern Life had also used storyboarding, and having worked on that series, Hillenburg felt strongly about adopting the process for SpongeBob SquarePants— even though Nickelodeon was beginning to show greater preference for script-driven cartoons. Another writer for the series, Merriwether Williams, described in an interview that she and Mr. Lawrence <b>would</b> <b>write</b> a draft for an episode in an afternoon and be done at 4 o'clock.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} broadly well {{received}} by critics {{and went into}} the best-seller lists {{by the end of the}} first week of sales, selling 44,093 copies in four days to become the fastest-selling fiction book after the Harry Potter titles. Faulks stated that although he enjoyed writing the book, he <b>would</b> <b>write</b> no more Bond novels.|$|E

If the preceding magnetic polarity was already positive, the resulting pattern might look like this: −−+. A value of 255, or all binary ones, <b>would</b> be <b>written</b> as −+−+−+−+ or +−+−+−+−.

5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he <b>would</b> <b>write</b> Rewrites overall story.|$|E
5|$|Alley {{was one of}} the few {{figures who}} were trusted by {{northern}} and southern Dahomeyans alike. His role was only temporary, until power was to be ceded back to civilians in six months time. Among the events on the official timetable, which the military published on January 17, 1968, was the creation of a nonmilitary Constitution Commission on January 31, which <b>would</b> <b>write</b> a new Dahomeyan constitution. The document granted Alley strong executive power, and was adopted by the Comite Militaire Revolutionaire, Alley's interim government comprisising only military officers, in early March. A national referendum on the constitution was held on March 31, which passed with 92 percent in favor.|$|E
5|$|During filming on December 28, 1996, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola filed {{a lawsuit}} against Warner Bros. and Sagan, who had died the {{previous}} week. Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975, titled First Contact. Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project, as well as from any novel Sagan <b>would</b> <b>write,</b> with American Zoetrope and Children's Television Workshop Productions. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon and Schuster published Contact and Warner moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film.|$|E

5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He <b>would</b> <b>write</b> five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and <b>would</b> <b>write</b> or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E
5|$|In The History of The Lord of the Rings series Christopher Tolkien {{recorded}} {{that his}} father had not foreseen the emergence of Faramir during the writing of the book, only inventing him at the actual point of his appearance in The Two Towers. J.R.R.Tolkien noted that the introduction of Faramir had led to postponement of the book's dénouement and to further development of the background for Gondor and Rohan. Long after completing The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien <b>would</b> <b>write</b> that of all characters Faramir resembles the author most, and that he had deliberately bestowed upon the character several traits of his own.|$|E
