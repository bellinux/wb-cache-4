50|$|Surfactants {{are usually}} organic {{compounds}} that are amphiphilic, meaning they contain both hydrophobic groups (their tails) and hydrophilic groups (their heads). Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a <b>water-soluble</b> <b>component.</b> Surfactants will diffuse {{in water and}} adsorb at interfaces between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.|$|E
40|$|The melting {{behavior}} {{of water in}} human stratum corneum (s. corneum) has been studied by sing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the temperature range from - 40 ° to 20 °C. The DSC thermogram was analyzed {{in terms of the}} amount of about water and the melting temperature of water in s. corneum. Extraction of the s. corneum with the mixed solvent of chloroform: methanol (2 : 1, v/v) or 0. 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate aqueous solution decreased the bound water content, whereas extraction with water did not change the bound water content. The melting temperature of water in the s. corneum was lowered as the water contents decreased. Extraction of the <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> from the s. corneum increased the melting temperature of water when the water contents were constant. The results suggest that 20 – 30 % of water in the s. corneum is bound water interacting strongly with the protein or lipids in the s. corneum, and the excess of water over the bound water content is unbound water solubilizing the <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> such as amino acids and urea in the s. corneum. The thermodynamic theory for freezing-point depression is favourably applied to the melting temperature change of the unbound water, which implies that the <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> are present as an aqueous solution in the s. corneum. Measurements of the melting-point depression of water in s. corneum provides us the quantitative information on the amount of <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> in the s. corneum.

5000|$|Schunck {{showed that}} {{alizarin}} {{was not the}} major colour precursor component of fresh madder root, {{but it was a}} yellow, bitter, <b>water-soluble</b> <b>component,</b> which he called rubian. Rubian was obtained from the water extract of madder root by adding bone-charcoal and extracting the bone-charcoal with ethanol. Rubian was an uncrystallisable gum, hydrolysable by acids or an enzyme contained in the madder root to give alizarin and a sugar. Rubian was actually a mixture of glycosides of di and trihydroxy anthraquinones of which a major component was ruberythric acid which is an alizarin 2-b-primeveroside. Many other [...] "compounds" [...] derived from the hydrolysis of rubian were described and enthusiastically named by Schunck: rubiretin, verantin, rubiacin, rubiadin, rubiapin, rubiafin and others, but some of these {{are most likely to be}} impure alizarin, and best forgotten. Some of Schunck's original samples were examined in 1975 by Wilfrid Farrar. Rubiadin was shown to be 1,3-dihydroxy-2-methyl anthraquinone, which Schunck assigned as the 4-methyl isomer. Rubiacine was identical to nordamnacanthal (1,3-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-aldehyde) and rubianine was an unusual C-glucoside of unknown constitution.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 {{high levels}} of MTBE were {{unexpectedly}} discovered in the water wells of Santa Monica, California, and the U.S. Geological Survey reported detections. Subsequent U.S. findings indicate {{tens of thousands of}} contaminated sites in water wells distributed across the country. As per toxicity alone, MTBE is not classified as a hazard for the environment, but it imparts an unpleasant taste to water already at very low concentrations. The maximum contaminant level of MTBE in drinking water has not yet been established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The leakage problem is partially attributed to the lack of effective regulations for underground storage tanks, but spillage from overfilling is also a contributor. As an ingredient in unleaded gasoline, MTBE is the most <b>water-soluble</b> <b>component.</b> When dissolved in groundwater, MTBE will lead the contaminant plume with the remaining components such as benzene and toluene following. Thus the discovery of MTBE in public groundwater wells indicates that the contaminant source was a gasoline release. Its criticism and subsequent decreased usage, some claim, is more a product of its easy detectability (taste) in extremely low concentrations (ppb) than its toxicity. The MTBE concentrations used in the EU (usually 1.0-1.6%) and allowed (maximum 5%) in Europe are lower than in California.|$|E
40|$|Fermentation {{technology}} is potentially sustainable {{for its use}} of renewable feedstocks. Large-scale application requires efficient downstream processing integrated with fermentation, which can be established by in situ product removal. In this field, the removal of slightly water-soluble compounds that are subject to speciation is challenging. Application of electrodialysis (ED), promising for product removal of charged compounds, is limited for slightly <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components.</b> Our approach, electrochemically induced crystallization (EIC), makes use of crystallization of slightly <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> inside ED modules {{as a means of}} in situ product removal. Proof-of-principle experiments show that EIC effectively decreases concentrations of several carboxylic acids in aqueous systems. Fermentation experiments with Pseudomonas putida S 12 indicated that integration of EIC with bio-based processes should be in an external loop with indirect contact to avoid a decrease in biomass activity and fouling of biomass inside the ED module. The implementation study demonstrates that high product removal rates can be maintained by regenerating the ED module using an auxiliary phase. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|A {{change in}} the {{chemical}} compositions of volcanic gases {{is one of the}} noticeable phenomena that frequently occurs prior to an eruption. Analysis of the <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> adhering to volcanic ash is available for remote monitoring of volcanic gases from inaccessible volcanoes. It is a secure method for monitoring volcanic activity without using particular devices. Prolonged volcanic eruption at the Unzen Fugendake volcano from 1990 to 1995 started with a phreatic eruption after 198 years of dormancy. Volcanic activity changed from a phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruption to a magmatic eruption with pyroclastic flows in May 1991. The relationship between the chemical composition of volcanic ash and the contents of the <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> adhering to it are discussed in relation to the early stage of the long-term eruption. Volcanic ash ejected by phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruption before dome formation was the product of the alteration in the volcanoclastic materials beneath the surface. The ash had a high content of <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components,</b> which was caused by the absorption of hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide gases from magma into wet debris before dome formation. Volcanic ashes which were generated by pyroclastic flows after dome formation were fresh lava fragments. While the contents of water-soluble sulfate adhering to the ash noticeably decreased, those of water-soluble chloride adhering to the ash hardly decreased. The considerable decrease in the contents of water-soluble sulfate was caused by the reaction of volcanic gases with dry lava fragments. Contrary to this, the concentration of hydrogen chloride gas in ash clouds was extremely high...|$|R

40|$|The {{conversion}} of barley starch to sugars {{is a complex}} enzymic process. Most previous work concerned the biotechnical aspect of in situ barley enzymes. However, the interactions among the macromolecular substrates and their effects on enzymic catalysis has been little examined. Here, we explore the mechanisms whereby interactions of protein and starch in barley flour affect the kinetics of enzymatic hydrolysis of starch in an in vitro system, using digestion rate data and structural analysis by confocal microscopy. The degradation kinetics of both uncooked barley flour and of purified starches {{are found to be}} two-step sequential processes. Barley proteins, especially the <b>water-soluble</b> <b>component,</b> are found to retard the digestion of starch degraded by a-amylase: the enzyme binds with water-insoluble protein and with starch granules, leading to reduced starch hydrolysis. These findings are of potential industrial value in both the brewing and food industries...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric dicarboxylic acids (DCA) are a {{ubiquitous}} <b>water-soluble</b> <b>component</b> {{of secondary}} organic aerosols (SOA), which {{can act as}} cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), affecting the Earth's climate. Despite the high abundances of oxalic acid and related compounds in the marine aerosols, {{there is no consensus}} on what controls their distributions over the open ocean.

Here we present latitudinal distributions of DCA, oxoacids and -dicarbonyls in the marine aerosols from the remote Pacific. Their concentrations were found several times higher in more biologically influenced aerosols (MBA) than less biologically influenced aerosols. We propose isoprene and unsaturated fatty acids as sources of DCA as inferred from significantly higher abundances of isoprene-SOA tracers and azelaic acid in MBA. These results have implications toward the reassessment of climate forcing feedbacks of marine-derived SOA...|$|E
40|$|Solar {{distillation}} {{can be used}} {{to produce}} potable water from contaminated water. However, studies show that ions such as F(-) and NO(3) (-) occur in distillates from solar stills. In order to understand the reasons for this behavior, imaging and distillation experiments were conducted. White dots were seen in the vapor space above the interface of hot water poured into containers. The concentrations of various ions such as F(-) and SO(4) (2 -) in the distillates from thermal and solar distillation experiments were roughly comparable when the feed consisted of deionized water and also solutions having fluoride concentrations of 100 and 10 000 mg/L. These observations suggest that aerosols enter the distillation setup through leaks and provide nuclei for the condensation of water vapor. The <b>water-soluble</b> <b>component</b> of aerosols dissolves in the drops formed, and some of the drops are transferred to the distillate by buoyancy-driven convection...|$|E

30|$|Besides, {{there were}} no {{significant}} differences in the amount of <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> (e.g. chrysin- 6 -C-Ara- 8 -C-Glc, chrysin- 6 -C-Glc- 8 -C-Ara, norwogonin- 7 - O-GlcA and chrysin- 7 -O-GlcA) and lipid components (like oroxylin A) present in the extracts prepared by MAE-W and HRE-W (Fig.  2 b). As expected, using UE with ethanol, the yield of most <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> were lower compared with those prepared by MAE-W and HRE-W (e.g. 19  % decrease of baicalin), whereas higher yields of the major lipid-soluble components (e.g. baicalein, 119  %; wogonin, 79  %; oroxylin A, 197  %) were observed probably due to the higher solubility of these compounds in ethanol. When water was used as solvent in UE, the least amount of these identified compounds could be obtained. These results therefore suggested that based on the profiles and quantity of all chemicals detected in the extracts, the MAE-W method is as good as the commonly used HRW-E method, whereas the efficiency and effectiveness of the UE method is highly dependent on the solvent used.|$|R
50|$|The Swiss Water® Process uses Green Coffee Extract (GCE) for the {{caffeine}} extraction mechanism.  Green Coffee Extract {{is a solution}} containing the <b>water-soluble</b> solids <b>components</b> of green coffee except {{the caffeine}}.  The process relies on {{the stability of the}} soluble components of the GCE and the gradient pressure difference between the GCE (which is caffeine lean) and the green coffee (which is caffeine rich). This gradient pressure causes the caffeine molecules to migrate from the green coffee into the GCE. Because GCE is saturated with the other <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> of green coffee only the caffeine molecule migrates to the GCE; the other water-soluble coffee elements are retained in the Green Coffee.

40|$|Directed {{assembly}} of triblock copolymer worms to produce nanostructured fibers is achieved via colloid electrospinning. These copolymer worms are conveniently prepared by polymerization-induced self-assembly in concentrated aqueous dispersion. Addition {{of a second}} <b>water-soluble</b> <b>component,</b> poly(vinyl alcohol), {{is found to be}} critical for the production of well-defined fibers: trial experiments performed using the worms alone produce only spherical microparticles. Transmission electron microscopy studies confirm that the worm morphology survives electrospinning and the worms become orientated parallel to the main axis of the fibers during their generation. The average deviant angle (θdev) between the worm orientation and fiber axis decreases from 17 ° to 9 ° as the worm/PVA mass ratio increases from 1. 15 : 1 to 5 : 1, indicating a greater degree of worm alignment within fibers with higher worm contents and smaller fiber diameters.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comObjective: To examine the effect of topically applied tea tree oil (TTO) on histamine-induced oedema in the ears of mice. Methods and results: For BALB/c mice, 10 7 undiluted TTO applied immediately after, but not 30 min before intradermal injection of 600 7 g histamine in 10 7 l, significantly suppressed oedema development. TTO applied after histamine injection also suppressed histamine-induced oedema in C 57 /BL 6 mice. TTO applied immediately after intradermal injection of compound 48 / 80 (200 7 g in 10 7 l saline) also significantly reduced ear swelling. TTO suppressed histamine-induced oedema to the same extent in capsaicin-treated (neuropeptide-depleted) and control mice which suggests that TTO does not inhibit histamine-induced oedema by regulating the activity of peripheral sensory neurons. Terpinen- 4 -ol, the major <b>water-soluble</b> <b>component</b> of TTO, was equivalent in potency to TTO in the suppression of histamine-induced ear swelling. Conclusion: Topical application of TTO, and in particular terpinen- 4 -ol, may be effective in controlling histamine-induced oedema often associated with Type I allergic immediate hypersensitivities.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of sericin supplementation in a maturation medium on the meiotic competence and fertilisability of sheep oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured in TCM 199 supplemented with sericin at various concentrations of 0 (control), 0. 1, 0. 25 and 0. 5 %, either with or without bovine serum albumin (BSA). When the COCs were matured without BSA, the supplementation of 0. 1 % sericin significantly increased the rates of maturation to metaphase II and the total fertilisation of oocytes compared with the other concentrations of sericin. When the COCs were matured with BSA, the beneficial effects of 0. 1 % sericin supplementation on the maturation and fertilisation of oocytes were not observed. Our findings indicate that supplementation with 0. 1 % sericin during maturation culture may improve the nuclear maturation and fertilisability of sheep oocytes.

40|$|Biorefinery of {{sunflower}} whole {{plant can}} be conducted with water using a nine modules Clextral Evolum HT 53 twin-screw extruder (TSE). Aqueous extraction of oil is an environmentally cleaner alternative technology to solvent extraction. TSE carries out three unit operations: conditioning and grinding, liquid/solid (L/S) extraction and L/S separation. The compressing {{action by the}} reverse screws (CF 2 C) is essential for L/S separation. Positioned in module 9, CF 2 C screws push part of the mixture upstream against the general movement in TSE, and this counter pressure ensures the L/S separation efficiency above the metal filter, located in eighth position. Oil is extracted {{in the form of}} two emulsions, stabilized by phospholipids and proteins, and usable as co-emulsifiers in cosmetic industry. An aqueous extract containing <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> from whole plant is also generated; it could be recycled. As a mixture of fibers and proteins, the cake can be moulded by thermo-pressing into boards, usable in the furniture and building industries. In this study, fractionation was conducted from next inlet flow rates: 54 kg/h solid and 183 kg/h water (3. 4 L/S ratio). The screw speed varied from 249 to 124 rpm, corresponding to a filling coefficient (ratio of the solid inlet flow rate to the screw speed) from 217 to 436 g/h rpm. The filling coefficient directly affects the L/S separation efficiency. The latter can be estimated from next experimental data: the outlet flow rates of both cake and filtrate, the cake moisture content, the residual contents of oil and <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> in the cake, and the extraction yields in dry matter, lipids and <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components.</b> For low filling coefficients (i. e. high screw speed), the L/S mixture compression in CF 2 C screws is insufficient, not allowing a satisfactory L/S separation. Conversely, for high filling coefficients (i. e. low screw speed), solid particles accumulate more upstream from the pressing zone, obstructing part of the filtering screens and thus reducing the filtration surface. A less efficient L/S separation is then observed. From the experimental data evolution, optimal screw speed was estimated at 182 rpm using a second order polynomial regression, corresponding to a filling coefficient of 297 g/h rpm. Extraction yields in dry matter, lipids and <b>water-soluble</b> <b>components</b> were 22 %, 49 % and 40 %, respectively. Such filling would lead to a specific mechanical energy of 103 W/h kg whole plant processed...|$|R
