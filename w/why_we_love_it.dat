5000|$|Averill {{notes the}} hints of rapture, [...] "quasi-religion" [...] and erotic passion in the {{language}} used by barbershoppers to describe the emotional effect. He quotes Jim Ewin as reporting [...] "a tingling of the spine, the raising of the hairs {{on the back of}} the neck, the spontaneous arrival of goose flesh on the forearm ... the fifth note has almost mysterious propensities. It's the consummation devoutly wished by those of us who love Barbershop harmony. If you ask us to explain <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> so, we are hard put to answer; that's where our faith takes over." [...] Averill notes too the use of the language of addiction, [...] "there's this great big chord that gets people hooked." [...] An early manual was entitled [...] "A Handbook for Adeline Addicts".|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} [...] "Monument" [...] {{was well}} received by Rock Sound who awarded it 8/10 [...] "Since metalcore started merchandising a band’s image and paint-splattered jock-straps, before a fairly blueprinted sound structure, it’s {{been a difficult}} path to tread to find which bands are worth sticking around to listen to, but with their second outing ‘Monument’, Miss May I have firmly marked their place for Killswitch Engage’s support slots. The thunderous attacks of ‘Relentless Chaos’ and ‘Creations’ show the band’s steps towards thrash tendencies to a well worked effect. With exhilarating time signatures and ruthless musicianship, Miss May I have shown {{what it was that}} made metalcore exciting in the first place, and <b>why</b> <b>we</b> can <b>love</b> <b>it</b> once again." ...|$|R
5000|$|Annalee Newitz of io9 says [...] "What's terrific about Isa is that it's {{playing in}} the same {{thematic}} sandbox as other great works of contemporary science fiction, from Orphan Black to Ramez Naam's Nexxus series, but takes them in a new direction." [...] She goes on, [...] "That's <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> this movie. <b>It</b> makes no apologies for having a female hero, and makes no {{big deal out of}} it, either. Ultimately it's about a group of characters, and how they function in a future world of brain implants and programmable minds." ...|$|R
40|$|Don Watson {{talks about}} his {{recently}} published travel book, American journeys which investigates {{the meaning of the}} United States: its confidence, its religion, its heroes, its violence, and its material obsessions. The things that make America great are also its greatest flaws. Not long after 9 / 11 Don Watson wrote a Quarterly Essay about Australia’s relationship with the US. Called Rabbit Syndrome, it provoked huge debate -unsurprisingly, given that America is Australia’s most important ally. But America is just about everyone’s most important ally. So what is it that has made the US so extraordinarily successful? <b>Why</b> do <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> so much yet clearly loathe it at the same time? How can it be so dynamic yet so neglectful of its own citizens, such a land of freedom and oppression all at once?Don Watson is a Melbourne-based freelance writer with a PhD from Monash University. He has been a speechwriter for former Victorian Premier, John Cain, and has also served as speechwriter and adviser to former Prime Minister, Paul Keating until Keating’s defeat in the 1996 election. Talk recorded at the University of Adelaide, Bragg Lecture Theatre, Thursday 6 March 2008, at a free public event hosted by the Friends of the University of Adelaide Library...|$|R

5000|$|Kotsko has {{published}} three short books on popular culture, Awkwardness: An Essay (2010), <b>Why</b> <b>We</b> <b>Love</b> Sociopaths: A Guide to Late Capitalist Television (2012), and Creepiness (2015). Each book draws out a specific theme found in contemporary U.S. TV shows; Awkwardness addressing the curious rise of [...] "awkward humor" [...] in the 21st century, <b>Why</b> <b>We</b> <b>Love</b> Sociopaths addressing {{the trend toward}} {{a certain type of}} deeply antisocial protagonist, and Creepiness uses a Freudian lens to distinguish a discomfiting strain of popular culture from the topic of the first book. The trilogy was greeted with general acclaim, with the Oxonian Review declaring that [...] "Awkwardness is just what a work of philosophy should be", and Scott Berkun describing <b>Why</b> <b>We</b> <b>Love</b> Sociopaths as [...] "a second cousin to Postman’s classic Amusing Ourselves to Death." [...] <b>Why</b> <b>We</b> <b>Love</b> Sociopaths, however, also drew criticism for its admittedly non-technical use of the term sociopathy.|$|R

[...] "There are many reasons <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> The Vampire Diaries: a hot cast, intriguing characters, suspenseful storylines. But above all, perhaps, is this: the show actually provides answers. It doesnt drag out mysteries with no end in sight. Every week, viewers are treated to valuable nuggets of information, while, of course, dropping their jaws over new questions and plot developments. Thats also <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>love</b> The Vampire Diaries.
