25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And <b>we</b> <b>realize</b> that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E

[...] He also noted that the Centipede theme was 'dramatically transformed' when Chan kills Agent Quan; [...] "the low brass blast out a huge statement of the Centipede Theme ... The heavy, brassy orchestration offers a completely new take on the theme, which used to exist only in creepy bells." ...|$|E
500|$|In hindsight, {{historians have}} faulted the Americans, {{especially}} Patch and Halsey, {{for not taking}} advantage of their ground, aerial, and naval superiority to prevent the successful Japanese evacuation of most of their surviving forces from Guadalcanal. Said Chester Nimitz, commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, {{of the success of}} Operation Ke, [...] "Until the last moment it appeared that the Japanese were attempting a major reinforcement effort. Only the skill in keeping their plans disguised and bold celerity in carrying them out enabled the Japanese to withdraw the remnants of the Guadalcanal garrison.

500|$|Mark Lawson of The Guardian {{noted that}} the cause of Cal's {{hermaphroditic}} condition is an inherited recessive gene. According to UC Riverside psychology professor Sonja Lyubomirsky, the novel examines how an individual's traits are due neither solely to nature nor solely to nurture. Similarly, Cal's gender cannot be defined solely as male or female. Rather, it is both male and female. Addressing how genetic determinism may have renewed the antediluvian beliefs about destiny, Eugenides refutes the post-Freudian beliefs that a person's traits are mainly due to nurture. Thus, the novel pits evolutionary biology against free will. Eugenides sought to find a compromise between these two views. Explaining that gender is a [...] "very American concept", he believes that [...] "humans are freer than <b>we</b> <b>realize.</b> Less genetically encumbered." ...|$|E

[...] But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy—the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying {{to the rhythm of}} Billy's spiel. [...] And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, <b>we</b> <b>realize</b> that R & H have not only skipped the overture and the opening number but the exposition as well.

500|$|Yard {{believed}} that eligible national parks {{had to be}} scenically stunning. [...] He noted in his 1919 volume The Book of the National Parks that the major characteristic of almost all national parks was that their scenery had been forged by geological or biological processes. [...] He wrote, [...] "e shall not really enjoy our possession of the grandest scenery in the world until <b>we</b> <b>realize</b> that scenery is the written page of the History of Creation, and until we learn to read that page." [...] Yard's standards also insisted upon [...] "complete conservation", meaning avoidance of commercialism and industrialization. [...] Often referring to parks as [...] "American masterpieces", he sought {{to protect them from}} economic activities such as timber cutting and mineral extracting. [...] In such, Yard often advocated the preservation of [...] "wilderness" [...] conditions in America's national parks.|$|E

We will be assembling a blue-ribbon panel to look at the issue. We're looking at reactors that have a high-energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long-lived actinide waste. These are fast-neutron reactors. There's others: a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy, but again creates high-energy neutrons that can burn down the long-lived actinides. ...|$|E
500|$|On February 14, 2012, it was {{announced}} that Solo had signed with the Seattle Sounders Women. Joining the club the same year were national teammates Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, and Sydney Leroux. Sounders Women general manager, Amy Carnell, said of the signing, [...] "Hope is undoubtedly the best women's keeper in the game today. Her signing represents the caliber player Sounders Women's fans can expect in 2012. As the landscape of women's soccer continues to evolve, <b>we</b> <b>realize</b> the unique opportunity before us." [...] Because of national team commitments and preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Solo made three appearances for the club, tallying a total of 261 minutes. Her goals against average was 0.344, she made five saves and had one shutout. With the addition of Solo and her national team teammates, the Sounders sold out nine of their ten home matches at Starfire Stadium (capacity: 4,500). The average attendance during league matches was four times higher than the second most attended team in the league.|$|E

The next month, Marvel, in partnership with Dolby Laboratories, Visa, and Raspberry Pi, announced the [...] "Ant-Man Micro-Tech Challenge", aimed at females aged 14 through 18, to create DIY projects involving micro technology and readily accessible and found materials. Winners teamed with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) programs in their areas to lead teams in recreating their projects. In June, Marvel released posters featuring Ant-Man juxtaposed with Iron Man's armor, Captain America's shield, and Thor's hammer Mjolnir. Mendelson compared this to Disney's marketing campaign for Lilo & Stitch that put the protagonist into iconic scenes from other Disney cartoons. A six-minute IMAX preview of the film began screeing before showings of Jurassic World, and scenes from the film were shown at Disney California Adventure's Bug's Life Theater in 3D with in-theater effects.|$|E
