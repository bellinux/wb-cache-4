5|$|Katharine married Henry Haskell of Kansas City, {{a former}} Oberlin classmate, in 1926. Orville <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> and inconsolable, feeling {{he had been}} betrayed by Katharine. He refused to attend the wedding or even {{communicate}} with her. He finally agreed to see her, apparently at Lorin's insistence, just before she died of pneumonia on March 3, 1929.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Oxford, Hogg {{was sent}} to York to serve a legal apprenticeship. Timothy Shelley <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> when he learned of the expulsion, but John Hogg was not minded to {{discipline}} his son or to forbid him from associating with Percy Shelley. Prudentia Hogg, who was an Evangelical Christian, was shocked when she learned that her son was promoting atheism. She was further angered when she learned that her son had become a vegetarian, a decision that she attributed to Shelley's corrupting influence.|$|E
25|$|Fury is {{introduced}} in the Nightlife expansion pack and occurs when one Sim gets angry at another. During this time relationships with the Sim who <b>is</b> <b>furious</b> <b>are</b> harder to build. Also, the Sim who <b>is</b> <b>furious</b> may pick a fight or vandalize the home lot of the Sim they <b>are</b> <b>furious</b> with. Fury {{can be caused by}} another Sim burgling the Sim's house, getting fined after calling emergency services when there was no emergency, fighting, cheating on (the cheater or the Sim that was cheated with, often both), and more.|$|R

He also had two Macedonian princes {{from the region}} of Lyncestis killed, but spared a third, Alexander Lyncestes. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he <b>was</b> <b>furious.</b> Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was {{in command of the}} advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle.|$|E
5|$|Mike Rinder {{spent almost}} {{two years in the}} Hole between 2004 and 2007, leaving it {{occasionally}} to deal with public relations matters such as dealing with the BBC journalist John Sweeney's 2007 documentary Scientology and Me. Rinder says that Miscavige <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> with the way that Sweeney had been handled and ordered Rinder to go to Sussex to dig ditches on a Church property there. He defected instead, eventually settling in Denver.|$|E
5|$|Stephen <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> {{over what}} he saw as {{potentially}} precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially refused to allow Murdac into England. When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went to consult with the Pope on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the King refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates. Stephen also cut his links to the Cistercian order, and turned instead to the Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.|$|E

5|$|The {{match is}} mostly remembered for Billy Bremner and Kevin Keegan being jointly {{dismissed}} {{from the field}} by referee Bob Matthewson in the 60th minute after they had a fight. Keegan, who claimed provocation, <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> about being sent off and threw his shirt away. Bremner copied him and the two players were afterwards charged with bringing football into disrepute. The FA Disciplinary Committee imposed tough punishments but were themselves heavily criticised by people in football who doubted their competence.|$|E
5|$|When Scott finally read Zelda's book, a {{week after}} she'd sent it to Perkins, he <b>was</b> <b>furious.</b> The book was a semi-autobiographical account of the Fitzgeralds' marriage. In letters, Scott berated her and fumed that the novel had drawn upon the autobiographical {{material}} {{that he planned to}} use in Tender Is the Night, which he'd been working on for years, and which would finally see publication in 1934.|$|E
5|$|A German {{officer who}} escaped {{reported}} that the German prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme {{became aware of the}} situation, he decided that retaliation was needed. He ordered III.Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the 717th Infantry Division, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested. Böhme <b>was</b> <b>furious,</b> and, on 15October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This was done on 16October.|$|E

5|$|Adolf Hitler <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> {{that the}} British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. The raid refocused German attention on the Atlantic Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} regain the WWF Tag Team Championship, Money Inc. began a feud with Razor Ramon. DiBiase had been making fun of Ramon over his upset loss to the 1-2-3 Kid, and even offered Ramon a job as his servant. Ramon <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> with DiBiase and turned face during their feud. Soon after, Ramon distracted DiBiase in a match against the 1-2-3 Kid, causing the Million Dollar Man an {{embarrassing}} loss of his own. At SummerSlam 1993, Razor Ramon defeated Ted DiBiase in what would be DiBiase's last WWF match. Later in the event, I.R.S. defeated the 1-2-3 Kid. DiBiase went on {{a leave of absence}} for several months, and Schyster returned to singles competition, feuding with Ramon.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E

5|$|At 1:00a.m. on February 14, Floyd held {{a council}} {{of war in}} his {{headquarters}} at the Dover Hotel. There was general agreement that Fort Donelson was probably untenable. General Pillow was designated to lead a breakout attempt, evacuate the fort, and march to Nashville. Troops were moved behind the lines and the assault readied, {{but at the last}} minute a Union sharpshooter killed one of Pillow's aides. Pillow, normally quite aggressive in battle, was unnerved and announced that since their movement had been detected, the breakout had to be postponed. Floyd <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> at this change of plans, but by then it was too late in the day to proceed.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} in 1998, Kiedis and Flea {{decided it was time}} to fire their guitarist. Navarro <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> when confronted by Kiedis and Flea, but {{eventually}} accepted his termination. The Chili Peppers were fighting, and on the verge of breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought it may be necessary to break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E
5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to be}} a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E

5|$|His father, Hyman Krustofski, was a rabbi and {{strongly}} opposed young Herschel's wish {{to become a}} comedian; he wanted the boy to go to yeshiva instead. Krusty did attend the school, where he said he made the other students laugh by doing funny impressions of his father. As a result, Krusty became a slapstick comedian behind his father's back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbi's convention and a rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. Rabbi Krustofski, {{who was in the}} audience, recognized him, <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> and disowned his son, and now it has been 25 years since they have seen or spoken to each other.|$|E
5|$|Hitler <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> {{over the}} failure to destroy the convoy, and ordered that all {{remaining}} German major warships be broken up for scrap. In protest, Raeder resigned; Hitler replaced him with Admiral Karl Dönitz, who persuaded Hitler to rescind the order to dismantle the Kriegsmarine's surface ships. In March, Lützow moved to Altafjord, where she experienced problems with her diesel engines. The propulsion system proved to be so problematic that repairs in Germany were necessary. She briefly returned to Norway, {{but by the end}} of September 1943, a thorough overhaul was required. The work was completed in Kiel by January 1944, after which she remained in the Baltic Sea to conduct training cruises for new naval personnel.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Seattle {{lost in the}} 2-legged 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League quarter finals by an {{aggregate}} score of 7–3 to Santos Laguna. The Sounders advanced to the finals of the Open Cup where they were defeated by Sporting Kansas City after penalty kicks. Schmid <b>was</b> <b>furious</b> over {{what he saw as}} a controversial call that handed Kansas City the victory. The team finished the regular season with a 15–8–11 record to make the playoffs where they advanced past Real Salt Lake to reach the conference championship series against the Galaxy. The team played defensive and suffered a 3–0 blowout in the first leg. They won on the return leg but lost on aggregate.|$|E
