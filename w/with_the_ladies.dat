500|$|The {{cross country}} skiing venue {{took place at}} Vesec which had two 3.75km loops in 2007. These loops were {{shortened}} to 3.3km and 2.5km, and then combined. Four additional loops of 1.2km (women's sprint), 1.3km (men's sprint), 5km, and 7.5km were also created. At the fall 2007 meeting in Zurich {{during the week of}} 24 September 2007, it was announced that Vesec had completed paving the courses for roller skiing and in-line skating, finalization of bridges, access roads, and permanent facilities; and installing snow-making equipment. The test event for cross country occurred during the weekend of 15–17 February 2008. Because of warm weather and the lack of snow, the organizing committee was forced to bring snow from the mountains surrounding Liberec. As a result, the races were held on the paved roller skiing track. Initially on 16 February they were scheduled to be pursuit events, but were changed to interval start events. The winner of the 10km women's event was Norway's Astrid Jacobsen while the winner of the 15km men's event was Jean Marc Gaillard of France.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Outlaw Star has been favorable. Eric Luce, Ivevei Upatkoon, and Michael Poirier of EX.org all gave similarly positive reviews for the Japanese manga, Japanese anime, and English anime versions of Outlaw Star respectively. Luce was complimentary of the manga's [...] "raw" [...] yet [...] "good and distinctive" [...] artwork, detailed backgrounds, and good placement of characters among one another. However, he was annoyed {{that all the}} women have [...] "disturbing tendency to {{all have the same}} silicone stiffened chests" [...] and that characters typically wear mad grins. Upatkoon found the artwork of the anime version to be good, and he particularly enjoyed the opening sequence, but took issue with the occasionally inconsistent character designs. He also appreciated the show's dichotomy between serious and humorous subject matter, shown by the titular ship in its grappler mode and how it communicates with the crew. Poirier found the main protagonist Gene to be the anime's best characterization: [...] "Gene Starwind is a sly, sharp-shooting hero whose success with his gun (and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladies)</b> is matched only by his propensity to get space-sick. Imagine that: the star of a space-faring series has to continually worry about vomiting onto his control panel. This sort of ironic comedy can be found throughout Outlaw Star, creating excellent segues between the fantastic action sequences and the delightful characters." [...] Poirier was intrigued by its other characters as well, and was impressed by the [...] "sharp but fluid" [...] animation style and the spaceship designs. Mania.com's David Owens appreciated the artistic style specifically for the characters, nearly all of which he incidentally found likeable. Jacob Churosh of THEM Anime Reviews additionally noted high animation quality throughout. Although he proclaimed the vehicle designs of Outlaw Star to be superb, Protoculture Addicts writer Martin Ouellette judged the animation and character designs to be [...] "less lucky" [...] and lacking in [...] "the special aura" [...] of Sunrise's acclaimed 1998 series Cowboy Bebop.

At the Omloop het Nieuwsblad at the end of February, Van Dijk attacked at the last climb. She was caught and finished the race in arrears due to a bike change.

Anna van der Breggen {{was the only one who}} was able to follow her. The duo extended their advantage over the cobbled sections that followed, holding off the chase group to the line, where Van Dijk lost the two-up sprint. A few days later Van Dijk rode again strong in the Le Samyn des Dames. In the final kilometers she closed a one-minute gap with the front group. After closing the gap she was the leadout for Chantal Blaak who sprinted to victory. Due to a back injury, Van Dijk could not start in Omloop van het Hageland. In the first World Cup of the season, the Ronde van Drenthe, the team was eager to win. In the final Van Dijk was the lead-out for Armitstead. However, Armitstead lost Van Dijk in the last kilometer. Van Dijk continued sprinting and rode to the third place. She was happy with her result, but found it a shame that the team did not win. During the second World Cup race, the Trofeo Alfredo Bina Van Dijk couldn't ride uphill with the fastest riders and finished eighth, with teammate Armitstead taking the win. For the Tour of Flanders, Van Dijk heard a day before the race [...] she was not as a leader of the team, although Van Dijk won this World Cup race previous year.
