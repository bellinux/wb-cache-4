500|$|Teles {{said she}} {{would be open to}} {{returning}} for a sequel; she feels the film was [...] "set [...] up very nicely for" [...] one, and claims [...] "verybody's wondering" [...] if there will be a follow-up. On the possibility of a sequel, Lundgren said: [...] "I didn't consider [...] as a franchise, but when I was over there , I started thinking, 'How <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this different? How would I stay close to the subject matter?' Organ trafficking is quite big as well, so I thought that could be interesting. We could follow up with some kind of other trade." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a TV {{interview}} {{aired on}} Lebanon's New TV station on 27 August 2006, Nasrallah {{said that he}} would not have ordered the capture of two Israeli soldiers if he had known it would lead to such a war: [...] "We do not think, even one percent, that the capture led to a war at this time and of this magnitude. I'm convinced and sure that this war was planned and that the capture of these hostages was just their excuse to start their pre-planned war, but if I had known on July 11 ... that the operation would lead to such a war, <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it? I say no, absolutely not." ...|$|E
2500|$|That same year, Robyn {{returned}} home to Sweden and discovered the electronic music brother-and-sister duo The Knife while browsing through a record store. She became inspired by how the duo self-financed and released their recordings, and bought herself out of her recording contract with Jive Records. She was free from her contract, but {{did not want to}} sign with another major label because she felt that [...] "it was totally illogical. Why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> that? I felt like either I quit making music or I start my own record company". Six months after leaving Jive Records, Robyn founded her own record label, Konichiwa Records, and began recording songs for her fourth album.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know how}} I hamper you. But {{if you will}} help me. Oh! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> work, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> study. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> all <b>I</b> could to understand." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{admitted}} that I had not. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> eat, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> anything, so that afterward {{she would tell}} me about Bertha.|$|R
2500|$|In 2008, Jason Pierce {{revealed}} that {{an offer to}} reform for a performance at the Californian music festival Coachella has been refused. He said: [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> that? I mean, I {{would have liked to}} go and watch the Battle of Waterloo when it happened but that doesn't mean I'm going to go and sit in a field somewhere and watch people act it out." [...] In 2009, approaches were again made for a reunited Spacemen 3 to appear at a summer festival, at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival; however, Pierce quashed rumours, saying he [...] "wasn't interested" [...] and added, [...] "The split was so acrimonious and my view of him [...] hasn't changed. No, I've not mellowed about him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, {{another set}} of {{pictures}} showing Hudgens topless emerged on the Internet. Hudgens' representatives did not comment, though her lawyers requested {{the removal of the}} pictures from the Internet. In late 2009, Hudgens sued [...] "www.moejackson.com" [...] for posting nude [...] "self-portrait photographs" [...] of her taken on a mobile phone in a private home. Hudgens later commented on the photos' impact on her career in the October issue of Allure with, [...] "Whenever anybody asks me, <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> nudity in a film, if I say that it's something I'm not comfortable with, they're like, 'Bullshit, you've already done it.' If anything, it makes it more embarrassing, because that was a private thing. It's screwed up that someone screwed me over like that. At least some people are learning from my mistake." [...] According to Us Weekly, further pictures were released on the Internet on March15, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|... "Sheriff Arpaio {{has made}} public {{statements}} that a fact finder could interpret as endorsing racial profiling, such as stating that, even lacking 287(g) authority, his officers can detain people based upon 'their speech, {{what they look}} like, if {{they look like they}} came from another country'... Moreover, he acknowledges that MCSO provides no training {{to reduce the risk of}} racial profiling, stating 'if we do not racial profile, why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> a training program?'" [...] Judge Snow expanded the complaint into a class-action lawsuit, including all Latino drivers stopped by the Sheriff's Office since 2007, or who will be stopped in the future. He also enjoined the MCSO and all of its officers from [...] "detaining any person based only on knowledge or reasonable belief, without more, that the person is unlawfully present within the United States, because as a matter of law such knowledge does not amount to a reasonable belief that the person either violated or conspired to violate the Arizona human smuggling statute, or any other state or federal criminal law." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] he said, [...] "and {{this is no}} {{impediment}} unto that; for, were I sure to go {{to heaven}} to-morrow, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> to-day." ...|$|R
5000|$|Romita later elaborated: Stan {{showed me}} Dick Ayers' splash page for a Daredevil. He asked me, [...] "What {{would you do}} with this page?" [...] I showed him on a tracing paper what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> and then {{he asked me to}} do a drawing of Daredevil the way <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a big drawing of Daredevil ... just a big, tracing-paper drawing of Daredevil swinging. And Stan loved it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know now," [...] said Jonas, [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> {{will think}} of it. But this I know,--that we ought never to be {{overcome}} of evil, but to overcome evil with good." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{possible}} tactics {{prior to}} the race provided an ongoing discussion among racing fans, as both Nichols Canyon and Faugheen in their careers were keen {{to get in the}} lead but Ruby Walsh later explained: [...] "I viewed it that if Willie Mullins wasn't training Arctic Fire or Nichols Canyon, what <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> That's the way I rode the race". Faugheen went in front approaching the first hurdle but Nichols Canyon came alongside him and forced a strong pace right from the start and the two were closely followed by Arctic Fire. At the third-last hurdle the fight for the lead upfront was beginning to take the toll on the two outsiders who were starting to be left behind. After two more furlongs Nichols Canyon showed the first signs of getting tired following Faugheen's strong gallop and jumped the second last hurdle markedly to his right with jockey Paul Townend pushing along whilst Arctic Fire passed him. Faugheen moved on by four lengths and extended to ten at the last hurdle, at which he showed his characteristic disregard for the small obstacles making a blunder out of it, landing awkwardly but without losing his momentum and being eased off by Ruby Walsh in the last 100 yards, still finishing 15 lengths clear of the runner-up Arctic Fire with a further 13 lengths back to Nichols Canyon.|$|E

6000|$|... 'What <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> that for?' {{answered}} the hardy farmer; 'the best way's {{to let the}} blood barken upon the cut; that saves plasters, hinney.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Eaton has {{highlighted}} the therapeutic value of sport {{for anyone with}} a disability. He commented [...] "If I didn't play sport I don't know what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> get to meet people and to travel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Want him!" [...] exclaimed Lanigan; [...] "not much. But I want her. If {{there were}} only two {{together}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> yesterday. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> join them, take a part, and before long carry her off; but <b>I</b> can't <b>do</b> that with Mrs. Cristie there. I haven't the cheek to break up her studies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> as you bade me, and so <b>I</b> will. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> it sooner if I {{had known that}} you wished it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never have worn it at all if I had thought that you disliked it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} impossible! What <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> yonder, after this other life? Once {{you leave the}} old land, you can never quite get back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tara {{shook her}} head. [...] "Wait," [...] she admonished. [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> without you, {{and if you}} were {{captured}} how could you collect your reward?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> if Mr. Simon Girty {{tried to}} make a squaw of me?" [...] exclaimed Betty, her eyes {{flashing}} fire. [...] "Why, I'd kill him!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... --Look here, Cranly, he said. You {{have asked}} me what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> and what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> {{will tell you what}} <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> and what <b>I</b> will not <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use--silence, exile, and cunning.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> What could I do?' Then {{there was}} a pause. 'Perhaps I should want you to--marry me, which would be worse than Dick Shand's drinking. Eh?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} spoken to her. Nor <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> so till I had first {{addressed}} myself {{to you or}} to her mother. May I speak to Mrs. Mountjoy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Lassiter. I'll {{never leave}} Utah. What <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{in the world}} with my broken {{fortunes}} and my broken heart? Ill never leave these purple slopes I love so well." ...|$|E
60|$|Were the {{collection}} of poems, published with these biographical sketches, important enough, (which I am not vain enough to believe,) to deserve such a distinction; even as <b>I</b> have <b>done,</b> so <b>would</b> <b>I</b> be <b>done</b> unto.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not talk}} of it, Lady Croston. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{a great deal}} more than that for you; in fact," [...] here he dropped his voice a little, [...] "there are few things that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> for you, Madeline." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Most willingly <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this, Lady, but I may not, it {{is against}} my oath. Also, what can it matter? You shall remain alone for {{so long as it}} shall please you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Reply. O no; neither <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{it for a}} {{thousand}} worlds. O, methinks they make me sometimes tremble to think of them. But how and if I should delight in them before I am aware? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> without Mrs. Joyce?" [...] {{he asked}} himself. [...] "She is a {{wonderful}} woman." [...] Strange that in a single hour he should come to lean upon her as upon an elder sister.|$|E

6000|$|... "Quite right, monsieur. You {{understand}} that, if I {{had thought}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> my husband any good by revealing these facts, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> so. But {{it did not}} seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or innocence." ...|$|R
6000|$|Edie {{took him}} round to his brother's house, and there, over the deaf and blind face that lay cold upon the pillows, he cried the cry {{that he would}} not cry over his living, imploring brother. [...] "Oh, Harold, Harold," [...] he groaned in his broken agony, [...] "I forgive you, I forgive you. I too sinned as you did. What you <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> It was bound up in both our natures. In your place <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> as you did.
