40|$|Abstract — Automatic {{vehicle speed}} control is {{presently}} {{one of the}} most popular research topics throughout the automotive industry and particularly in the Intelligent Transportation Systems field (ITS). Cruise Control (CC) system employs the concept of running at set speed under no obstacle / vehicle in front (velocity Control). CC for the metropolitan areas can significantly enhance the benefits in terms of comfort, safety, traffic flow, noise and emissions with some improved technology. CC fails to work when a vehicle / obstacle is detected in the front of the host vehicle. To overcome this drawback, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system was developed. ACC can also wok in velocity <b>control</b> mode along <b>with</b> <b>distance</b> <b>control</b> mode. In <b>distance</b> <b>control</b> mode ACC can automatically adjust the velocity of the vehicle in order to maintain a proper distance between leading vehicle and the host vehicle. This paper discuss about the various evolutions that has been evolved in the field of cruise control, its recent developments and research trend in the automation of the vehicles in longitudinal/lateral control. The control algorithms like fuzzy logic, sliding mode, genetic algorithm, sensor fusion techniques etc., are used to implement the various level of evolution of cruise control. The techniques with their merits and short comings have been reviewed, keeping safety first and then fuel economy and comfort. The paper concludes with suggestions for future improvement...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} on the control of nonlinear-nonstationary {{vibration}} of a frame-stringer structure resulting from high levels of excitaation from a nearby supersonic jet exhaust. The structure exhibits periodic, chaotic, or random behaviors when forced by high-intensity sound from a supersonic jet exhaust with shock loading superimposed on the broadband response. The time history of the pressure, showing the rotation and flapping of the shock structure in the jet column due to large-scale instabilities, indicates that the response is not only nonlinear but also nonstationary. The acoustic pressure radiated by the structure also contains shocks {{and the formation of}} harmonics <b>with</b> <b>distance.</b> <b>Control</b> of the structural response is achieved by actively forcing the structure with an actuator at the shock oscillation frequency whose amplitude is locked into a self-control cycle. Results show that the peak power level is reduced by a factor of 63, or 18 dB. As a result, new broadband components emerge with at least four harmonics. At accelerating and decelerating supersonic speeds, the exhaust from the jet induces higher transient loading on the nearby flexible structure due to the occurence of multiple shocks from the jet...|$|R

40|$|A {{major theme}} in {{scanning}} electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is a methodology for nanoscale imaging <b>with</b> <b>distance</b> <b>control</b> and positional feedback of the tip. We report {{the expansion of}} intermittent contact (IC) -SECM to the nanoscale, using disk-type Pt nanoelectrodes prepared using the laser-puller sealing method. The Pt was exposed using a focused ion beam milling procedure to cut {{the end of the}} electrode to a well-defined glass sheath radius, which could also be used to reshape the tips {{to reduce the size of}} the glass sheath. This produced nanoelectrodes that were slightly recessed, which was optimal for IC-SECM on the nanoscale, as it served to protect the active part of the tip. A combination of finite element method simulations, steady-state voltammetry and scanning electron microscopy for the measurement of critical dimensions, was used to estimate Pt recession depth. With this knowledge, the tip-substrate alignment could be further estimated by tip approach curve measurements. IC-SECM has been implemented by using a piezo-bender actuator for the detection of damping of the oscillation amplitude of the tip, when IC occurs, which was used as a tip-position feedback mechanism. The piezo-bender actuator improves significantly on the performance of our previous setup for IC-SECM, as the force acting on the sample due to the tip is greatly reduced, allowing studies with more delicate tips. The capability of IC-SECM is illustrated with studies of a model electrode (metal/glass) substrate...|$|R

40|$|Field {{emission}} {{provides an}} alternative sensing solution in scaled electromechanical systems and devices, when typical displacement detection techniques fail in submicron and nanodimenions. Apart from its independency from device dimension, {{it has also}} a high response, integration and high compatibility benefits. In this work, we propose using two modes of detection (fixed current and fixed bias) on two sensing methods: static sensing and dynamic resonance sensing. We measured the characteristic of the two modes and proved that field emission is a viable cantilever displacement detection technique. Customized tip on a fixed substrate has been fabricated and loaded to a UHV atomic force microscopy scanning tunneling microscopy system providing us a field emission environment <b>with</b> precise <b>distance</b> <b>controls</b> without the effects of cantilever bending. Thus, {{we are able to}} measure and determine the relationship of emission electric field to the electrode distance, as well as the relationship of the emission current to the electrode distance. The sensitivity obtained in our work for the static mode is 0. 5 V/nm. In dynamic mode, we successfully measured a resonance of a piezoactuated cantilever at 162. 2 kHz. Characterizing these relations enabled us to propose the possibility of using field emission as a cantilever displacement sensing technique...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop data mining models able to {{identify}} andclassify usage and driving parameters that affect fuel consumption of heavyvehicles. Heavy vehicles open up for a new range of systems aimed atimproving the efficiency and intelligence of road transports. The mostimportant feature of all these systems and services is the fuel efficiency of these vehicles. For developing energy optimized autonomous vehicles and for helping drivers in eco-driving training, {{there is a need}} to understand the usage parameters of these vehicles. One part of this is to understand the factors that affect fuel consumption. In this thesis, comparison of usage and driving patternparameters has been done to analyze fuel consumption of heavy vehicles. Theimportance of the parameters has been evaluated depending on its contributionin predicting fuel consumption of heavy vehicles. This particular idea is of huge interest for the company and it will be used in building optimal control strategies for fuel efficiency. Data mining techniques random forest and gradient boosting were used for theanalyses because of their good predictive power and simplicity. Drivingparameters like speed, <b>distance</b> <b>with</b> cruise <b>control,</b> <b>distance</b> <b>with</b> trailer, maximum speed and coasting were found to be important factors that affect fuel consumption of heavy vehicles. Evaluation of performance of each ofthese models based on Nash- Sutcliffe measure demonstrated that randomforest (with an accuracy of 0. 808) could do a better prediction of the fuel consumption using the input variables compared to gradient boosting method(accuracy= 0. 698). The results proved that it is wise to rely on predictiveefficiency of random forest model for future analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{drivers of}} {{regional}} parasite distributions are poorly understood, especially {{in comparison with}} those of free-living species. For vector-transmitted parasites, in particular, distributions might be influenced by host-switching and by parasite dispersal with primary hosts and vectors. We surveyed haemosporidian blood parasites (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) of small land birds in eastern North America to characterize a regional parasite community. Distributions of parasite populations generally reflected distributions of their hosts across the region. However, when the interdependence between hosts and parasites was controlled statistically, local host assemblages were related to regional climatic gradients, but parasite assemblages were not. Moreover, because parasite assemblage similarity does not decrease <b>with</b> <b>distance</b> when <b>controlling</b> for host assemblages and climate, parasites evidently disperse readily within the distributions of their hosts. The degree of specialization on hosts varied in some parasite lineages over short periods and small geographic distances independently {{of the diversity of}} available hosts and potentially competing parasite lineages. Nonrandom spatial turnover was apparent in parasite lineages infecting one host species that was well-sampled within a single year across its range, plausibly reflecting localized adaptations of hosts and parasites. Overall, populations of avian hosts generally determine the geographic distributions of haemosporidian parasites. However, parasites are not dispersal-limited within their host distributions, and they may switch hosts readily...|$|R
