5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, should <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> sequel to the first one or do <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} in the Cairns community newspaper, Cairns Bulletin, O'Brien described their musical forte: [...] "Rock's such a broad term... <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of harder stuff but we also do softer variations" [...] and that his fellow members know [...] "which buttons to press to make things kick in and when to give space when one needs it." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>We</b> had to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> Shakespeare, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> Macbeth. <b>We</b> had to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> pre 20th-century text, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> play, She Stoops to Conquer. <b>We</b> had to <b>do</b> {{poetry and}} <b>we</b> <b>did</b> Yevgeny Yevtushenko. But no novels.|$|R

5000|$|They had around 30 bands {{from all}} over the Midwest, {{including}} Minneapolis and Chicago. We won because <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> very different set from everybody else. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> some steps like The Raiders and wore gold sparkle shirts!" ...|$|R
500|$|Sadie's Story {{was created}} by Fourth Wall Studios in {{partnership}} with Staten and artist Ashley Wood. Fourth Wall Studios was formed by former members of 42 Entertainment, who produced the highly successful I Love Bees alternate reality game to promote Halo 2. Recalled Staten, [...] "we realized that in Halo <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> {{pretty good job of}} describing the clash of these military industrial complexes, but it really is the soldiers' story," [...] and Halo 3: ODST offered a chance {{to take a look at}} the unexplored civilian story.|$|E
500|$|Fieldy {{has said}} of the album [...] "Right now, I will tell you this... we've done {{something}} we've never done before. Normally if <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put {{the best of what}} we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's {{going to be a little}} extra special this time." [...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E
500|$|To {{reflect the}} episode's setting in 1985, the typical title credit {{sequence}} was redone using different music, the Asimov font for early computer type for the show's logo, and terms that were [...] "fringe science" [...] at the time, such as [...] "virtual reality," [...] "genetic engineering," [...] and [...] "personal computing". Pinkner later recalled, [...] "One of our writers said off-handedly that if we’re doing a show from 1985, shouldn’t <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> credit sequence from 1985, and literally, we pounced on it". He and Wyman asked J. J. Abrams, {{who wrote the}} original credit sequence melody, to write a 1980s version; Abrams was [...] "very, very happy to do that," [...] according to Wyman.|$|E

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> cross {{sectional}} study in medical students of Faculty of Medicine in Khartoum, Sudan. The Faculty of Medicine has around 1800 medical students who graduate after completing 6  years’ curriculum. We included {{students who are}} older than eighteen years. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> clustered random sampling in students from the second to sixth year and collected 500 questionnaires of which 487 were suitable for analysis. We excluded the first year student because great proportion of them were under eighteen at time of data collection which may interfere with randomization and cause a selection bias.|$|R
500|$|Hanneman later {{admitted}} {{that while the}} band was listening to Metallica and Megadeth at the time, they were finding the repetition of guitar riffs tiring. He said, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> verse two or three times, we're already bored with it. So we weren't {{trying to make the}} songs shorter—that's just what we were into," [...] which resulted in the album's short duration of 29 minutes. King had stated that while hour-long records seem to be the trend, [...] "ou could lose this part; you could cut this song completely, and make a much more intense record, which is what we're all about." [...] When the record was completed, the band met with Rubin, who asked: [...] "Do you realize how short this is?" [...] Slayer members looked at each other, and replied: [...] "So what?" [...] The entire album was on one side of a cassette; King stated it was [...] "neat," [...] as [...] "You could listen to it, flip it over, and play it again." [...] The music is abrasive and faster than previous releases, helping to narrow the gap between thrash metal and its predecessor hardcore punk, and is played at an average of 220 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the {{interlude}} [...] "Miami" [...] and [...] "Chasing Summers", which are homages to the summers in the city. The collaborative effort We Own the Night follows {{as the third}} track; the song features vocals from English recording artist Luciana Caporaso, which coincides over electronic basslines. After transitioning from [...] "What Can <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> (<b>A</b> Deeper Love)" [...] and [...] "If a Lie Was Love", the respective seventh and eighth tracks—the remixes of [...] "Paradise" [...] and [...] "Somebody That I Used to Know"—follows suit; the latter contains an upbeat melody with pounding synthesizers. It continues with [...] "Walls", the album's ninth song, which contains an upbeat melody and a house-inspired breakdown. Hardwell's remix of [...] "Young Blood" [...] constitutes the tenth tune of Club Life: Volume Two Miami, which albeit retains the original song's banger themes, provides a [...] "euphoric sound with progressively sweet vocals building next to synths before releasing a thumping beat". The thirteenth track, [...] "Arena", commences after [...] "Life", [...] "Long Time", and the [...] "electric summer sound" [...] of Axwell's [...] "In My Mind". [...] "Can't Stop Me", a collaborative work between Tiësto and fellow Dutch producer Afrojack, is drenched with thumping percussion and grandiose vocals. [...] "Maximal Crazy" [...] serves as the album's concluding number.|$|E
500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E
30|$|Aim: <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> {{retrospective}} {{survey of the}} results of F- 18 -PET-CTs and CTs performed at our hospital between 07 / 2008 and 08 / 2014 for suspected tuberculosis.|$|R
5000|$|We {{lived in}} Rome; God, it was beautiful. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lot of films very quickly, with backing from Italian and Yugoslavian finance sources. It {{was one of}} the happiest times of my life.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> {{field study}} {{based on this}} {{preliminary}} design in an artificial intelligence (AI) course, and identified the required modifications in the strategy, {{which led to the}} revised design of the second DDR cycle.|$|R
500|$|Before each segment, {{there are}} {{trailers}} advertising fake films, {{as well as}} vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for Grindhouse. [...] "I didn't even know about it until I {{read it in the}} trades. It said something like 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'" [...] Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, [...] "We had so many ideas for trailers. I made Machete. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright, and they said, 'Can <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said, 'I have a trailer: Werewolf Women of the SS.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'" [...] Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down. Some Canadian screening releases included the South by Southwest-winning trailer Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E
500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a lot of confidence in our water sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> huge crane over." [...] They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music of}} Culture Club is {{described}} by George as, [...] "The aim is to be creatively fluid to make everything <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> little different. We {{want to be a}} bridge between white rock and black soul", adding that, [...] "I want Culture Club to represent all peoples and minorities".|$|E

6000|$|... "Seems to me it's time <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> little think ourselves," [...] added Ricardo, {{with more}} assurance. Long {{as they had}} been {{together}} the moods of his governor were still a source of anxiety to his simple soul.|$|R
2500|$|Unconscious agency {{processing}} {{can even}} alter, in the moment, how we perceive {{the timing of}} sensations or actions. Kühn and Brass apply retrospective construction to explain the two peaks in [...] "successful decide" [...] RT's. They suggest that the late decide trials were actually deliberated, but that the impulsive early decide trials {{that should have been}} labelled [...] "failed to decide" [...] were mistaken during unconscious agency processing. They say that people [...] "persist in believing that they have access to their own cognitive processes" [...] when in fact <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> great deal of automatic unconscious processing before conscious perception occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Touring {{with the}} popular McDowell bought Petra {{credibility}} with youth leaders and church pastors, who were impressed by the speaker's forceful defense of Christian rock music. Seeking to build on that growing influence, Hartman and Schlitt turned to youth ministers directly {{at a conference in}} California, asking them how Petra could better aid their ministries. The response: Produce some music that could be better replicated in a church setting. [...] "So we thought, ‘What if <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> CD with worship songs that we think are cool, but do it Petra style and then provide an accompaniment track for the youth groups?'" [...] Schlitt said.|$|E
2500|$|Sunbury Pop Festival was {{an annual}} Australian rock music festival {{that was the}} seventh {{of more than a}} dozen major outdoor rock festivals staged in Australia between 1970 and 1975, but it was the only one that became a {{continuing}} event, at least for four years. It was promoted by Odessa Promotions, which was formed by a group of television professionals headed by John Fowler from GTV9 in Melbourne. Festival publicist Jim McKay recalled, [...] "It was a good idea over coffee at the Channel Nine canteen... We were a bit bored, wondering what to do next... Why don't <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> pop festival, like Woodstock?" [...] From late 1971, Odessa Promotions touted the forthcoming festival as [...] "41 hours of non-stop entertainment. Sunbury, the rock happening of 1972. Three days of sun-filled togetherness".|$|E

2500|$|The Pointer Sisters are {{scheduled}} to play six Australian dates in May and June 2016 [...] with the lineup of Ruth Pointer, Issa Pointer and Sadako Johnson: recent media reports indicate that Anita Pointer's health issued have necessitated her retiring from the group. In a 25 February 2016 interview with News.com.au Ruth Pointer said of the Pointer Sisters recent live performance history: [...] "I'm almost inclined to call [...] top-up engagements not tours. We don’t do the tours {{like we used to}} do back in the day. We’ll leave that to the young folks, out on the road in buses for months at a time....We still have a good time, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of corporate dates, a lot of casinos, special events, fundraisers, that’s our audience. We’re so glad [...] still relevant and people still want to hear them being sung and we love singing them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} save money by {{eliminating}} the need for model sheets, Bakshi let animator John Sparey draw some of the first sequences of Fritz. Bakshi states that he knew that [...] "Sparey would execute them beautifully." [...] Poses from his sequences were photocopied and handed out {{to the rest of the}} crew. The film was produced almost entirely without pencil tests. According to Bakshi, [...] "We pencil tested I'd say a thousand feet , tops. [...] <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> major feature without pencil tests—that's tough. The timing falls off. I can always tell an animator to draw it better, and I know if the attitude of the characters is right, but the timing you really can't see." [...] Bakshi had to judge the timing of the animation simply by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand, until he could see the completed animation on the screen. Veteran Warner Bros. animator Ted Bonnicksen was incredibly dedicated to his work on the film, to the point where he completed his animation for the synagogue sequence while suffering from leukemia, and would take the scenes home at night to work on them.|$|E
2500|$|Speculation on {{the show}} not {{returning}} for the Summer 2008 Television Season developed as the previous series had been accelerated to {{the second half of}} the 2007-08 television season as part of replacement programming following the writers' strike. [...] However, CBS announced on March 17, 2008 following speculation that it would not be returning that the Series Ten would be a summer 2008 broadcast. Casting for Big Brother 10 began on February 25, 2008. Applications were due on April 25, 2008 and video tape submissions were due on April 4, 2008. During May 2008 interviews for the 40 semi-finalists were held with the finalists being chosen on May 21, 2008. Casting calls were held in various cities across the country including Los Angeles, California, Charleston, South Carolina, Louisville, Kentucky, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Phoenix, Arizona. Series producer Allison Grodner stated [...] "We’re going to have our wildest group yet. We’ve found some very extreme personalities with very extreme points of view." [...] Big Brother 8 winner Dick Donato later announced on [...] that Big Brother 10 would feature a wider range of HouseGuests. Grodner later confirmed that the cast of Big Brother 10 would feature no pre-existing relationships, making it the first season since Big Brother 3 to do so. Grodner later stated [...] "Big Brother 9 involved couples, singles, and soul mates who were young, single, impulsive, and ready to party. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> 180 with Big Brother 10. This summer you’re going to find a 22-year-old body builder and a 75-year-old great grandpa in the house, and everyone else in between.
