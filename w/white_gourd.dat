The gourds, which other birds do not like, protect {{a small number of}} martins from losing their homes to sparrows and starlings. Other birds seen at the park include gulls, sandpipers, cormorants, kingfishers, and swallows. Beavers frequent the area. A plaque {{at the south end of}} the park honors an Oregon white oak, [...] "one of the largest" [...] along the Greenway.|$|R
50|$|Sopona {{is known}} in the Afro-Brazilian {{tradition}} of Candomblé as Sakpata or Sakpata-Omolu in the (Jejé nation). He {{is associated with the}} colors red, black, and white, as in Africa. Insects associated with him are Sakpata-Omolu beetles, black butterflies, flies, and mosquitoes. A skirt and hood made of straw that covers the entire body is the clothing associated with Sakpata-Omolu followers and worship. In the Jejé tradition Kpo and Loko are also associated with straw clothing. The xaxará, a broom with palm or straw bristles, is used in Sakpata-Omolu rituals. Small <b>gourds,</b> <b>white</b> cowry shells, a black necklace (laguidibá) are all clothing associated with Sakpata-Omolu. He is seen to have both the power to inflict and cure skin disease and other contagious diseases. In present times this includes AIDS.|$|R

60|$|The {{interior}} of the cottage is simple. Entering the door, a single plank with pins for hinges fitted into sockets {{above and below the}} lintel--in fact, as artless a contrivance as ever seen in Spain or Corsica--you find a space, divided by dwarf walls of wattle and dab into three compartments, for the men, women, and cattle. The horses and cows, tethered at night on the left of the door, fill the cottage with the wherewithal to pass many a nuit blanche: the wives lie on the right, near a large fireplace of stones and raised clay, and the males occupy the most comfortable part, opposite to and farthest from the entrance. The thatched ceiling shines jetty with smoke, which when intolerable is allowed to escape by a diminutive window: this seldom happens, for smoke, like grease and dirt, keeping man warm, is enjoyed by savages. Equally simply is the furniture: the stem of a tree, with branches hacked into pegs, supports the shields, the assegais are planted against the wall, and divers bits of wood, projecting from the sides and the central roof-tree of the cottage, are hung with clothes and other articles that attract <b>white</b> ants. <b>Gourds</b> smoked inside, and coffee cups of coarse black Harar pottery, with deep wooden platters, and prettily carved spoons of the same material, compose the household supellex. The inmates are the Geradah and her baby, Siddik a Galla serf, the slave girls and sundry Somal: thus we hear at all times three languages [19] spoken within the walls.|$|R
50|$|The basic cooking {{methods for}} various dishes include cooking, shallow and deep frying. Onla, of the Bodos, {{is made with}} ground rice and special herbs, and {{constitutes}} a complete meal in itself. Other meats include squab, duck, chicken, goat meat, venison, and turtle although venison and turtle meat are legally prohibited. The combination of duck - <b>white</b> <b>gourd</b> and squab - papaya orbanana flower is very popular. Meat is generally stewed using limited spices {{as well as a}} choice of herbs and vegetables.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} awaited festivals {{in the state of}} Bihar, besides Pratihar Shashthi (Chatha Puja), is indeed The Durga Puja. The festival must have beven started either by the biharis on their own accord or by {{influences}} from the neighbouring state of West Bengal, but certainly, Bihar has its own version of celebrating Durga Puja.The Ritualistic version though begins much earlier, nearly 6 days before, the actual Pandal hopping period lasts for only three days, namely, Saptami, Ashtami and Navami, making the entire festival last for 9 days. Dashmi, the tenth marks the conclusion.The construction of Puja Pandals take nearly three months, and preparations begin much earlier, from the month of July or August itself. The artisans try their best to give an experience of World Tour by constructing the Puja Pandals in the image of world-famous monuments. The idol preparation is done with utmost sanctity.The establishment of the Holy Pitcher, called the Kalash Sthapana is done {{on the first day of}} the Bright half of the Ashwina Month. A clay bed is established into which seeds of Barley are sown and in the centre of this bed, a Pitcher, full of water, jewels, and leaves, topped by a Coconut and draped by red cloth is established. The Pitcher itself is believed to be the representation of the universe, while the clay bed symbolises the agricultural fields. During the course of 9 days, the barley seeds spring out, which is believed to be an indicative of good harvest and prosperity. The Major Part of the entire Worship is the performance of the recitation of the Book, 'Shri Durga Saptashati' which is roughly translated as, 'The Glory of Devi in Seven Hundred Verses'.The Clay image of Goddess Durga is Unveiled on the Day of Saptami. The Unveiling is done just as soon as a <b>White</b> <b>Gourd</b> is sacrificed in honour of Chandika. Nights are marked by Huge crowds thronging, seemingly aimlessly, in every direction of the road. While there are a thousand showcases of Puja Pandals, the most famous ones in the city of Patna are, Dak Bungalow Chowraha, Beena Cinema Hall, Patna Kali Bari, Bengali Akahara, Adrakh Ghat, Khajanchi Road, macchuatoli, dariyaganj, raja bazaar, Jag dev Path, Rukanpura and so many more.Durga Puja is celebrated with much more Pomp in districts of Munger, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur, Purnia and the rest, aligned to West Bengal border, with much Bengali influence in the way of worship and most remarkably, distinct forms of idol making.While the Puja goes own in the Puja Pandals, there are many ancient temples in the city of Patna and other places in bihar which continue to perform durga Puja in their own way.A few to mention are, Bari Patan Devi, Cchoti Patan Devi, Shitala Mandir, Darbhanga House Kali mandir, Siddheshwari Kali Mandir, Mundeshwari Mandir.Unlike West Bengal, there is No Navapatrika Sthapana in Bihar. However, Bodhan and Billva Nimantran is performed in the eastern districts.While Ashtami is a Day of Great religious service, the juncture of Ashtami and Navami is considered most sacred, and is called Mahanisha Puja, which lasts for about Five Hours, unlike the Sandhi Puja, which is carried out for only 48 minutes.Navami is marked by Chandika Navami Homam or Fire sacrifice in honor of Durga. The day also hosts Animal sacrifices, though now not much prevalent, is still performed in very old temples of Shakti. Goats, Sheeps and Buffaloes are sacrificed. The meat hence obtained is distributed among the people free for consumption. However, such practices are now being condemned and animals have been replaced by vegetables.Pandal hopping reaches at its peak on this day.On the day of Dashmi, the Goddess is asked to recede back to her celestial abode. The Kalash is dismantled and the water from the Pitcher is sprinkled everywhere and around. The sproutings of Barley are uprooted from the clay bed and is kept over the ears symbolising blessings related to prosperity and good health. The vine of the Aparajita plant is tied over the wrist for blessings related to success and victory. Rituals like Sindur Khela are not at all performed in Bihar as falling down of Sindur and playing with it is not considered auspicious in this state. Instead, the women folk put a Sindur tilaka from the tip of the nose up till the midway of the head for long life and well being of their husbands. Boys on the other hand are engaged in playing with colours.Flat wheat bread stuffed with lentils, curry of yam, fried crispy amorphophalous leaves, fish, kheer, are especially made on this day. It is believed that who so ever sees the Neelakantha Bird on the day of Dashmi would be very lucky and victorious throughout the year.Just as the sun begins to set, the Idols are carried over to the banks of river Ganga, and are immersed there in, with only memories to ponder upon but with a firm belief of the return of Universal mother the next year.|$|E
40|$|Fifty four seed {{samples of}} three {{cucurbits}} namely sweet gourd (Cucurbita moschata Duch. Ex Poir.), <b>white</b> <b>gourd</b> (Benincasa hispida Cogn.) and bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) {{were collected from}} six different districts of Bangladesh, to find out a suitable detection technique of associated seed-borne fungi in laboratory conditions. Three different detection methods namely, dry inspection, blotter test and seedling symptom test were compared in present study. Among the tested three detection techniques, more infection rates were observed for Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium in all cucurbit seeds in blotter test method, whereas higher infection caused by Fusarium and Rhizopus were recorded in test tube seedling symptom test. The higher germination percentage of cucurbit seeds was observed in blotter test and it is less expensive, quick and useful {{for the detection of}} most of the infectious fungi...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the isolation of}} a protease from common bean leaves grown in the field. On {{the basis of its}} biochemical properties it was classified as serine proteinase belonging to the subtilisin clan. Isoelectric focusing resulted in a single band at pH 4. 6, and SDS–PAGE in a single band corresponding to Mr 72 kDa. The proteinase activity is maximal at pH 9. 9 and shows high stability in the alkaline region. The relative activities of the proteinase for eight different synthetic substrates were determined. The requirement for Arg in the P 1 position appeared obligatory. kcat/Km values indicate that, for highest catalytic efficiency, a basic amino acid is also required in the P 2 position, presenting a motif typical of the cleavage site for the kexin family of subtilases. The sequence of the 17 N-terminal amino acids of this proteinase shows similarity to those of other plant subtilases, sharing the highest number of identical amino acids with proteinase C 1 from soybean seedling cotyledons and a cucumisin-like proteinase from <b>white</b> <b>gourd</b> (Benincasa hispida) ...|$|E
40|$|As {{the food}} supply chain {{globalization}} became inevitable, transparency in the way agriculture was grown and handled throughout the supply chain process resulted in an important issue of ‘traceability’ in global food trade and safety for health management. Traceability in agriculture is faced with the technological challenges including food product label and identification, activity/process characterization, information systems for data capture, analysis, storage, and {{the integration of the}} overall traceable data for the supply chain, i. e., from farm to table. While some field data can be automatically acquired and transmitted by sensor networking, most agricultural activity information was recorded by manual handwriting for the traceability information systems. System architecture, operation scenarios, and the implementation examples for the mobile farming data collection system to automatically record the agricultural activities information for famers were proposed in this research. The farming information for farming activities is coded in two-dimensional labels of quick response (QR) codes. By scanning the proper operation labels, the corresponding farming data can be captured and uploaded simultaneously to the back-end web server. A collaborative research project for the traceability of <b>white</b> <b>gourd</b> planting in Tianjin was performed. The system can be implemented for public traceability system data collection and importing, as well as playing the roles of a private traceability system. The consumers’ confidence for healthy food choices with clear food traceability can be improved...|$|E
