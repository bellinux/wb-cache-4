5|$|In 2003 and 2004, 31 {{fish species}} {{were found at}} 20 sites in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek. Eastern blacknose dace {{are the most common}} fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent of the sites. White suckers and brown trout occurred at 80 percent of the sites, longnose dace occurred at 70 percent of the sites, cutlips minnows occurred at 65 percent of the sites, and bluegills occurred at 60 percent of the sites. Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species <b>was</b> <b>wild</b> brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well. Other game fish in the creek's drainage basin include rainbow trout. smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and chain pickerel.|$|E

25|$|The {{wilderness}} – {{the barren}} region immediately {{next to the}} Dead Sea, and below sea level; it <b>was</b> <b>wild,</b> and barely inhabitable, {{to the extent that}} animals and people which were made unwelcome elsewhere, such as bears, leopards, and outlaws, made it their home. In biblical times, this region was further subdivided into three sections – the wilderness of En Gedi, the wilderness of Judah, and the wilderness of Maon.|$|E
25|$|The 78th Battleaxe Infantry Division, {{under the}} command of Major-General Vyvyan Evelegh, {{assembled}} for a drive towards Catenanuova and to capture Centuripe as part of Operation Hardgate. The country between the two villages <b>was</b> <b>wild</b> and rough with great rocky crags, similar to those among which the 78th had fought in the campaign in Tunisia, and this terrain covered the one mountain road between them. Evelegh ordered Brigadier Nelson Russell, commander of the 38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade, to take Centuripe, and the plan was for a night advance to be made with heavy artillery fire available at call. The 6th Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers were given the main tasks, and the 2nd Battalion, London Irish Rifles were ordered to make a dangerous flanking manoeuvre.|$|E

25|$|The {{border patrol}} mission started with DH-4s and Curtiss JN-4 Jennies, with both {{eventually}} replaced with updated Dayton-Wright DH-4Bs. Most {{of the first}} planes were not properly equipped for field service. Not knowing what turn events on the border might take, the Army wanted the planes ready for any eventuality. Colonel James E. Fechet, Air Service Officer at the Southern Department, found it no easy task to obtain bomb racks, machine gun mounts, cameras, and other equipment. There was a delay, for example, in installing synchronized Martin guns because parts supplied with the guns did not fit the planes on the border. The radios on some planes could send only in code and could not do that very well. Compasses were unreliable, maps sketchy and of little use. The country over which the men had to fly <b>was</b> <b>wild</b> and rough and sparsely populated, with few places for safe emergency landings.|$|E
25|$|Minna's {{relationship}} with Wagner was stormy: Wagner was jealous and possessive {{and there were}} frequent loud arguments which usually ended with Minna in tears. However, {{by the time the}} company returned to Magdeburg to open the season in October 1834 the two were lovers, and by February 1835 Wagner wrote to his brother Alfred that he and Minna were engaged, although to Wagner's fury Minna continued to be pursued by other suitors. In November 1835 Minna, dissatisfied with the Magdeburg troupe and probably with Wagner as well, left suddenly to take on a role at the Königstadt Theatre in Berlin. Wagner <b>was</b> <b>wild</b> with despair and implored her to come back and marry him. Minna eventually agreed to return, but stayed only {{to the end of the}} season in Magdeburg before heading to Königsberg to join the local theatre company, while Wagner looked for work in Berlin. Failing in this, he joined Minna in Königsberg and accepted a menial position as a junior conductor. Minna married Wagner in Tragheim Church on 26 November 1836, where they argued even in front of the minister who was to marry them.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{continued}} their winning streak {{when they returned}} home for a brief series with the Houston Astros. John Ely again pitched well in his fourth career start, allowing one run on five hits and striking out eight in seven innings as the Dodgers won 6–2. On May 18, the Dodgers placed Ethier on the 15-day disabled list, but {{continued their}} winning streak by beating the Astros 7–3 to pull to within one game of the division leading Padres. The streak was stopped at nine as the visiting Padres pounded the Dodgers 10–5 on May 19. Ortiz and Troncoso combined to allow five runs in the fourth inning. The Dodgers returned to the winning ways the following day with a 4–1 victory. Kershaw pitched 7 innings, allowing the one run, in his third straight terrific start. The Dodgers opened interleague play by welcoming the Detroit Tigers to Dodger Stadium on May 21. Billingsley turned in another solid start, allowing one run in seven innings and Dontrelle Willis <b>was</b> <b>wild</b> in the fourth inning as the Dodgers won 4–1 {{to move into a}} tie for first place in the NL West. John Ely won his third start of the season the following day, as Kemp and Blake both hit home runs and Jonathan Broxton picked up his tenth save of the season in the 6–4 victory. The Tigers avoided the sweep by beating the Dodgers 6–2 in the series finale, thanks to a two-run first inning homer by Miguel Cabrera.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on April 14 {{to begin a}} four-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Kuroda struggled with his control in the opener as the Dodgers lost 9–5. Jon Garland made his first {{start of the season}} the next day, but he <b>was</b> <b>wild</b> and the Dodgers were pounded 11–2. Clayton Kershaw had his first poor outing of the season in game 3 of the series, as the Dodgers lost 9–2 to extend their losing streak to five games. The Dodgers snapped that streak the following day as Billingsley pitched eight shut out innings, while striking out eleven. Matt Kemp hit a walk-off two run home run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth for the 2–1 win. The Dodgers then began a four-game homestand with the Atlanta Braves. Prior to the first game, the Dodgers called up their 2010 minor league player of the year, Jerry Sands, who doubled in his first at-bat and later picked up his first RBI to back solid pitching from Ted Lilly in the Dodgers 2–1 win. Brandon Beachy outpitched Kuroda in the next game, as the Braves broke open a tight game with an eight run ninth inning to pull off a 10–1 rout. Jon Garland bounced back from his rough debut to pick up the complete game victory, as Andre Ethier had three hits including a home run and Juan Uribe had four RBI in the Dodgers 6–1 victory. Matt Kemp hit a two-run walk off home run in the 12th inning as the Dodgers beat the Braves 5–3 to end the series.|$|E

The crossings had been contested before: in 1678 during the French-Dutch war, in 1703 during the War of the Spanish Succession, in 1733 during the War of the Polish Succession, and earlier in Battle of Kehl, when the French crossed into the German states on 2324 June.

500|$|Go Man Go was {{inducted}} into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1990. A further honor was the naming of a stakes race after him, the Grade I Go Man Go Handicap run in September at Los Alamitos. Walt Wiggins, a racing commentator and author, said of Go Man Go: [...] "He was a brilliant speedhorse, some say the fastest ever. He <b>was</b> <b>wild</b> and reckless, a rogue at first, and often a clown who seldom saw the uniqueness of his talents or the seriousness of his commission. He had intrinsic greatness and couldn't care less." [...] Dan Essary, who was Director of Racing for the AQHA for many years, described Go Man Go's impact on the Quarter Horse breed as [...] "He was to Quarter Horse racing what Babe Ruth was to baseball, what Ben Hogan was to Golf and what Man o'War was to Thoroughbred racing. Horses may have run faster and horses have earned more money, but the fame of Go Man Go lingers." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{separated}} {{politically and}} geographically, the fates of Kehl, a {{village on the}} eastern shore of the Rhine in Baden-Durlach, and those of the Alsatian city of Strasbourg, on the western shore, were united by the presence of bridges and a series of gates, fortifications and barrage dams that allowed passage across the river.
