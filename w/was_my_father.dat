[...] They began meeting in 1990, and founded the LGBT arts organization One In Ten, with Reel Affirmations as the organization's first program. [...] The four sought the advice and input of Frameline, then the largest LGBT gay film festival in the U.S. [...] With financial and administrative assistance from Frameline, the first Reel Affirmations film festival opened on October 11, 1991. [...] The first festival venue was the Biograph Theater in Georgetown. [...] The 10-day festival screened 62 feature films, short subjects and documentaries to 2,500 attendees.

Siddig described the role as a [...] "godsend" [...] to him, because it enabled him to [...] "portray various aspects of an Arab man who was readily credible. He {{came out of a}} new identity I was looking for, trying to take a snapshot of this guy before he disappears. He <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> He was your father. He was the father of all the generations that had a liberal upbringing and didn't make a lot of money." [...] Roshan Seth played imam Fazul Azzam; he was cast because Brenton wanted him to appear in the episode. Meanwhile, Taahir Husain played the bomber Abu Hassan. The producers felt that the child actor was [...] "a find" [...] for them; it was his first television appearance, but they believed his performance [...] "carried it off." ...|$|E

2500|$|Falco and Isabella Vitkovic welcomed a baby girl, Katharina Bianca Vitkovic, in 1986. They {{married in}} 1988, {{but it was}} a [...] "love-hate" [...] relationship, as Katharina {{describes}} it. The marriage was short-lived. Falco believed Katharina was his biological daughter until a paternity test proved otherwise when she was seven. After this revelation, Katharina's relationship with her father became strained. Though they kept in contact, she took her mother's surname and claimed she was written out of his will. She was 12 years old when Falco died. She did not reconcile with his mother, Maria Hölzel, until a few years before Hölzel's death at the age of 87 in April 2014. Katharina published a memoir in 2008 called Falco war mein Vater (Falco <b>Was</b> <b>My</b> <b>Father).</b>|$|E

And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders. And He has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.

2500|$|Michael Majerus's 1998 book [...] is an {{adaptation}} of Kettlewell's The Evolution of Melanism, which discussed criticisms of Kettlewell's original experimental methods. When the biologist Jerry Coyne reviewed this book in Nature, he stated that the most serious problem was that only two peppered moths had been found on tree trunks. He also wrote that the white moths had increased in numbers before the lichen had returned and that Kettlewell's findings of moths choosing matching backgrounds had not been replicated in later experiments. Coyne compared his reaction to [...] "the dismay attending my discovery, {{at the age of}} 6, that it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and not Santa who brought the presents on Christmas Eve". He concluded that [...] "for the time being we must discard Biston as a well-understood example of natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution. There are many studies more appropriate for use in the classroom" [...] and that further studies of the animal's habits were needed.|$|E

They reconciled and were remarried in Milan, Italy, in August 1967, according to Time. On January 18, 1969, {{while living in}} East Orange, New Jersey, {{she gave birth to}} her first son, David Elliott. In 1973, her second son Damon Elliott was born. On May 30, 1975, the couple separated and Warwick was granted a divorce in December 1975 in Los Angeles. The court denied Elliott's request for $2000 a month in support pending a community property trial, and for $5000, when he insisted he was making $500 a month in comparison to Warwick making $100,000 a month. Warwick stated in Don't Make Me Over: Dionne Warwick, a 2002 Biography Channel interview, [...] "I was the breadwinner. The male ego is a fragile thing. It's hard when the woman is the breadwinner. All my life, the only man who ever took care of me financially <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> I have always taken care of myself." ...|$|E
