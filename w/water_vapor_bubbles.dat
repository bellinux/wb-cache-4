The bubble detachment radius decreases for increasing bulk liquid velocity, in a way that merely depends on the detachment radius without convection. Nitrogen bubbles, coming from a capillary with approximately the same radius are larger than <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>bubbles.</b> A force coefficient fit is performed on force components perpendicular to the wall.

40|$|Irregularities on {{spillway}} surfaces will, in a {{high speed}} flow, cause small areas of flow separation. In these regions the pressure will be lowered and, if the velocities are high enough, the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the <b>water.</b> <b>Vapor</b> <b>bubbles</b> will form and, when they are carried away downstream into high pressure region, the bubbles collapse and possible cavitation damage may occur. Experimental investigations (Volkart and Rutschmann (1984) show that the damage can start at clear water velocities of between 12 to 15 m/s. Up to velocities of 20 m/s the surfaces may be protected by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials. When air {{is present in the}} water the resulting mixture is compressible and this damps the high pressure caused by the bubble collapses (Peterka (1953). Peterka, Russell and Sheehan (1974) performed experiments on concrete specimens and showed that air concentrations of 1 - 2 percent reduce substanÃ‚Â¬tially the cavitation erosion and above 5 - 7 per cent no erosion was observed. When there is not enough surface aeration (i. e., downstream of a gate) or if the tolerances of surface finish required to avoid cavitation are too severe (i. e., V > 30 m/s), air can be artificially introduced by aeration devices (called aerators) located on the spillway floor and sometimes on the side walls...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present the}} {{development}} of a new underwater laser cutting process in which a water-jet has been used along with the laser beam to remove the molten material through kerf. The conventional underwater laser cutting usually utilizes a high pressure gas jet along with laser beam to create a dry condition in the cutting zone and also to eject out the molten material. This causes a lot of gas bubbles and turbulence in water, and produces aerosols and waste gas. This may cause contamination in the surrounding atmosphere while cutting radioactive components like burnt nuclear fuel. The water-jet assisted underwater laser cutting process produces much less turbulence and aerosols in the atmosphere. Some amount of <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>bubbles</b> is formed at the laser-metal-water interface; however, they tend to condense as they rise up through the surrounding water. We present the design and development of a water-jet assisted underwater laser cutting head and the parametric study of the cutting of AISI 304 stainless steel sheets with a 2 kW CW fiber laser. The cutting performance is similar to that of the gas assist laser cutting; however, the process efficiency is reduced due to heat convection by water-jet and laser beam scattering by vapor. This process may be attractive for underwater cutting of nuclear reactor components. Keywords—Laser, underwater cutting, water-jet...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{description}} of diffusion {{growth of a}} gas bubble after its nucleation in supersaturated liquid solution is presented. We study the influence of Laplace pressure on the bubble growth. We consider two different solubility laws: Henry’s law, which is fulfilled for the systems where no gas molecules dissociation takes place and Sievert’s law, which is fulfilled for the systems where gas molecules completely dissociate in the solvent into two parts. We show {{that the difference between}} Henry’s and Sievert’s laws for chemical equilibrium conditions causes the dif-ference in bubble growth dynamics. Assuming that diffusion flux of dissolved gas molecules to the bubble is steady we obtain dif-ferential equations on bubble radius for both solubility laws. For the case of homogeneous nucleation of a bubble, which takes place at a significant pressure drop bubble dynamics equations for Henry’s and Sievert’s laws are solved analytically. For both solubility laws three characteristic stages of bubble growth are marked out. Intervals of bubble size change and time intervals of these stages are found. We also obtain conditions of diffusion flux steadiness corresponding to consecutive stages. The fulfill-ment of these conditions is discussed for the case of nucleation of <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>bubbles</b> in magmatic melts. For Sievert’s law the an-alytical treatment of the problem of bubble dissolution in a pure solvent is also presented. ∗Address all correspondence to this author...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In this study, {{the effect}} of {{flushing}} saline on arterial wall damage (medial ruptures and necrosis), intimal hyperplasia, and arterial remodeling was determined. During excimer laser coronary angioplasty saline is flushed {{to reduce the size}} of explosive <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>bubbles</b> formed by intraluminal delivery of excimer laser pulses in blood. METHODS: In the femoral artery of the rabbit, 600 excimer laser pulses (308 nm, 50 mJ/mm 2 per pulse, 20 Hz) were delivered coaxially over a length of 20 mm in 10 bursts of 3 seconds each. In 24 / 48 procedures, saline was flushed (0. 2 ml/s) via the guidewire channel. After 2 and 56 days, microscopic and angiographic results were compared. RESULTS: At 2 days, as compared to lasing in blood, saline flush had drastically reduced the incidence of dissections (2 / 12 vs. 11 / 12, P < 0. 002), but had increased the extent of medial and adventitial necrosis. The latter is attributed to direct irradiation of the arterial wall. After 56 days, in the saline group, in the middle-distal part of treated segments, medial necrosis without intimal hyperplasia was observed. However, at the edges of these lesions, intimal hyperplasia and arterial shrinkage reduced the lumen. CONCLUSION: Flushing saline during coaxial excimer laser pulse delivery significantly reduced the incidence of vessel wall ruptures, and prevented intimal hyperplasia formation in part of the lesion. The histologic findings at 56 days are attributed to the optical window which the saline flush provides for direct ultraviolet light irradiation of the arterial wal...|$|E

40|$|Pulsed {{mid-infrared}} lasers are {{an alternative}} to excimer lasers for transluminal angioplasty. The mid-infrared lasers, however, were reported to produce "acoustic" wall damage that might impair the immediate and long-term results. To study the immediate and long-term effects on the arterial wall, 184 craters (1 mm diameter and 1 mm depth) were produced perpendicular to the intimal lining in the thoracic aortas of pigs. Three types of craters were evaluated: Ho-YSGG laser-induced (lambda = 2. 09 microns, 2 pulses of 500 microseconds, 0. 50 joule/pulse, 50 gm force), mechanically drilled, and "acoustic" craters. "Acoustic" craters were produced by two laser pulses delivered into a saline-filled metal fiber cap, which {{was placed in a}} mechanically drilled crater. The metal cap was provided with four outlets for <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> and isolated "acoustic" from optical and thermal laser effects. The pigs survived 3, 14, and 28 days. Arterial wall damage, medial necrosis, and wall healing were assessed microscopically. At 3 days, laser and "acoustic" craters were accompanied by large tissue ruptures (2. 7 +/- 0. 9 mm and 2. 9 +/- 0. 8 mm, respectively, mean +/- standard deviation). These were attributed to large <b>vapor</b> <b>bubbles</b> expanding within the tissue. A zone of medial necrosis was observed adjacent to the laser craters (0. 43 +/- 0. 15 mm) and to the "acoustic" craters (0. 17 +/- 0. 14 mm). Neither ruptures nor necrosis was observed with the mechanical craters. At 2 and 4 weeks, the necrotic areas were repopulated with smooth muscle cells and all craters were adequately filled with smooth muscle cells, without any sign of an exaggerated proliferative response. We conclude that within the arterial wall, Ho-YSGG ablation was accompanied by the rapid expansion of a <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>bubble.</b> The formation of the relatively large <b>vapor</b> <b>bubble</b> is inherent to the use of a mid-infrared laser. The risk of creating dissections clinically, when delivering Ho-YSGG laser pulses, remains to be determined.

40|$|Objective The Lumenis® High-power Holmium Laser (120 H) has {{a unique}} {{modulated}} pulse mode, Moses™ technology. Moses technology modulates the laser pulse to separate the <b>water</b> (<b>vapor</b> <b>bubble),</b> then deliver the remaining energy through the bubble. Proprietary laser fibers were designed for the Moses technology. Our aim was to compare stone lithotripsy with and without the Moses technology. Methods We designed a questionnaire for the urologist to fill immediately after each ureteroscopy in which the Lumenis 120 H was used. We compared procedures with (n= 23) and without (n= 11) the use of Moses technology. Surgeons ranked the Moses technology in 23 procedures, in comparison to regular lithotripsy (worse, equivalent, better, much better). Laser working time and energy use were collected from the Lumenis 120 H log. Results During 4 months, five urologists used the Lumenis 120 H in 34 ureteroscopy procedures (19 kidney stones, 15 ureteral stones; 22 procedures with a flexible ureteroscope, and 12 with a semi-rigid ureteroscope). Three urologists ranked Moses technology as much better or better in 17 procedures. In 2 cases, it was ranked equivalent, and in 4 cases ranking was not done. Overall, laser lithotripsy with Moses technology utilized laser energy in less time to achieve a satisfying stone fragmentation rate of 95. 8 mm 3 /min versus 58. 1 mm 3 /min, P= 0. 19. However, this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion The new Moses laser technology demonstrated good stone fragmentation capabilities when used in everyday clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Noble-metal {{nanoparticles}} exhibit rich optical behavior, such as resonant {{light scattering}} and absorption and non-linear signal enhancement. This makes them attractive for {{a multitude of}} physical, chemical, and biophysical applications. For instance, recent biomedical experiments demonstrate the suitability of noble-metal nanoparticles for selective photothermal apoptosis by heat transport by laser irradiation. The applications of nanoparticles largely exploit that plasmons, i. e. collective oscillations of the conduction electrons, can be optically excited in these nanoparticles. In optical spectroscopy, these are seen as pronounced resonances. In {{the first part of}} this work, model calculations are employed to elucidate how radiation damping in noble-metal nanoparticles, i. e. the transformation of plasmons into photons, depends on particle size, particle shape, and on electromagnetic coupling between individual particles. Exact electrodynamic calculations are carried out for individual spheroidal particles and for pairs of spherical particles. These calculations for spheroidal particles demonstrate for the first time that radiative plasmon decay is determined by both the particle volume and the particle shape. Model calculations for pairs of large spherical particles reveal that the electromagnetic fields radiated by the particles mediate electromagnetic coupling at interparticle distances in the micrometer range. This coupling can lead to immense modulations of the plasmonic linewidth. The question whether this coupling is sufficiently strong to mediate extended, propagating, plasmon modes in nanoparticle arrays is addressed next. Detailed analysis reveals that this is not the case; instead, for the particle spacings regarded here, a non-resonant, purely diffractive coupling is observed, which is identified by steplike signatures in reflection spectra of the particle arrays. In the second part of this work, structural and optical properties of noble-metal nanoparticles are examined. It is shown that laser-irradiation of silver nanoparticles embedded in titania induces structural and optical changes in the nanoparticles. Consequently, the sample color changes to that of the illuminating light. Optical spectroscopy and x-ray diffractrometry show that the amount of metallic, crystalline, silver is reduced in the particles under irradiation. Based on these experimental findings a model of this recently discovered photochromic effect is presented. In another project, the cooling dynamics of laser-excited gold nanoparticles are investigated by solving the heat transfer equation. These theoretical results are compared to time-resolved x-ray scattering experiments. The thermal conductivity of the nanometer-sized interface between the particle and the surrounding water phase is determined by combining theory and experiment. Furthermore, the threshold temperature for the nucleation of nanoscale <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>bubbles</b> on a picosecond timescale is determined...|$|E
40|$|Most {{types of}} {{problems}} which arise {{in connection with}} the use of a hydrofoil operating in water can be solved simply by treating it as an airfoil operating in air. For this purpose, use can be made of the great wealth of theoretical information and experimental data which can be found in the literature. There are, however, regimes of operation of the hydrofoil which are not duplicated by the airfoil excepting possibly under very special conditions. These regimes are identified by one of the following: (a) cavitation (b) ventilation (c) proximity to a free surface Cavitation is characterized by the presence of <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>bubbles</b> at regions in the flow where the pressure is less than the vapor pressure corresponding to the existing water temperature. Although most commonly observed on the blades of propellers or on the vanes of axial flow pumps, cavitation can also be present on fins used to stabilize high speed underwater missiles, on hydrofoils used as lifting surfaces, or on support struts of various kinds. Allied to this problem is ventilation, a condition which is like cavitation in that it results in discontinuities in density in the fluid surrounding the hydrofoil, although the initiating mechanism is fundamentally different and the lighter medium is air or gas instead of water vapor. A third type of flow regime which may be very important is that associated with a hydrofoil which approaches or intersects a water-vapor or water-gas interface. In this case the flow must satisfy the constant pressure boundary condition on that interface. The effect of gravity may or may not be important, and the hydrofoil can be oriented in any direction. A lifting hydrofoil would most likely be parallel, or nearly parallel, to the water surface, whereas a support strut or a stabilizing fin would inter sect the water surface nearly at right angles. It is this last mentioned type of ope ration which is investigated in this report, and which, as will be seen later, also implies a study of the effects of air ventilation. Among the specific fundamental questions which arise in considering a vertical hydrofoil piercing a flat water surface and which is at an angle of attack to the flow, are the following: (a) How does the presence of the air-water interface affect the apparent aspect ratio of the hydrofoil as compared with its geometrical value? (b) What is the effect of air ventilation on the value of cross-force developed by the hydrofoil, and what observations can be made regarding the inception of this phenomenon? Since no previous hydrofoil studies had been performed in the Free Surface Water Tunnel, it was also of interest to determine the suitability of that facility and its associated equipment for doing work of this kind. On the other hand, the investigation was intended only as a preliminary one and was, therefore, undertaken with limited resources...|$|E

Experiments were performed at frequencies of 20 and 500 kHz. At 20 kHz, there appeared to be an enhancement due to sonolytic ozonation, while at 500 kHz, an apparent retardation was seen.

The diameter of the <b>vapor</b> <b>bubble</b> can be well controlled through tuning the laser power. A theory model is given to explain the underlying physics in the process. The method reported will have some interesting applications in micro-fluidics and bio-techniques...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-An {{acoustic}} field {{is used to}} increase the critical heat flux (CHF) of a flat-boiling-heat-transfer surface. The increase {{is a result of}} the acoustic effects on the <b>vapor</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Experiments are performed to explore the effects of an {{acoustic field}} on <b>vapor</b> <b>bubbles</b> in the vicinity of a rigid-heated wall. Work includes the construction of a novel heater used to produce a single <b>vapor</b> <b>bubble</b> of a prescribed size and at a prescribed location on a flat-boiling surface for better study of an individual <b>vapor</b> <b>bubble’s</b> reaction to the acoustic field. Work also includes application of the results from the single-bubble heater to a calibrated-copper heater used for quantifying the improvements in CHF. I. OVERVIEW A major challenge in the design and packaging of high-density microelectronic devices and systems (e. g., high-speed microprocessors, optoelectronics, micro- and millimeter-wav...|$|R
