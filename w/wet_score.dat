30|$|However, {{it seems}} that the NoBoots {{condition}} cannot effectively alleviate psychological burden. Sweat sensation, thermal sensation, and thermal comfort in NoBoots were not significantly different with FullPPE except for sweat sensation in the recovery period. In the present study, it was found that a relationship between sweat sensation and clothing humidity on the chest at the end of exercise was logarithmic. Over the clothing humidity of 95 %RH on the chest, subjects felt <b>wet</b> (<b>score</b> 2) or severe wet (over score 2). In NoBoots, clothing microclimate humidity on the chest had no significant superiority than those in FullPPE.|$|E

40|$|We {{designed}} a randomized, double blinded, 3 -months controlled prospective clinical study to investigate effects of oral uridine on the ocular surface in dry eye patients. Twenty-seven patients who diagnosed as dry eye with lower than 5 mm of wetting in the Schirmer strip, with corneal epithelial erosion and who completely followed-up till 3 months were enrolled. Corneal-conjunctival fluorescein staining, non-anesthetic Schirmer test, impression cytology, and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) were evaluated {{in the experimental}} and placebo groups at the baseline, 1 and 3 months after start of medication in a double blinded manner. Fluorescein stain score of the cornea was markedly decreased in oral uridine group compared to the placebo group at 3 months after medication (P= 0. 032, Mann-Whitney U test). The Schirmer <b>wetting</b> <b>score</b> for the oral uridine group was significantly increased (P= 0. 001, Wilcoxon signed rank test) at 3 months and its difference between two groups was statistically significant (P= 0. 030, Mann-Whitney U test). OSDI scores were significantly decreased at 1 and 3 months in treatment group. Oral uridine is effective in treatment of dry eyes...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{non-slip}} surfaces during {{loading and}} unloading of weaned pigs {{plays an important role}} in animal welfare and economics of the pork industry. Currently, the guidelines available only suggest the use of ramps below 20 ° to load and unload pigs. Three ramp angles (0 °, 10 ° or 20 °), five bedding materials (nothing, sand, feed, wood shavings or wheat straw hay), two moistures (dry or wet bedding; > 50 % moisture) over two seasons (> 23. 9 °C summer, < 23. 9 °C winter) were assessed for slips/falls/vocalizations (n = 6, 000 pig observations). “Score” was calculated by the sum of slips, falls, and vocalizations. With the exception of using feed as a bedding, all beddings provided some protection against elevated slips, falls, and vocalizations (P < 0. 01). Providing bedding reduced (P < 0. 05) scores regardless of whether the bedding was dry or <b>wet.</b> <b>Scores</b> increased as the slope increased (P < 0. 01). Provision of bedding, other than feed, at slopes greater than zero, decreased slips, falls and vocalizations. The total time it took to load and unload pigs wa...|$|R

But in Shanghai, Button again put on a remarkable display of driving in the <b>wet</b> and <b>scored</b> {{what was to be}} the RA107's best finish of the season with a fifth place, despite struggling for grip in the early stages. At Interlagos however, both cars retired with overheating engines due to the very hot weather in the race. This meant {{that for the first time}} in his career, Barrichello failed to score points during the season, while Button finished 15th overall with six points.|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} year Walters became captain of Worcestershire, and he advanced steadily despite his team falling off and two very <b>wet</b> summers, <b>scoring</b> over 1,500 runs in 1932 including 190 against Warwickshire. However, {{it was not}} until 1933 that Walters entered the front rank of batsmen. Whereas he had hit only one century in each of his first three seasons at Worcestershire, that year he hit a county-record nine centuries. With the Nawab of Pataudi, Maurice Nichol and Harold Gibbons Walters gave Worcestershire a quartet of batsmen who contributed twenty-five centuries between them. Although Worcestershire won only two games because of deplorable bowling, with Herbert Sutcliffe suffering a surprise decline, Walters was chosen to open the batting in all three Tests against the touring West Indians. With scores of 51 and 46 in the first two Tests he did not disappoint, and was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden for 1934. In the following series in India Walters definitely established himself as England's first choice opening bat, averaging 71 for six innings.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{moment you}} {{discover}} which foot is your right foot, you don’t have many hesitations about {{which of them}} is the left foot. And then the problem left is which of them to start walking with them (A. A. Milne). Flatfoot impairs the body’s shock absorption mechanism and creates motor difficulties in functions or activities requiring balance and stability. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find the effect of flat foot deformity on selected physical fitness components in school going child. For this task a total of 20 subjects (10 flat footer and 10 normal feets) subject were selected purposively from different school, ranged from 9 to 14 years of age. Methodology –to identify the flat foot deformities wet test was measured. Data was collected individually by performing the <b>wet</b> test. Mean <b>score,</b> standard deviation were applied for data analysis and interpretation. Conclusion – the mean score for bow legs was 3. 6 and for knock knee 4. 4 was reported. In the examined subject it was found that 20 % of the subjects were having postural deformity. I...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{urbanization}} and deforestation have {{enhanced the}} opportunities of contact {{between humans and}} monkeys {{and the impact of}} human activities on primate behavior is receiving growing attention. This study explores whether activity budgets and diet of a group of capuchin monkeys (Cebus libidinosus) inhabiting the area of the swimming pools of the National Park of Brasília is affected by the presence of visitors providing food to them. During one year, both in the dry and the <b>wet</b> seasons, we <b>scored</b> capuchins' behavior via scan sampling every ten minutes. Results showed that this group spent less time foraging for wild foods than other comparable groups living in similar habitats. Moreover, capuchins relied more on human food during the dry season, when pulpy fruits were less available, than in the wet season. Our findings confirm other studies on different monkey species that have shown that access to human food decreases the time spent foraging for wild food and the home range size. They also show that capuchins are able to modify their diet, to exploit alternative food sources, and to change their activity budget in response to the availability of new food opportunities and to seasonal food availability...|$|R
40|$|In {{the era of}} lung-protective {{mechanical}} ventilation using limited tidal volumes, higher respiratory rates are applied to maintain adequate minute volume ventilation. However, higher respiratory rates may contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury (VIII). Induced hypothermia reduces carbon dioxide production and might allow for lower respiratory rates during {{mechanical ventilation}}. We hypothesized that hypothermia protects from VIII and investigated whether reducing respiratory rates enhance lung protection in an in vivo model of VIII. During 4 h of mechanical ventilation, VIII was induced by tidal volumes of 18 mL/kg in rats, with respiratory rates set at 15 or 10 breaths/min in combination with hypothermia (32 degrees C) or normothermia (37 degrees C). Hypothermia was induced by external cooling. A physiologic model was established. VIII was characterized by increased pulmonary neutrophil influx, protein leak, <b>wet</b> weights, histopathology <b>score,</b> and cytokine levels compared with lung protective mechanical ventilation. Hypothermia decreased neutrophil influx, pulmonary levels, systemic interleukin- 6 levels, and histopathology score, and it tended to decrease the pulmonary protein leak. Reducing the respiratory rate in combination with hypothermia did not reduce {{the parameters of the}} lung injury. In conclusion, hypothermia protected from lung injury in a physiologic VIII model by reducing inflammation. Decreasing the respiratory rate mildly did not enhance protection.

50|$|The turn of {{the century}} saw the {{emergence}} of Two Mile Borris as real power house in Tipperary Hurling with Ned Hayes as captain they bounced back from losing the previous year’s county final to go on and Win the 1900 county championship and {{for the second year in}} row the All Ireland title for the county with a win over Desmonds of London in the Final. 1901 saw the turn of Ballytarsna and their captain Watty Dunne to represent the parish and they went on to win the county final against Lahorna De <b>Wets</b> on a <b>score</b> of 7.11 to 0.01. Ned Hayes and his Two Mile Borris men were back again 1903 and they captured the county title defeating Lahorna De Wets in the final and they repeated this feat again in 1905 defeating lorrah in the county decider. In 1907 the Mid Tipperary Championship began with Tom Semple’s Thurles men winning the first three titles which meant it was 1910 before Moycarkey Borris claimed their first mid senior title; when Two Mile Borris ended the blues strangle hold on the title. Moycarkey Borris also claimed three mid junior “A” titles in this era with victories for Two Mile Borris in 1909, Horse and Jockey in 1912 and for Moycarkey in 1918.|$|R
5|$|After {{playing in}} two trial matches, Headley was {{selected}} to tour England in 1933 under the continuing captaincy of Jackie Grant. The English press speculated on Headley's {{ability to cope with}} English conditions, while expecting him to perform to a high standard. In the event, Wisden believed he justified the expectations and increased his reputation. In the first match of the tour he scored 52 {{out of a total of}} 129 against Northamptonshire, in difficult batting conditions on a <b>wet</b> pitch. He <b>scored</b> fifties in each of his next three matches before scoring a century against the MCC during his first appearance at Lord's Cricket Ground. In the second innings of this match, a short ball from Bill Bowes struck Headley on the chest, and as a result of this injury he missed three games, but when he returned to the team he scored 129 against Glamorgan and 224 not out against Somerset. A quieter match followed against Middlesex, but Headley reached his second double century of the tour in the match against Derbyshire, which took him past 1,000 runs for the season. Despite Headley's contributions, the West Indians won only one of these matches and subsequently lost the first Test against England by an innings. Headley scored 13 in the West Indies first innings, and his 50 was the highest score when West Indies followed-on. Critics were impressed by Headley's second innings performance, in which he scored his runs out of 64 added while he was batting. Between the first and second Tests, in matches where conditions were difficult for batting and ideal for spin bowlers, Headley scored three fifties and achieved his side's highest score in each of four innings.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} the prognostic {{factors that influence}} overall survival (OS) in patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphomas and evaluate the clinical usefulness and the prognostic value of the International Prognostic Index (IPI). Patients and Methods: Four hundred eighty-four patients with Ann Arbor stage III-IV follicular lymphomas treated in two phase III trials from 1986 to 1995 were screened for this study. All histologic slides were reviewed by two hematopathologists. The influence of the initial parameters an survival wets defined by univariate (log-rank test) and multivariate (Cox model) analyses. Results: The poor prognostic factors for OS (age > 60 years, "B" symptom(s), {{greater than or equal}} to two extranodal sites, stage IV disease, tumor bulk > 7 cm, at least three nodal sires > 3 cm,liver involvement, serous effusion compression or orbital/epidural involvement, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate > 30 mm/h) that were significant in univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate analysis. Three factors remained significant: B symptom(s) (risk ratio = 1. 80), age greater than 60 years (risk ratio = 1. 60), and at least three nodal sites greater than 3 cm (risk ratio = 1. 71). When the IPI was applied to these patients, the <b>score</b> <b>wets</b> 1, 2, 3, and 4 - 5 in 49 %, 39 %, 11 %, and 2 %, respectively, and it was significant for progression-free survival (P =. 002) and OS (P =. 0001). Conclusion: Three prognostic factors for poor OS were identified: B symptoms, age greater than 60 years, and at least three nodal sites greater than 3 cm. The IPI was prognostic for OS, bur in this population, a very low number of patients belonged to the high-risk groups. (C) 1999 by American Society of Clinical Oncology...|$|R
60|$|One day in Piccadilly, in a pause of {{the thin}} rain, I met a solitary {{apparition}} in the diaphanous silks and the snowy plumes of hat and boa which the sylphs {{of the church}} parade wore in life through those halcyon days when the tide of fashion was highest. The apparition put on a bold front of not being strange and sad, but upon the whole it failed. It {{may have been an}} impulse from this vision that carried me as far as Hyde Park, where I saw not a soul, either of the quick or the dead, in the chilly drizzle, save a keeper cleaning up the edges of the road. In the consecrated closes, where the vanished children of smartness used to stand or sit, to go and come like bright birds, or flowers walking, the inverted chairs lay massed together or scattered, with their legs in the air, on the wet grass, and the dripping leaves smote damply together overhead. Another close, in Green Park the afternoon before, however, I saw devoted to frequenters of another sort. It had showered over-night, and the ground must still have been <b>wet</b> where a <b>score</b> of the bodies of the unemployed, or at least the unoccupied, lay as if dead in the sun. They were having their holiday, but they did not make me feel as if I were still enjoying my outing so much as some other things: for instance, the colored minstrelsy, which I had heard so often at the sea-side in August, and which reported itself one night in the Mayfair street which we seemed to have wholly to ourselves, and touched our hearts with the concord of our native airs and banjos. We were sure they were American darkies, from their voices and accents, but perhaps they were not as certainly so as the poor little mother was English who came down the place at high noon with her large baby in her arms, swaying it from side to side as she sang a plaintive ballad to the skies, and scanned the windows for some relenting to her want.|$|R
