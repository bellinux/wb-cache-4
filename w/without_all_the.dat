In fact, before the 3-in-1 kits discussed below, promos were offered as kits <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> extra custom and hot rod parts (Doty 2004b, p88). These were sometimes molded in color instead of the traditional white for the kits and easily assembled without glue.|$|E

The repertoire includes a series of performances. First comes the Totayam and Puruppatu performances, which are preliminary 'pure' (abstract) dances that emphasize skill and pure motion. Totayam is performed behind a curtain and <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> costumes, while Puruppatu is performed without the curtain and in full costumes.|$|E
25|$|The second {{incident}} of 2004 {{was on one}} of Intamin's mega coasters, Superman: Ride of Steel at Six Flags New England in Massachusetts. The ride, again with lap bar restraints, was dispatched with a cerebral palsy sufferer in the front seat, who died after being ejected from his seat. According to an investigation, the ride operators were primarily to blame for not ensuring the rider was properly secured. Intamin was also partially blamed because the ride's safety system allowed the train to be dispatched <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> restraints properly secured.|$|E
500|$|In the Coventry Telegraph in 2001, Barbara Goulden {{called the}} book's title provocative. A 2003 Daily Express review called What's So Amazing About Grace?

The song was originally recorded on the Tour Bus in Europe in 2010, {{and was later}} remixed at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, California by Trevor Muzzy. Gaga said that the song was inspired {{after a night of}} partying at the Laboratory nightclub in Berlin, Germany. The next day, she wrote [...] "Scheiße", stating that she [...] "meant [...] like 'shit, it's good.' But I also meant it the other way; because this song is really about wanting to be a strong female <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> bullshit that comes along with. Anything that gets in your way from being brave. It's not the only word I know, I just like that word. It's sexy." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Ellen {{has been}} positive. In their initial appearance, Bryan Enk of UGO {{felt that the}} new hunters of the Roadhouse had potential to be the Supernatural equivalent of Buffy the Vampire Slayerss Scooby Gang, comparing Ellen to Buffys Giles, as she is [...] "the elder who can help guide the boys from a home base and serve as an emotional link to their father, a parental figure <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> melodramatic baggage of the actual father from the first season". Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune was [...] "annoyed" [...] at {{the destruction of the}} Roadhouse in the second season finale, as she [...] "really loved Ellen". Diana Steenbergen of IGN also favored Ellen from the beginning, believing her to be [...] "a great addition to the show". She deemed Ellen [...] "tough and direct, and also female, something the boys don't have a lot of in their lives right now".|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} not without controversy, however. There {{are a number of}} episodes with scenes of one {{teenager}} being beaten by his father. When reviewing those episodes, the Ryerson University of Toronto said the show [...] "stands on its own" [...] in reflecting [...] "the kinds of issues [...] facing in their own lives ... handled with care and consideration, <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> glamour of a Hollywood soap opera." [...] A two-part storyline about date-rape proved too risqué for The N officials, who delayed its broadcasting until suitable edits could be made, and other special treatments were available in the form of panel discussions, online parental guides and separately filmed introductions. The Gazette said, [...] "You've got to hand it to the creative team behind CTV's justly celebrated teen series, Degrassi: The Next Generation. They're nothing if not a clever bunch", and Brian Orloff of the St. Petersburg Times praised the series as it [...] "stays in touch with teens' lives".|$|E

500|$|Critics who {{disliked the}} album cited what they {{viewed as a}} ridiculous concept. Salon remarked in its review that [...] "Musically [...] their 1995 album Clouds Taste Metallic offers the same {{psychotic}} results <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> technological hassle. And conceptually? The same thing, just all at once: stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid." [...] Jason Josephes from Pitchfork awarded the album a score of 0.0 out of 10; in a scathing review, Josephes criticized the album for being inaccessible, asking [...] "Do I want to buy three more CD players with which to enjoy Zaireeka or, say, eat?" [...] and derided the band's fans. Further, in October 2009, editor-in-chief of Pitchfork, Mark Richardson, wrote a book titled Zaireeka for the 33 1/3 book series, published by Continuum International Publishing, now owned by Bloomsbury Publishing. In it, Richardson chronicles {{the creation of the}} album, praises it from multiple angles, and discusses the impact the album has had on music since its release. The album was included in Pitchforks 2010 list of [...] "ten unusual CD-era gimmicks".|$|E
500|$|The term passive-aggressive {{has since}} {{gone on to}} be {{commonly}} associated with Gothel. Critics felt that Gothel could possibly pioneer [...] "a new kind of Disney villainess," [...] introducing [...] "the undermining, passive-aggressive, guilt-trip-inducing witch." [...] The Village Voice wrote that, as a villain, Gothel [...] "is Disney’s first villainess whose chief crime is being an underminer," [...] warning Rapunzel that she is simply [...] "too silly, too uneducated, too unsophisticated" [...] to survive life outside of the tower. The Los Angeles Times referred to Gothel as [...] "A guilt-tripping, overprotective, super-manipulative parent from hell." [...] One film critic observed that [...] "Gothel {{is one of the}} most understated villains Disney has used in a long time. She harkens back to the wicked step mother idea in Cinderella ... She proves it's possible to be evil <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> theatrics." [...] The author continued, [...] "Gothel is one for the ages with a bit of darkly comedic timing and the overall greed and menace a villain needs to be disdained." [...] The character has received comparisons to the Evil Queen, Snow White's stepmother, from Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).|$|E
500|$|Much of Hill's lyrics {{dealt with}} motherhood, the Fugees, reminiscence, love, heartbreak, and God. Commenting on the album's gospel content, Hill stated [...] "Gospel music is music {{inspired}} by the gospels. In a huge respect, {{a lot of this}} music turned out to be just that. During this album, I turned to the Bible and wrote songs that I drew comfort from." [...] Several of the album's songs, such as [...] "Lost Ones," [...] "Superstar," [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] and [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] were widely speculated as direct attacks at Fugee members Wyclef and Pras. [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] was originally intended for a different artist, however, Hill decided to keep it after it was completed, due to its personal content. Although {{a large portion of the}} album's love songs would turn out to be bitter from Hill's previous relationship, [...] "Nothing Even Matters," [...] a duet performed by Hill and R singer D'Angelo, showcased a brighter, more intimate perspective on the subject. The song was inspired by Hill's relationship with Rohan Marley. Speaking about [...] "Nothing Even Matters"' lyrics, Hill remarked: [...] "I wanted to make a love song, á la Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway, and give people a humanistic approach to love again <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> physicality and overt sexuality." ...|$|E

[...] He was {{appreciative of the}} support, especially from the Asian-American community, but he preferred to concentrate on his play <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> attention when he had not [...] "proven anything to anybody". Smart saw that Lin was skilled at getting to the paint, but needed to learn to pass because, he said, Lin [...] "couldn't shoot the ball at all". The coach also noticed that Lin always arrived early for practice and left late. Lin studied and rehearsed Steve Nash's and other top point guards' pick-and-roll plays. Frank Hughes of Sports Illustrated wrote that Lin spoke with the occasional [...] "seeds of self-doubt", which he said was uncommon to hear in the NBA. Hughes also found it rare when Lin compared himself to the Phoenix Suns' then-backup point guard Goran Dragić. [...] "Neither of us is a freak athlete, but we're both effective {{and know how to}} play the game," [...] Lin said. Lin and Stephen Curry, the 2009–10 runner-up Rookie of the Year, received more interview requests than any other Warrior. Team officials regularly denied requests for Lin to help him keep his focus. He was approached to be the subject of documentaries. Smart planned to take pressure off Lin since Lin had a tendency to be hard on himself and get frustrated, but the coach admitted that he once succumbed to the home crowd's wishes and put Lin into a game in the wrong situation.|$|E
500|$|Season four began {{expanding}} on {{the series}} long story arc of Lex's feelings for Lana. Though the seeds were {{planted in the}} second episode of the first season, {{it was not until}} season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer Darren Swimmer questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: [...] "You have to ask yourself, in the words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?" [...] Writer Todd Slavkin described season five as [...] "the darkening of Lex Luthor". By the time [...] "Aqua" [...] came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face. Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of [...] "Lexmas" [...] that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In [...] "Lexmas", Lex is shot and he gets a chance to live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child. It is here that Lex decided that he would always [...] "go for the prize".|$|E

Club, the channel is marketed toward audiences who [...] "enjoy a Spanish flavor <b>without</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> actual Spanish". Sí TV's target audience of young adults aged 18–34 are [...] "presumably those who have long since assimilated into American convention", and who [...] "don't necessarily have any particular fealty {{to the sort of}} programming that goes to great lengths to remind them of their heritage – unlike their first-generation parents or grandparents". Within three months of its launch, Sí TV had seven million subscribers nationwide.|$|E
