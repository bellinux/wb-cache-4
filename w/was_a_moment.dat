5|$|On October 26, 2009 AAA {{held the}} Torneo Abismo Negro {{in honor of}} Palomeque, the tournament was a 7-man gauntlet-style match and {{included}} a mix of five AAA veterans and two Abismo Negro students. The participants were Cuervo, Black Abyss, Gato Eveready, Kempo Dragon, Joe Lider, Extreme Tiger and Relámpago. Relámpago, Abismo Negro's last student to turn professional, won the match after 48 minutes. The event was not televised and did not become an annual event. During Triplemania XVII there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silence in memory of Abismo Negro, Antonio Peña and Mitsuharu Misawa (Misawa had died the night before).|$|E
5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the {{audience}}. To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago Blackhawks NHL {{franchise}} wore NIU Huskies decals {{on their}} helmets during their game on Sunday, February 17, 2008, versus the Colorado Avalanche. A {{moment of silence}} was also observed before the national anthem at the game, and the team wore the same decal during its next two games at the St. Louis Blues and at home against the Minnesota Wild. The Chicago Wolves of the AHL held an NIU night during which there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silence and NIU students were {{given the opportunity to}} participate during in game promotions. The Rockford Icehogs, also of the AHL, wore their red jerseys on the following Friday and Saturday night during the team's two home games at the Rockford MetroCentre, distributed red and black ribbons, had a 5' by 16' sign for people to sign, as well as encouraged fans to wear red to the game.|$|E

5|$|When Deep Purple's first line-up came {{together}} in 1967, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, {{in line with the}} hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.|$|E

25|$|During the 2005 Ashes series, Lee had {{numerous}} defiant innings, including {{a stand of}} 43 not out in the Second Test at Edgbaston, Australia's highest individual score in that innings. This innings nearly won the match for Australia but the other batsman Michael Kasprowicz was caught behind by Geraint Jones and England won by just two runs. After the memorable match, England bowlers Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff went over to console Lee. The image of Flintoff consoling Lee <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> which came to symbolise a hotly contested series.|$|E
25|$|The first Test was delayed, at the {{instigation}} of the SCG {{to allow}} time for Ranjitsinhji {{to recover from}} tonsillitis and because Andrew Stoddart's mother had died. In the event, Stoddart did not play, but Ranjitsinhji did, although he did drop down to seventh in the batting order. England were captained by Archie MacLaren for the first time. The Test was dominated by an innings of 175 by Ranjitsinhji. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of controversy when Australian batsman Charlie McLeod was run out by Bill Storer when he left his crease after being bowled by a no-ball, when his deafness prevented him from hearing the umpire's call. England won comfortably by 9 wickets.|$|E
25|$|Gerry Anderson {{began his}} career in photography, earning a {{traineeship}} with the British Colonial Film Unit after the war. He developed an interest in film editing {{and moved on to}} Gainsborough Pictures, where he gained further experience. In 1947 he was conscripted for national service with the Royal Air Force. He was based at RAF Manston, an airfield near Margate, and served part of his time in air traffic control. On one occasion, a Spitfire was coming in to land. It was only about 50 feet above the ground before the runway controller alerted the pilot to the fact the plane's undercarriage hadn't lowered. The pilot opened up the throttle and climbed away. As this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Anderson always remembered, he found it all too easy to write about aircraft when he devised stories for Thunderbirds. After completing his military service, he returned to Gainsborough, where he worked until the studio was closed in 1950. He then worked freelance on a series of feature films.|$|E

25|$|Ip Man 2 was {{released}} in select Asian countries and in Australia on 29 April 2010. Prior to its release, Mandarin Films publicly launched the film's official website in Beijing on 6 April 2010. The film held a premiere press conference in Beijing on 21 April 2010, only seven days after the 2010 Yushu earthquake. Guests were asked to wear dark-colored clothing in show of mourning; there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silence {{for the victims of}} the disaster. The film's cast, Donnie Yen, Sammo Hung, Huang Xiaoming, Lynn Hung, and Kent Cheng attended the premiere, and donated a total of ¥500,000 (US$73,200) to relief efforts helping in the disaster recovery. The film held private screenings in Chengdu on 21 April 2010, and in China on 27 April 2010, receiving positive reactions from audiences. Mandarin Films has sold North American distribution rights for the film to distributor Well Go USA. Ip Man 2 {{was released}} in the United States by Variance Films on 28 January 2011.|$|E
25|$|Benaud, who {{had gone}} in as nightwatchman, {{did not last long}} the next morning, but Simpson and O'Neill took the score to 154 before the former was third out for 91. So with seven wickets left, Australia only needed another 104. But wickets now fell steadily, {{including}} O'Neill for 48, Harvey and Davidson, all three dismissed by Worrell. When Burge was seventh out to Valentine for 53, Australia still needed another 8 runs to win. With four runs required, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of controversy. Grout late cut Valentine for two runs, but the off bail had fallen to the ground. The umpires consulted, but ruled that the batsman was not out. Thus Australia were 256-7 instead of 254-8. Valentine had Grout's wicket without further addition to the score: 256-8. Still without addition, an easy chance given by Martin was missed, the batsmen taking a single to bring the scores level. Australia then edged home by two wickets, the winning run being a bye. Australia had scored at only 29 runs per 100 balls. At the death, Mackay scored his 3 not out off 51 balls. Worrell bowled 31 8-ball overs in conceding only 43 runs for his 3 wickets, and Gibbs bowled 41 overs in taking 2/68. Valentine took 3/60 in 21.7 overs.|$|E

500|$|The {{final scene}} in the episode, {{featuring}} Bart and Lisa fighting in the arena, has received overwhelmingly positive remarks from reviewers. Canning wrote that it was [...] "a classic moment for the series [...] This almost felt like a moment that could have closed out the series." [...] Hughes commented that it was [...] "the best moment of the night" [...] as it [...] "would have been a typical ending" [...] {{if it had not}} added the twist preceding the credits. Melissa and Randall Baker of TV Guide magazine said that the scene <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of [...] "girl power", as Lisa knocks out Bart easily with one punch.|$|E
500|$|In a Top 100 list {{compiled}} by VH1 and Entertainment Weekly in 2000, Jackson's performance was ranked as the sixth greatest rock 'n' roll TV moment. Five years later, Entertainment Weekly named Jackson's Motown 25 performance {{as one of}} the most important pop culture moments in history. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that crossed over in a way that no live musical performance ever had. There was a messianic quality to it", Entertainment Weekly editor Steve Daly commented. The performance has been shown on television numerous times. It is also featured on the DVDs: HIStory on Film, Volume II and the bonus DVD of Thriller 25.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the sound}} of Frozen, {{director}} Jennifer Lee stated that sound played a huge part in making the film [...] "visceral" [...] and [...] "transported"; she explained, [...] "n letting it tell the story emotionally, {{the sound of}} the ice when it's at its most dangerous just makes you shudder." [...] The complete silence at the climax of the film right after Anna freezes was Lasseter's idea, one he [...] "really wanted". In that scene, even the ambient sound that would normally be there was taken out {{in order to make it}} feel unusual. Lee explained [...] "that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> where we wanted everything to feel suspended." ...|$|E

500|$|Mikan's {{death was}} widely mourned by the {{basketball}} world, and also brought media {{attention to the}} financial struggles of several early-era NBA players. Many [...] felt that the current players of the big-money generation should rally for larger pensions for the pre-1965 predecessors in upcoming labor negotiations. Shaquille O'Neal paid for Mikan's funeral. He said: [...] "Without number 99 , there is no me." [...] Before Game 5 of the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals between the Heat and the Detroit Pistons, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silence to honor Mikan. Bob Cousy remarked that Mikan figuratively carried the NBA {{in the early days}} and single-handedly made the league credible and popular. The 2005 NBA Finals between the Pistons and the San Antonio Spurs was dedicated to Mikan.|$|E
500|$|The Trojans did {{not escape}} injuries, as linebacker Clay Matthews, substituting for the {{recovering}} Brian Cushing, broke his thumb, causing Cushing {{to enter the}} game as his replacement. [...] The Trojans also suffered twoinjuries on kick returns: fullback Alfred Rowe suffered a mild concussion, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of worry when returner Vincent Joseph, after being tackled and fumbling the ball, lay on the turf for over 10minutes before being removed by stretcher with a bruised larynx and a neck sprain, but no serious injuries. Linebacker Rey Maualuga was flagged during a field goal attempt for the rarely called penalty of [...] "disconcerting", which is given for [...] "words or signals that disconcert opponents when they are preparing to put the ball in play".|$|E
500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E
