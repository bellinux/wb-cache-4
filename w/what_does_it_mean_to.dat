25|$|Through the {{humanities}} we {{reflect on the}} fundamental question: <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world where irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.|$|E

A related question is whether learning mathematics requires experience or reason alone. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> prove a mathematical theorem and how does one know whether a mathematical proof is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and logic, human capabilities such as intuition, and the material universe.|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} of the season, which begins with episode 11, takes place three months after the events of episode 10. On the {{structure}} of the season and shifting the focus between the two parts, Bell stated it was the intent to follow the format from season two, by tying [...] "a whole bunch of [...] but not all of them off by the midseason. And then we launch something exciting for the back half...the promise of more to come." [...] Whedon added that [...] "though we do break the season up, we feel that the season as a whole is one arc" [...] and so the series would explore the same themes in the second half, [...] "themes {{of what it means to}} be human and Inhuman. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> all these people when they have to live with their actions? Are they capable of the things their enemies are capable of?...What is the true nature of a person? Is everybody capable of everything if put in a terrible position? Or is there true good and a true evil?" [...] The second half of the season sees the introduction of the comics' right-wing hate group the Watchdogs, depicted as radicals wishing to [...] "eliminate the Inhumans", as well as a [...] "cure" [...] that can prevent terrigenisis in yet-to-transition Inhumans.|$|E
500|$|On the {{decision}} to downplay Raziel's quest for vengeance against Kain in this sequel, Hennig explained, [...] "he's being pretty simple-minded, he's sort of being very black-and-white in his interpretation of things, and being kind of petulant [...] he's not really as heroic as Kain is, {{and he has a}} lot of stuff to figure out, basically, about what's going on". Soul Reaver 2 was crafted to feature a more cinematic, story-focused experience than its predecessor, which the developers felt had been [...] "patchy" [...] in this regard. It entered production after Blood Omen 2, but shipped almost six months before the latter game. A separate team within Crystal Dynamics, with creative autonomy, developed Blood Omen 2, and contradictions created by its scenario hindered work on Soul Reaver 2. After researching time travel fiction, Hennig devised a subplot concerning temporal paradoxes to resolve the continuity problems between both titles, and established that Blood Omen 2s story is a product of the final paradox created when Kain saves Raziel at the end of Soul Reaver 2. Other themes were inspired by the works of Joseph Campbell, and theology surrounding Gnosticism. Concepts which formulated the crux of the story included the idea [...] "that the only way a hero can ever succeed is by following his own path", and the question, [...] "can you change history or not? And if so, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> change history - in terms of being responsible for the repercussions?" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{writing for}} Batman, Hill {{considered}} that a fundamental {{aspect of the}} character was how he interacts with his villains, allies, and the city around him. Hill said: [...] "You know, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be Batman? ...How does it affect Batman when things happen to him? What is his psychological make up? Those are the influences behind the game... you actually delve into the psyche of what makes him what he is, which is where I think {{so much of the}} interest in Batman is." [...] Batman's armor was redesigned to match that of the Batmobile to make them appear visually similar—featuring the same shapes and material textures—and appear functionally compatible with the high-speed methods in which the character enters and exits the vehicle. The design also added armor over Batman's shoulders, covering the previously exposed cape, to make it appear more feasible that it could hold Batman's weight without failing during gliding. For other returning characters, art director David Hego said that the designs were conceived to keep them interesting after players had seen them several times before in previous games, while the game's autumnal setting also necessitated a change in character clothing over the winter setting of Arkham City. The Penguin lost his long coat, and was made to look dirtier, his clothing showing signs of sweat and food stains, and his head was shaved. For Two-Face, the designers felt the character did not require changing significantly, and instead emphasized existing character traits, particularly his disfigured flesh, using references of burnt flesh as inspiration. Similarly, they wanted to retain the typical Riddler characterizations like green shirts emblazoned with question marks, but instead had the character design evolve throughout the game, modifying his own costume in response to the events of the plot.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{began to}} write again in 1847. His first work in this period was Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits which {{was made up of}} three parts. It {{included}} Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing, What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air, and The Gospel of Sufferings. These questions are asked, <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be a single individual who wants to do the good? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be a human being? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> follow Christ? He now moves from [...] "upbuilding (Edifying) discourses" [...] to [...] " [...] discourses", however, he still maintains that these are not [...] "sermons". [...] A sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks. Later, in 1849, he wrote [...] discourses and Godly discourses.Is it really hopelessness to reject the task because it is too heavy; is it really hopelessness almost to collapse under the burden because it is so heavy; is it really hopelessness to give up hope out of fear of the task? Oh no, but this is hopelessness: to will with all one's might-but there is no task. Thus, only if there is nothing to do and if the person who says it were without guilt before God-for if he is guilty, there is indeed always something to do-only if there is nothing to do and this is understood to mean that there is no task, only then is there hopelessness.

2500|$|Subjectivity is {{that which}} the individual—and no one else—has. But <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> have {{something}} like this? It cannot be understood {{in the same way}} as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society’s, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: ...|$|E

60|$|The reader {{may think}} that such a {{description}} of the world would be quite inadequate. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> assign to an event the particular co-ordinates x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], if in themselves these co-ordinates have no significance ? More careful consideration shows, however, that this anxiety is unfounded. Let us consider, for instance, a material point with any kind of motion. If this point had only a momentary existence without duration, then it would to described in space-time by a single system of values x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4]. Thus its permanent existence must be characterised by an infinitely large number of such systems of values, the co-ordinate values of which are so close together as to give continuity; corresponding to the material point, we thus have a (uni-dimensional) line in the four-dimensional continuum. In the same way, any such lines in our continuum correspond to many points in motion. The only statements having regard to these points which can claim a physical existence are in reality the statements about their encounters. In our mathematical treatment, such an encounter is expressed {{in the fact that the}} two lines which represent the motions of the points in question have a particular system of co-ordinate values, x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4], in common. After mature consideration the reader will doubtless admit that in reality such encounters constitute the only actual evidence of a time-space nature with which we meet in physical statements.|$|E
