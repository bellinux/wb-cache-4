500|$|The {{difficulties}} continued, {{partly because}} giving plants scientific names relies on [...] "type specimens". Ultimately, if botanists <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> a particular plant {{is an example}} of, say, Mammillaria mammillaris, {{they should be able}} to compare it with the type specimen to which this name is permanently attached. [...] Type specimens are normally prepared by compression and drying, after which they are stored in herbaria to act as definitive references. However, cacti are very difficult to preserve in this way; they have evolved to resist drying and their bodies do not easily compress. A further difficulty is that many cacti were given names by growers and horticulturalists rather than botanists; as a result, the provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (which governs the names of cacti, as well as other plants) were often ignored. Curt Backeberg, in particular, is said to have named or renamed 1,200 species without one of his names ever being attached to a specimen, which, according to David Hunt, ensured he [...] "left a trail of nomenclatural chaos that will probably vex cactus taxonomists for centuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{answer to}} readers who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> I am [...] "really" [...] an insider or an {{outsider}} to the Pagan community is that I am neither and both [...] that how I {{look at things}} depends very much upon context, but contains both anthropological and Pagan perspectives at the same time. The ethnographic perspective is not about being an objective observer of a culture, but rather about containing within one body multiple, simultaneous frames of reference with which to interpret experience, {{and being able to}} shift easily from one to the other.|$|E
2500|$|... "History {{shows me}} one way, {{and one way}} only, in which a high state of civilization has been produced, namely, the {{struggle}} of race with race, and {{the survival of the}} physically and mentally fitter race. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> the lower races of man can evolve a higher type, I fear the only course is to leave them to fight it out among themselves, and even then the struggle for existence between individual and individual, between tribe and tribe, may not be supported by that physical selection due to a particular climate on which probably so much of the Aryan's success depended." ...|$|E
60|$|As Johnny murmured {{something}} in his placid admiration, the ministering women at his bed's head {{asked him what he}} said. It seemed that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> all these were brothers and sisters of his? So they told him yes. It seemed then, that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> God had brought them all together there? So they told him yes again. They made out then, that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> they would all get out of pain? So they answered yes to that question likewise, and made him understand that the reply included himself.|$|R

2500|$|Suppose some given {{data points}} each belong {{to one of}} two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in. In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a -dimensional vector (a list of [...] numbers), and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> we can {{separate}} such points with a -dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum margin classifier; or equivalently, the perceptron of optimal stability.|$|E
