500|$|Epstein {{added the}} Vic Lewis Organisation to NEMS in 1966, and later brought {{impresario}} Robert Stigwood in as a manager. He once offered {{to sell the}} control of NEMS to Stigwood, without telling any of his artists about the offer. McCartney was taking a more active interest in NEMS' finances, as it became known that some artists with more ruthless managers claimed to be benefiting from more commercially advantageous terms, such as the Rolling Stones under the management of Allen Klein. After Epstein's death, Clive Epstein assumed control of NEMS as the company's second largest shareholder. Stigwood then tried to take over management of NEMS, but all four Beatles vigorously objected, with Lennon saying, [...] "We don't know you. Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> this?" ...|$|E

If we were going to monitor student use at home, we would have stated so. Think about it—why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> that? There is no purpose. We are not a police state.... There is no way that I would approve or advocate for the monitoring of students at home.I suggest you take a breath and relax.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on April 23, 2002, McCain said that [...] "no American leader should be {{expected}} to sell a false peace to our ally, consider Israel's right to self-defense less legitimate than ours, or insist that Israel negotiate a political settlement while terrorism remains the Palestinians' preferred bargaining tool." [...] During the 2006 Lebanon War, McCain said, regarding Israel's role in the conflict with Lebanon and Hezbollah, [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> if somebody came across our borders and killed our soldiers and captured our soldiers? Do you think we would be exercising total restraint?" ...|$|E

5000|$|On January 17, 2012, Citadel's {{flagship}} funds crossed {{their respective}} high water marks, earning back the losses from 2008. Griffin stated, [...] "We <b>did</b> exactly what <b>we</b> said <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{it the right}} way. The world changed dramatically in 2008, and we adapted our capabilities and resources to successfully compete in this new environment." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I care not, ma'am, so that I go with you. I <b>would</b> rather <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not live}} in a country where I cannot {{understand}} all that the people say to you, but wherever you are will be my earthly paradise." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The cow-boy's goin' under before long," [...] said my friend. [...] "Soon as the country's settled up he'll have to go. But he's mighty useful now. What <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{without the}} cow-boy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{talk about}} leaving us, dear, DEAR Captain, Jim," [...] pleaded Anne, in a choked voice, patting the old brown hand, once so strong, but now grown very feeble. [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> without you?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What I mean," [...] said Mr. Lyons, [...] "is we {{have our}} ideals. Why, now, would we welcome a man like that? Do you think now after what he did Parnell was a fit man to lead us? And why, then, <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it for Edward the Seventh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|JANET [She {{is seated}} in an easy-chair near the fire.] I {{was talking to}} a woman only yesterday--in Bethnal Green. She keeps a husband and three {{children}} by taking in washing.

5000|$|Glaspie {{herself for}} years {{remained}} {{silent on the}} subject of her actions in Iraq. But in March 2008 she gave an interview to the Lebanese newspaper Dar Al-Hayat. In the interview, she said she has no regrets. [...] "It is over," [...] Glaspie said. [...] "Nobody wants to take the blame. I am quite happy to take the blame. Perhaps I was not able to make Saddam Hussein believe that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> what <b>we</b> said <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> but in all honesty, I don't think anybody in the world could have persuaded him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Gordon. [...] "It's {{quite what}} one <b>would</b> expect. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> things differently. <b>We</b> heave our rails down and {{fill up the}} country with miners and farmers while you'd be {{worrying}} over your parliamentary bills.

6000|$|Haney {{insisted on}} smoking a cigar in the lobby. Bertha took her mother away to talk over the {{tremendous}} decision {{which was about}} to be thrust upon them.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] muttered Galleygo, as he {{descended the}} stairs; [...] "if I {{was to do}} as he says, now, what <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with the fleet? Ships wants orders to fight; and flags wants food to give orders; and food wants {{stewards}} to be put upon the table; and stewards wants no devils to help 'em do their duty. No--no--Sir Jarvy; I'll not pay that visit, till we all goes in company, as is suitable for them that has sailed so long together." ...|$|E
6000|$|April 2.--Spoke to-day the {{magnetic}} cutter {{in charge of}} the middle section of floating telegraph wires. I learn that when this species of telegraph was first put into operation by Horse, it was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea, but now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay! So wags the world. Tempora mutantur--excuse me for quoting the Etruscan. What <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> without the Atalantic telegraph? (Pundit says Atlantic was the ancient adjective.) We lay to a few minutes to ask the cutter some questions, and learned, among other glorious news, that civil war is raging in Africa, while the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in Yurope and Ayesher. Is it not truly remarkable that, before the magnificent light shed upon philosophy by Humanity, the world was accustomed to regard War and Pestilence as calamities? Do you know that prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the end that these evils (!) might not be visited upon mankind? Is it not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of interest our forefathers acted? Were they so blind as not to perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only so much positive advantage to the mass! ...|$|E
5000|$|When Muhammad {{heard that}} Abu Sufyan's caravan was {{returning}} from Syria, he consulted the Muslims {{over whether to}} attack. He did not listen to either Abu Bakr or Umar. Then Sa'd ibn Ubadah stood up and said: [...] "Allah's Messenger, you want us Ansar. If you ordered us to plunge our horses into the sea, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so. If you ordered us to goad our horses as far as Bark al-Ghimad, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so." [...] Muhammad then called upon the men to march to Badr.|$|R
5000|$|According to Charles Duelfer, {{after the}} bombing the Iraqi {{ambassador}} to the UN told him, [...] "If we had known that was all you <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have ended the inspections long ago." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My child, {{you will}} be with us yourself. <b>Would</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} which would hurt or offend you? Come now! be reasonable! We are not at a pleasure party. We are all grave men, entering gravely on an experiment which may unfold the wisdom of old times, and enlarge human knowledge indefinitely; which may put the minds of men on new tracks of thought and research. An experiment," [...] as he went on his voice deepened, [...] "which may be fraught with death to any one of us--to us all! We know from what has been, that there are, or may be, vast and unknown dangers ahead of us, of which none in the house today may ever see the end. Take it, my child, that we are not acting lightly; but with all the gravity of deeply earnest men! Besides, my dear, whatever feelings you or any of us may have on the subject, it is necessary for the success of the experiment to unswathe her. I think that under any circumstances it would be necessary to remove the wrappings before she became again a live human being instead of a spiritualised corpse with an astral body. Were her original intention carried out, and did she come to new life within her mummy wrappings, it might be to exchange a coffin for a grave! She would die the death of the buried alive! But now, when she has voluntarily abandoned for the time her astral power, {{there can be no doubt}} on the subject." ...|$|E

6000|$|Some kind {{critic who}} peruses these {{writings}} will, doubtless, have the goodness {{to point out}} that the simile of the Mediterranean heath is applied to two personages in this chapter--to Ottilia and Dorothea, and say, Psha! the fellow is but a poor unimaginative creature not to be able to find a simile apiece at least for the girls; how much better <b>would</b> <b>WE</b> have <b>done</b> the business! ...|$|R
