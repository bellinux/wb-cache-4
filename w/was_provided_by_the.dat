If a {{tropical disturbance}} reaches moderate tropical storm status west of 55°E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm. If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status between 55°E and 90°E, then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius assigns the appropriate name to the storm. A new annual list is used every year, and this list <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> country of Seychelles.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach to designing smaller waveguide filters <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters {{in the late}} 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven and Young in 1966. Since then, evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are important considerations.|$|E

5|$|Two British athletes competed, both in alpine skiing events, and no medals were won. The size of {{the team}} was a {{decrease}} from that which had entered previous Games, in the 1998 Winter Paralympics 20 British athletes had participated. One {{reason for this is}} that whilst funding for the two athletes <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British Paralympic Association, it totalled only £1,500 compared to the £4 million worth of funding available to British athletes at the 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E

Stephen Napier, who was disabled after being knocked off a motorbike by an unmarked police car in 1995, also competed in four events in the LW10 classification. His highest finish was sixth in the Super-G and he also had three seventh-place finishes. In each of his events Napier was the lowest ranked athlete to complete the course.|$|E
5|$|Continuous U.S. {{air support}} for Barrel Roll {{operations}} <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aircraft of the 602nd and 606th Special Operations Squadrons, {{elements of the}} 56th Air Commando Wing (as of 8 April 1967 the 56th Special Operations Wing), based at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. On 25 October 1967, {{they were joined by}} the 22nd Special Operations Squadron. Pre-planned airstrikes in the Barrel Roll area were rare. Until 1968, most U.S. jet fighter-bomber sorties only occurred when aircraft were returning to Thailand from Rolling Thunder missions carrying unexpended ordnance loads. They would then be directed to targets in northeastern Laos.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in finding}} the funding, {{opposition}} from the two mainline companies that the line was intended to connect, and World War I, led {{to the start of}} construction work being delayed until 1927. The line was completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Southern Railway. The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned, but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that the line did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E

5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. The aim {{was to create a}} more accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware limitations in mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, the Red Cross and World Food Council (UNDRO) set up {{shelters and}} began {{assisting}} residents {{in need of}} food and shelter.

5|$|For {{much of the}} year, the {{garrison}} would be plagued by mosquitoes and the heat and humidity common to the Washington area during the summer. Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, {{a breeding ground for}} malaria. Communication with the outside world <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule. Trips to Washington or Uniontown from the fort were uncommon, and by virtue of its location at the extreme end of the Eastern Branch defenses, Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, {{the castle}} was leased for 22 years by Anthony and Bunty Kinsman, {{at a cost}} of £1,000. The {{property}} required extensive structural repairs and renovations in order to be made habitable, which the Kinsmans undertook over the next two years. The construction work cost £8,596, and some financial support <b>was</b> <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Works in exchange for the castle being opened to the public for the next fifteen years. The new oak doors in the castle were fitted with iron hinges that had originally been used in nearby Lowther Castle.

5|$|In 2002, {{a planet}} {{was found by}} the Anglo-Australian Planet Search team to be {{orbiting}} the star in a very eccentric orbit.
