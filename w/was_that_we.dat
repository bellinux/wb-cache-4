25|$|The 1950-51 side under Freddie Brown...was full of inexperienced {{players and}} we paid the penalty. I'm sure {{if we had}} {{selected}} one or two solid players such as Jack Robertson, Dennis Brookes, Jack Ikin and Bill Edrich we would have won the Ashes - in spite of once again being caught on a glue-pot at Brisbane. Two Tests were lost by a very small margin and we won the last. In addition Denis Compton was a complete failure in the Tests, scoring only 53 runs in four matches. In spite of the critics the bowling proved adequate and Freddie Brown did a grand job {{in view of the}} shortcomings of the side. To me the annoying part <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had players in England who could have won the series for us.|$|E

But there were no violins strumming in 'Black and Blue'." ...|$|E

Two days later his manager persuaded him to reconsider and look for something he liked that he could shape the film into. He took the job, giving Finerman extensive notes on the script and laying out a detailed vision for the film.|$|E

500|$|Alavés manager José Manuel Esnal praised {{his players}} despite their loss: [...] "Dortmund {{has seen a}} great final, and it was {{possibly}} the smallest team in the competition that made it great." [...] Esnal saluted his players for their character especially for equalising twice in the match: [...] "We played with pride and class to get the score back to 4–4 {{at the end of}} normal time, the result of that, however, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were half dead going into extra-time. But we're the same team as we were two hours ago. One side always has to lose a final, just as one wins." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sale of the}} band's North American {{independent}} {{record label}} Almo Sounds to Universal Music Group in early 2000 put the B-sides album on hold; Garbage decided to simply start work on recording their third album instead. Garbage began writing and recording the album at their own Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin in April of that year. [...] "The only vision we had <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> wanted it to sound different," [...] recalled guitarist Duke Erikson about the influence that the two new tracks had cast, adding that the band wished to evolve the chemistry that the band had developed from touring the previous two years.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Grand Met {{merged with}} Guinness, a major drinks concern, {{and the new}} company was named Diageo. In 1999 Walsh {{returned}} to England, and was elected {{chief operating officer of}} Diageo in January 2000, and CEO in September 2000. He took over a company that had stagnated since its merger three years earlier, and that The Economist deemed [...] "mediocre". As head of Diageo he transformed the consumer goods company into a streamlined premium drinks business. Walsh said:"While Diageo had positions in drinks, that leadership was marginal – capital was not limitless. My view, supported by colleagues on the board, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should focus on where we can be a global leader. We couldn't aspire to that in food – that slot was taken by the Unilevers and Nestlés and Krafts of this world – but we could command that position in premium drinks." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend focused {{primarily}} on the series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case-of-the-week. “Overall {{it was a good}} mystery-of-the-week but seeing as it was the second to last episode, the only thing I cared about <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> finally got more Weevil!” Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick’s character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. “As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it. [...] But the knowledge that this might be the last time we see them puts a damper on things. Still, better to go out with good episodes than bad.” ...|$|E

500|$|Residente o Visitante was {{recorded}} in various countries, as the band was on tour during {{the making of the}} album. [...] Residente explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of Calle 13, and felt that the recording of Residente o Visitante was a smoother process than the first: [...] "The main difference for us this time around <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had more opportunities, more tools and more money. We were also on tour at the same time, unlike the first. I spent my time writing during the travels, while my brother would write the music." [...] Residente was invited by La Mala Rodriguez to come to Spain to collaborate on a song. [...] He agreed, as he greatly admired La Mala's work, and the two met for drinks where they discussed the kind of song they wanted to create before going to the studio to record what would later become [...] "Mala Suerta Con el 13".|$|E
500|$|Carter {{also sought}} to rectify small issues that fans had with the 1998 feature film, The X-Files, explaining, [...] "I think {{if there was any}} trouble with the movie, it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> promised so much that we didn't deliver all of it. I think we wanted to deliver a lot, and all at once, in these two episodes". Episode co-writer Frank Spotnitz agreed, saying that when The X-Files film was being {{promoted}} with the tagline [...] "The Truth is Revealed," [...] he realized that the answers presented in the movie would not be the answers that many of the fans were wanting to hear. Spotnitz also felt that writing [...] "One Son" [...] was difficult because the episodes that gave answers seemed to be less entertaining for viewers than episodes that presented new questions. Spotnitz, however, acknowledged that this episode was necessary to help explain the complex mythology of the show; he called the episode the [...] "biggest chapter we had time to explore in the nine years we were on the air".|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} and commercial success of The Bends gave Radiohead {{the confidence to}} self-produce their third album. Their label Parlophone gave them a £100,000 budget for recording equipment. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said [...] "the only concept that we had for this album <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> wanted to record {{it away from the}} city and that we wanted to record it ourselves." [...] According to guitarist Ed O'Brien: [...] "Everyone said, You'll sell six or seven million if you bring out The Bends Pt 2, and we're like, 'We'll kick against that and do the opposite'." [...] A number of producers, including major figures such as Scott Litt, were suggested, but the band were encouraged by their sessions with Godrich. They consulted him for advice on what equipment to use, and prepared for the sessions by buying their own equipment, including a plate reverberator purchased from Jona Lewie. Although Godrich had sought to focus his work on electronic dance music, he outgrew his role as advisor and became the album's co-producer.|$|E

500|$|On December 21, 1970, Presley {{engineered}} {{a meeting}} with President Richard Nixon at the White House, where he expressed his patriotism and his contempt for the hippies, the growing drug culture, and the counterculture in general. He asked Nixon for a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge, to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people {{and that it was}} therefore important he [...] "retain his credibility". Presley told Nixon that the Beatles, whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era, exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti-Americanism and drug abuse in popular culture. On hearing reports of the meeting, Paul McCartney later said he [...] "felt a bit betrayed" [...] and commented: [...] "The great joke <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were taking [...] drugs, and look what happened to him", a reference to Presley's death, hastened by prescription drug abuse.|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E
