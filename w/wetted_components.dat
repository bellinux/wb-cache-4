The polymers, described by the bead-spring model, spread {{on a flat surface}} with a surface-coupled Langevin thermostat to mimic the effects of a corrugated surface. Each droplet consists of chains of length 10 or 100 monomers with ~ 350, 000 monomers total. The qualitative features of the spreading dynamics are presented for differences in chain length, surface interaction strength, and composition. When the components of the droplet differ only in surface interaction strength, the more strongly <b>wetting</b> <b>component</b> forms a monolayer film on the surface even when both materials are above or below the wetting transition. In the case where the only difference is the polymer chain length, the monolayer film beneath the droplet is composed of an equal amount of short chain and long chain monomers even when one component (the shorter chain length) is above the wetting transition and the other is not. The fraction of short and long chains in the precursor foot depends on whether or not both the short and long chains are in the wetting regime.

40|$|The {{infiltration}} of rainwater {{can result from}} envelope defects that allow water to infiltrate into the stud cavity behind the exterior sheathing, i. e. the back wall. Once rainwater migrates into the stud space, it cannot easily evacuate and is thus likely to accumulate, leading to potential degradation of the wood studs and exterior sheathing, depending on the temperature conditions. Therefore, studying the drying potential of wood-frame wall assemblies that {{have been subjected to}} a moisture load like rain infiltration can provide valuable information with respect to the assembly's hygrothermal performance. The primary objectives of the research project were: (1) To evaluate the wetting and drying performance of hygroscopic components in wood-frame wall assemblies wetted by rain infiltration; (2) To investigate the impact of several parameters on the hygrothermal response of the various monitored components such as the sheathing material, the type of vapor retarder, and the presence of foam insulation on the exterior side of the assembly, (3) To develop a framework for large-scale envelope testing of wall assemblies subjected to wind-driven rain infiltration. The role of the vapor retarder, the exterior insulation, an added exterior insulation, the wall height, the presence of hygroscopic cladding was studied and the effect of varying the moisture load was also investigated. The research was primarily experimental but also included some simulation work. The moisture content results from the experiments show that the sheathing material had the most significant impact on the drying response of the wall components, with the lowest and highest drying rate occurring when OSB and fiberboard sheathings were employed, respectively. Increasing the vapor permeability of the vapor retarder within the range allowed by the National Building Code of Canada increased the drying rate of the <b>wetted</b> <b>components</b> within the walls when OSB sheathing was employed.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with geothermal energy and specifically focuses on engineered geothermal systems (EGS), which are among a portfolio of technology options for power generation from geothermal resources. In this cyclic approach (also known as hot-dry-rocks or enhanced geothermal systems), high pressure water (i. e. "geofluid") is first pumped down a borehole (known as injection well) into a bed of hot fractured rock and forced to travel through the bed, capturing the heat content of the rocks. The hot water is then extracted from a second borehole (known as production well) and sent into a binary power plant, where its thermal energy is converted to electricity. The cooled water exiting the power plant is then injected back into the ground to resume the cycle. The aim of this thesis is to advance the understanding of CO₂ based EGS power generation process and verify the merits of using CO₂ rather than water for heat extraction from fractured hot dry rocks. The work has been largely driven by the suitable thermodynamic and transport properties of supercritical CO₂ (scCO₂), {{which makes it a}} desirable candidate for harnessing geothermal energy from hot dry rocks, particularly in regions where water resources are scarce. However, {{only a limited number of}} studies were carried out in the past to assess the viability of the CO₂ based EGS concept. Most of these studies were theoretical examinations of the heat extraction and exergy analysis under a limited range of operational parameters. In addition, research work on the fluid-rock interactions relevant to CO₂ based EGS is also limited and needs further investigation. The present thesis addresses the above knowledge gaps through a combined experimental and theoretical study, resulting to an accurate description of the entire CO₂ based EGS power generation process encompassing the reservoir, wellbore and power plant cycle as well as the fluid-rock geochemical interaction. The specific objectives of the project underlying this thesis were: (1) model development and simulation of the entire CO₂ and H₂O based EGS and the associated power plant cycles, (2) optimisation studies and sensitivity analysis of operating and design parameters affecting CO₂ and H₂O based EGS performance, (3) performance comparison of CO₂ based EGS and H₂O based EGS under the same operating and reservoir conditions, (4) examination of the effect of reservoir parameters on both CO₂ and H₂O based EGS concepts through detailed 3 D reservoir simulations, (5) design and fabrication of a fluid-rock interaction apparatus capable of simulating EGS conditions, and (6) experimental investigation of the fluid-rock interactions at reservoir conditions and its likely impact on the performance characteristics of CO₂ and H₂O based EGS. One dimensional (1 D), 2 D, and 3 D models of integrated reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle were developed to provide an overall description of fluid flow in fractured reservoir (channel flow) and in radial fluid flow in homogeneous porous media. It was also created to investigate " 3 D effects" as well as transient changes during the power generation process. The thermosiphon power generation process was used in CO₂ based EGS model simulations while the Organic Rankine Cycle binary plant with isopentane as the working fluid was employed in the H₂O based EGS simulations. Mass and energy balance equations associated with the integrated 1 D and 2 D reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle model simulations were solved using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES). In the integrated 3 D reservoir-wellbore-power plant cycle modelling, the transient geofluid mass and heat flow rates in the reservoir were simulated using TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N software packages while the wellbore flow and power plant cycle calculations were carried out using EES. The use of TOUGH 2 /ECO 2 N was validated and calibrated by replicating the results of prior studies done by Pruess (2008) where TOUGH 2 /EOSM simulator was used. A fluid-rock interaction apparatus with titanium made <b>wetted</b> <b>components</b> was designed and fabricated to conduct batch and flow-through experimental studies of rock samples with CO₂ and H₂O at pressures up to 50 MPa and temperatures up to 400 °C. Surface granite from Moonbi near New England Highway, NSW and drill core samples from Mossgiel 1 and Nambucurra 1 boreholes at Murray-Darling Basin, NSW were collected and used as representatives of hot-dry-rock (HDR) EGS reservoir rock formations. The granite samples were pulverised and analysed for particle size distribution as well aselement (fused-bead XRF) and mineral (Rietveld quantitative XRD) compositions prior to any experiments. Fluid-rock interaction experiments were conducted for up to 15 days at different simulated reservoir pressures (20 and 35 MPa) and temperatures(200 and 250 °C). Fluid effluents were analysed using ICP-OES, and the reacted pulverised granite samples were subjected to further XRF, XRD, and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) analysis. The following are the key findings of the integrated 1 D/ 2 D reservoir-wellbore-power simulations: • The mass flow rate of CO₂ has an inverse relation with the injection temperature in a CO₂ based EGS while there is a direct relationship between the mass flow rate of water and injection temperature in CO₂ based EGS. These contrasting behaviours can be assigned to the fact that an increase in the injection temperature lowers the CO₂ density and hence increases its dynamic viscosity whereas in the case of water, an increase in the injection temperature lowers H₂O kinematic viscosity and thereby decreases the dynamic viscosity. • Reservoir pressure loss is generally higher for H₂O than for CO₂ because of the higher H₂O kinematic viscosity. • CO₂ overall mass flow rate is higher than that of H₂O due to lower average CO₂ kinematic viscosity at reservoir conditions. • Wellbore frictional loss of CO₂ is greater than that of H₂O due to the lower average CO₂ density along the length of the wellbore. • Heat extraction rates of H₂O based EGS is generally higher than those of CO₂ based EGS due to higher specific heat capacity of water. • The thermal siphoning is not practical for H₂O based EGS because the production pressure is usually lower than the injection pressure. • Power generation output of H₂O based EGS are higher than that of CO₂ based EGS and increases almost linearly as injection pressure increases while CO₂ based EGS power output shows a parabolic trend. These were found to be due to the dependency of CO₂ thermodynamic properties on pressure while H₂O thermodynamic properties are almost independent of pressure. • Reservoir temperature does not influence the overall CO₂ mass flow rate, but CO₂ heat extraction rate increases as reservoir temperature increases due to increase in the specific enthalpy change. • The maximum power generation of CO₂ based EGS decreases as reservoir pressure decreases due to lower CO₂ production pressure in the wellhead. • For both CO₂ and H₂O based EGS, shorter injection to production well distance gives higher fluid mass flow rate due to the increase in pressure gradient (pressure drop/distance) between the injection and production wells. • As the ratio of production to injection well increases, the CO₂ based EGS power generation output increases due to diminishing CO₂ frictional loss in individual production well as the number of production well increases. • CO₂ based EGS generally performs better in low permeability reservoirs (typically one order of magnitude decrease in reservoir permeability decreases CO₂ mass flow rates by 27 % while H₂O mass flow rates decreases by 67 %). • The overall thermal efficiency at any specified injection and reservoir conditions is constant regardless of CO₂ mass flow rate. Batch and flow-through CO₂-rock interaction experiments show that Ca, Fe, Mg, Al, and Si dissolve in scCO₂, which was found to be partly due to the presence of H₂O in the CO₂ stream leaked from the piston accumulator. Geochemical model simulations show that aqueous Si concentration is in equilibrium with the rock minerals after 1 day exposure in the batch experiment. The log of (Na/K) ratios shows the preferential dissolution of albite over k-feldspar. The SEM image analysis of the treated granites shows signs of erosion (i. e. rounded edges and pebble-like surfaces), which is considered to be due to the formation of carbonates in the surface and its subsequent erosion and dissolution (particularly Na₂CO₃ and K₂CO₃) to the fluid. The XFR analysis of the untreated and treated pulverised granites shows very small changes to SiO₂, Al₂O₃, CaO, MgO, Fe₂O₃, Na₂O, and K₂O major oxide compositions consistent with the ICP-OES analytical results. The Na-K-Mg ternary diagram of the data collected from the fluid-rock experiments shows that the aqueous fluid is far from the equilibrium. The presence and/or absence of minerals (hornblende or chlorite) in the starting material influences the log of (Na/K) ratios. Hornblende alters or converts to chlorite in the CO₂-H₂O mixture. Moreover, the concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Fe decreases with time, which is considered to be due to the formation of a passive layer of insoluble carbonate minerals in the surface, thus preventing further fluid-rock interaction. The pressure loss data collected during the flow-through fluid-rock interaction experiments validate the theory that CO₂ has lower reservoir loss than H₂O. The data also validate the correlation between particle size and intrinsic permeability, which predicts that at the same fluid mass flow rate, a medium with a larger particle size has a lower pressure loss...|$|E

The proposed alternative strategy is to estimate both the hydrostatic and the <b>wet</b> <b>components</b> of the tropospheric delay using different process noises with different mapping functions for both components in an extended Kalman filter (EKF).

40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) of {{navigation}} satellites was first developed for global navigation and position determination purposes. Signals from satellites are delayed by the Earths neutral atmosphere on propagating to ground-based receivers, termed the tropospheric delay. Although an unwanted term for precise positioning, the tropospheric delay may {{be converted to}} atmospheric water vapour, which is a vital parameter for weather forecasting. This research investigates the optimum GPS processing strategy to estimate atmospheric water vapour derived from ground-based GPS receivers particularly in the Australian region. For this purpose, GPS data observations from GPS permanent stations across Australia, mainly from the Australian Regional GPS Network, will be processed using scientific GPS software in post-processed mode and near real-time mode. This research shows that by applying high accuracy GPS data processing, the tropospheric delay could be estimated precisely.

The publications listed mostly relate to the modelling and estimation of propagation delay (both the dry/hydrostatic and <b>wet</b> <b>components)</b> in Global Positioning System, very long baseline interferometry, satellite Doppler, and satellite altimetry observations, but some relevant publications dealing with the physics and chemistry of the troposphere and propagation at visible light wavelengths are also included. We would like to make this bibliography as complete as possible — especially with regard to the most recent literature on the subject — and so welcome suggestions for additions to the list which will be incorporated into future editions. Thanks to Dr. Gunnar Elgered of Chalmers University's Onsala Space Observatory, Onsala, Sweden, for suggesting a number of items which have been included in this edition...|$|R
40|$|We report major, trace, and {{volatile}} element data on basaltic glasses from the northernmost {{segment of the}} Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC 1) in the Lau back-arc basin to further test and constrain models of back-arc volcanism. The zero-age samples come from 47 precisely collected stations from an 85 km length spreading center. The chemical data covary similarly to other back-arc systems but with tighter correlations and well-developed spatial systematics. We confirm a correlation between volatile content and apparent extent of melting of the mantle source but also show that the data cannot be reproduced by the model of isobaric addition of water that has been broadly applied to back-arc basins. The new data also confirm {{that there is no}} relationship between mantle temperature and the wet melting productivity. Two distinct magmatic provinces can be identified along the ELSC 1 axis, a southern province influenced by a “wet component” with strong affinities to arc volcanism and a northern province influenced by a “damp component” intermediate between enriched mid-ocean ridge basalts (E-MORB) and arc basalts. High–field strength elements and rare earth elements are all mobilized to some extent by the <b>wet</b> <b>component,</b> and the detailed composition of this component is determined. It differs in significant ways from the Mariana component reported by E. Stolper and S. Newman (1994), particularly by having lower abundances of most elements relative to H_(2) O. The differences can be explained if the slab temperature is higher for the Mariana and the source from which the fluid is derived is more enriched. The ELSC 1 damp component is best explained by mixing between the <b>wet</b> <b>component</b> and an E-MORB-like component. We propose that mixing between water-rich fluids and low-degree silicate melts occurs at depth in the subduction zone to generate the chemical diversity of the ELSC 1 subduction components. These modified sources then rise independently to the surface and melt, and these melts mix with melts of the background mantle from the ridge melting regime to generate the linear data arrays characteristic of back-arc basalts. The major and trace element framework for ELSC 1, combined with different slab temperatures and compositions for difference convergent margins, may be able to be applied to other back-arc basins around the globe...|$|R
40|$|The Atacama Large millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) {{makes use}} of water vapour radiometers (WVR), which monitor the {{atmospheric}} water vapour line at 183 GHz {{along the line of}} sight above each antenna to correct for phase delays introduced by the <b>wet</b> <b>component</b> of the troposphere. The application of WVR derived phase corrections improve the image quality and facilitate successful observations in weather conditions that were classically marginal or poor. We present work to indicate that a scaling factor applied to the WVR solutions can act to further improve the phase stability and image quality of ALMA data. We find reduced phase noise statistics for 62 out of 75 datasets from the long-baseline science verification campaign after a WVR scaling factor is applied. The improvement of phase noise translates to an expected coherence improvement in 39 datasets. When imaging the bandpass source, we find 33 of the 39 datasets show an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) between a few to ~ 30 percent. There are 23 datasets where the S/N of the science image is improved: 6 by 450 GHz) and long-baseline (> 5 km) observations. These inherently have poorer phase stability and are taken in low PWV (< 1 mm) conditions for which we find the scaling to be most effective. A promising explanation for the scaling factor is the mixing of dry and <b>wet</b> air <b>components,</b> although other origins are discussed. We have produced a python code to allow ALMA users to undertake WVR scaling tests and make improvements to their data. Comment: 27 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables - Accepted to A&...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} and mechanical characteristics of ionic-covalent entanglement hydrogels consisting of combinations of the edible biopolymers gellan gum and gelatin were investigated. Impedance analysis and compression testing showed that these hydrogels (with water content = 97 %) exhibited conductivity values {{of up to}} 13 mS/cm and compressive stress at failure values of up to 1. 0 MPa. These are suitable characteristics for printed and mechanically robust <b>wet</b> device <b>components...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. From a {{conceptual}} {{point of view}} water vapour radiometers (WVRs) are ideal instruments for a direct determination of the water vapour content in the atmosphere above a space geodetic observing site. For various reasons the application of WVRs for a direct correction of geodetic Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations for the <b>wet</b> <b>component</b> of atmospheric refraction has not been brought to a stage where it could be employed routinely. The installation of {{a new type of}} WVR at the 100 m Effelsberg radio telescope in Germany opens up new possibilities for a direct correction of the VLBI observations using line-of-sight WVR observations. The WVR has been in operation during two geodetic VLBI sessions of a purely European network. In addition, some WVR data at Onsala have been revisited to embark on a project which aims at applying wet delay corrections from WVRs to VLBI sessions of the European geodetic VLBI network for the Effelsberg, Madrid, Onsala and Wettzell sites. In this paper we present the analysis and results of a few examples of Effelsberg and Onsala observing sessions...|$|R
40|$|Existing apriori tropospheric {{models are}} not {{sufficiently}} accurate to remove tropospheric delay from GPS observations. Remaining effects of residual tropospheric delay {{need to be}} estimated to ensure high accuracy and reliability of GPS positioning. Other researchers have shown that implementations of network-based positioning techniques can adequately model the residual tropospheric delay as well as ionospheric delay and orbit biases. However, the effectiveness in removing residual tropospheric delay is highly dependent on {{the degree to which}} the <b>wet</b> <b>component</b> from the troposphere can be estimated or mitigated, an effect which shows strong variation with time and space. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the performance of an existing apriori tropospheric model and to discuss some issues concerning the estimation of the (total) tropospheric delay in the equatorial area. Finally, the network approach is applied to mitigate the effect of residual tropospheric delay. Some preliminary results from test experiments using GPS network data from an equatorial region, a location with the highest effect of tropospheric delay, are presented...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} numerical simulations {{of the atmosphere}} for typical daytime con-vective conditions at Chajnantor, and derived the resulting wet and dry contributions to the atmospheric phase fluctuations. The simulations show that: ◦ Dry phase fluctuations occur in two layers – near to the ground, and at the tem-perature inversion, while the wet fluctuations are concentrated mainly at the inversion, with only a small contribution near to the surface. The resulting total phase fluctuations are strongly concentrated at the inversion, owing to significant negative and positive correlations between the dry and wet refractive index fluctuations at the ground and inversion respectively. ◦ The phase structure function is well described by a Kolmogorov turbulence spectrum on small scales, with a turn over {{on a scale of}} order the depth of the boundary layer. ◦ The total r. m. s. phase is found to have a linear dependence on air mass (as the eleva-tion is changed), and this is similar to the dry <b>component,</b> while the <b>wet</b> <b>component</b> is found to vary as air mass to the power 0. 75...|$|R
40|$|The Water {{damage in}} {{buildings}} and building components because of leaking pipes {{and more and}} more because of floods and severe weather require professional help. Methods for analysing the cause of damage have to be developed or improved as well as repair and remediation techniques. Therefore, large scale laboratory tests with four rooms with three types of masonry walls and typical floors for intermediate storeys with insulation have been performed within a climate simulator. Artificial water damage was provoked through watering the floors, and the dispersion of water in the floors and the rising damp in the walls was measured. In the follow-up to the watering of the floors, a company which is specialized in drying wet buildings installed different drying systems for under-floor drying and wall drying. The drying process of the different components and layers of the floor construction and walls was monitored by a measuring system with more than 300 sensors for moisture content, relative humidity and temperature accompanied by thermography. After providing an initial contamination that is typical for construction sites, the microbial load (mould infestation) within the <b>wet</b> <b>components</b> was monitored at different times by experienced biologists. The aim of the research was to gain more confidence in selecting appropriate drying procedures and systems and to assess success control methods that identify the moment for terminating the drying process by on-the-spot-checks of exhaust air humidity and other parameters. At the same time the research delivers a lot of useful data for the validation of computer simulations reproducing the hygrothermal behaviour of <b>wet</b> building <b>components</b> at ambient conditions representative for water damage occurrence and subsequent technical drying. This leads the way to more accurate planning of remedial measures by applying hygrothermal simulation tools...|$|R
