50|$|The engine, {{because it}} is {{indirect}} injection, with a slower combustion burn time than direct injection, is suitable to run on SVO (pure vegetable oil). A feature of the Ricardo Comet pre-chamber design {{is that it makes}} the engine tolerant of low Cetane value fuels such as SVO. The viscosity of vegetable oil when cold is too great for rotary injection pumps, (in particular the weaker Lucas CAV pump, the Bosch VE fuel pump is superior), preventing it from acting as a lubricant and increasing the workload on the distributor/rotary injection pump and damaging it. The Lucas EPIC pump fitted to the 2.1 L 12 valve turbodiesel engine after 1995 is the weakest pump of all. Different fresh vegetable oils have different viscosities: thinnest are; sunflower, rapeseed (often only labelled vegetable oil, but with pictures of distinctive yellow flowers), then soya and corn oil, but palm oil (may be only marked vegetable oil) is thickest and may be solid at room temperature. Vegetable oils thicken when used for cooking, so used oils can be much thicker than any fresh oil, they may even solidify at room temperature. It is necessary for used oil to be very well filtered (ideally cold filtered to 1 micron), to avoid filter plugging and/or injection pump damage. Heavily used oil may be highly acidic and corrode the inside of the injection pump. Such oil can only be used as fuel without the risk of damage, if it has been chemically processed into bio-diesel. The open market price for used oil is often quite close to special offer supermarket prices for new oil, which can be used straight away. In order to reduce the viscosity of the SVO, it should be heated to engine coolant operating temperature, typically with a two tank system, in order to start and shutdown on diesel or bio-diesel. Versions of this engine from the early '90s onward, are typically fitted with a Peugeot-type coolant heated fuel filter that helps heat fuel and reduce viscosity. Fuel / engine coolant heat exchangers, usually required for straight vegetable oil conversions, are still needed for long term life expectancy, or there will be accelerated wear of the fuel injection pump. Heated vegetable oil is a good injection pump lubricant. This is especially important in cold weather ambient temperatures. Mixing with major oil company brand diesel, (which in winter is thinner and contains anti-waxing <b>winterising</b> agents) to thin the vegetable oil fuel, choosing a thin vegetable oil, <b>winterising</b> additive, or electric heating, or a combination of these are helpful especially when starting and warming up, as coolant heating will not yet be at operating temperature. The difference between the use of good quality fuel and supermarket diesel, in a diesel / vegetable oil fuel mix, will be very noticeable, especially at lower temperatures. The fuel systems used on this engine return heated fuel to the fuel tank. Running with half a tank of fuel instead of fully filling up, will allow the tank to be heated more effectively by this warmed fuel in low ambient temperatures. Due to different calorific values some oils will give less mpg and some more.|$|E

In addition to the natural benefits of the site, new technologies, resulting from astrophotonics, may allow miniaturised instruments, that are easier to <b>winterise</b> and advanced filters to further reduce the background in the infrared.

500|$|During the December 2009 European snowfall, four Eurostar trains {{broke down}} inside the Channel Tunnel, after leaving France, {{and one in}} Kent on 18 December. Although the trains had been <b>winterised,</b> the systems had not coped with the conditions. Over 2,000 {{passengers}} were stuck inside failed trains inside the tunnel, and over 75,000 had their services disrupted. All Eurostar services were cancelled from Saturday 19 December to Monday 21 December 2009. An independent review, published on 12 February 2010, was critical of the contingency plans in place for assisting passengers stranded by the delays, calling them [...] "insufficient".|$|R
40|$|Carp viscera oil can be {{obtained}} by both ensilage and fishmeal processes. This study examined the refinement of carp (Cyprinus carpio) oils obtained by both processes, and compared crude, neutralised, bleached, <b>winterised</b> and deodorised oilsâ€™ characteristics and lipid profiles. Refined oils obtained by the two processes did not present significant difference (p > 0. 05) for Lovibond colour, free fatty acids, and thiobarbituric acid values. The major fatty acids identified in the carp crude, bleached and refined oils were oleic, palmitic, palmitoleic, linoleic and linolenic, constituting approximately 69. 6 % of the total fatty acids of the oils. The n 3 /n 6 ratio was approximately 1. 05 for refined oil. Therefore, carp viscera refined oil can be considered a rich source of essential fatty acids of the n 3 and n 6 series...|$|R

Snow also disrupted motorways, including the M1, and many airports were closed.|$|R
50|$|The {{icebreaker}} {{approached the}} construction site {{in the morning of}} 24 February 2004. During the two days that followed, eight containers weighing together 130 tonnes (286,601 pounds) were unloaded from the ship. Construction works started as soon as the ship was unloaded. This first delivery of material was used to build almost the whole main building, which was then used to store materials for further construction. The construction took place {{towards the end of the}} Antarctic summer and lasted seven days. As the first delivery did not contain all the necessary construction materials and systems, the main building and surrounding containers were <b>winterised</b> and the construction activities continued the following year. For Antarctica, weather conditions were very favourable during the construction, but the temperature was still between -8-+6 C and the winds reached 120 km/h, sometimes blowing incessantly for several days.|$|R
5000|$|The National Capital Commission (NCC) {{maintains}} the house, its property, and {{a selection of}} historic furnishings from the Crown Collection {{for use in the}} public rooms of the mansion, ranging from musical instruments to chairs, tables, and paintings by famous Canadians. However, {{due to the lack of}} restraints on the prime minister of the day to do what he or she pleases with the home, several have left their own marks on the building. For example, the rear patio was enclosed and <b>winterised</b> while Lester B. Pearson was prime minister and inside, Pearson's wife, Maryon, created in the basement the Canadiana Room, where she collected Canadian antiques and craft-work. While Joe Clark and his family were resident at 24 Sussex, the interiors were redecorated, the dining room ceiling receiving gold leaf re-purposed from another project and unnamed business associates of Pierre Trudeau installed a swimming pool for his frequent workouts. The pool, designed by government architect Stig Harvor, reportedly cost C$275,000 due to an underground access increasing the expense. [...] This was raised in a [...] "public fund" [...] headed by Keith Davey, the donors to which were never made public. Brian Mulroney was the first prime minister to have the costs of renovations publicly revealed. The high tab for his and his wife's alterations to the building caused political controversy, especially as some of the costs were paid for from the PC Canada Fund, which raised money from individual donations to fund the Progressive Conservative Party.|$|R
