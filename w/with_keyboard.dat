5|$|Luzzaschi's book of madrigals for one, two, {{and three}} sopranos <b>with</b> <b>keyboard</b> accompaniment, {{published}} in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music {{may have been}} kept back from publication {{in order to maintain}} the secrecy of Alfonso's musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding to requests from Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both that male singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means of filling in the counterpoint.|$|E
5|$|Sander Gommans {{started the}} {{composition}} of the basic melodies for Invisible Circles at the beginning of 2003 in his home studio in Reuver, working at the same time on new songs for the EP Exordium. This part of the creative process had been shared with Mark Jansen for the previous albums and it would be shared <b>with</b> <b>keyboard</b> player Joost van den Broek for the following ones. Gommans wrote the songs for the new album with the precise idea of pushing the music of the band closer to progressive metal, reducing the gothic atmospheres of the previous releases to a minimum and adopting as many different musical styles as he felt necessary to the convey the message of the songs. Meanwhile, his fiancée Floor Jansen was writing the lyrics and shaping the plot for the concept album.|$|E

Fahrenheit eventually went Gold on October 3, 1994. Steve Porcaro was never replaced and Toto decided to continue with only five members. Although Porcaro occasionally assisted the band on synthesizers for their subsequent studio albums (and appeared on their 1988 tour), David Paich handled most of the live keyboard work (<b>with</b> <b>keyboard</b> technician John Jessel assisting on certain dates) post 1988.|$|E
25|$|Window {{management}} in Windows 7 has several new features: Snap maximizes a window {{when it is}} dragged {{to the top of}} the screen. Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen allows users to snap software windows to either side of the screen, such that the windows take up half the screen. When a user moves windows that were snapped or maximized using Snap, the system restores their previous state. Snap functions can also be triggered <b>with</b> <b>keyboard</b> shortcuts. Shake hides all inactive windows when the active window's title bar is dragged back and forth rapidly (metaphorically shaken).|$|E
25|$|Leopold {{discovered}} that {{his two children}} were musically gifted in about 1759, when he began <b>with</b> <b>keyboard</b> lessons for the seven-year-old Nannerl. The toddler Wolfgang immediately began imitating his sister, at first picking out thirds on the keyboard and then making rapid progress under Leopold's instruction. By 1762, the children were ready to work as concert performers, and Leopold began taking the family on extensive concert tours, performing for both aristocracy and public, throughout central and western Europe. This tour included Munich, Vienna, Presburg, Paris and the Hague together with a lengthy stay in London; see Mozart family Grand Tour.|$|E

The latter's contribution, on harmonium, is prominent on the take available unofficially on Living in the Alternate World, a bootleg compilation containing pre-overdubbed versions of the officially released songs, but was subsequently superseded by John Barham's orchestral arrangements.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{dance music}} style most {{closely associated with}} the tromba among the Betsimisaraka is called basesa and is performed on accordion. The traditional basesa performed for tromba ceremonies uses kaiamba shakers to accentuate the rhythm; lyrics are always sung in local Betsimisaraka dialect. The accompanying dance is performed with arms to the sides of the body and heavy foot movements. Contemporary basesa, which has been popularized across the island, is performed using a modern drum kit and electric guitar and bass <b>with</b> <b>keyboard</b> or accordion accompaniment, and the associated dance style has been influenced by dances performed to sega and kwassa kwassa music from Reunion Island. Basesa is also performed by the Antandroy, but among Betsimisaraka the style is performed significantly more slowly. [...] Another major musical style specific to the region is valse, Malagasy interpretations of traditional European seafarers' waltzes performed on accordion; this genre is never performed during tromba ceremonies.|$|E
500|$|The final {{thing that}} he did {{was to create a}} {{breakdown}} using Auto-Tune and the Nord Lead synthesizer, applying its echo function. In total Ahmadzaï worked for 15days on the track, finally handing it to mixing engineer Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent. He explained in an interview <b>with</b> <b>Keyboard</b> magazine that the version that he created was almost same to the final track present in Music. On most of the other tracks, Stent tried to add a lot of mixing effects to Ahmadzaï's production. But for [...] "Impressive Instant", they tried to mix it first from the Sony digital tracks and failed get the original sound of the demo, since the compression present in the track was the actual sound to be produced. So Stent took the sound from Ahmadzaï's Yamaha 02R mixer, including the bass, loops, and the kick. Along with mixing the track at Olympic Studios, London, the mastering was done by Tim Young at Metropolis Studio. Other engineers working on the track included Mark Endert, Sean Spuehler, Tom Hannen and Tim Lambert.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{their earlier}} works, this album {{features}} no keyboards, instead replacing long time keyboard player, Daniella Jones, with guitarist Justin Garcia.

500|$|West {{recorded}} a verse by rap artist Nas—one of his idol rappers—for the track [...] "We Major" [...] without informing Jay-Z, {{who at the}} time was engaged in a [...] G.O.O.D, music label-mate Really Doe also appears on the track, delivering its elongated chorus. West later revealed that part of the reason he created the song was to dismantle the feud between the MCs, which they did later that year. [...] "Hey Mama", dedicated to his mother Donda West, was first recorded by West as early as 2000. Brion ran into some obstruction while conducting a twenty-piece orchestra for [...] "Celebration", as its musicians found themselves giggling at West's humorous lyrics which hampered their playing. [...] On [...] "Roses," [...] West and Brion had some minor discord; Brion initially layered it <b>with</b> <b>keyboard</b> arrangements, only for West to remove his keys along with the beat and completely reconfigure the entire song {{in such a way that}} its verses are built around the rhythm formed by his vocals and Brion's arrangements arrive during the choruses. Brion later lightheartedly compared the indecision surrounding the construction of the track to that of Prince's famous last-minute removal of the bass line from [...] "When Doves Cry." [...] According to Patti Labelle, she contributed vocals to [...] "Roses". [...] "I was in his studio one night, and [...] and his mother both asked if I'd just sing something on this song", Labelle recalled. [...] "I didn't get a credit on the album because the liner notes had already been printed up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Opening with [...] "Springtime", the EP {{highlighted}} the country blues style harmonica of Dalton {{which was in}} part characteristic of the Lighthouse Keepers' sound. The disc heralded the introduction of brass instruments into the group's instrumental range which continued in subsequent recordings. Trumpet player Alex Hamilton, who also played the solo on The Particles track [...] "I Luv Trumpet", contributed overdubbed brass lines on [...] "Bad Mood" [...] and the duet intro for country ballad [...] "Again". Musical arrangements were embellished <b>with</b> <b>keyboard</b> and tambourine played by Ward with additional percussion by O'Neil. The integration of the driving pop sensibility of drummer Williams, allowed O'Neil to add second guitar parts to [...] "The Beat" [...] and [...] "Narvel Felts".

2500|$|A rare {{inclusion}} in a marching band that {{is becoming more}} popular {{is the use of}} electrophones in a marching band. [...] The most common electric instrument seen is a bass guitar, but some schools also use keyboards and lead guitar. [...] To make the electric instruments usable, external power in the stadium is normally used, but some groups may use a car-battery mechanism that requires a car battery and a converter to give the instruments and amplifiers remote power. [...] Most bands have the guitars in the pit <b>with</b> <b>keyboard</b> and auxiliary percussion, but some guitarists do march in the field show. [...] This is made possible by wireless transmission systems that connect a transmitter on the guitar to a receiver hooked to the amplifier. This implementation of equipment can also be used in parades. [...] Some band scores have parts for bass guitar, but in the event that a score does not, the bass guitarist normally plays tuba/sousaphone, bassoon, baritone-bass clef, euphonium-bass clef, or trombone music. [...] It is very rare for a score to have a part for electric guitar, but the guitarist may use oboe or flute music in this situation.|$|E
