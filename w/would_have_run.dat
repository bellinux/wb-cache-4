5|$|In 1975, the Delaware River Port Authority {{proposed}} that a Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) rail line be added along the median of Route55 between Deptford and Glassboro; however, plans were canceled. In the 2000s, another proposal resurfaced {{to add a}} PATCO line along the Route55 corridor. The alternative called for park and ride lots to be constructed along the Route55 corridor, providing access to the line. PhaseI <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>run</b> to Glassboro (Rowan University) and PhaseII would have extended down to the Millville area and service the Cumberland Mall area.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Clearview was {{intended}} to run along the existing right-of-ways of Utopia Parkway and Francis Lewis Boulevard. An alternate proposed routing <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>run</b> along Little Neck Bay and through Alley Pond Park, essentially parallel to the Cross Island Parkway. By September 1956, the Clearview was mapped along 206th and 207th Streets and Hollis Court Boulevard, east of Francis Lewis Boulevard, after community opposition. The reroute {{reduced the number of}} properties to be demolished or relocated from 860 to 421. An information center was set up by the TBTA for local residents displaced by the expressway.|$|E
5|$|The B {{bill was}} again {{examined}} by a joint committee under Lord Windsor. The GN bill was examined by a separate committee under Lord Ribblesdale. The B's eastward extension to Holborn {{to connect to}} the GN was permitted, but the extension to Parsons Green was rejected following objections from hospitals in the Fulham Road, which were concerned that vibrations from trains might affect their patients. The B link from Piccadilly Circus to Charing Cross was rejected {{on the grounds that}} it involved sharp turns and steep gradients to avoid public buildings in the area. The merger with the GN and name change were permitted. The GN's extension to Temple was rejected following objections from the Duke of Norfolk who owned the land under which it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>run.</b> The abandonment of the route north of Finsbury Park was permitted.|$|E

5000|$|In waterfalls, the run (also {{known as}} the runout) is the linear {{distance}} the stream flows {{from the brink of}} the waterfall to its base. Therefore, a steeper waterfall <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a shorter <b>run,</b> and a less inclined waterfall <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a longer <b>run.</b> As an example, rapids typically <b>have</b> longer <b>runs,</b> as their actual drop is usually much shorter than the distance they flow.

5|$|As planned, {{counterclockwise}} trains, to {{and from}} Jamaica and Howard Beach, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>run</b> every 2 minutes during peak hours, for a frequency of 30 trains per hour (tph). Each branch would have been served by a train every four minutes, or 15 tph. The final environmental impact statement planned for even higher frequencies of 40 tph, or a train every 90 seconds in the central terminal area. However, , actual frequencies were much lower, with each branch being served by one train every 7 to 12 minutes during peak hours, or 5 to 8.5 tph. During middays, trains come every 10 to 15 minutes, with 4 to 6 tph on each branch. Late night service is less frequent: trains come every 15 to 20 minutes, with 3 to 4 tph on each branch. Weekend service is similar to night service, with trains coming every 16 minutes, or 4 tph on each branch. Trains make the journey between the terminals and either Jamaica or Howard Beach in about eight minutes.|$|E
5|$|From 1768 {{there were}} a number of grand schemes proposed, all with the aim of linking the Bristol Channel to the English Channel by a waterway, thereby {{avoiding}} the need to navigate by sea around Cornwall and Devon. James Brindley was the first to survey a route, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>run</b> from the Bristol Channel to Exeter, following the course of the River Tone for part of its route. In 1769, Robert Whitworth looked at a shorter route from Bridgwater Bay to Seaton, following the River Parrett and the River Axe. He was asked to reassess the route in the 1790s. William Jessop surveyed a route between Taunton and Exeter in 1794, while another group proposed a canal linking Bristol, Nailsea, Bridgwater and Taunton, which was surveyed by William White. Jessop's assistant, Josiah Easton, suggested a route from Uphill (on the Bristol Channel) to Seaton, again in 1794, and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the Grand Western Canal and the Bristol and Western Canal, respectively. Only the first was authorised, but the economic downturn caused by the Napoleonic Wars meant that construction did not begin immediately.|$|E
5|$|Two {{additional}} realignments {{occurred at}} the north end of the Green Line, but with less acrimony. North of Fort Totten, the line was to have surfaced in the median of the planned North Central Freeway, I-95, and proceeded to a point just west of Prince George's Plaza, with an intermediate station at Chillum. I-95 and Metro <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>run</b> through the Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park; the cancellation of I-95 through the District and out to the Beltway in 1974 meant that it was no longer necessary or appropriate to condemn an I-95-sized swath of parkland just for Metro (as well as a Metro station and its parking lot). WMATA eventually selected a new route that skirted most of the park, and it was federally approved by the mid-1980s. The planned Chillum station was relocated and named West Hyattsville. The other alignment dispute occurred in the Petworth section of Washington, and involved whether the tunnel would go under or skirt Rock Creek Cemetery and how to go through this soft-soil burial ground (it was skirted using the New Austrian Tunnelling method), and the least disruptive way under New Hampshire Avenue from Georgia Avenue – Petworth to Columbia Heights (the tunnels were stacked).|$|E

5|$|A belt route around Salt Lake City {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1955, with the Utah Highway Department (the predecessor to the present-day Utah Department of Transportation) holding hearings concerning construction beginning in early 1958. The southeast quadrant {{of the route}} was originally placed from a junction at proposed I-15 in Murray northeasterly through Murray and Holladay, eventually reaching the east bench at 3900 South. From there, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>run</b> north toward the mouth of Parley's Canyon at proposed I-80 (at the time US-40). Almost immediately, this plan was met with opposition among local residents in the area. The proposed route would have bisected the primarily residential Holladay suburb, {{as well as the}} southern portion of Murray. After more than two years of hearings and widespread opposition from residents, the Highway Department released their proposed routing in June 1960, which placed the southeast quadrant where it runs today. While quelling criticism from some, others remained in opposition, saying the route was still too intrusive along residential areas. The western quadrant was also admonished for being placed to close to other major arterials. In November 1963, a small, two-lane portion of the northwest quadrant of the belt route opened from Redwood Road (SR-68) in Davis County west and south to 2100 North, north of the Salt Lake City International Airport. This portion of road was extended east to I-15 in North Salt Lake and upgraded to freeway standards by 1969.|$|E
5|$|The Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN) first {{proposed}} a {{station in the}} Strand area in a private bill presented to Parliament in November 1898. The station {{was to be the}} southern terminus of an underground railway line planned to run from Wood Green station (now Alexandra Palace) via Finsbury Park and King's Cross and was originally to be located at the corner of Stanhope Street and Holles Street, north of the Strand. When the two streets were scheduled for demolition as part of the London County Council's plans for the construction of Kingsway and Aldwych, the GN moved the location to the junction of the two new roads. Royal Assent to the bill was given and the Great Northern and Strand Railway Act 1899 was enacted on 1 August. In September 1901, the GN was taken over by the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B), which planned to build an underground line from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus via Knightsbridge. Both were under the control of Charles Yerkes through his Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company and, in June 1902, were transferred to Yerkes' new holding company, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Neither of the railways had carried out any construction, but the UERL obtained permission for new tunnels between Piccadilly Circus and Holborn to connect the two routes. The companies were formally merged as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) following parliamentary approval in November 1902. Prior to confirmation of the merger, the GN had sought permission to extend its line southwards from the future junction of Kingsway and Aldwych, under Norfolk Street to a new interchange under the Metropolitan District Railway's station at Temple. The extension was rejected following objections from the Duke of Norfolk under whose land {{the last part of the}} proposed tunnels <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
