5|$|As the frontrunners {{set their}} first timed laps in Q3, Hamilton {{made a mistake}} and ran wide at the last corner, leaving him behind Rosberg and both Ferrari drivers. Hülkenberg, both Williams drivers and Ricciardo were {{eliminated}} without setting another time, while the four fastest cars came out again. Hamilton set the fastest ever lap at the Bahrain Circuit, at 1:29.493, to achieve pole position ahead of Rosberg, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 0.077 seconds slower. Half a second behind, Vettel grabbed third place on the grid ahead of teammate Räikkönen. After qualifying, Hamilton's pole was put under threat after the FIA started an investigation after Hamilton reversed in the pit lane to park up. Hamilton was given a reprimand and his pole position stood.|$|E
5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs {{and in his}} memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E
5|$|The {{companies}} under Pitcairn's command got {{beyond their}} officers' control {{in part because}} they were unaware of the actual purpose of the day's mission. They fired in different directions and prepared to enter private homes. Colonel Smith, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> arriving with the remainder of the regulars, heard the musket fire and rode forward from the grenadier column to see the action. He quickly found a drummer and ordered him to beat assembly. The grenadiers arrived shortly thereafter, and once order was restored among the soldiers, the light infantry were permitted to fire a victory volley, after which the column was reformed and marched on toward Concord.|$|E

Guicciardini retired to his villa in Arcetri, where he spent his last years working on the Storia d'Italia. He died in 1540 without male heirs.|$|E

25|$|The {{average age}} of first sexual {{intercourse}} in the United States is around 18 for males and around 17 for females, {{and this has been}} rising in recent years.

25|$|Sometime after {{starting}} {{work in the}} story department, Wray became involved in RKO's Young Writers' Project, {{a program designed to}} identify and cultivate writing talent at the studio. A treatment found in her estate papers puts her in that program in 1941, but her screenwriting career really began in 1942 when she was given an opportunity to work with Val Lewton <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> beginning what would become a legendary short career as a producer of low-budget horror movies.|$|E

25|$|The Cubs {{struggled}} in Cactus League action, so Green began {{to rebuild the}} team before it left Mesa. Green began by releasing Ferguson Jenkins, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 16 games shy of winning 300 games. Jenkins' release ended the right-hander's second stint with the Cubs, and effectively, his career. Green's biggest move of the spring came on March 26, when he sent journeyman reliever Bill Campbell and catcher Mike Diaz to Philadelphia for pitcher Porfi Altamirano and outfielders Gary Matthews and Bob Dernier.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} held on 25 November 1945 was a {{blow for}} the Communist Party of Austria which received {{a bit more}} than 5% of the vote. The coalition of Christian Democrats (ÖVP) and Social Democrats (SPÖ), backed by 90% of the votes, assumed control over the cabinet and offered the position of Federal Chancellor to Christian Democrat Julius Raab. The Soviets vetoed Raab, due to his political role in the 1930s. Instead President Karl Renner, with the consent of parliament, appointed Leopold Figl, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> barely acceptable to the Soviets. They responded with massive and coordinated expropriation of Austrian economic potential.|$|E
25|$|Blackpool {{finished}} the 1949–50 season in seventh place. A quarter-final defeat at Liverpool ended the club's FA Cup interest for another season. Blackpool's reserve team, however, won the Central League championship, scoring 82 {{goals in the}} process. They were assisted significantly by Jackie Mudie, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> beginning {{to knock on the}} door of the first team. Other new members included the amateur Bill Slater and Bill Perry. Out went goalkeeper Joe Robinson, who was unable to win back the number-one jersey from Farm, as well as Alex Munro, who retired, and Ron Suart, who joined Blackburn.|$|E

Disney admired Arrow's work and hired them to help design build the vehicles for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. They would eventually design and build the ride systems for many of Disneyland's original and early rides, including Mad Tea Party, King Arthur Carrousel, Casey Jr. Circus Train, and Snow White's Scary Adventures. Disney continued to use Arrow as Disneyland expanded. Arrow designed and built Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Autopia, and Alice in Wonderland in coming years as well as upgrading and renovating the King Arthur Carrousel.|$|E

25|$|In {{her fourth}} and final college year Stowers {{featured}} {{in the top three}} in NCAA competition. At the 2014 NCAA Indoor Championships she ran a school record of 7.94 to take third place again in a tight race, where the top three (including Sharika Nelvis and Tiffani McReynolds) all finished within one hundredth of a second of each other. The 2014 NCAA Outdoor Championships bore similar results, as Stowers finished in a wind-assisted 12.54 seconds to place second behind Nelvis, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> two hundredths ahead of her. She was usurped by Kentucky's Kendra Harrison in SEC competition, ranking second behind her both indoors and outdoors. Her third career win at the Penn Relays made her the first woman to achieve that feat. She ended the year on a high note at the 2014 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships: after setting a personal record of 12.71 seconds in the qualifying round, she progressed to the final and finished in fourth place – her highest ever senior national ranking.|$|E
