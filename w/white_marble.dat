The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order, and made from Italian <b>white</b> <b>marble.</b> The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.|$|E

In this game, players {{move up to}} four Pac-Man characters (traditional yellow plus red, green and blue) plus two ghosts as per the throws {{of a pair of}} dice. Each Pac-Man is assigned to a player while the ghosts are neutral and controlled by all players. Each player moves their Pac-Man the number of spaces on either die and a ghost the number of spaces on the other die, the Pac-Man consuming any <b>white</b> <b>marbles</b> (the equivalent of dots) and yellow marbles (the equivalent of power pellets) in its path. Players can move a ghost onto a Pac-Man and claim two <b>white</b> <b>marbles</b> from its player. They can also move a Pac-Man with a yellow marble inside it onto a ghost and claim two <b>white</b> <b>marbles</b> from any other player (following which the yellow marble is placed back in the maze.

This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and <b>white</b> <b>marble</b> design.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. - The {{different}} types of Apuan <b>white</b> <b>marbles</b> show varying degrees of durability when exposed to external weathering. Their durability has been related to different microstructures, linked to distinct tectonometamorphic histories within the Apuan Metamorphic Complex. This paper examines samples collected from several sectors of the Apuan Alps, the differing geological histories of which cause different marble microstructures. The samples are dominated by either granoblastic or xenoblastic microstructures. Chemical, mineralogical, petrographical and physical analyses were carried out. Microstructural characteristics were analysed by image analysis in order to quantify parameters such as grain diameter, diameter of equivalent circle, axial ratio, and roundness. These data are related to petrophysical parameters such as porosity, mesopore distribution, and saturation index. All the collected data indicate that the Apuan <b>white</b> <b>marbles</b> with low roundness (indicating granoblastic structure) {{are more susceptible to}} weathering than those with xenoblastic structure. Furthermore, the different microstructural characteristics can be used to study the provenance of the <b>white</b> <b>marbles</b> used in the past in constructing and decorating historical buildings and monuments.

5|$|As {{a gateway}} to the west, and Persia in particular, Lahore had a strong {{regional}} style which was heavily influenced by Persian architectural styles. Earlier mosques, such as the Wazir Khan Mosque, were adorned in intricate kashi kari, or Kashan style tile work, from which the Badshahi Mosque would depart. Aurangzeb chose an architectural plan {{similar to that of}} Shah Jehan's choice for the Jama Masjid in Delhi, though built the Badshahi mosque on a much larger scale. Both mosques feature red sandstone with <b>white</b> <b>marble</b> inlay, which is a departure from typical mosque design in Lahore, in which decoration is done by means of intricate tile work.|$|E

When he was led to believe that many of his works would not be allowed for publishing, he retook possession of all the manuscripts he had sent in, including some previously unpublished writings.

5|$|It {{was built}} by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan between 1644 and 1656 {{at a cost of}} 1 million rupees, and was inaugurated by an imam from Bukhara, present-day Uzbekistan. The mosque was {{completed}} in 1656 AD with three great gates, four towers and two 40 m high minarets constructed of strips of red sandstone and <b>white</b> <b>marble.</b> The courtyard can accommodate more than 25,000 persons. There are three domes on the terrace which are surrounded by the two minarets. On the floor, a total of 899 black borders are marked for worshippers. The architectural plan of Badshahi Masjid, built by Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb at Lahore, Pakistan, is similar to the Jama Masjid, Delhi.|$|E

5|$|Shah Jahan's first {{contribution}} to the fort commenced {{in the year of}} his coronation, 1628, and continued until 1645. Shah Jahan first ordered construction of the Diwan-i-Aam in the style of a Chehel Sotoun - a Persian style 40-pillar public audience hall. Though construction of the Shah Burj commenced under Jahangir, Shah Jahan was displeased with its design and appointed Asif Khan to oversee reconstruction. Shah Jahan's Shah Burj forms a quadrangle with the famous Sheesh Mahal, and Naulakha Pavilion. Both are attributed to Shah Jahan, although the Naulakha Pavilion may be a later addition possibly from the Sikh era. The <b>white</b> <b>marble</b> Moti Masjid, or Pearl Mosque, also dates from the Shah Jahan period.|$|E

These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in <b>white</b> <b>marble</b> running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E
