Computer Games said it was innovative and may serve as an inspiration for future games. PC Gamer said the multiplayer mode was the redeeming factor of the game, though it was still marred by bugs.

5|$|Basilicata {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Campania. Both ships were built on the same slipway. They were launched {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. Fitting-out work proceeded more slowly on Basilicata, and she was completed on 1 August 1917, four months after her sister ship. After completion, Basilicata was stationed in Italian Libya. On 13 August 1919, while moored in Tewfik at the southern end of the Suez Canal, one of Basilicatas boilers exploded, which sank the ship. Salvage operations began thereafter, and on 12 September 1920, the ship was refloated. The Regia Marina decided that repairing the ship was not <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost,</b> and so on 1 July 1921 she was sold to ship breakers in Suez.|$|E
5|$|Jun'yō was torpedoed in November 1943 {{and spent}} three months under repair. She was damaged by several bombs during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944, but quickly {{returned}} to service. Lacking aircraft, {{she was used}} as a transport in late 1944 and was torpedoed again in December. Jun'yō was under repair until March 1945, when work was cancelled as uneconomical. She was then effectively hulked {{for the rest of the}} war. After the surrender of Japan in September, the Americans also decided that she was not <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> to make her serviceable for use as a repatriation ship, and she was broken up in 1946–1947.|$|E

5|$|Beebe {{continued}} to conduct marine research after 1934, {{but he felt}} that he had seen what he wanted to see using the Bathysphere, and that further dives were too expensive for whatever knowledge he gained from them to be <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost.</b> With the help of Beebe's friend the physician Henry Lloyd, Beebe conducted an expedition in the West Indies examining the stomach contents of tuna, which uncovered previously unknown larval forms of several species of fish. Shortly after returning, Beebe set out on a longer expedition to the waters around Baja California, financed by the Californian businessman Templeton Crocker on board his yacht the Zaca. The goal of this expedition was to study the area's undersea fauna by means of dredging and helmet diving, and Beebe and his team were surprised by the diversity of animals that they encountered there. In 1937 Beebe went on a second expedition aboard the Zaca, documenting the native wildlife along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Colombia. During this expedition, rather than focusing on either sea animals as he had at Nonsuch Island or on birds as he had earlier in his life, he attempted to document all aspects of the ecosystem. Beebe described his two expeditions on board the Zaca in his books Zaca Venture and The Book of Bays, in which he emphasized his concern for threatened habitats and his dismay at human destruction.|$|E
25|$|The airport's {{value was}} {{estimated}} at NOK20 million. A sabotage of the drainage system was discovered in 1949, which explained many of the technical challenges affiliated with the runways.

Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season—hardly <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of losing two first-round draft picks.

25|$|The {{slope of}} the curve at a point on it gives the {{trade-off}} between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, {{an example of a}} real opportunity cost. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. Along the PPF, scarcity implies that choosing more of one good in the aggregate entails doing with less of the other good. Still, in a market economy, movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> to the agents.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{before the}} system was {{declared}} operational, Iron Dome was criticized by Reuven Pedatzur, a military analyst, former fighter pilot and {{professor of political science}} at Tel Aviv University for costing too much compared to the cost of a Qassam rocket (fired by Palestinian forces), so that launching very large numbers of Qassams could essentially attack Israel's financial means. The estimated cost of each Tamir interceptor missile has been cited from US$20,000–50,000 whereas a crudely manufactured Qassam rocket costs around $800 and the cost of each Hamas Grad rocket is only several thousand dollars each. Rafael responded that the cost issue was exaggerated since Iron Dome intercepts only rockets determined to constitute a threat, and that the lives saved and the strategic impact are <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{widening}} project, the level-of-service along the highway went from an overall grade of 'F' (failing) to 'A' (excellent) and {{became one of the most}} scenic byways in the nation. The desire by the designers of the highway, the general public, and the numerous preservation organizations to maintain the historic character of the corridor and to maintain its unique character made the cost extraordinairly high but it was well <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost.</b> Dry-laid limestone rock fences were dismantled and reconstructed by hand, for instance, and extensive landscaping and tree planting using native species were utilized.

500|$|The album reached #70 on the Oricon charts, and {{remained}} on the charts for two weeks.

500|$|Two {{plans for}} modernizing the ship were put forward before World War I. In 1907 the Naval General Staff {{proposed}} a major reconstruction {{aimed at reducing}} her draft and raising her armor belt higher out of the water. Her above-water torpedo tubes, torpedo nets, auxiliary boilers and 47-millimeter guns would have been removed, her superstructure cut down and her rigging reduced to a single pole mast. These changes would have reduced her displacement by , but the plan was rejected due to a shortage of money. Her above-water torpedo tubes, however, were removed about this time. In 1912 {{the staff of the}} Black Sea Fleet proposed to replace all of her 47mm guns with four [...] guns and to remove the auxiliary boilers and the submerged torpedo tubes to offset the additional weight. The Naval General Staff did not think that this was <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> and rejected the plan. Even though these plans did not come to fruition, other alterations were made to Rostislav before the war. A dozen of her 37mm guns were removed in 1906, and she was fitted with [...] rangefinders, probably made by Barr and Stroud, in 1907 and 1908.|$|E
