40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years attitudes towards science and science classes in K- 12 {{education}} {{have been an}} important topic of investigation due to {{the decreasing number of}} students choosing Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) related careers, and the increasing need for STEM prepared workers to cover the job demands of the future. The {{purpose of this study is}} to confirm a previously measured difference in scientific curiosity between middle school students in El Paso and in Ciudad Juarez, and to collect additional data that might tell us what the possible factors or reasons for this difference are.

40|$|In {{a globalized}} product design market, firms take {{national}} identity into consideration to survive among the competitors, because a particular identifying feature {{can be the}} decision making factor for customers to buy a particular product. In such a situation, you may realize something as “Japanese-like” or “Finnish-like” in designs as you hold the product in your hand. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think <b>like</b> that? The {{aim of this study}} is to clarify the factors that characterize these ideas, in terms of furniture design, with a focus on industrial development and the cultural contexts of Japan and Finland. The study is twofold, with a theoretical framework and an empirical framework. The theoretical analysis works with cultural industrial context and also argues that the transition of industrial development significantly affects national product design orientation and helps characterize products. The empirical analysis works with questionnaires concerning product image. The results conceptualize cultural references in both Japanese and Finnish furniture design. However, the results also present the realistic difficulty of recognizing products. The paper concludes by arguing that factors affecting customer’s decision making are also influenced by not only product design but the socio-culture they belong to. Therefore, measuring product image is not the only way to define national product identity, and the image is formed by both customers and product design factors...|$|R

This is one of war's dreadful taxes and necessities; {{and all sorts of}} innocent people must suffer by the misfortune. The corn was high at Waterloo when a hundred and fifty thousand men came and trampled it down on a Sabbath morning. There was no help for that calamity, and the Belgian farmers lost their crops for the year. Perhaps I am a farmer myself--an innocent colonus; and instead of being able to get to church with my family, have to see squadrons of French dragoons thundering upon my barley, and squares of English infantry forming and trampling all over my oats.

Well, I am a Belgian peasant, and I see the British running away and the French cutting the fugitives down.

But everybody said, 'Oh no, sit down'. I said, 'I don't want to disturb you all' - but I did make myself behave! And I was quite dispassionate, actually. The strange thing is, after I read the script, I was very moved by it. But as soon as I started working on it, I think everybody did start getting quite emotional - but I couldn't. Even about myself leaving - people in the cast would come up and say, 'How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> feel?' and I'd say, 'I can't go there, I can't think about that, because the work's not finished'. The strange thing is, {{the only thing that}} moved me was the Farewell Pat programme. Which is strange, but I suppose that was personal in a sense." [...] Also, St. Clement explained the experience of filming her final episode. She added: [...] "It was a great challenge, that script," [...] she commented. [...] "I looked at it and thought, 'Oh, heck, how do I give light and shade to something where somebody is actually dying?'
