5|$|Neighbours is an Australian {{television}} soap opera. It {{was first}} broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It {{was created by}} TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed {{the idea of making}} a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's digital channel, Eleven.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Thale {{writes in}} the Encyclopedia of Chicago that lacking {{credible}} evidence regarding the bombing, [...] "...the prosecution focused on the writings and speeches of the defendants." [...] He further notes that the conspiracy charge was legally unprecedented, the Judge was [...] "partisan," [...] and all the jurors admitted prejudice against the defendants. Historian Carl Smith writes, [...] "The visceral feelings of fear and anger surrounding the trial ruled out anything but the pretense of justice right from the outset." [...] Smith notes that scholars have long considered the trial a [...] "notorious" [...] "miscarriage of justice." [...] In a review somewhat more critical of the defendants, historian Jon Teaford concludes that [...] "he tragedy of Haymarket is the American justice system did not protect the damn fools who most needed that protection... It is the damn fools <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> too much and too wildly who are {{most in need of}} protection from the state." [...] Historian Timothy Messer-Kruse revisited the digitized trial transcript and argued that the proceedings were fair for their time, a challenge to the historical consensus that the trial was a travesty.|$|E
500|$|Richard Schickel of Time {{magazine}} praised Zorro as {{a summer}} blockbuster which paid tribute to the classical Hollywood swashbuckler films. [...] "The action in this movie, most of which {{takes the form of}} spectacular stunt work performed by real, as opposed to digitized, people," [...] Schickel stated, [...] "is motivated by simple, powerful emotions of an old-fashioned and rather melodramatic nature." [...] Zorro exceeded Roger Ebert's expectations, who was surprised by the screenplay's display of traditional film craftsmanship. [...] "It's a reminder of the time when stunts and special effects were integrated into stories, {{rather than the other way}} around." [...] Ebert later called The Mask of Zorro [...] "probably the best Zorro movie ever made." [...] Despite giving credit to Anthony Hopkins for his masculine portrayal of an older Zorro, Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, found that the actor's [...] "performance presents a slight problem: The film asks us to believe that no one has figured out that Zorro and his real-life persona are the same person, even though they are the only guys in Mexico <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> with a British accent." ...|$|E

Scott of The New York Times describes 300 as [...] "about as violent as Apocalypto and twice as stupid," [...] while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones; Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans, declaring that the Persian characters are [...] "pioneers {{in the art of}} face-piercing", but that the Spartans had access to [...] "superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities". Kenneth Turan writes in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "unless you love violence as much as a Spartan, Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy, you will not be endlessly fascinated." [...] Roger Ebert, in his review, gave the film a two-star rating, writing, [...] "300 has one-dimensional caricatures <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud." [...] Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical, such as film critic Robby Eksiel, who said that moviegoers would be dazzled by the [...] "digital action" [...] but irritated by the [...] "pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Neighbours {{was created}} in the early-to-mid-1980s by Australian TV {{executive}} Reg Watson. Watson decided to create a soap opera after working on Crossroads and seeing how successful it and Coronation Street were in Britain. He had already created such successful Australian made soap operas as The Young Doctors, Prisoner and Sons and Daughters. Watson proposed the idea of making a show that would focus on more realistic stories and portray teens and adults <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> openly to each other and solve their problems together. Watson, who worked for the Grundy production company, decided to make his show appeal to both Australia and Britain. In 2005, Darren Devlyn and Caroline Frost from the Herald Sun reported that Watson then took his idea to the Nine Network in 1982, but it was rejected. Former Network Nine chief executive Ian Johnson commented {{that it was one of}} the [...] "biggest missed opportunities" [...] in his twenty-four years at the network. He added [...] "I remember it being discussed, but I'm not exactly sure what went against it. It may have had something to do with the fact we'd picked up Sale of the Century with Tony Barber in 1980 and it was doing huge business, so we didn't have a pressing need for a five-night-a-week show." [...] Watson then took his idea to the Seven Network, who commissioned the show, following the success of his other Seven Network soap opera, Sons and Daughters. Several titles for the show were discussed, including People Like Us, One Way Street, No Through Road and Living Together until the network programmers voted on Neighbours. The first episode was broadcast on 18 March 1985 and reviews for the show were favourable. However, the Melbourne-produced programme underperformed in the Sydney market and after a meeting of the general managers, Seven decided to drop the show in October 1985. Seven's Melbourne programme boss, Gary Fenton said Sydney chief Ted Thomas told the other general managers that Seven could not afford three dramas and argued that the Sydney-based A Country Practice and Sons and Daughters be retained.|$|E
