40|$|Abstract The {{general purpose}} of this study is to look at what four {{different}} Swedish newspapers reported about the Berlin walls fall. The newspapers chosen for the study are Ny Dag, Arbetet, Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter. The method used is a qualitative method while analyzing newspaper materials. This is accomplished by using four different questions. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction?</b> What was the predicted future? How the magazines opinion is shown through their general ideological believes? Was the Berlin walls fall viewed as a threat? The general reaction was a euphoric feeling and a new time for Europe. The future talks centered on the uniting of the two Germanys and why this should or shouldn’t happen. The political messages were different in every newspaper. Svenska Dagbladet went hard against communism while Ny Dag defended it. Arbetets reporting was milder and Dagens Nyheter tried to play both sides. The newspapers did report about a threat perspective and it was about the relationship between superpowers and the impending question about immigrants from DDR. The threat perspective was lowering while a peace perspective was rising...|$|E

The {{endorsement of the}} policy happily coincided with the launch of QUT’s new eprint repository, QUT ePrints. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> of the QUT research community to the policy? Well, the sky didn’t fall in. So far, no objections to the concept or to the actual policy have been expressed. Has the policy facilitated efforts to populate QUT ePrints? In many ways, yes it has. While QUT ePrints was not immediately inundated with self-archived papers, within six months over two hundred papers have been deposited and the deposit rate is increasing steadily. Some disciplines have shown more enthusiasm, and depositing activity, than others.

This study attempts to show {{how and why the}} African states tried to isolate South Africa. This selection is done in order to portray the special role the African states played in the ostracism of South Africa from the community of nations. The objective is to analyse the strategies and the role of Africa, 2 individually and collectively, and to demonstrate {{the extent to which they}} were committed to the implementation of this isolation campaign. This study will try to give, as far as possible, a balanced perspective of the issues surrounding Africa's campaign of isolation. The present study is, therefore, a serious attempt at a study of that campaign. In this connection, attention will also be focused on questions such as: What motivated the OAU to interact in the campaign to isolate South Africa? What internal factors determined Africa's strategies, successes and failures? What role did the frontline states play in the isolation campaign? Why did Mozambique and South Africa conclude the Nkomati Agreement in 1984 ?

My aim is to create comprehensive picture of bilateral relations between Czechoslovakia and the United States before and after the signing of the Munich Agreement. Thesis focuses on the diplomatic and economic relations between Czechoslovakia and United States in the period 1936 [...] 1938 / 1939. The introductory part of the thesis is devoted to the phenomenon of isolationism and its influence in shaping the U. S. foreign policy. The main point of the analysis is the attitude of the American public to the Czechoslovak crisis and the Munich Agreement itself. The main hypothesis consists in the assertion that the United States played a major role in the Czechoslovak crisis that preceeded the signing of the Munich Agreement. I am seeking answers to these questions: How did the American public perceived the Czechoslovak crisis? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> of the U.

We were {{a group of students}} from various countries, and we met for social evenings once a week. There were discussions and mutual entertainment as well as just getting together. On one of these occasions, I asked a question relating to the literary aspect of the course: <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> in this country when Winston Churchill got the Nobel Prize in Literature? There was complete silence. The main teacher was clearly embarrassed and looked at the other teachers, but not a word was uttered. Finally, he turned to me and said: There was evidently no reaction. He looked around once more and added: I think they were glad the old chap got something. The man referred to as the old chap was about 80 years old at the time, a legend in his own lifetime, the receiver of heaps of distinctions including literary prizes. Everything {{that has to do with}} the Nobel Prize nominations, reports, discussions is subject to secrecy for 50 years. This is a blessing for us who are in charge of the Prize. The other side of the coin is that, as far as Churchill is concerned, I am now in a position to account for things that have been hidden so far. Let us see what the archives of the Academy can tell us, bearing in mind that one of the interesting aspects of the Prize is its function in cultural communication. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} researching {{the war between}} Russia and Georgia {{and how it was}} {{reflected}} in the British newspaper The Daily telegraph and in the German newspaper Die Welt. The conflict, which started in the night before the 8 th of August, when fighting erupted between Georgia and South-Ossetia, quickly escalated to a war between Russia and Georgia. About 800 people lost their lives. Over 100000 people had to leave their homes. The war created lots of problems in the relationships of different states. Questions rose, whether Russia was as harmless as it wanted to show. The relationship between the two superpowers – USA and Russia – got far colder. Considering, that the conflict received a lot of media coverage, and that public opinion was important to both parties – the author of this work allows himself to call the war between Russia and Georgia also a media war. The mass media {{plays an important role in}} developing a person´s world image. People greatly depend on the media for finding information about foreigner affairs. A person adjusts his or her opinion to be more in correspondence with the opinion given in the media. The journalist’s role writing about a conflict is rather complicated. Access to the conflict zone is a very important factor, but during war time, media is mostly put under censorship, and the access to these zones is denied. People also trust legit world leaders, if it is an urgent foreigner affair. That is why politics and the opinion of politicians are very important. Using content analysis, the author coded 134 articles from The Daily Telegraph and Die Welt online, which were published on the 8 th of August to the 14 th of August. Searching answers to the questions, where the information was received in the articles, who was more represented in the articles and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> of the world leaders to the war, the author tries to answer who´s vision of the war is portrayed more in the media. After the coding and analysis, the author found that Russia was seen more negatively then Georgia. At the same time however, the author cannot say, that one side of the conflict was more favored then the other...|$|E

40|$|Restoring lost land in Cameroon Cue: In much {{of north}} Cameroon the clay soils are very {{sensitive}} to erosion. With the pressure of increased population, fallow periods have shortened and land degradation has become severe. An estimated 30 % of land in the area is degraded, and nearly 20 % has been abandoned. So, in a joint venture, soil scientists and foresters have for some years been working with farmers to try to find ways of regenerating the lost land. And by combining tree and crop species, and using existing water harvesting methods, they appear to have developed a sustainable system that can restore productivity to these abandoned fields. Tunde Fatunde recently spoke to one of the researchers, Oscar Eyog Matig, to find out how a simple intercropping of crops and trees could bring lost land back into production. But Oscar began by explaining that their initial efforts had not been successful. IN:		?The first step was that scientists tried to use very heavy machinery. ? OUT:		?. Are needed? Yes. ? DUR?N		 6 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Oscar Eyog Matig on a research project that has been helping farmers to restore degraded farmland in north Cameroon. Transcript Matig		The first step was that scientists tried to use very heavy machines to plough the land, to allow the land to increase its water holding capacity. And after two years we discovered that the soil will come back at the initial level of degradation. Fatunde	So two years of wasted effort? Matig	Because you have a very good yield of cotton or rice the first year but later on, two or three years after the yield becomes as it was at the beginning. Fatunde	Then what was the next solution to that? Matig	The next solution was how to sustain this. To sustain it we need to continue to harvest water and secondly to provide people and the land with crops which will continue to provide products to the farmers. Fatunde	Yes and what are these? Matig	And the practice that we used was farmer practice. The way they are harvesting water in that type of land and they are digging small dams, with all of those practices which can harvest the maximum of the rainfall. The species that we planted was tree species that have available water all the time and {{because of a lack of}} amount of water we decided also to make inter-cropping. Fatunde	Inter-cropping between what kind of trees and what kind of crops? Matig		As the water was in a very huge quantity we decided to use rice. Fatunde	Rice. Matig	And for the trees, we used two types of trees. The first one is what we call Acacia senegal, which is producing Gum Arabic. Fatunde	So Acacia senegal means Gum Arabic trees? Matig	Yes and the second was a fruit tree, local fruit trees which is called a marula but the scientific name is Sclerocarya birrea Fatunde	Two trees? Matig		Two trees. Fatunde	Now how did you marriage, through inter-cropping, these two trees and rice? Matig	You have the rice in the middle because the trees are planted 4 metres by 4 metres and in between you have the rice. Fatunde	What purpose do the trees serve? Matig	With this system we have three advantages. The first is that we have almost lost 20 % of the farmland in the region which we have now recovered. The second benefit is that we have planted a crop. Even if you are planting it only the two first years they can use it as additional, add value. Now for the third benefit, is the trees. You have Gum Arabic which is well known in the world, used to produce this chewing gum, used to produce coca cola. And you have also Sclerocarya birrea which is a fruit, a local fruit tree. Those ones will continue providing a product for the farmers. Fatunde	While at the same time rice production is going on seasonally? Matig		Yes. Fatunde	After two years or three years of this experimentation <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> of the farmers who were working on a pilot project? Matig	The farmers were very surprised because for them this land was lost completely and they have noticed that we have regenerated the land. So for them it?s a very? even if it was the only success of the project it was enough. Fatunde	But that was not the only success of the project? Matig	But it was not the only success, they were producing crop as inter-cropping and it was another success for them because they were involved, it was they who were planting those crops and harvesting it. Fatunde	Did they also go ahead to multiply, reproduce this experiment on their own farms? Matig	Yes. Let me tell you one thing which is a major concern for the farmer to implement the same system by his own. There is a problem of land tenure. Whenever you have to plant a tree you should be the owner of the land. It is only those who are owners and mainly the chief who are able to implement the same system. Fatunde	Were they also able to have enough money to also build wells and so on? Matig	Yes because as I told you the system we use was learned from the farmers. Even the well or the small dams they are doing it themselves for other purpose. They are doing it for what we call a very specific variety of sorghum, we call muskwari. We are doing it already. Fatunde	Oh, they were doing it. What you people did was to do inter-cropping now? Matig	Now it?s only awareness, to tell them that what you are doing with the sorghum you can sustain it by putting very very important species and permanent species which can provide them incomes. When an Acacia senegal is well managed you have the Gum Arabic forever. Fatunde	I see. Now going back to the farmers, since you?ve visited some of them, how did you evaluate the progress you saw from what they learnt from your pilot project? Matig	The progress in the farmer when you have a new technology is very slow because the farmer was very happy to implement it as soon as possible. As I have told you they have the land constraints but this can be solved because it?s a problem of meeting local authorities and also it?s at policy level. So this can be solved. Technically what we found was that few farmers have started planting their own trees within the farmland. So when they started planting trees within the sorghum land it was an improvement. What we noticed was a very big demand of tree seedlings by farmers. Fatunde	So how do you see the future of this inter-cropping system you have introduced among the farmers in northern Cameroon? What is your own evaluation based on what you saw in the ground? Matig	What I saw on the ground is that this technology can quickly take off but they need some assistance, a policy support by the government and technical support by the scientists in the region. Fatunde	Are needed? Matig	Yes. End of track. Researcher Oscar Eyog Matig explains how intercropping of trees and cereal crops, combined with water harvesting, has restored degraded land in north Cameroon...|$|E

The last part focuses on the initiation of education in children with accelerated cognitive development, school maturity and readiness and the possibility of acceleration in education. <b>The</b> practical part <b>is</b> dedicated to qualitative research ivolving parents of six children who started school attendance early and at <b>the</b> same time <b>were</b> intellectually accelerated. Later talent in <b>the</b> intellecutal area <b>was</b> diagnosed in all children based on repeated examination in Pedagogical Psychological Counseling Office...|$|R
40|$|The Superfast Spreading Crust campaign, echoing long-standing ocean {{lithosphere}} community endeavors, {{was designed}} {{to help us understand}} the formation, architecture, and evolution of ocean crust formed at fast spreading rates. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 335, "Superfast Spreading Rate Crust 4 " (13 April- 3 June 2011), <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fourth scientific drilling cruise of the Superfast Spreading Crust campaign to Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 1256 D. The expedition aimed to deepen this basement reference site several hundred meters into the gabbroic rocks of intact lower oceanic crust to address the following fundamental scientific questions: Does the lower crust form by subsidence of a crystal mush from a high-level magma chamber (gabbro glacier), by intrusion of sills throughout the lower crust, or by some other mechanism? How does melt percolate through the lower crust, and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reactions</b> and chemical evolution of magmas during migration? Is the plutonic crust cooled by conduction or hydrothermal circulation? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> role and extent of deeply penetrating seawater-derived hydrothermal fluids in cooling the lower crust and the chemical exchanges between the ocean crust and <b>the</b> oceans? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> relationships among the geological, geochemical, and geophysical structure of the crust and, in particular, the nature of the seismic Layer 2 - 3 transition? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> magnetic contribution of the lower crust to marine magnetic anomalies...|$|R
