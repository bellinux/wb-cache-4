500|$|In February 1971, after a one off {{performance}} at the Myponga Pop Festival in Australia, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of Paranoid, the band were afforded more studio time, along with a [...] "briefcase full of cash" [...] to buy drugs. [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> coke, big time", Ward explained. [...] "Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like.

Two days later Yavuz Sultan Selim headed south to the Dardanelles to bombard Allied troops at Gallipoli, accompanied by the pre-dreadnought battleship [...] They were spotted at dawn from a kite balloon as they <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> position. When the first [...] round from the dreadnought [...] landed close by, Yavuz moved out of firing position, close to the cliffs, where Queen Elizabeth could not engage her. On 30 April Yavuz tried again, but was spotted from the pre-dreadnought [...] which had moved into the Dardanelles to bombard the Turkish headquarters at Çanakkale. The British ship only managed to fire five rounds before Yavuz moved out of her line of sight.|$|E

500|$|Shakur also {{attacked}} {{many other}} people associated with Bad Boy Records and with Biggie, such as Lil' Kim and Junior M.A.F.I.A. He exclaimed that their lifestyle and what they rapped about were fraudulent, {{and that they were}} not from the streets. He believed that they were only perpetuating the drama and did not understand the situation they <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into.</b> Bronx rapper Chino XL was also insulted for vulgar comments he made about Shakur on his song [...] "Riiiot!". In the original recording, Shakur also insulted Jay Z at the ending segment, but removed it after being convinced by Outlawz members that Carter {{had nothing to do with}} the conflict between Death Row and Bad Boy. After Jay Z's debut album (which featured Biggie on [...] "Brooklyn's Finest") was subsequently released after [...] "Hit 'Em up", Shakur included Jay Z amongst the many other East Coast rappers to be insulted in his [...]|$|E

[...] We both dove for him the moment Staubach threw. [...] I think I got {{a hand on the}} ball. [...] We had to play him tough. [...] Goddamn it was the whole season on one play.

2500|$|The Matabele (Ndebele) king Lobengula {{planned a}} {{surprise}} attack at night. The British {{set up camp}} at the [...] Shangani river, forming into a circular defensive laager on the model pioneered by the Boers. Lobengula's generals Manonda and Mjaan launched the attack with 5-6,000 warriors. However, the British sentries soon alerted the soldiers. According to trooper Jack Carruthers the attack came at 2:15a.m., [...] "a peaceful night, clear sky but on the dark side. The bugles gave the alarm, the camp was all excitement in a moment, all noise {{with the opening of}} ammunition boxes and shouting of officers, the men <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> their places... the scouts had hardly time to save themselves. The outer sentries also had narrow escapes getting back into laager." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, former {{president}} of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili published an article in The Guardian where he wrote that for months prior to August 2008, [...] "unidentified troops" [...] "grabbed more and more control over Georgia's separatist regions, and <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> {{a growing number of}} shooting matches with local law enforcement." [...] According to him, Russian tank columns started to move into Georgia to the point when, on 7 August 2008, the Georgian armed forces were compelled to respond. Saakashvili claimed that if Georgia had not responded, Russian special forces could have easily reached Tbilisi within 24 hours. He claimed that he [...] "couldn't afford to wait." [...] By military response he managed [...] "to gain time, raise the stakes, and ultimately save ... statehood and democracy." [...] He pointed out if the west had reacted [...] "properly" [...] to the war in Georgia, [...] "Ukraine would never have happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{have often}} been {{compared}} to Sonic Youth, and they were once described as [...] "The Sonic Youth of the Southern Hemisphere", with Trouser Press describing their early sound as [...] "hard, droning, unforgiving guitar music with occasional lapses into verse/chorus regularity". By Tanker their sound had become more conventional. With their relocation to New York, their sound also shifted, with the band's next releases described as [...] "an unholy collision between The Beatles harmonies and The Velvet Underground dissonance", with Parker stating {{at the time that}} the band <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> [...] "the harmonic value of distortion; we started to be very particular about where we set the instruments up and the angles the sounds were bouncing at. From these harmonic experiments I became more interested in the actual melodic content of the music". Pitchfork Media described them in 1999 as [...] "a huge mess of sound that's simultaneously beautiful, jagged, atonal, and supremely melodic", while another review in the same year described their sound as [...] "one part Superchunk, one part Pixies, and one part Dinosaur Jr." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{dramatic}} {{failure of the}} first United States attempt to launch a satellite on December 6, 1957, Sides spoke at a conference of the American Management Association on January 15, 1958, where he reiterated that the nation's development of long-range missiles was [...] "progressing very well" [...] and complained that a false impression had been created by missiles that failed in early tests. [...] "It just so happened that {{about the time of}} the sputnik launchings, our intermediate and intercontinental ballistics missile flight-test programs <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> high gear; and not being blessed with a Siberian proving ground, where we might do our testing in private, every malfunctioning test vehicle was given a play in all the media of public information. The impression was unwittingly created that we were really on our uppers, when, as a matter of fact, each one of these so-called unsuccessful missiles yielded {{a great deal of the}} very information it was fired to obtain. In ten years of missile experience I cannot recall a missile system in which similar casualties were not encountered in the early test flights. But in each case we have determined the causes, corrected the deficiencies and gone on to develop a successful weapon system." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{year after}} their wedding, Sonya and Toadie's {{marriage}} came under strain. Toadie accused Sonya of neglecting their relationship, {{when she began}} to get involved in their friends' problems. Morey said, [...] "Sonya and Toadie have been together for five years and, unfortunately, little things are starting to niggle - which doesn't mean they're over, or anything like that, but it's definitely causing a few issues for them." [...] Morey explained that life had slowed down for Sonya and Toadie and they <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> [...] "the nitty gritty" [...] of their marriage, which was challenging for them both. Things became worse for Sonya and Toadie when Jacob Holmes (Clayton Watson) kissed Sonya. Morey told Kirsty Nutkins from the Daily Express, [...] "The kiss with Jacob was the first big crack in their relationship. Even though Sonya didn't have feelings for him, it hurt Toadie a lot." [...] The actress said it was uncomfortable to play out the scenes involving her character's marital problems. She also found it frustrating, as she knew Sonya in particular was not learning from her mistakes. Morey thought Sonya and Toadie could benefit from better communication, and from Sonya telling people to seek help from other sources, like a counsellor. She also thought Toadie could help his wife out more often, especially if the person she was helping was his friend too.|$|E
