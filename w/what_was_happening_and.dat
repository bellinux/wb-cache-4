5|$|Murray {{grew up in}} Dunblane and {{attended}} Dunblane Primary School. He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says {{he was too young}} to understand <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>and</b> is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E
5|$|Marshal Zhukov {{was rewarded}} for his support with full {{membership}} in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October, the defense minister was sent {{on a tour of}} the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> <b>and</b> hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the Gosbank) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.|$|E
5|$|Reports were {{received}} in January 1849 that some Aboriginal {{people had been}} killed near Guichen Bay. On 19 February, the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse arrived in the district to investigate. He began his inquiries, assisted by a mounted policeman, an interpreter, and an Aboriginal guide. An Aboriginal witness, Leandermin, took Moorhouse {{to the site of}} the alleged crime. He told Moorhouse that he and a white man named Parker were walking along a road when they heard shots. He went to see <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> <b>and</b> from behind some trees, saw four or five Aboriginal women lying on the ground with fresh wounds. He also saw others on the ground, who he presumed were dead because they were not moving. Two white men were present, Leandermin identified Brown as one of them, and stated that Brown had a gun in his hand.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April 1940, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Norway {{as a part}} of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did not get any notification of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> <b>and</b> only music was played on the radio. Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the Oslo Cathedral School, only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and Karl Johans gate, where he witnessed the Germans marching through. The next (or possibly the same) day, a German Junkers plane crashed near him and his friend when they were on their way from Lysaker to get a closer view of the captured Fornebu Airport. He briefly found himself in the situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but the heat was unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded. The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint Vidkun Quisling as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems-Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected if he had not been through recruit training, and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for Northern Norway. They came as far north as Nord-Trøndelag, where they however gave up and returned home.|$|E
5|$|The 32nd Infantry Regiment in Dupont's {{division}} marched from Haslach towards Ulm and {{ran into}} four Austrian regiments holding Boefingen. The 32nd carried out several ferocious attacks, but the Austrians held firm and repulsed every one. The Austrians flooded the battle with more cavalry and infantry regiments to Ulm-Jungingen hoping to score a knockout blow against Ney's corps by enveloping Dupont's force. Dupont sensed <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>and</b> preempted the Austrians by launching a surprise attack on Jungingen, during which he took as prisoner at least 1,000 of the Austrians. Renewed Austrian attacks drove these forces back to Haslach, which the French managed to hold. Dupont was eventually forced {{to fall back on}} Albeck, where he joined Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers's foot dragoons division. The effects of the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on Napoleon's plans are not fully clear, but the Emperor may have finally ascertained {{that the majority of the}} Austrian army was concentrated at Ulm. Accordingly, Napoleon sent the corps of Soult and Marmont towards the Iller, meaning he now had four infantry and one cavalry corps to deal with Mack; Davout, Bernadotte, and the Bavarians were still guarding the region around Munich. Napoleon did not intend to fight a battle across rivers and ordered his marshals to capture the important bridges around Ulm. He also began shifting his forces to the north of Ulm because he expected a battle in that region rather than an encirclement of the city itself. These dispositions and actions would lead to a confrontation at Elchingen on the 14th as Ney's forces advanced on Albeck.|$|E

25|$|Captain André Léon Jean Marie Morazzani, {{the senior}} officer aboard Tempête, ordered the British ships to {{intercept}} the intruders while {{he led the}} older and slower French destroyers southeast.

Lookouts commander, Derick Hetherington, advised Meteor via TBS (Talk Between Ships) <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>and</b> the British ships went on separate courses northeast at full speed.

25|$|Concurrently {{with the}} siege in 749, the Abbasids crossed the Euphrates and took Kufa. The son of Khalid al-Qasri – a disgraced Umayyad {{official}} {{who had been}} tortured to death a few years prior – began a pro-Abbasid riot starting at the city's citadel. On September 2, 749, al-Hasan bin Qahtaba essentially just walked right in {{to the city and}} set up shop. Some confusion followed when Abu Salama, an Abbasid officer, pushed for an Alid leader. Abu Muslim's confidante Abu Jahm reported <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> <b>and</b> the Abbasids acted preemptively. On Friday, November 28, 749, before the siege of Wasit had even finished, As-Saffah, the great-grandson of Muhammad's uncle, al-Abbas, was recognized as the new caliph in the mosque at Kufa. Abu Salama, who witnessed twelve military commanders from the revolution pledging allegiance, was embarrassed into following suit.|$|E
25|$|During the descent, Captain Cronin ordered Flight Engineer Thomas to {{tell the}} flight attendants to prepare for an {{emergency}} landing, but Thomas was unable to contact them through the intercom.

Thomas saw severe damage immediately upon leaving the cockpit; the aircraft's skin was peeled off in some areas on the upper deck, revealing the frames and stringers.

Thomas returned to the cockpit and reported that a large section of fuselage was open aft of the Number 1 exit door.

Two hours after the hijacking began, the hijackers asked the captain to depart for Paris so the hijackers could hold a press conference there. The captain could not take off as the aircraft boarding stairs were still attached to the A300 and the Algerian authorities blocked the runway with parked vehicles. When the captain, forced by the hijackers, asked for the removal of the boarding stairs, the Algerian authorities, determined not to give in to any of the hijacker demands, refused. The hijackers announced that they would detonate the aircraft unless the Algerian authorities gave in to the demands.|$|E
