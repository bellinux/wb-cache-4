Starches have shown varied-shaped granules with monomodal distribution, and B-type crystallinity. Variations in amylose contents found by three analyses were hypothesized being related to intermediate material.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the effect of photoperiod on the duration from vine (shoot) emergence to flowering in <b>white</b> or Guinea <b>yam</b> (Dioscorea rotundata). The duration from vine emergence to flowering in two clonal varieties of yam (TDr 131 and TDr 99 - 9) was recorded at 10 different sowing dates/locations in Nigeria. Durations to flowering varied from 40 to > 88 days. Mean daily temperature and photoperiod between vine emergence and flowering varied from 25 to 27 degrees C and 13. 1 to 13. 4 h day(- 1), respectively. Both clones had similar responses to temperature, with base and optimum temperatures of 12 and 25 - 27 degrees C, respectively. Thermal durations to flowering were strongly related (r(2) > 0. 75 - 0. 83) to absolute photoperiod (h) at vine emergence as well as to rate of change of photoperiod (s day(- 1)) at vine emergence. The response to absolute photoperiod suggests that <b>white</b> <b>yams</b> are quantitative LDPs, flowering sooner in long than short days. Yams also flowered earlier when the rate of change of photoperiod was positive but small, or was negative. It is suggested that yams may use a combination of photoperiod and rate of change in order to fine tune flowering time. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Before the {{prolonged}} {{civil war in}} Sudan and drought in Ethiopia, farmers in those countries were planting <b>white</b> <b>yams</b> (Dioscorea rotundata). But now yam has almost completely disappeared from these countries because the planting portion of the crop {{also happens to be}} the edible portion. Farmers expect to set aside at least one quarter of their annual harvest for replanting but whenever farmers, for one reason or another, consume all the yams they have, the crop's genetic base is eroded. This is what has happened in Sudan, Ethiopia and other crisis-ridden African countries where yam culture flourished in the past. It is almost impossible to recreate yam germplasm because the crop responds poorly to conventional plant breeding techniques. Unlike some other crops, where the male and female flowers are on the same plant, yam flowers are borne on separate plants and the flowering of male and female plants is difficult to synchronize. Also, flower thrips, the insects that pollinate most yam flowers, are not very efficient which results in the abortion of many female yam flowers. However, scientists at the International Institute of, Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan have achieved a break- through in yam, breeding based on the Institute's large germplasm collection of new yam genotypes with better flowering qualities, which can be manipulated by breeders to generate new varieties. With the development of the new genotypes of yams through seed, new materials are being made available by IITA both in seed and tissue culture form. Requests have already been received from Rwanda, Guinea, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Kenya and Equatorial Guinea. Sudan Uganda and Malawi have also shown interest and it is hoped that in the near future yam culture will expand to cover the rest of the African continent, particularly East and central Africa.

50|$|Yam {{is grown}} on free draining, sandy and fertile soil, after {{clearing}} the first fallow. Land is prepared {{in the form}} of mound or ridge or heap of 1 m height. The yams recommended for such soil conditions in Nigeria are <b>white</b> <b>yam</b> or white guinea yam (Discorea rotundata) and water yam or yellow yam (Discorea alata). Planting is done by seed yam or cut setts from ware tubers. One day before planting, the tubers have to be subjected to treatment with wood ash or a fungicide (thiabendazole) to prevent damage to the soils. The setts are planted at an interval of 15 - 20 cm with the cut face facing up. Mulching is essential during October-November with dry grass or plant debris weighed down with balls of mud. Dosage of fertilizer application, as essential, is decided after chemical analysis of the soil samples. Manual weeding by hoeing is done three or four times depending on the rate of weed growth. Two Stakes, each of 2 m height are used for staking the plants to vine over it; one for two plants with the other used for bracing with the adjacent stakes. Sorghum stovers are also used for this purpose in the savannah land. Pest and disease control is addressed by cultural control and chemical methods; the pests which affect the plant are nematodes such as root knot Meloidogyne spp. and yam nematode (Scutellonema bradys), and insects such as yam shoot beetle, yam tuber beetle and crickets. Weeding of the field is essential and maintaining a 2 - 3 m weed free border around the field is to be ensured. Disease resistant cultivars are normally recommended for use. Harvesting is done before the vines become dry and soil becomes dry and hard. Generally, a yield of 10-15 tonnes per ha for <b>white</b> <b>yam</b> and 16-25 tonnes for water yam are obtained by following prescribed management practices. The harvested yams are stored by tying them with ropes. They have a shelf life of about 5 months. Warehouses where they are stored should be made rodent proof with a metal base and wire netting. Rotten buds and sprouted buds should be removed.|$|E

Study Design: Evaluation of the effects of peeling, blanching and sodium metabisulphite pretreatments on the ease of drying, particle size distribution, colour and pH of yam bean flour using a 2 x 3 factorial design. Place and Duration of Study: Yam bean roots were obtained from the CSIR-Crops Research Institute, Kumasi, Ghana. All reagents used were obtained from accredited suppliers in Accra, Ghana. Actual experimental studies were conducted at the laboratories of the CSIR-Food Research Institute, Accra, Ghana, between August 2012 and November 2013. Methodology. We subjected peeled and unpeeled yam bean tubers (Pachyrhizus erosus) to three pretreatments involving blanching at 100 C for 3 min; soaking in 0. 1 % sodium metabisulphite solution for 3 min and no treatment control. Samples were dried at 55 C for 6 hours, cooled to room temperature, milled, sieved and the flour analyzed for ease of drying as indicated by the final moisture content, colour, pH, and ease of milling as indicated by particle size distribution. Results: The pretreatment methods had significant (p> 0. 05) effects on the colour of the flour samples. Peeling, followed by sodium metabisulphite pretreatment produced <b>whitest</b> <b>yam</b> bean flour (L-value of 90. 89). Flour samples from unpeeled roots recorded lower pH (p> 0. 05) than those from peeled samples.

40|$|Open Access Journal; Published online: 19 Sept 2017 Background Root and tuber {{crops are}} a major food source in {{tropical}} Africa. Among these crops are several species in the monocotyledonous genus Dioscorea collectively known as yam, a staple tuber crop that contributes enormously to the subsistence and socio-cultural lives of millions of people, principally in West and Central Africa. Yam cultivation is constrained by several factors, and yam {{can be considered a}} neglected “orphan” crop that would benefit from crop improvement efforts. However, the lack of genetic and genomic tools has impeded the improvement of this staple crop. Results To accelerate marker-assisted breeding of yam, we performed genome analysis of <b>white</b> Guinea <b>yam</b> (Dioscorea rotundata) and assembled a 594 -Mb genome, 76. 4 % of which was distributed among 21 linkage groups. In total, we predicted 26, 198 genes. Phylogenetic analyses with 2381 conserved genes revealed that Dioscorea is a unique lineage of monocotyledons distinct from the Poales (rice), Arecales (palm), and Zingiberales (banana). The entire Dioscorea genus is characterized by the occurrence of separate male and female plants (dioecy), a feature that has limited efficient yam breeding. To infer the genetics of sex determination, we performed whole-genome resequencing of bulked segregants (quantitative trait locus sequencing [QTL-seq]) in F 1 progeny segregating for male and female plants and identified a genomic region associated with female heterogametic (male[*]=[*]ZZ, female[*]=[*]ZW) sex determination. We further delineated the W locus and used it to develop a molecular marker for sex identification of Guinea yam plants at the seedling stage. Conclusions Guinea yam belongs to a unique and highly differentiated clade of monocotyledons. The genome analyses and sex-linked marker development performed in this study should greatly accelerate marker-assisted breeding of Guinea yam. In addition, our QTL-seq approach can be utilized in genetic studies of other outcrossing crops and organisms with highly heterozygous genomes. Genomic analysis of orphan crops such as yam promotes efforts to improve food security and the sustainability of tropical agriculture.

40|$|Scarcity of seed, pest and {{diseases}} are major constraints to yam production. Tissue culture techniques of meristem culture combined with heat therapy {{have been used}} to produce high-yielding virus-tested plantlets of root crops, which are later multiplied through micropropagation. However, the micropropagation rate is low in yam. We investigated in vitro, the rate of production of new nodes at some Plant growth regulator regimes applied at specific growth phases of yam. Three concentrations each of uniconazole-p (UP), gibberellic, jasmonic (JA) and naphthalene acetic (NAA) acids were applied at single node and primary nodal complex (PNC) formation phases in a split-plot design using two genotypes each of <b>white</b> and water <b>yams.</b> Number of nodes per plantlet was recorded after 16 weeks. The number of new nodes varied significantly with genotype by growth phase interaction and the main effect of PGRs. After 16 weeks, the control, 1. 7 µM UP and 0. 03 µM JA had highest means of 7, 9 and 8 nodes per plantlet compared to 2 - 3 nodes in the GA treatments. Thus, 4, 900, 8, 100 and 6, 400 plantlets can be obtained in I year from a 100 -node plant. In D. alata genotypes, addition of PGRs at PNC doubled the number of nodes per plantlet relative to addition at single node stage, while the effect of stage varied with genotype in D. rotundata. There is an important role for GA and its inhibitor-UP on the rate of yam micropropagation. Optimum multiplication rates can be achieved if the right PGR is applied at a standardized growth phase of a particular genotype. Earliness of genotypes seems to be a major factor that will determine the timing of application of PGRs. Peer Revie...|$|R
