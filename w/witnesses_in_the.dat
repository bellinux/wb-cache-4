5|$|One of Gheorghe Tătărescu's last {{appearances}} in public was his stand {{as one of}} the prosecution's <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1954 trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, when he claimed that the defendant had been infiltrated into the PCR during the time when he had been premier (Pătrășcanu was posthumously cleared of all charges). Released in 1955, Tătărescu died in Bucharest, less than two years later. According to Sanda Tătărescu Negropontes, this came as a result of tuberculosis contracted while in detention.|$|E
5|$|The four {{civilians were}} tried on December 13. The {{principal}} prosecution witness, a servant {{of one of}} the accused, made claims that were easily rebutted by defense <b>witnesses.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> face of this weak testimony, as well as waning public interest, the prosecution allegedly failed to press its case very hard. The civilians were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and banished from the province.|$|E

5|$|After all the {{interviews}} concluded, {{the group of}} 208 men were convicted in summary courts-martial of disobeying orders, Article 4 of the Articles for the Government of the United States Navy (Rocks and Shoals). Each man was subject to forfeiture of three months' pay. A few of them were held as <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upcoming mutiny trial. The rest were split into smaller groups and shipped out to various places in the Pacific Theater. Carl Tuggle, one of the 208, said in 1998 {{that a group of}} prisoners including himself were assigned menial tasks such as cleaning latrines and picking up cigarette butts at a series of Pacific islands. After returning from active duty they each received bad conduct discharges, which meant the loss of virtually all veterans' benefits.|$|E
5|$|General Robert C. Oaks, USAF, Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe, {{immediately}} appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 {{accident investigation}} board composed of a board president, 11 board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and 13 technical advisers. The board president was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and the testimony of <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> investigation can be used against them in military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate safety investigation, in which the results are not publicly released and witness testimony is immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a safety investigation.|$|E
5|$|In Kępno, Mestwin II {{probably}} {{expected the}} arrival of the Duke of Greater Poland. Here, on 15 February 1282, a treaty was concluded between Przemysł II and Mestwin II, which secured the future unification of Gdańsk Pomerania and Greater Poland. <b>Witnesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> signed document, among others, were Pomeranian Voivode Waysil, Poznań voivode Beniamin, Gniezno voivode Arkembold, Poznań judge Mikołaj, Kalisz judge Andrzej, and the Dominican monk Piotr (later Prince-Bishop of Cammin from 1296–1298), who was possibly responsible for writing the text.

5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the songs}} on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. The group {{returned}} to EMI Studios (now known as Abbey Road Studios) in May to commence recording sessions that lasted through to October. During these sessions, arguments broke out among the Beatles, and <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio saw band members quarrel over creative differences. Another divisive element was the constant presence of John Lennon's new partner, Yoko Ono, whose attendance at the sessions broke with the Beatles' policy regarding wives and girlfriends. After a series of problems, including producer George Martin taking a sudden leave of absence and engineer Geoff Emerick quitting, Ringo Starr left the band briefly in August. The same tensions continued throughout the following year, leading to the eventual break-up of the Beatles in April 1970.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E

40|$|We {{apply the}} {{generalised}} concept of witness operators to arbitrary convex sets, and review {{the criteria for}} the optimisation of these general witnesses. We then define an embedding of state vectors and operators into a higher-dimensional Hilbert space.

Using this relation we arrive at a conceptually simple method {{for the construction of}} Schmidt number <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> bipartite systems...|$|R
5|$|Although the Dirty War {{ended in}} the eighties, Kirchner {{considered}} it an unresolved issue. In his inaugural speech, he supported human rights organizations which sought the incarceration of the military connected with the National Reorganization Process. He also ordered the top military leadership to retire. Kirchner sent a bill to the Congress to annul the full stop law and the Law of Due Obedience, which had halted trials of the military for crimes related to the Dirty War. The laws had been repealed in 1998, but that repeal had little legal significance, as only an annulment would reopen the cases. Although this initiative was opposed by Duhalde and Scioli, most legislators considered it a symbolic gesture since the laws' constitutionality would {{be decided by the}} Supreme Court. Both laws were annulled by the Congress in August 2003, and many cases were reopened as a result. The Supreme Court declared the laws, and Menem's presidential pardons, unconstitutional in 2005. Jorge Julio López, witness in a trial of police officer Miguel Etchecolatz, disappeared in 2006. This caused a national scandal, as it was suspected that he was disappeared to intimidate other <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upcoming trials, and the government was unable to locate him.|$|E
5|$|The trial resumed on March 4, 2013 with testimonies from expert <b>witnesses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{fields of}} {{criminal}} psychology (Tereza Soukupová, {{appointed by the}} court) and psychiatry (Alena Gayová, appointed by the defense). Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person, even though the presiding judge {{had told him that}} at this point they may be undertaken in his absence. The two expert witnesses agreed that Blythe is not aggressive; nevertheless, he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress. The court further heard testimonies from two eyewitnesses. One of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall. He testified that when by the exit, he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air. He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage. The ambulance arrived 5–10 minutes later.|$|E
