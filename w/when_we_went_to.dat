A case of measles broke out very shortly and we were quarantined, and {{the only time we}} got out of the college was <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the skating rink to play hockey; and that was a great relief." [...] – Admiral Murray.|$|E
500|$|The full album {{versions}} continued, {{as well as}} a localized {{rendition of}} [...] "Wrecking Ball", at Springsteen's four shows to close out the Philadelphia Spectrum as well; some 43 different songs were playing during the stand. [...] Apart from the album playings, Springsteen kept setlists flexible during the third leg; sign requests continued, as in Springsteen's words they allowed [...] "the fans to have input into the show in a way that just pumps the blood into everything and enlivens the evening." [...] Born to Run remained the standard full album choice {{for the rest of the}} tour, but the two shows at New York's Madison Square Garden saw The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle and The River, with the latter's 20-song length dominating the setlist. [...] Springsteen felt The River show succeeded, saying [...] "I sequenced [...] to feel like a live show, so you have four fast songs and a couple of ballads. It played real well <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> play it." ...|$|E
500|$|Around this period, the Ravens {{decided on}} a new, {{permanent}} name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In Jon Savage's analysis, they [...] "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage." [...] Manager Robert Wace related {{his side of the}} story: [...] "I had a friend... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity... <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> [...] with the name, they were... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky! Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's—he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their [...] "kinky" [...] fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, [...] "The way you look, and the clothes you wear, you ought to be called the Kinks." [...] "I've never really liked the name", Ray stated.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{the three}} merchants sing {{has had a}} lyrics change. The lyric [...] "We never, never fail <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> make a sale, we simply cheat a little if we must" [...] was changed to [...] "We never, never fail <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> make a sale, we work a little harder if we must." [...] The reason for these edits is not known; but it {{may have to do}} with the merchants being [...] "Jewish" [...] stereotypes.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's queer {{that crowd}} should be here, after what {{happened}} in Butte," [...] he said. [...] "I'll ask Dick Logan about 'em, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's that whisky," [...] said Ethelbertha. [...] "You {{never touch}} it except <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Harris's. You know you can't stand it; {{you have not}} a strong head." ...|$|R
2500|$|Eight of {{the eleven}} tracks on Prayers on Fire were written or co-written by Cave, [...] " [...] {{was a kind of}} {{reaction}} to the major disappointments we felt <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> England... began to see a vision and I don't think we were positively influenced ... we didn't want to be like the English New Wave pop groups of the time". Pew observed [...] " [...] stinks, quite honestly ... The engineer slept through the entire session for a start". In Melbourne, in December 1980 and January 1981, they joined engineer and producer, Tony Cohen, in Armstrong's Audio Visual Studios (A.A.V. Studio 2) and Richmond Recorders, to record their tracks. Music journalist, Toby Creswell, noted that the band [...] "struggled with creating their own identity some of them also began indulging an appetite for alcohol and heroin". Cave was embarrassed by [...] "Zoo Music Girl" [...] but noted [...] "we were digging for something and we kind of just found it with some songs" [...] and cited [...] "King Ink" [...] as an example of [...] "a certain kind of sound that we wanted to work with on records after that".|$|E

6000|$|... "Just as <b>we</b> do <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> heaven," [...] I suggested; {{the banker}} did not answer, and I {{instantly}} felt {{that in the}} presence of the minister my remark was out of taste.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church," [...] she said, [...] "he always walks {{ahead of}} the rest of us. I don't {{understand}} why he likes to do so, but this is one of his habits." ...|$|R
