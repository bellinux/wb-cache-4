40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of the SmartBadge; an electronic replacement for the standard paper name badge worn at conferences and similar events. Both hardware and software have been designed for the SmartBadge; the hardware has been developed around a CC 1010 microcontroller and RF transceiver. Attached to this are an infrared transceiver, an LCD display, some LEDs, buttons and a piezoelectric buzzer. There is also an antenna for the RF transceiver whose design is the result of SuperNEC [1] simulations. Protocol software development has focussed on the communication between a SmartBadge and other badges and base stations, yet there is still space available in the CC 1010 <b>s</b> <b>flash</b> memory to develop applications beyond the business card exchange example developed to demonstrate the communication software. The SmartBadge communicates with other badges by using the infrared transceiver. In the business card application a SmartBadge is worn by a person and is collecting the ID and a time counter from SmartBadges worn by other facing people as this person mingles through a conference or similar event. This data is then collected in real time using the RF transceiver to communicate with base stations which would be scattered around the venue. The RF network has been designed as a single hop network and a new Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol has been designed to allow the SmartBadges to share the links to the base stations while conserving as much energy as possible. This protocol is called Uplink MAC (or U-MAC) and is described in section 6. 2. i i...|$|R
40|$|Video {{fluorescence}} microscopy {{was used to}} study adsorption and fusion of unilamellar phospholipid vesicles to solvent-free planar bilayer membranes. Large unilamellar vesicles (2 - 10 microns diam) were loaded with 200 mM of the membrane-impermeant fluorescent dye calcein. Vesicles were ejected from a pipette brought to within 10 microns of the planar membrane, thereby minimizing background fluorescence and diffusion times through the unstirred layer. Vesicle binding to the planar membrane reached a maximum at 20 mM calcium. The vesicles fused when they were osmotically swollen by dissipating a KCl gradient across the vesicular membrane with the channel-forming antibiotic nystatin or, alternatively, by making the cis compartment hyperosmotic. Osmotically induced ruptures appeared as bright flashes of light that lasted several video fields (each 1 / 60 <b>s).</b> <b>Flashes</b> of light, and therefore swelling, occurred only when channels {{were present in the}} vesicular membrane. The flashes were observed when nystatin was added to the cis compartment but not when added to the trans. This demonstrates that the vesicular and planar membranes remain individual bilayers in the region of contact, rather than melding into a single bilayer. Measurements of flash duration in the presence of cobalt (a quencher of calcein fluorescence) were used to determine the side of the planar membrane to which dye was released. In the presence of 20 mM calcium, 50 % of the vesicle ruptures were found to result in fusion with the planar membrane. In 100 mM calcium, nearly 70 % of the vesicle ruptures resulted in fusion. The methods of this study can be used to increase significantly the efficiency of reconstitution of channels into planar membranes by fusion techniques...|$|R
40|$|The strong {{degeneracy}} of the 12 C ignition {{layer on}} an accreting neutron star {{results in a}} hydrodynamic thermonuclear runaway, in which the nuclear heating time becomes shorter than the local dynamical time. We model the resulting combustion wave during these superbursts as an upward propagating detonation. We solve the reactive fluid flow and show that the detonation propagates through the deepest layers of fuel and drives a shock wave that steepens as it travels upward into lower density material. The shock is sufficiently strong upon reaching the freshly accreted H/He layer that it triggers unstable 4 He burning if the superburst occurs during {{the latter half of}} the regular Type I bursting cycle; this is likely the origin of the bright Type I precursor bursts observed at the onset of superbursts. The cooling of the outermost shock-heated layers produces a bright, ~ 0. 1 <b>s,</b> <b>flash</b> that precedes the Type I burst by a few seconds; this may be the origin of the spike seen at the burst onset in 4 U 1820 - 30 and 4 U 1636 - 54, the only two bursts observed with RXTE at high time resolution. The dominant products of the 12 C detonation are 28 Si, 32 S, and 36 Ar.

40|$|The {{energy storage}} of {{photosynthesis}} {{in the green}} alga Chlorella vulgaris was determined by pulsed, time-resolved photoacoustics. The energy storage of the linear electron transfer process in photosynthesis, of cyclic photosystem (PS) I, and possibly of PSII was determined by selection of excitation wavelength and of flash interval. At 695 nm excitation, a rather large cyclic PSI energy storage of 0. 68 ± 0. 04 eV/quantum of energy at 8 ms after a 1 -μs flash was obtained. This energy remained the same at flash intervals of 0. 35 to 60 s and was independent {{of the presence of}} 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea. We tentatively assign this energy to the ferredoxin-NADP-reductase-ferredoxin and oxidized cytochrome b 6 /f complexes. An efficient distribution of energy between cyclic and linear systems is obtained with the simple assumption that the turnover time of the cyclic system is slower than that of the linear system. The energy storage of linear electron flow was determined by 655 nm excitation of Chlorella with a short flash interval of 0. 35 <b>s</b> per <b>flash.</b> It was calculated to be 0. 50 ± 0. 03 eV/hv, close to that expected for oxygen and NADPH formation. The energy storage of PSII is determined by excitation of Chlorella at 655 nm with a long flash interval of 60 <b>s</b> per <b>flash.</b> It was calculated to be 1. 07 ± 0. 05 eV/hv, consistent with the energy storage being in S-states and the secondary electron acceptor of PSII with a calculated redox energy of 1. 03 eV/hv. In the presence of 1 μm 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea, the calculated energy storage in PSII is still significant, 0. 53 ± 0. 04 eV/hv. This probably indicates a significant cyclic electron flow around PSII. These cyclic flows may contribute considerably to energy storage in photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Organization of afferent {{information}} into parallel ON and OFF pathways {{is a critical}} feature of the vertebrate visual system. All afferent visual information in the vertebrate retina reaches the inner plexiform layer (IPL) via bipolar cells. It is at the bipolar cell level that separation of ON and OFF information first appears for afferent information from cones. This may also hold true for the rod pathway of cold-blooded vertebrates, but not for mammals. The all-rod retina of the skate presents an opportunity to examine such pathways in a retina having but a single class of photoreceptor. Immunocytochemical evidence suggests that both ON and OFF bipolar cells {{are present in the}} skate retina. We examined the pharmacology of the skate electroretinogram (ERG) to test the hypothesis that independent ON and OFF bipolar cell pathways are functional as rod afferent pathways from outer to inner plexiform layer in the skate. 100 microM 2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyric acid (APB) reversibly blocked the skate ERG b-wave. A small d-wave-like OFF component of the ERG revealed by DC recording of response to a prolonged (10 <b>s)</b> <b>flash</b> of light was reduced or blocked by 5 mM kynurenic acid (KYN). We found that addition of 200 microM picrotoxin to the Ringer's solution revealed prominent ON and OFF components of the skate ERG while reducing the c-wave. These ON and OFF components were reversibly blocked by 100 microM APB and 5 mM KYN, respectively. Reversible block of the OFF component by KYN was also accomplished in the presence of 500 microM N-methyl-DL-aspartate. From these findings, we conclude that ON and OFF bipolar cells are likely to be functional as parallel afferent interplexiform pathways in the all-rod retina of the skate...|$|R

This flash-induced fading effect (Kanai et al, 2003 Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 15 664 - 672) is considered as a time-locked variant of the Troxler effect. In the original experiment by Kanai, a short circular flash surrounding an object in the peripheral visual field causes the object to temporarily disappear from visual awareness.

The bi-exponential function shows sigmoidicity when one of the two rate constants differs by less than one order of magnitude from the other.
