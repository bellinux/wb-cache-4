5|$|Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{are usually}} {{the main cause of}} PID. Data suggest that PID is often polymicrobial. Isolated anaerobes and facultative {{microorganisms}} have been obtained from the upper genital tract. N. gonorrhoeae has been isolated from fallopian tubes, facultative and anaerobic organisms <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> from endometrial tissues.|$|E
5|$|Monument23 {{was damaged}} in {{the mid-twentieth century}} by a local mason who {{attempted}} to break its exposed upper portion using a steel chisel. As a result, the top is fragmented, although the broken pieces <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> by archaeologists and have been put back into place.|$|E

50|$|França, Langer and Ferigolo (2011) found that, when {{added to}} Nesbitt's {{analysis}} (2011), Decuriasuchus <b>was</b> <b>recovered</b> as the basalmost loricatan. Its addition influenced the phylogenetic placement of Ticinosuchus as well; in Nesbitt's original analysis it <b>was</b> <b>recovered</b> outside Loricata, but when Decuriasuchus {{was included in}} the analysis, Ticinosuchus <b>was</b> <b>recovered</b> as a basal member of Loricata.|$|R
25|$|Recovering stocks: After {{decades of}} decline, Pacific sardine populations <b>are</b> <b>recovering.</b> In 2004, the NMFS {{declared}} that, due to reduced harvest and bycatch, Pacific whiting <b>were</b> <b>recovering.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some {{artefacts}} <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> {{from the}} northeastern {{portion of the}} structure. They included fragments of a metate and of a manos (handstone for use with a metate) and a large quantity of domestic ceramics. Stela 1 and Altar 7 were found in front of Structure 4.|$|E
5|$|Soon the PNHQ {{deployed}} {{rescue teams}} on patrol vessels {{to recover the}} survivors of Khaibar. As Muhafiz sank before it could transmit, the Pakistanis knew the fate of ship from its few survivors, who <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> when the patrol vessel steered towards the ship's burning flotsam.|$|E
5|$|That {{same day}} five {{soldiers}} were killed in nearby Habbaniyah when their M113 armored personnel carrier {{was hit by a}} mine. According to General Conway, it was the largest mine that had been used in Anbar to date; only a tailgate and a boot <b>were</b> <b>recovered.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although most {{ilmenite}} <b>is</b> <b>recovered</b> {{from heavy}} mineral sands ore deposits, ilmenite can also <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> from layered intrusive sources or [...] "hard rock" [...] titanium ore sources.|$|R

5|$|The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin has the {{wreckage}} of two complete aircraft that <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> from separate crash sites near Murmansk in 1990 and 1994. These wrecks were purchased from New Zealand collector Tim Wallis, who originally planned for the remains to be restored to airworthy, in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{average life}} span is unknown but {{in common with}} seabirds such as the {{wandering}} albatross and Leach's storm petrel, frigatebirds are long-lived. In 2002, 35 ringed great frigatebirds <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> on Tern Island in the Hawaiian Islands. Of these ten were older than 37 years and one was at least 44 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} and resulting fire claimed {{the lives of}} 50people (42French nationals, sevenIrish nationals, and oneBritish national). Only 27bodies <b>were</b> <b>recovered.</b> A further fatality occurred during the salvage operation with the loss of a Dutch diver.|$|E
50|$|The jewel <b>was</b> <b>recovered</b> by divers; many presume {{the sword}} {{to have been}} lost at this time, though it is officially said to have <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> and {{enshrined}} at Atsuta Shrine.|$|R
50|$|A compound-leaved fossil {{species has}} <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> {{from the middle}} Eocene Golden Grove site in Adelaide that closely resembles Neorites kevedianus. Although {{abundant}} at this site, it has not <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The Luohandong Formation is a Mesozoic {{geologic}} formation in China. Dinosaur remains {{are among the}} fossils that have <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from the formation. Pterosaur fossils have also <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from the formation.|$|R
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale of the issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E
5|$|After the Gold Rush had concluded, gold {{recovery}} operations continued. The final stage to recover loose gold was to prospect for gold that had slowly washed {{down into the}} flat river bottoms and sandbars of California's Central Valley and other gold-bearing areas of California (such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County). By the late 1890s, dredging technology (also invented in California) had become economical, and {{it is estimated that}} more than 20million ounces (620t) <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> by dredging (worth approximately US$28billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in one or both of two major surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E
50|$|In this industry, acetate <b>is</b> <b>recovered</b> {{during the}} {{manufacturing}} of polymers. In this case, the wanted product {{is actually the}} polymer; however, the acetate is not a waste either since it <b>is</b> <b>recovered.</b> While the polymer solids are discharged through the solid exit port and further processed, the acetate that <b>is</b> <b>recovered</b> through the liquid exit port and further separated from the washing liquid to recover pure acetate.|$|R
50|$|Sinomenium macrofossils have <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> {{from the}} late Zanclean stage of Pliocene sites in Pocapaglia, Italy.

25|$|The Sci-Fi Channel {{posted a}} summary of its program The Bermuda Triangle: Startling New Secrets on its website, in which it said that all that <b>was</b> <b>recovered</b> <b>was</b> a lifeboat. The Coast Guard had listed all that <b>was</b> <b>recovered</b> and {{identified}} for its report, as well as assembling the items for public display during the inquiry, which was photographed. A lifeboat was not among the debris, nor <b>was</b> one <b>recovered.</b>|$|R
5|$|Astorga and Henderson were {{released}} in March 1973 {{after the war}} ended. The remains {{of the rest of}} the crew of Bat 21, Hambleton's EB-66E Destroyer—Bolte, Gatwood, Giannangeli, Levis, and Serex have not been recovered to date. Gatwood left behind a 13-week-old son he had never seen, Robin F. Gatwood III. The remains of Kulland, Frink and Paschall <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> and returned to the United States in 1995, where they were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The bodies of Potts and Walker have not been recovered to date.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 15 October, the {{men were}} taken to a public {{cemetery}} near Shanghai, where they were shot by a Japanese firing squad. Following the bodies' cremation, the ashes were taken to a mortuary. After the war ended, the men's ashes <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> and their letters found in a secret file of the War Ministry Building in Tokyo. In 1946, Farrow was interred with honors at the Arlington National Cemetery, Section 12, Grave 157.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{early on}} October18, Kiko was {{forecast}} to strike Mexico at tropical storm intensity and cyclone advisories were issued accordingly. However, a building mid-level ridge of high pressure over inland Mexico was then forecast {{to cause the}} center of circulation to pass just offshore. Though no damage was reported {{in association with the}} cyclone, rough seas created by Kiko capsized a ship with thirty people on-board; two were found still alive, fifteen bodies <b>were</b> <b>recovered,</b> and nine were reported missing.|$|E
50|$|The Qigu Formation is a Mesozoic {{geologic}} formation. Dinosaur remains {{are among}} the fossils that have <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from the formation, although none have yet been referred to a specific genus. Pterosaur fossils have <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from the formation.|$|R
50|$|Paulownia macrofossils have <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> {{from the}} late Zanclean stage of the Pliocene sites in Pocapaglia, Italy and Paulownia caucasica macrofossils have <b>been</b> <b>recovered</b> from strata of the Serravallian stage of the Miocene in Georgia in the Caucasus region.|$|R

5|$|Fairfax {{wrote that}} his second-in-command, Major-General Lambert, {{could not get}} up to him, and so charged in another place. A lane, the present-day Atterwith Lane, crossed the ditch on this flank, and some {{accounts}} suggest that several units were easy targets for the Royalist musketeers as they advanced along the lane only four abreast. When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this point was removed in the 1960s, several hundred musket balls <b>were</b> <b>recovered.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the ship's {{compass and}} several flags <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> and {{returned}} to Germany, where they are held at the German Naval Academy Mürwik in Flensburg-Mürwik. In 2006, Chilean and German divers found and recovered Dresdens bell, which is now in Germany. CS Forester's novel Brown on Resolution, and two subsequent movies, were inspired by the Dresdens escape and subsequent destruction.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 the Lebanese {{government}} {{started a}} massive campaign to recover antiquities that were stolen or traded {{during the civil}} war. Many artifacts <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> from warehouses or private homes since Lebanese law dictates that any item more than 300 years old belongs to the state. In 2011, the ground floor restoration lab was moved and a new exhibition hall, named after prince Maurice Chehab was opened to the public.|$|E
5000|$|Probable {{reserves}} are volumes defined as [...] "less likely to <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> than proved, but more certain to <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> than Possible Reserves". Some industry specialists {{refer to this}} as P50, i.e., having a 50% certainty of being produced.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Camellia is {{the final}} winner of 128 -bit block cipher in NESSIE. In this paper, we {{construct}} some efficient distinguishers between 4 -round Camellia and a random permutation of the blocks space. By using collision-searching techniques, the distinguishers are used to attack on 6, 7, 8 and 9 rounds of Camellia with 128 -bit key and 8, 9 and 10 rounds of Camellia with 192 / 256 -bit key. The 128 -bit key of 6 rounds Camellia can <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> with 2 10 chosen plaintexts and 2 15 encryptions. The 128 -bit key of 7 rounds Camellia can <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> with 2 12 chosen plaintexts and 2 54. 5 encryptions. The 128 -bit key of 8 rounds Camellia can <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> with 2 13 chosen plaintexts and 2 112. 1 encryptions. The 128 -bit key of 9 rounds Camellia can <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> with 2 113. 6 chosen plaintexts and 2 121 encryptions. The 192 / 256 -bit key of 8 rounds Camellia can <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> with 2 13 chosen plaintexts and 2 111. 1 encryptions. The 192 / 256 -bit key of 9 rounds Camellia can <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> with 2 13 chosen plaintexts and 2 175. 6 encryptions.
