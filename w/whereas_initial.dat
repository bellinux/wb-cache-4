Case reportAn infant of {{two and a half}} months presented with endonasal tumor extending to ethmoid. Surgical excision was performed on an endonasal approach. Myxoma was diagnosed by histologic examination of the surgical specimen, <b>whereas</b> <b>initial</b> biopsy had suggested fibrous dysplasia.

40|$|AbstractBone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) induce autonomic neurogenesis in {{neural crest}} cultures and stimulate sympathetic neuron development when overexpressed in vivo. We demonstrate that inhibition of BMPs in the chick embryo by the BMP antagonist Noggin prevents sympathetic neuron generation. In Noggin-treated embryos, the noradrenergic marker genes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH), panneuronal neurofilament 160 (NF 160) and SCG 10 genes, and the transcriptional regulators Phox 2 b and Phox 2 a are not expressed in sympathetic ganglia. <b>Whereas</b> <b>initial</b> ganglion development is not affected, {{the expression of}} the basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor Cash- 1 is strongly reduced.
