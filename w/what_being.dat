The kanji symbol {{used in the}} logo was drawn by Naora, who had {{designed}} the Shinra logo in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Naora specifically requested that he draw the logo due to this previous experience. To achieve the grittier atmosphere, Naora took a research trip to a Japanese military camp to learn <b>what</b> <b>being</b> a military cadet was like. The island of the Vermillion Perystilium {{was based on an}} offshore Japanese island he had visited prior to his involvement with the game, adding elements in-game such as an offshore ship wreck to symbolize his fear of the sea. He was also influenced by an incident where he saw a dead cat surrounded by other cats to portray the bond between members of Class Zero, and the game's themes, in promotional artwork.|$|E

His feelings for In-ha have always been conflicted with his hatred for her mother, but he finds that he cannot deny them as they grow older. After years of being a taxi driver, he decides to become a reporter with In-ha to prove his family's innocence, and show reporter Song Cha-ok <b>what</b> <b>being</b> a true reporter means. However, Dal-po soon realizes that a reporter must constantly struggle {{with the idea of}} justice and truth in a world where everyone wants to hide the facts for their self-interests.|$|E

It's more about examining how {{your friends and family}} react to you when you're sick." [...] "We don't want to do some ridiculous she-might-die thing.

Lead vocalist Tim McIlrath commented that the song is [...] "kind of a punk rock anthem about being a punk rocker in today’s world; like <b>what</b> <b>being</b> a human being in today’s world is like." [...] Scott Heisel of Punknews.org felt that the Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1 version maintained the band's distinctive sound, and signing to a major record label had not changed the band's music.

Following his appeal for the return of the prosthesis, he received a telephone call from two youths who said they [...] "might be able to recover the lost leg" [...] but asked [...] "What is it worth?" [...] Infuriated, McFall refused to pay anything and asked the youths whether they had considered <b>what</b> <b>being</b> an amputee was like. After McFall agreed to take no further action against them, the youths anonymously returned the prosthesis to the Institute a week later. McFall went on to achieve a personal best of 8.55seconds in the 60metres race, and 28.21seconds in the 200metres on 4 February.|$|E
500|$|... "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" [...] also explores and satirizes people's {{reactions}} to homosexuality through Stan and other characters who react to Sparky's behavior. For example, Stan admits {{he does not}} even know <b>what</b> <b>being</b> gay includes, except simply that it [...] "is bad". Also, when Cartman suggests to Stan that Sparky might be at the mall buying leather pants, it satirizes the stereotype that all gay men are engaged in the leather subculture. The episode also mocks what many LGBT activists perceive as hatred and misunderstandings about homosexuality often expressed by anti-LGBT and right-wing activists, including Christian ministers Jerry Falwell and Fred Phelps. This is partially illustrated in this episode by Mr. Garrison's condemnation of homosexuals, rooted in deep-seated fear of his own sexuality. Basing his comment off this episode, Gardiner commented that South Park had a [...] "Queer Lite" [...] attitude towards homosexuality, stating [...] "they are unemphatically tolerant, polymorphously perverse, ambiguously gay affirmative".|$|E

500|$|On February 1, 2006, Insane Clown Posse fan Jacob D. Robida {{attacked}} {{individuals in}} a gay bar in New Bedford, Massachusetts with a handgun and a hatchet—a weapon {{featured in the}} logo of the group's record label, Psychopathic Records. Robida had a swastika tattoo and flaunted Nazi insignias and paraphernalia on his website. On February 5, Robida shot and killed a traffic officer during a routine stop. When police pulled Robida over during a later stop, he killed his girlfriend, Jennifer Bailey of Charleston, West Virginia, then opened fire on the police. Robida was shot twice in the head during the shootout with the police, and later died in the hospital. On February 7, Insane Clown Posse released a statement on the Robida attacks. The group's manager Alex Abbiss extended Bruce and Utsler's condolences and prayers {{to the families of}} the victims, stating that [...] "It's quite obvious that this guy had no clue <b>what</b> <b>being</b> a Juggalo is all about.

500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn <b>what</b> <b>being</b> homesick is really about." ...|$|E
500|$|Just as Lee explores Jem's {{development}} {{in coming to}} grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes <b>what</b> <b>being</b> female means, and several female characters influence her development. [...] Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. [...] Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong-willed, independent, and protective. [...] Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. [...] The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. [...] For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. [...] By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, [...] "Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child." ...|$|E

500|$|Secrets reveal {{themselves}} steadily {{throughout the}} episode. Xander fears that his future marriage will turn {{him into an}} argumentative drunk like his father. He attempts to avoid his fears through the song [...] "I'll Never Tell", singing [...] "'coz there's nothing to tell", after summoning Sweet to Sunnydale to show him that he and Anya will be happy. Amid the various annoyances Xander and Anya express through this song, some verses are clear-sighted observations of behavior, such as Anya's accusation that Xander—once in love with Buffy—uses Buffy as a mother figure to hide behind. Anya also avoids the truth by burying herself in wedding plans without thinking critically about <b>what</b> <b>being</b> married will entail; instead she considers Xander an accessory to her desired lifestyle. Of all the characters, Anya is the most preoccupied with the style of singing and songs, demanding to know if Spike sang [...] "a breakaway pop hit, or a book number", and asking Dawn if the pterodactyl she facetiously says {{she gave birth to}} also broke into song. Anya and Xander's duet is the only song in the episode to address the audience directly. During the long single-shot scene when she and Xander talk over each other insisting to Giles that evil must be at play, Anya refers to the audience, saying [...] "It was like we were being watched... Like there was a wall missing ... in our apartment... Like there were only three walls and not a fourth wall." [...] Albright asserts that Anya's constant preoccupation with her and others' performances indicates that she has serious doubts about her future supporting role as Xander's wife.|$|E
500|$|The Independent {{said that}} Insurrection [...] "never stops being familiarly jolly and antiquated", {{and called the}} entire Star Trek film {{franchise}} [...] "old-fashioned". The Washington Post also called the film old fashioned, but [...] "in the best sense of the word", {{and said that the}} film did what the [...] "doctor – make that Dr. 'Bones' McCoy – ordered". British journalist Simon Rose, writing for The Daily Mirror was more critical of the film, saying that it failed to break the odd-numbered Star Trek film curse, and that it was [...] "feeble", [...] "moribund" [...] and [...] "tedious". However, Josh Spiegel writing for The Buffalo News said that Insurrection broke the odd-numbered film rule. Further criticism came from the Birmingham Evening Mail, which said that it was [...] "an adult form of entertainment equivalent to Teletubbies for babies", and that there were [...] "lots of repetition, rubbery faces, gibberish dialogue, characters leaping up and down in funny suits and some very basic effects". The reviewer gave the film two stars for fans, and none for non-fans. In Folklore/Cinema: Popular Film as Vernacular Culture, the actions of Data and the Ba'ku child Artim in Insurrection are seen as [...] "a metamorphosis motif where a child becomes computerlike and a computer/android becomes more childlike". Data specifically [...] "is a metaphor for a child who seeks to understand <b>what</b> <b>being</b> human means and then, like the velveteen rabbit, wishes to become. From confronting his father and evil brother to finding his mother, Data also represents the potential within all of us to quest for a fuller humanity".|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning, wrote, [...] "Even in {{an episode}} like 'The 'C' Word,' {{where some of}} the ideas fall a bit short, there were still plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to talk about. [...] In the end, the great writing outweighed the slightly bothersome contrivances to make this yet another laugh-filled episode of 30 Rock." [...] He said that the pairing of Jack and Tracy [...] "gave us another opportunity to enjoy the pairing of the polar opposite personalities". Canning reported that the Liz plot had [...] "its funny moments", but opined that it was hard to [...] "get past the fact this wasn't exactly the Liz we knew", in regards to her being a [...] "domineering boss that cares little about her employees." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that putting Alec Baldwin and Rip Torn together [...] "was a genius move." [...] She was complimentary towards Tina Fey, citing that it was [...] "another great week" [...] in her [...] "continuing portrayal of <b>what</b> <b>being</b> a hard-working gal is actually like." [...] Ward enjoyed Tracy's speech, noting that it was [...] "priceless", and was glad to see him having [...] "ample screen time... which was a nice change of pace." [...] TV Guides Matt Mitovich wrote he enjoyed all of the episode's storyline pairings, but much enjoyed Jack and Tracy. Further in his recap, Mitovich reported that Liz's plot could have been better had the comedy show How I Met Your Mother [...] "not gone there with the C-word" [...] in an episode. Though, he said that Liz's story [...] "had a fitting message – that she is held to a different standard, yet shouldn't be, as a female head writer. Plus, her story gave us that winning flurry of flashbacks to times when she was a... not very nice lady." ...|$|E
