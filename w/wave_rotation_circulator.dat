40|$|Often coastal {{protection}} works {{are carried out}} to mitigate the effects of erosion, but do not attempt to address the cause. For example, rock/concrete walls, breakwaters or groynes along the beach act to mitigate the effects or to realign the beach. However, end effects on the shoreline downstream and the environmental imperatives to retain natural character often preclude hard structures. Also, coastal re-alignment {{may not be possible}} in built-up areas where natural alignments would sweep though modern shoreline developments. <b>Wave</b> <b>rotation</b> is a method of {{coastal protection}} that targets the cause of the erosion (i. e. longshore wave-driven currents). Offshore, submerged structures are oriented to rotate waves so that the alongshore current (and thus sediment transport) is reduced inshore. The realigned wave angle at the breakpoint (in harmony with the alignment of the beach) results in reduced longshore flows and sediment accretion in the lee of the rotating reef. This paper considers two types of offshore reef that we describe as “dissipators ” and “rotators”. The former acts to break the waves and protect the coast by reducing wave energy in the lee of the reef. The latter relies on <b>wave</b> <b>rotation</b> to create the chosen wave alignment. The rotator is particularly beneficial in areas of low wave climate or large tidal range when wave breaking is difficult to achieve on a submerged structure, particularly around high tide. Numerical modelling is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>wave</b> <b>rotation</b> to mitigate erosion...|$|R

40|$|A {{perspective}} on systems containing many action potential waves that, individually, {{are prone to}} spiral wave breakup is proposed. The perspective is based on two quantities, “predator” and “prey,” which we define as the fraction of the system in the excited state and in the excitable but unexcited state, respectively. These quantities exhibited a number of properties in both simulations and fibrillating canine cardiac tissue that {{were found to be}} consistent with a proposed theory that assumes the existence of regions we call “domains of influence,” each of which is associated with the activity of one action potential wave. The properties include (i) a propensity to rotate in phase space in the same sense as would be predicted by the standard Volterra-Lotka predator-prey equations, (ii) temporal behavior ranging from near periodic oscillation at a frequency close to the spiral <b>wave</b> <b>rotation</b> frequency (“type- 1 ” behavior) to more complex oscillatory behavior whose power spectrum is composed of a range of frequencies both above and, especially, below the spiral <b>wave</b> <b>rotation</b> frequency (“type- 2 ” behavior), and (iii) a strong positive correlation between the periods and amplitudes of the oscillations of these quantities. In particular, a rapid measure of the amplitude was found to scale consistently as the square root of the period in data taken from both simulations and optical mapping experiments. Global quantities such as predator and prey thus appear to be useful in the study of multiple spiral wave systems, facilitating the posing of new questions, which in turn may help to provide greater understanding of clinically important phenomena such as ventricular fibrillation...|$|R

Subsequently, the contributions made by previous authors (primarily using theory and numerical simulations) to elucidate how the drag {{is affected by}} additional physical processes are surveyed.

40|$|It is {{traditionally}} assumed that impulse propagation in cardiac muscle {{is determined by}} the combination of two factors: (1) the active properties of cardiac cell membranes and (2) the passive electrical characteristics of the network formed by cardiac cells. However, advances made recently in the theory of generic excitable media suggest that an additional factor—the geometry of excitation wavefronts—may play an important role. In particular, impulse propagation strongly depends on the wavefront curvature on a small spatial scale. In the heart, excitation wavefronts have pronounced curvatures in several situations including waves initiated by small electrodes, waves emerging from narrow tissue structures, and waves propagating around the sharp edges of anatomical obstacles or around a zone of functional conduction block during spiral <b>wave</b> <b>rotation.</b> In this short review we consider the theoretical background relating impulse propagation to wavefront curvature and we estimate the role of wavefront curvature in electrical stimulation, formation of conduction block, and the dynamic behavior of spiral wave...|$|R

As inside the Earth's core or in various industrial processes, a flow is altered by the presence of both background rotation and a large scale magnetic field. In this context, we present a set of 3 D direct numerical simulations of incompressible decaying turbulence. We focus on parameters similar to the ones encountered in geophysical and astrophysical flows, so that the Rossby number is small, the interaction parameter is large, but the Elsasser number, defining the ratio between Coriolis and Lorentz forces, is about unity. These simulations allow to quantify the effect of rotation and thus inertial waves on the growth of magnetic fluctuations due to Alfvén <b>waves.</b> <b>Rotation</b> prevents the occurrence of equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energies, with a reduction of magnetic energy at decreasing Elsasser number Λ.

Because of its complex nature, each identified form of AF requires specialized treatment. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the bases of these arrhythmias is essential for therapeutic development. A variety of experimental studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of AF are performed using primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes (NRAMs). Previously, we {{have shown that the}} distinct advantage of NRAM cultures is that they allow standardized, systematic, robust re-entry induction {{in the presence of a}} constitutively-active acetylcholine-mediated K+ current (IKACh-c).

40|$|The {{experimental}} and clinical possibilities for studying cardiac arrhythmias in human ventricular myocardium are very limited. Therefore, {{the use of}} alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great importance. In this article we introduce a mathematical model of the action potential of human ventricular cells that, while including {{a high level of}} electrophysiological detail, is computationally cost-effective enough to be applied in large-scale spatial simulations for the study of reentrant arrhythmias. The model is based on recent experimental data on most of the major ionic currents: the fast sodium, L-type calcium, transient outward, rapid and slow delayed rectifier, and inward rectifier currents. The model includes a basic calcium dynamics, allowing for the realistic modeling of calcium transients, calcium current inactivation, and the contraction staircase. We are able to reproduce human epicardial, endocardial, and M cell action potentials and show that differences can be explained by differences in the transient outward and slow delayed rectifier currents. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed data on action potential duration restitution, which is an important characteristic for reentrant arrhythmias. The conduction velocity restitution of our model is broader than in other models and agrees better with available data. Finally, we model the dynamics of spiral <b>wave</b> <b>rotation</b> in a two-dimensional sheet of human ventricular tissue and show that the spiral wave follows a complex meandering pattern and has a period of 265 ms.

BACKGROUNDElectrocardiographic classification of CCW and CW typical atrial Fl is frequently hampered by inaccurate and inconclusive scalar waveform analysis of the 12 -lead ECG. METHODSElectrocardiogram signals from 62 torso sites and multisite endocardial recordings were obtained during CCW typical atrial Fl (12 patients), CW typical Fl (3 patients), both forms of typical Fl (4 patients) and CCW typical and atypical atrial Fl (1 patient). All the Fl wave episodes {{were divided into two}} or three successive time periods showing stable potential distributions from which integral maps were computed. RESULTSThe initial, intermediate and terminal CCW Fl wave map patterns coincided with: 1) caudocranial activation of the right atrial septum and proximal-to-distal coronary sinus activation, 2) craniocaudal activation of the right atrial free wall, and 3) activation of the lateral part of the subeustachian isthmus, respectively. The initial, intermediate and terminal CW Fl wave map patterns corresponded with : 1) craniocaudal right atrial septal activation, 2) activation of the subeustachian isthmus and proximal-to-distal coronary sinus activation, and 3) caudocranial right atrial free wall activation, respectively.
