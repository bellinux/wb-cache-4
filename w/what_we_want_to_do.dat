500|$|As Voorhis {{served his}} fifth {{term in the}} House, local Republicans searched for a {{candidate}} capable of defeating him. Richard Nixon answered the call. Nixon, who {{was still in the}} Navy when approached, wrote of Voorhis, [...] "His 'conservative' reputation must be blasted.

[...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really think about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and write the best record we can.'

[...] Nixon was a virtual unknown outside of his hometown of Whittier and was facing a popular and respected incumbent. [...] Charles Voorhis wrote his son that the Republicans had endorsed a Quaker named Richard Nixon, but hoped that his son would retain {{a large part of}} the Quaker vote. The elder Voorhis was confident that his son would triumph again, writing, [...] "It is just another campaign that we have to go through... In any event, we have nothing to worry about now." ...|$|E

[...] Johnson told The Dispatch [...] "I need unlimited, unfettered discretion to seek every fact I can find in order to come to a decent conclusion.

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the band's catalog of music is written by You, followed by Morrie, and then Takahiro, who wrote seven of eight songs on the first album. Morrie is responsible for all the lyrics, which are mostly in Japanese with some English lines, and contributed three songs on the second, and four (two with the band's producer Hajime Okano) on the fourth album. Joe composed one song {{in each of the}} first three albums, and they all showcase the bass. The band usually does not discuss their ideas on sound and style, yet Morrie says, [...] "we individually do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> based on the songs that You creates, even if it destroys the original concept of the song". In regard to band's music and lyrics, Morrie described them as explosive and outward with an incentive kind of a death drive.|$|E
2500|$|For {{their second}} album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), Muse wanted {{to craft a}} more {{aggressive}} sound. In 2000, Wolstenholme said: [...] "Looking back, there isn't much difference sonically between the mellow stuff and the heavier tracks [...] The heavy stuff really {{could have been a}} lot heavier and that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with [...]" [...] Their third album, Absolution (2003), features prominent string arrangements and began to draw influences from artists such as Queen. Their fourth album, Black Holes and Revelations (2006) was influenced by artists like Depeche Mode and Lightning Bolt, as well as Asian and European music such as Naples music; additionally, the band listened to radio stations from the Middle East during the album's recording sessions. Queen guitarist Brian May has praised Muse's work, calling the band [...] "extraordinary musicians", who [...] "let their madness show through, always a good thing in an artist." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{than ever}} before we have access to {{information}} {{that allows us to}} reflect on the causes and consequences of our actions. At the same time we are faced with dangers related to unintended consequences of our actions and by our reliance on the knowledge of experts. We create, maintain and revise a set of biographical narratives, social roles and lifestyles – the story of who we are, and how we came to be where we are now. We are increasingly free to choose <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and who we want to be (although Giddens contends that wealth gives access to more options). But increased choice can be both liberating and troubling. Liberating in the sense of increasing the likelihood of one's self-fulfilment, and troubling in form of increased emotional stress and time needed to analyse the available choices and minimise risk of which we are increasingly aware (what Giddens sums up as [...] "manufacturing uncertainty"). While in earlier, traditional societies we would be provided with that narrative and social role, in the post-traditional society we are usually forced to create one ourselves. As Giddens puts it: ...|$|E

2500|$|Mahathir, who {{had never}} been fond of the judiciary, began making heated {{statements}} about it at this time. Mahathir declared, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, and we want to give our interpretation.' If we disagree, the courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' ... We know exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but once we do it, it is interpreted in a different way." [...] Mahathir also lambasted [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent" [...] and play to public opinion. Soon after, nine judges sitting on the High Court were reassigned to different divisions; Justice Harun Hashim, who presided over the UMNO case, was transferred from appellate and special powers cases to commercial crimes. However, because the UMNO case was already in progress, his transfer would not take effect until the case closed. Harun later ruled that under the evidence presented, it was clear several UMNO delegates had come from unregistered branches of the party. In line with the law, he declared he was forced to declare UMNO an illegal society, and thereby dismissed the case of the plaintiffs. Mahathir soon formed a new party, UMNO Baru (New UMNO), to replace UMNO. Within a year, the suffix [...] "Baru" [...] was dropped, making it just plain [...] "UMNO".|$|E
