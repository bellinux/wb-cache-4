The washerwomen--the term is used as being generic to the trade and not to the sex, for some of the performers were men--were divided into two classes, who worked separately; not so separately but what they talked together, and were on friendly terms; but still there was a division. The upper washerwomen, among whom the men were at work, were Mahomedans; the lower set were Jewesses. As to the men, but little observation was made, except that they seemed expert enough, dabbing their clothes, rubbing in the soap, and then rinsing, very much in the manner of Christians. But it was impossible not to look at the women. The female followers of the Prophet had, as they always have, some pretence of a veil for their face. In the present instance, they held in their teeth a dirty blue calico rag, which passed over their heads, acting also as a shawl. By this contrivance, intended only to last while the Christians were there, they concealed one side of the face and the chin. No one could behold them without wishing that the eclipse had been total. No epithet commonly applied to <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> could adequately describe their want of comeliness. They kept their faces to their work, and except that they held their rags between their teeth, they gave no sign of knowing that strangers were standing by them.|$|E

60|$|But I go farther. The Old-Age Pensions Act, so {{far from}} being in {{conflict}} with a scheme of contributory insurance, is really its most helpful and potent ally. The fact that at seventy the State pension is assured {{to all those who}} need it, makes a tremendous difference to every form of insurance confined to the years before seventy, whether for old age or for invalidity. I asked an eminent actuary the other day to make me some calculations. They are rough, general calculations, and no doubt they might be more exact. But roughly, I believe it to be no exaggeration to say that the rates to cover a man till seventy are in many cases scarcely half what they would be, if they had to cover him till death. Do you see what that means? It is a prodigious fact. It is the sort of fact by the discovery of which people make gigantic fortunes; and I suggest to you that we should make this gigantic fortune for John Bull. It means that the whole field of insurance has become much more fruitful than it ever was before, that there is a new class of insurance business possible which never was possible before. It means that the whole field of insurance is far more open to the poorest class of people than it was before, and that with a proper system the benefits of the Old-Age Pensions Act would not be confined to the actual pensioners who are drawing their money, but would extend forwards in anticipation to all other classes and to all other people, and that so far as five shillings a week is concerned--that is not much unless you have not got it--the actuarial position of every man and <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> has been enormously improved by the Old-Age Pensions Act.|$|R

[...] Reneltta also explains Imago's differences from the Edmonton production, saying they “took the gratuitous out of it so you could hear the necessary”. Their production opted to separate the characters and the violence rather than having them interact and commit violence towards one another. She supports this decision by stating it is a way of making the violence more impressionistic.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{not until}} the {{introduction}} of the Constitution of Human Rights that all <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> were recognized formally as equal citizens. These Constitutional rights were created in 1996. In this Constitution, there was a special paragraph for women, titled ‘Equality’. In this it said that in the state you may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds. But before this Bill of Rights, the struggle of the women in South Africa started as early as 1913. When black and coloured women in the free state protested against having to carry identify passes, which white women didn’t have to carry around. This shows us that Black and coloured women were also again treated lesser than the white women. In 1918 Charlotte Maxeke started the first formal women’s organization called the Bantu Women's League. In the 1930s and 1940s there were many mass protests, demonstrations and resistance campaigns in which women participated. Before 1943 the African National Congress (ANC) was an organisation founded by men and admitted men. The struggles of women from 1913- 1943 showed that women were affected by colonialism as well. In 1943, the ANC opened its doors for women to join the ANC. In 1948 the ANC Women's League was formed and Ida Mtwana became the first female president of the League. In 1952 many Black, Coloured and Indian women took part in the Defiance Campaign, which involved purposefully breaking apartheid laws. After that, throughout history and until the present day there have been many campaigns for their rights. Many campaigns were very successful. The women now have more rights than they have ever had before.http://www.anc.org.za/content/women-and-african-national-congress-1912-1943 ...|$|E
5000|$|Both Robert and Anna {{turned up}} alive in Port Charles in 2006 {{much to the}} {{surprise}} of their daughter, Robin. During his return in 2006, Robert told Robin {{that he was in the}} South Pacific trying to track a lethal dose of encephalitis. He said that he quarantined a village and torched it but two potential carriers slipped through the net: one was a chimp and the other was Luke Spencer. Robert and Robin's relationship was briefly strained due to him not telling her he was alive, but they soon became close again. When Anna returned in the summer of 2007, she explained that Robert was deep undercover on a mission to recover black market alien remains. Later, at the end of the summer both Anna and Robert were assigned on a mission in the Amazon. The character then appears on the prime time spin-off General Hospital: Night Shift when he narrowly escapes a plane crashes near Port Charles. Jagger Cates rescues him and brings him to General Hospital where it is revealed that he has a brain tumor. During an MRI, Patrick Drake tells Robert that the brain tumor is the result of another tumor, and tells Robert that he has colon cancer. Writer Sri Rao explained the storyline, stating [...] "When I decided to bring Robert Scorpio back to Port Charles, I wanted him and Robin to come together as a family. The best way to do that would be to have Robert present with a medical condition." [...] Rao went on to explain the cultural reasons for using colon cancer as a plot point, stating [...] "I chose colon cancer because it's a disease that affects so many men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> - but we don't really talk about it. ... This is one of the cancers that can most easily be prevented if only people will get screened. Hopefully, we can raise awareness of this with our viewers." [...] Rao reached out to the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance to make sure he conveyed the story [...] "authentically, responsibly and realistically". Robert falls into a coma, and both Mac Scorpio (John J. York) and Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) make appearances on the series to support the character. York took the opportunity to speak out and raise awareness on colon cancer. While in a coma, Robert dreams of Anna, Robin, Luke Spencer, Sean Donely and Tiffany Donely in a flashback to their old life in the 1980s. He comes out of the coma on October 14, 2008 and leaves for further treatment in Europe.|$|E

This being said, the Cervical Cancer is still the second leading cause of female deaths in developing countries. The reason behind this is {{because of the lack of}} early diagnosis and sometimes even because lack of information. Since the <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>countries</b> do not have gynecological surveillance, mainly because its cost, chances are high that the cancer grows to a state that can no longer be treated. When the surveillance actually exists, it is very expensive since the samples of the tests made need to be sent to another country with access to specific equipment. With the increasing techonological development, it is possible to create a less expensive tool to try to supress some of this problems. The tool will be used to assist the medical staff so that they have a first overview of the patient's cervical cancer results. Nevertheless, the ultimate decision on whether a person actually has or does not have cancer comes from the doctor. The objective of this thesis is to develop a tool that can support and be used by developing countries health facilities, so that they have the first impression about the situation of the patient by analysing the pictures of the samples gathered during the appointment. The main focus of the tool is to analyse and identify specific characteristics of the sample pictures in order to be able to give feedback about the existence of the cancer. In the end, the main objective is to spare those facilities sending the samples to other places and spend more money than they should, as the tool would give some insights about the risks and the need of further analyses...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{project of}} the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee, still running today at Milwaukee's Good Samaritan Medical Center, was started to provide people with help that was not being given by other {{existing}} social services and was set up as a feminist institution. Approximately thirty volunteers served at all times to cover alternate four-hour shifts and all workers at the Women's Crisis Line were women. This was because the center was created for women and was therefore run by women; additionally these women could relate to the other women in need. The {{information provided by the}} callers and workers was used to identify where there was help needed in the community which then {{led to the formation of}} the Sexual Assault Counseling Unit, the Sexual Assault Treatment Center, and the Task Force on Battered Women. The crisis line was a successful first project for the Coalition because the Coalition bylaws strived [...] "to develop alternative institutions within the women's movement." [...] The center, being a feminist institution, also adapted a feminist philosophy as The Crisis Line's policy statement stated, [...] "No matter what your personal views, when counseling, you should suggest all the alternatives to a particular woman's problem (non-sexist, of course) and leave the final decision up to her ... As women, we feel this society treats us with disrespect, treats us as if we are sick or crazy because we do not fit the mold they have made for us ... <b>Women</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> for too long have had other people (men) make their decisions, and we will at no time perpetuate this ..." [...] The Women's Crisis Line was not only helpful, it was successful. [...] "In its first month of operation, the Crisis Line received 119 calls, and one year later, in January 1974, the monthly total reached 755. By mid-1977, the Crisis Line reported that the number of calls received each month averaged between 1,200 and 1,500. The major areas of concern expressed by callers included relationships, family conflicts, divorce, depression, legal issues, and pregnancy and other health concerns. Many callers sought referrals to local professional and social service providers knowing that Crisis Line staff made referrals only to those individuals and services with an established record of fair and sensitive treatment of women. Sexual assault accounted for 30-35 calls per month, and potential suicides constituted 10 calls each month."Due to gaining of momentum, idea of the Women's Crisis Line to go independent and break off from the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee stemmed from Crisis Line Director Karen Coy. The group wanted to become independent mainly because of financial reasons though not all members were in favor of the split. In May 1975 it became an independent organization but remained in close communication with the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee by continuing to work with them on other projects in the Milwaukee area. Though split, the Women's Coalition of Milwaukee is often referred to as the independent organization's 'mother' agency. The organization then transferred to the Counseling Center of Milwaukee as they found sponsorship in 1979 and later became affiliated with the Women's Health Institute at Good Samaritan Medical Center in 1986.|$|E

It turns out that this woman is Kalpana (Kalpana), and she’s a famous actress. Her life is a whirl of men trying to flatter her, making promises of laying their hearts at her feet, and so on. Dev’s failure to even recognize her has endeared him to her. She likes his candour, {{and the fact that he}} treats her as a friend, not as an idol. She even buys him a new coat, which she hands over to him in the car, insisting that he should wear it instead of his old coat.And that isn’t the only time they meet.
