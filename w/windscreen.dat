5|$|On 19 January 1939, {{test pilot}} Kapetan Milan Pokorni put the {{prototype}} into a steep dive. When he reached , the <b>windscreen</b> {{detached from the}} aircraft; Pokorni pulled up hard and the strain broke off half of the starboard wing. The aircraft crashed, and Pokorni was killed. An inquiry determined that modifications to the <b>windscreen</b> had contributed to the accident but the main factor had been the pilot's handling of the highly sensitive controls. Engineers recalculated the stress factors on the airframe and they {{were found to be}} safe; the crash was attributed to pilot error and the sensitivity of the controls.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June 2010, 611 C3 Picassos built between January and March 2010 were {{recalled}} due to incorrectly routed fuel pipes, {{which were}} {{believed to have been}} in contact with the heat shield. This fault may have caused chafing and may lead to a fuel leak. The models were built between January and March 2010 and were sold in the UK. On 24 August 2010, all 13,234 Picassos sold in the UK were recalled because the <b>windscreen</b> trim could deteriorate, and could eventually detach, leading to a loose-fitting <b>windscreen.</b>|$|E

5000|$|On 3 March 2011, it was {{announced}} that Trifords Ltd that they had purchased some parts of the former Auto <b>Windscreens</b> business, including the rights to use the Auto <b>Windscreens</b> brand name. See #Auto <b>Windscreens</b> (2011 onwards) ...|$|R
5000|$|As delivered, the Class 4E units did {{not have}} the [...] "eyebrow" [...] {{sunshades}} above the front <b>windscreens.</b> These were later fitted in Cape Town to prevent pantograph grease from befouling the <b>windscreens.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by an {{entrepreneur}} (Brian Holmes) in 1971. It was incorporated on 20 May as Auto <b>Windscreens</b> (Chesterfield) Ltd, as company number 01011907. was part of national <b>windscreens.</b> In 1982 it opened its own manufacturing facility in Chesterfield. In 1986 it was purchased by the holding company, Heywood Williams, whose businesses portfolio at the time included the UK's largest glass distribution company. In 1988 the company was renamed to just Auto <b>Windscreens</b> Ltd, and in 1989 to Heywood Williams Automotive Ltd. Having sold the glass distribution business in 1990 to Pilkington, Heywood Williams sold the Auto <b>Windscreens</b> company to HSBC Private Equity in 1998, for £77.2m, reverting to the name Auto <b>Windscreens</b> Ltd. HSBC left the existing management structure in place, {{with the intention of}} a trade sale or flotation at a later date.|$|R
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated <b>windscreen</b> washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome <b>windscreen</b> decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the <b>windscreen,</b> while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
5|$|Exclusive is {{consistently}} {{the most expensive}} trim for each market, with the biggest choice of engines and features. It is the only model to feature a folding front passenger seat, making the storage space into the whole interior of the car except the driver's seat. Extras for the trim include: tinted windows, rear parking sensors, automatic <b>windscreen</b> wipers, a leather and chrome interior, pollen filter, and dual-zone automatic climate control, which allows for two varying temperature settings simultaneously in the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{the summer}} of 1942 the TRE {{development}} team began experimenting with systems to project the display onto the <b>windscreen,</b> and by October had combined this with an image of the existing GGS Mk. II gyro gunsight to produce a true head-up display known as the Automatic Pilot's Indicator, or API. A single example was fitted to a Beaufighter and tested through October, and numerous modifications and follow-on examples were trialled over the next year.|$|E
5000|$|This station {{underwent}} reconstruction from September 2009 to December 2011. Both platforms were rebuilt {{with new}} <b>windscreens,</b> canopies, and tactile strip edges. A temporary platform over the express tracks {{was used to}} provide service on the side that was under rebuilding. [...] The new <b>windscreens</b> were controversial with nearby community members, since the <b>windscreens</b> contained gaps that allowed trash and noise through while causing privacy issues for residents whose backyards faced the station.|$|R

5|$|The {{pilot and}} gunner/radio {{operator}} sat in tandem, {{back to back}} in a single pressurized cockpit, protected by armour plates to their front and rear, {{as well as by}} a bulletproof <b>windscreen,</b> seated on ejection seats. The aircraft was intended to use Klimov VK-1 engines, a derivative of the Rolls-Royce Nene II, but the engine was still under development, so less powerful Kuznetsov RD-45s were substituted instead. The aircraft carried a Toryii-1 radar for use by the gunner/radio operator.|$|E
5|$|Well you can't believe it, but the Sturmovik, {{which was}} their main ground-attack aircraft, flew like B-17s in {{formation}} and didn't {{attempt to make}} any evasive manoeuvres. And all they had was one peashooter {{in the back of}} each plane. Also, some of the pilots were women. Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't open fire til the aircraft filled my whole <b>windscreen.</b> If I did this, I would get one every time.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit <b>windscreen</b> for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have tan brick <b>windscreens</b> and column-less cantilevered <b>windscreens</b> {{along their}} entire lengths {{except for a}} small portion of the west (railroad north) end. The station has a crew quarters structure over both platforms which is constructed of brick with evidence of covered windows.|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} {{encountered in}} the use of a rotating arm for the generation of wind to test microphone <b>windscreens</b> are presented. Tests on various <b>windscreens</b> of cylindrical and spherical shape, composed of single and multiple sections, indicate that the most effective <b>windscreens</b> are those constructed of several layers of separated sheer nylon cloth. The supporting framework for the cloth as well as the cloth itself, have a marked effect on both the reduction of wind noise and on the attenuation of the desired sound...|$|R

5|$|On 10 June 1990, British Airways Flight 5390, a BAC One-Eleven flight between Birmingham and Málaga, {{suffered}} a <b>windscreen</b> blowout {{due to the}} fitting of incorrect bolts the previous day. The Captain, Tim Lancaster, suffered major injuries after being partially blown out of the aircraft, but the co-pilot landed the plane safely at Southampton Airport. Despite the physical trauma he suffered, Lancaster fully recovered, and five months later he returned to duty. The co-pilot never returned to flying due to the trauma he sustained.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November, the RhAR was {{withdrawn}} {{for a period}} of rest and recuperation (R). The battalion's Transport Platoon was ambushed by communist guerrillas as it was returning to base: a shot through the <b>windscreen</b> of one of the two trucks nearly hit its driver, but the convoy was able to escape the ambush without anybody being injured. On 26 November, the RhAR and the King's Own Scottish Borderers assisted the local police at Kelapa Sawit in an action called Tartan Rock: the security forces moved into the village and arrested 34 communist sympathisers, most of whom were ethnic Chinese students from the University of Malaya in Singapore. Two days later, the RhAR were back on regular duty.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, 29 December, the naked body {{of a young woman}} was found dumped at a lay-by on the A449 near the Worcestershire village of Hawford by a {{motorist}} who had stopped to change a <b>windscreen</b> wiper. Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure it was not that of Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at Yate, Gloucestershire. Smith's body was discovered in February 1996 in Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire.|$|E
50|$|Due to the wideness of Pelham Parkway and {{its service}} roads, the entire station, {{including}} the platform <b>windscreens,</b> canopies, and outer street support columns, is enclosed in concrete over the steel structure. A green trim line runs {{on top of}} the <b>windscreens</b> and no columns support the canopies.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{the station}} was rehabilitated with funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Four {{laminated}} glass <b>windscreens</b> by artist Amy Cheng, commissioned by the MTA Arts for Transit Program, was installed in July 2012. The <b>windscreens</b> were fabricated by Depp Glass, based in Long Island City, Queens.|$|R
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have beige <b>windscreens</b> {{and brown}} canopies with red support frames and columns {{in the center}} and beige, waist-high, steel fences with lampposts at regular intervals at either ends.

5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his <b>windscreen,</b> Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February, British {{pilots in}} Greece celebrated their biggest success in combat. No. 80 Squadron claimed 27 Italian {{aircraft}} without loss in 90 minutes of air combat. Pattle himself claimed three Fiat CR.42s {{shot down in}} less than three minutes. The Regia Aeronautica claimed that day it lost just one CR.42 (as confirmed by Italian pilot Corrado Ricci, a participant in those battles), plus four Fiat BR.20s and two G.50bis. The Italians claimed six Gladiators and one Supermarine Spitfire — none would be in the Mediterranean Theatre until March 1942 — while in fact only one Gladiator of No. 112 Squadron was lost, while two Blenheims, attacked by CR.42s had to crash-land returning to base. In a previous fight south of Vlorë, Pattle had to return to base with the <b>windscreen</b> covered by oil from a shot down enemy bomber. His tally was now 21 air victories.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 July, McCudden had handed his sister an {{envelope}} over breakfast, which was subsequently found to contain all of his medals. Today all of McCudden's medals including his Victoria Cross are displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Gillingham, Kent, alongside those of two of his brothers and his father. The original brass engraved grave plaque used, along with a wooden propeller, are also displayed. The shattered <b>windscreen</b> from McCudden's crashed S.E.5a is preserved {{in the collection of}} the Imperial War Museum. The museum's collections also include McCudden's uniform 'maternity jacket' and a half-length portrait of McCudden by William Orpen. In March 2009, McCudden and his contemporary Edward Mannock, were the subjects of the BBC Timewatch episode, WWI Aces Falling.|$|E
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have beige <b>windscreens</b> and red canopies {{with green}} outlines, frames, and support columns {{in the center}} and black, waist-high steel fences at either ends with lampposts at regular intervals. The <b>windscreens</b> have mesh fences at various points. The station signs are in the standard black name plates with white lettering.|$|R

5|$|Rachel crashes her {{car into}} Adam's on a {{supermarket}} car park. After a brief argument Adam suggests they exchange phone numbers, under the pretence {{that it is}} for insurance purposes. She writes hers on his rear <b>windscreen</b> but rain washes it off. Prompted by Pete, Adam spends {{a day on the}} supermarket car park, in the hope that he and Rachel will cross paths, but they do not meet. At a dinner party held by Karen and David, Karen suggests Rachel get out more and advises her to call Adam. They go on a date but Adam is disappointed that Rachel does not want sex. Eventually, he suggests they see a play, which happens to be on at a theatre near his house. The play is dismal but Rachel decides it is time they slept together. Jenny takes another pregnancy test, but it is negative. Adam arrives and recounts his dates with Rachel to her and Pete, telling them he loves Rachel.|$|E
5|$|The L version {{would not}} be able to enter {{production}} with the DB 600 owing to its use in the Bf 109, and the Bramo engine was rather thirsty on fuel and left the M models with too short a range for reconnaissance use. BMW 132N radials of 865PS were selected instead, which had lower fuel consumption for better range. Another two prototypes with DB 600 engines were produced as the Do 17R-0, but did not enter production. During reconnaissance missions the P-1 was armed with four MG 15s in the A, B and C—Stands. One machine gun was located in the rear of the cockpit, another in the lower rear Bola mount, one facing forward through the <b>windscreen</b> and the other in the nose glazing. In earlier variants the B-Stand (the gun position in the upper rear cockpit) was open to the elements, but the P-1 now provided an enclosed bulb-shaped mount protecting the radio operator from the weather.|$|E
5|$|A {{flurry of}} action followed. On 1 July 1941 he {{expended}} 89 rounds and damaged a Bf 109E. Bader's section was attacked and Johnson out-turned his assailant. Firing, he saw glycol streaming behind it. On 14 July, the Tangmere Wing flew on Circus 48 to St Omer. Losing {{sight of the}} squadron, Johnson and his wingman proceeded inland at 3,000 feet after spotting three aircraft. Turning in behind them, he identified them as Bf 109Fs. Johnson dived so as {{to come up and}} underneath into the enemy's blind spot. Closing to 15 yards, he gave the trailing Bf 109 a two-second burst. The tail was blown off and his windshield was covered in oil from the Messerschmitt. Johnson saw the other Bf 109s spinning down out of control. Having also lost his wingman, Johnson disengaged. Climbing and crossing the coast at Etaples, Johnson bounced a Bf 109E. Giving chase in a dive to 2,000 feet and firing at 150 yards, he observed something flying off the Bf 109's starboard wing. Johnson could not see any more owing to the oil-covered <b>windscreen</b> and did not make a claim. His second victory was probably Unteroffizier (Corporal) R. Klienike, III./Jagdgeschwader 26 (Third Group, Fighter Wing 26) who was posted missing.|$|E
50|$|Production {{started in}} 1962 {{and ended in}} 1993 with 1412 units produced, {{most of which are}} still in operation. This class is {{believed}} to have had the longest production period in the world for electric multiple units.The first units had first class compartments, but units numbered 602 and upwards were produced with only second class. Due to very long production period the series varies between specific production spans. Units up to number 1113 have corrugated sides and three <b>windscreens,</b> units numbered 1114 to 1825 have flat sides and three <b>windscreens,</b> whilst units from number 1900 up to 1953 have flat sides and two <b>windscreens,</b> resembling class EW58 units.|$|R
