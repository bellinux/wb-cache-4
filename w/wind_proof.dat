30|$|Managements {{of sweat}} and heat {{generated}} by sports activity are critical criteria for the sportswear to be competitive in the market. During hot summer, the sportswear is mostly open design but still the material property is very important. To maximize the sweat evaporation, air permeable or quick drying fabric is widely used. At cold weather, as the thermal insulation is important, openness is limited and <b>wind</b> <b>proof</b> material and/or padding material are often used. As a result, material {{is not sufficient to}} remove the sweat and body heat. If there is limited air permeability or no open space in the garment, the sweat by the sports activity will be accumulated and brings about the discomfort such as chilly feeling. In extreme case, at subzero temperature and prolonged exposure, severe damage such as frostbite and hypothermia can be resulted. When the <b>wind</b> <b>proof</b> and/or padding material are used, an effective way to remove body heat and sweat is to incorporate the slits in the garment.

There have been some major developments {{in the construction industry}} but there is still a lot to be done.   This diploma work thesis presents different methods of making existing construction shed establishments to use less energy. What is possible to do and how much energy is there to be saved? A shed establishment consisting of 8 shed units were studied in this project and the building simulation tool VIP-Energy was used to simulate different types of material in the sheds. An infrared camera was used to locate thermal bridges.   There are several factors that can be improved to make a construction shed establishment to use less energy. Replacement of old windows and doors, using more insulation, replacement of old less efficient insulation with new improved materials, using a different heating system, and more. One factor, which is more important than all the others, is to insulate between the 8 different shed units in the establishment. It is also important to make the construction <b>wind</b> <b>proof.</b>   The results show that if you replace the old wall and roof insulation with new better insulation, replace the old windows and doors and seal the gaps between the shed units the total energy reduction would be as high as 60 %.

H 577 P ITC 2015 Xiaoxx, 163 leaves :illustrations (some color); 30 cmPorous fibrous {{materials}} have wide applications {{in many different}} fields including textile fabric, fiber reinforced composite, fuel cells, filtration, thermal insulation, paper products, and tissue scaffold. In most of these applications, {{it is essential to}} optimize the transport properties. For example, permeability, diffusivity and thermal conductivity are the key parameters to affect the optimization of fibrous materials such as minimum permeability for <b>wind</b> <b>proof</b> and minimum effective thermal conductivity for clothing insulation. The transport phenomena in fibrous porous media are complex processes. The understanding and modeling of these processes can lead to the optimization and innovation of fibrous materials. However, the geometric structure of fibrous materials is very complex and difficult to determine. The transport properties of fibrous {{materials have}} been studied for many years, but the effects of the geometric parameters of the fibrous materials on the heat and mass transfer are still to be fully elucidated. Therefore, the current studies are aimed at elucidating the relationship between the transport properties (viz. permeability, diffusivity and thermal conductivity) and the geometric parameters of fibrous materials, obtaining the optimization of the fractal like architecture of porous fibrous materials related to total effective thermal conductivity, effective diffusivity, and effective permeability based on the established theoretical models, and predicting the optimized structure of porous fibrous materials for different applications. The first part of this work was aimed at studying the relative permeability with the effect of capillary pressure based on fractal geometry and the Monte Carlo simulations in the unsaturated porous material. The relative permeability was expressed as a function of porosity, the fractal dimension of tortuous capillaries, the area fractal dimension of pore, saturation and capillary pressure. It was found that the capillary pressure increased with decreasing saturation, and the capillary pressure increased sharply with decreasing saturation at small saturation. In addition, it was shown that the fractal dimensions of wetting phase and non-wetting strongly depended on the porosity of the unsaturated porous material. The predicted relative permeability obtained by the present Monte Carlo simulation was shown to have a good agreement with the available experimental result. Thus the proposed model improved the understanding of physical mechanisms of the liquid transport through the unsaturated porous material. The second part obtained a novel analytical model for the permeabilities of the fibrous gas diffusion layer in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In this model, the geometry structure of fibrous gas diffusion layer was characterized {{in the light of the}} water and gas fractal dimensions, the porosity, the tortuosity fractal dimension, and the pore area fractal dimension. It was shown that the water and gas relative permeabilities have no relationship with the porosity and were a function of the water saturation of fibrous gas diffusion layer only. Besides, it was found that the dimensionless permeability decreased markedly with increasing tortuosity fractal dimension. However, there was only a small decrease in the water and gas relative permeabilities when tortuosity fractal dimension increased. The model calculations were compared with the available experimental results and past models results, and good agreement was found. One advantage of the proposed analytical model was that it contained no empirical constant, which was normally required in past models. In the third part, the optimization of the fractal like architecture of porous fibrous materials related to permeability, diffusivity, and thermal conductivity was analyzed by applying the established theoretical models. In this analysis, the geometrical structure of porous fibrous materials was characterized in the light of the fractal dimension of pore area, the porosity, and the tortuosity fractal dimension. It was observed that the ratio of dimensionless permeability over dimensionless effective diffusivity (Y 3 =(K/D 2 f) /(De/Db)) of the fractal like architecture of porous fibrous materials decreased with the decrease of porosity and tortuosity fractal dimension, respectively, which implied that lower porosity and tortuosity fractal dimension were beneficial to wind/water resistant fabric, as it reduced the ratio of dimensionless permeability over dimensionless effective diffusivity (Y 3 =(K/D 2 f) /(De/Db)), resulting in lower permeability and higher diffusivity. Besides, it was shown that the ratio of dimensionless total effective thermal conductivity over dimensionless effective diffusivity (Y 5 =(keff/kg) /(De/Db)) of the fractal like architecture of porous fibrous materials decreased with the increase of porosity when porosity was lower than 0. 92. On the other hand, it was found that the ratio of dimensionless total effective thermal conductivity over dimensionless effective diffusivity (Y 5 =(keff/kg) /(De/Db)) increased with porosity when porosity was greater than 0. 92. In addition, it was found that the ratio of the dimensionless total effective thermal conductivity over dimensionless effective diffusivity (Y 5 =(keff/kg) /(De/Db)) increased with tortuosity fractal dimension, which implied lower tortuosity fractal dimension was beneficial to clothing insulation, as it reduced the ratio of dimensionless total effective thermal conductivity over dimensionless effective diffusivity (Y 5 =(keff/kg) /(De/Db)). The optimization results indicated that fabrics with more aligned fibers were preferred for protective clothing, as the low tortuosity fractal dimension implied fibers in the fibrous materials should be more aligned. Based on above findings and models, further investigations may be directed towards modifying and improving the established theoretical models for the optimization of the fractal like architecture of porous fibrous materials wherever necessary, fabricating electronspun nano- and micro fibrous membranes for the validation of established theoretical models, and fabricating prototypes of the optimized heterogeneous fibrous materials for clothing, and filters.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the large amounts of CO 2 {{emissions}} the built environment produces, it contributes immensely to climate change. Within the strategies developed to reduce anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, getting buildings to an energy-neutral level {{is one of the main}} priorities. The blueprint for this altered energy-efficient building now seems to be ready: the heavily insulated outer shells of buildings have decreased the demand for energy and the necessary coolness and warmth are induced using low-temperature systems. Whether these changes are enough remains to be seen. The actual, measured energy efficiency of these environmentally friendly buildings turns out to be lower than their theoretical efficiency; they use more energy than was expected up front. This difference can partly be attributed to the increased complexity of and sensitivity to improper use of these buildings. Users simply do not understand them well enough. Improper handling then turns into energy loss. Rebound effects also play a role in the lower levels of energy saving. The rebound effect states that as {{a result of}} higher efficiency, energy will relatively be cheaper. Lower energy bills will lead to a more increased use of warming and cooling, or to extra activities – whether or not polluting – outside the building. The rebound effects make clear that environmentally friendly buildings do not automatically make their users less polluting; the energy efficiency of the building does not change people’s behaviour. One of the results of a survey that was conducted among 414 employees in five, energy efficient, and five more older, and less energy efficient office buildings in The Netherlands subscribes this. The environmental self-identity - which is regarded as the extent to which people perceive themselves to be a person whose actions are environmentally friendly – hardly differs from the office building users in both types of buildings (M = 4. 977, SE =. 069 vs. M = 5. 052, SE =. 075). In order to reduce the rebound effects behaviour has to become more environmentally friendly. Changing behaviour sustainably is hard – because behaviour is based on routines - but it is not impossible. Behaviour is influenced by values that are stable, transsituational and fairly abstract. When the contextual situation changes, these values and the (habitual) behaviour inherent to that specific situation can be re-evaluated. This implicates that in buildings, new contexts should be created: building should change in a more drastic and radical way than the evolutionary improvements made so far. Besides their energy efficiency the new energy efficient building differs little from their energy consuming predecessors. The behaviour can also be changed by strengthen the environmental self-identity of people. Identity is the label with which somebody describes himself and it has a somewhat more flexible character than values have. For example, past behaviour is important for formulating one’s self-identity. It is seen as a cue to future behaviour. When somebody has shown environmentally friendly behaviour in the past, he is more likely to behave so in the future. Changes in the context and ways to strengthen the environmental self-identity match the philosophy of among others Albert Borgmann who states that comfort, and the energy needed for it, will be more valuable when a user is more actively engaged in creating it. By being actively involved in sustainably creating an as ‘comfortable’ perceived indoor climate, people would feel they are behaving environmentally friendly, and having an environmental self-identity. Further, users would get the idea that they could act as a co-designer of that climate, as a result of which they would be more forgiving to it as well. The increased environmental awareness resulting from this would then be the societal gain of a building that seduces its users to a more active involvement in creating the indoor climate. But why would users want to be seduced? In part, this could be attributed to the wish to control one’s living environment. Humans are comfort-seeking beings and when faced with discomfort, will find ways to remove that discomfort. Further, the ‘Theory of Planned Behaviour’ states that before behaviour is being performed, one will evaluate what that behaviour will bring as a return. In other words: will the behaviour lead to a positive or negative evaluation? It is obvious that the desired outcome is related to the professed values. So to be attractive to a diverse public, an activating building should appeal to different values. Improving or sparing the environment alone is not enough however. Saving energy, having financial advantages, having greater control and an improved image can also play a role when choosing the systems, and the thereof arising behaviour. This led to the following research question: What effects does a façade system that activates its users have on their perception of thermal comfort, their satisfaction with the indoor climate, the use of energy and their environmental awareness? Using an on the basis of this question designed activating, flexible, and adaptive façade (AfaF), a new context will be created in a test situation. Starting point is that however radical the facade to this end has to be, at the same time, one must be able to use it in an almost intuitive manner. In this way, the chances of making mistakes while using it will be minimized, and the chances to an actual and intensive use will be increased. When designing and materializing AfaF, the association with clothing is made. Just as when using clothes, extra layers of cloth are applied or removed when the situation inside or outside calls for it. To test whether users actually see through this association, but also whether or not the increased control leads to an increased perception of thermal comfort and satisfaction with the indoor climate, a test pavilion was created. The herein assembled AfaF consisted of four layers: a water and <b>wind</b> <b>proof</b> layer, two insulating layers, and a sun-shielding layer with a low emission coefficient. One hundred and eighty one students and employees of the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, University of Applied Sciences (HvA) have participated in the tests; some of them were allowed to operate the AfaF, others were not. The test results show that the test subjects with control over the AfaF saw it as an effective device to control the indoor climate. Next to effectiveness, one of the starting points in designing the AfaF was that it could be controlled intuitively. The time it cost the test subjects to manoeuvre the façade into the right configuration was thereby taken as a criterion. In the test unit with control over the AfaF, at the start of the test, the AfaF was purposely suspended in the wrong away, considering the outside conditions. The test subjects were then asked to re-configure the AfaF. On average, it cost them less than 5 seconds, which is lower than the ‘norm’. Furthermore, they strongly perceived the indoor climate they created to be a personal achievement. Having control, however, seems to play out less strongly in experiencing comfort and satisfaction with the indoor climate. Only operating the AfaF a second time had a significant influence on the contentment with the indoor climate (F(1. 85) = 8. 168; p <. 05; ƞ 2 =. 088). This contradicts other research that shows that control increases satisfaction. When prevailing temperatures are related to the perception of comfort and satisfaction with the indoor climate, however, both comfort and contentment turn out to score higher than was to be expected. Of the test subjects having control over the AfaF, 17...|$|E
