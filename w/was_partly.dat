5|$|Although {{earmarked}} for operations against the Soviet Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> as a deception measure, and partly because new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, although they were made ready {{in time for the}} actual commencement of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E

The numbers of aircraft to be procured fell from 21 to nine over a course of years, while costs continued to climb.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, Waller and {{two other}} people were chosen to find a {{location}} for Bloomsburg's Rosemont Cemetery. They chose a hill immediately north of Bloomsburg, which <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> his land, so on August 1, 1855 he sold them 2 acres and 33.5 perches of land to the Rosemont Cemetery Company for $490.

5|$|In Citi Bike's {{first three}} years of operations, no one died while riding a Citi Bike. This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> {{attributed}} to the bikes' design, as well as the higher concentration of cyclists on New York City roads before and since Citi Bike's launch.
