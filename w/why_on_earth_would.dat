They've been pacific people for centuries; owning an army {{did not seem to be}} a priority in their values since they're not interested in the concepts of jealousy, domination, or megalomania". [...] However, he wondered, [...] "did their non-violent philosophy serve and help their cause? I don't think so..." [...] The lack of intervention by the world powers was also criticized by Lemay: [...] "The whole world knows Tibet and Tibetan culture is very non-threatening, but nobody puts a real foot down to help them and get the Chinese out of there.

40|$|While {{contemplating the}} qualities that make a great leader and {{specific}} leaders in general, several people began to come to mind. Many of the great leaders of all time were not necessarily “positive leaders. ” Some were famous; others were infamous. Leaders come in all shapes in sizes: Some are loud and aggressive; others say very little and let their actions be their example. Although level of fame does not necessarily dictate {{the effectiveness of a}} leader, it does help in making them more universal—thus having the greatest impact on the masses. The lesser known leaders have to make their impact on a much smaller, but no less important scale. Some leaders we know through history’s recollections; others we may have known personally. George “Buck ” Weaver is not a household word and may never get the credit he truly deserves, yet nonetheless exhibited {{some of the most important}} qualities of leadership. Now unless you are an avid baseball fan, with an appreciation for the history of the game, you may not know who Buck Weaver is. And if you do know who he is, you might be wondering <b>why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> someone <b>would</b> be writing about the qualities of leadership about this particular person—especially in regard to how he is remembered in history. Buck Weaver played third base for the Chicago White Sox. That fact alone does not mean much too many people since there have been countless numbers of White Sox third basemen over the years. But the fact that Buck Weaver was the third basemen for the 1919 White Sox (or Black Sox as they were called) might ring a bell. Eight players from the 1919 White Sox were banned for life from baseball for throwing the 1919 World Series. The starting third baseman for the Chicago White Sox...|$|R

After all, its PISA scores have dropped down the rankings where they now sit {{alongside}} those of many other OECD nations. What does Australia have to offer that differs from the apparently more successful countries in Scandinavia and East Asia that have often {{been the focus of}} policy tourism? One answer is, of course, that PISA is not the be-all and end-all of educational assessment. But another reason is that other factors have overridden ‘PISA envy’ for countries like the US and UK, which are much more similar to each other than they are to either Finland or Shanghai-China. Their continuing mutual interest in each other’s reforms probably lies with shared social and political networks and assumptive worlds – and, of course, a common language with which to describe reforms...|$|E
40|$|<b>Why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>would</b> you do that? For generations this {{question}} has been asked of adolescents by bewildered adults {{in the home and}} classroom. In the Middle: The adolescent brain, behaviour and learning seeks to answer {{this question}} by looking at the latest empirical evidence related to the maturing adolescent brain. Over the last couple of decades neuroscience has provided us with exciting insights into how the brain develops and matures. Significantly, some of the latest research suggests that adolescent behaviour is not just about hormones or nurturing, but is also influenced by changes in the brain as it matures and restructures itself. Following on from his work looking at early brain development, Dr Nagel provides a continuing journey into the developing brain and mind with a degree of clarity to be appreciated by educators, health professionals and parents alike.

40|$|On my {{very first}} day as a {{doctorate}} student, my supervisor Øyvind Fiksen introduced me {{to one of my}} new colleagues, Christian Jørgensen, who enthusiastically told me about his fascination with the Northeast Arctic cod’s spawning migrations. I was immediately intrigued by his eager approach, but most of all by the simplicity of the research question that would form the basis of this thesis. <b>Why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>would</b> some cod choose to swim {{all the way from the}} Barents Sea to Møre, or even to Bergen, to spawn their eggs, when there were perfectly good spawning grounds in Lofoten or Troms, much closer to the Barents Sea? General evolutionary theory would predict that the individuals who undertook spawning migrations several times longer than their conspecifics must be getting something in return. Otherwise, it would be an evolutionary cul-de-sac. Impatiently I started sifting through all the literature I could find, from online articles via obscure reports from the Directorate of Fisheries, to joint Norwegian-Russian conference proceedings from the early 80 s, forgotten in someone’s bottom drawer. Still early in my work, Odd Nakken, a retired fisheries scientist, held an inspirin...|$|E

So <b>why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>would</b> we need another journal? What are we playing at? As editors of this journal our long term {{goal is to}} be instrumental in enabling the development of an effective and accepted paradigm for evidence-based information systems (EBIS) : providing evidence of its value and impact on information systems practice. Drawing on definitions from the health field (Muir Gray, 1997; Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes, & Richardson, 1996) we define EBIS as “an approach to decision making in the design, adoption and implementation of information systems that uses the best evidence available, from both practitioner expertise and systematic research, in consultation with all stakeholders”. In 2013, we argued that to achieve EBIS the information systems (IS) community needed to adopt a seven point agenda to provide the foundations for EBIS (B. J. Oates, Wainwright, & Edwards, 2013).

40|$|Why {{does anyone}} voluntarily {{want to learn}} a foreign language? Really, <b>why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>would</b> someone in Oxford study Japanese? What is {{the whole point of}} this? Of course many answers are given to this question, but mostly these answers are either not very {{profound}} or they are somebody else’s opinion. Of the first type are answers like “I wanted to learn a language totally different from mine” or “I have always been fascinated by Japan”, and of the second type are answers such as “only learning another language makes you understand your own language” (Goethe’s opinion) or “so that I can inform others about my country and its culture (opinion of the Japanese Ministry of Education). While such type of discourse may be fine for small-talk in some quarters, we should avoid it in scholarly discourse on language education. Understanding the motive and the motivation for learning a foreign language is vital for designing language education programs and for understanding learner progress, and also for understanding the lack of progress and the disappearance of motivation. There is nothing “natural” in taking up the effort of learning a new language. It’s hard work, and “naturally” we do not engage in hard work unless it has some sort of benefit for us. What I mean here in concrete terms is this. We do not voluntarily take up work unless it contributes to some extent to our personal welfare or wellbeing. Upon reflection, language is a powerful instrument in either furthering or in hindering our personal welfare. Language, in all its variation, is never socially neutral. The Japanese you speak {{now and in the future}} has implications on your welfare, and on how you maintain or loose your motivation. Knowledge about welfare education will help students and teachers alike to deal with the many difficulties that lie ahead in language learning. Why else for not these difficulties are the overwhelming attempts of leaning a foreign language interrupted, put aside and, let’s talk straight, “failures from the initial plan” to learn and use a new language? Welfare education is a new paradigm which allows us to grasp learning difficulties, to create positive environments for foreign language learning, and for empowering foreign language learners and their specific use of the new language. In this presentation, I spell out both on theoretical and on practical grounds how welfare education works for learning Japanese outside of Japan. I am looking forward to discussing this with students and teachers of Japanese alike. Why does anyone voluntarily want to learn a foreign language? I will give you an abstract answer to this, but this abstract answer should allow you to find your own individual and meaningful answer why you chose to learn Japanese.
