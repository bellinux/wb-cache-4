5|$|After the season, the Giants were {{involved}} in a fight for his services of Taylor with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Generals owner Donald Trump had given Taylor a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan on December 14, 1983, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> he would begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor immediately regretted the decision. The Giants, who were eager to keep Taylor, took part in negotiating his way out of it. To free Taylor from the contract, the Giants had to pay Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons for Trump to release Taylor's rights, and give Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the maximum}} calibre of naval gun allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was 40.6cm (16inch), Hitler soon had second {{thoughts}} about the guns {{to be used for}} the new ships and ordered that they be armed with 38cm (15inch) weapons. However, the 28.3cm turrets were readily available; 38cm turrets would take years to develop, and Hitler wanted capital ships as soon as possible to fulfill his political ideals. He was also reminded that, despite the allowances of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British had historically been sensitive about increases in main gun calibers aboard German capital ships. He therefore acquiesced to the ships' being armed with 28.3cm guns, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> they be upgunned to 38cm at the earliest opportunity.

Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|Although Taylor {{recorded}} nine {{sacks and}} made the All-Pro team {{for the third consecutive}} season in 1983, the Giants struggled. The team went 3–12–1, and Parcells received heavy criticism from fans and the media. Taylor was forced to play inside linebacker for part of the season, a position which allowed him less pass rushing opportunities, when Carson was injured. Frustrated by the losing, Taylor began acting out by arriving late for meetings, and not participating in conditioning drills in practice. After the season, Taylor was involved in a fight for his services between the Giants and the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Taylor was given a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan by Generals owner Donald Trump on December 14, 1983, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> he begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor regretted the decision, and less than a month later attempted to renege. His agent was able to negotiate by meeting with Trump personally and then the Giants which resulted in allowing Taylor to go with the Giants. Taylor got a 6-year $6.55-million package that also included a $1 million interest-free loan. The main results of these negotiations were threefold: 1) Taylor returned the $1 million to Trump, 2) the Giants paid Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons, and 3) the Giants gave Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E

5|$|The trial got {{underway}} on 20 November 1945. Lacking evidence confirming Bormann's death, the International Military Tribunal tried him in absentia, as permitted {{under article}} 12 of their charter. He {{was charged with}} three counts: conspiracy to wage a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. His prosecution was assigned to Lieutenant Thomas F. Lambert Jr. and his defence to Dr. Friedrich Bergold. The prosecution stated that Bormann participated in planning and co-signed {{virtually all of the}} antisemitic legislation put forward by the regime. Bergold unsuccessfully proposed that the court could not convict Bormann because he was already dead. Due to the shadowy nature of Bormann's activities, Bergold was unable to refute the prosecution's assertions as to the extent of his involvement in decision making. Bormann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and acquitted of conspiracy to wage a war of aggression. On 15 October 1946 he was sentenced to death by hanging, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> if he were later found alive, any new facts brought to light at that time could be taken into consideration to reduce the sentence or overturn it.|$|E
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1983 season, the Giants were {{involved}} in a fight for the services of star linebacker Lawrence Taylor—who the team had drafted number two overall in the 1981 NFL Draft—with the New Jersey Generals of the USFL and the Giants. Taylor had been given a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan by the Generals' owner Donald Trump on December 14, 1983, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> <b>that</b> he would begin playing in the USFL in 1988.

With Taylor retained, the Giants won two Super Bowls; in 1986, led by Taylor, who won the league's Most Valuable Player award, they defeated the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI, and in 1990, they defeated the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV. The decision to put football matters in the hands of Young was a key factor in those victories; 19 of the 22 Giants starters in Super Bowl XXI, plus the team's kicker and punter, were acquired after Young took over as GM.|$|E
