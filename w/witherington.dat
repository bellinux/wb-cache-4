25|$|He studied law at Trinity College, Dublin, {{where he}} became active in the College Historical Society debating club, and was elected its auditor in 1785. He {{graduated}} BA in February 1786. He qualified as a barrister in King's Inns {{at the age of}} 26 and attended the Inns of Court in London. As a student, he eloped with Martha <b>Witherington,</b> daughter of William and Catherine <b>Witherington</b> (née Fanning) of Dublin. She would go on to change her name to Matilda, on Wolfe Tone's request.|$|E
25|$|On August 3, 1997, Teddy <b>Witherington</b> (who {{previously}} {{organized the}} London LGBT Pride Event 1991–1997, {{including the first}} EuroPride Festival in 1992) was hired as the organization's first Executive Director. During his tenure, the celebration evolved into a multi-cultural festival and attracted support from high-profile celebrities and sponsors, including the B52s as Main Stage headliners in 2001 and Sir Ian McKellen as Grand Marshal in 2002. <b>Witherington</b> formally stepped down on January 6, 2006 and was succeeded by Lindsey Jones who had joined the staff in 2004. Jones served as executive director through the 2009 event.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of WWII in September 1939 Wanderer was sent to Plymouth Navy Base to join the Western Approaches Command along with her flotilla (Vanity, Vansittart, Volunteer, Whitehall, Witch, <b>Witherington</b> and Wolverine'), then on the 13th she was sent with HMS Whirlwind to escort convoy OB4 on its initial outward journey.|$|E
25|$|Avondale Park {{was built}} for the Canadian Government and {{operated}} by the Park Steamship Co Ltd. The United Kingdom Official Number 175378 and code letters VDDN were allocated. Her port of registry was Montreal, under the British flag. She was later chartered by the Ministry of War Transport, who placed her under the management of <b>Witherington</b> & Etheridge, Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
25|$|The {{women of}} SOE were all given {{military}} rank, with honorary commissions {{in either the}} Women's Transport Service, the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), officially part of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). Skarbek {{appears to have been}} a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945. She was one of the few SOE female field agents promoted beyond subaltern rank to captain, or the Air Force equivalent: flight officer, the WAAF counterpart of the flight lieutenant rank for male officers. Skarbek, like Pearl <b>Witherington,</b> the courier who had taken command of a group when the designated commander was captured, and Yvonne Cormeau, the most successful wireless operator, ended the war as honorary flight officers.|$|E
500|$|Ben <b>Witherington,</b> Professor of New Testament Interpretation at the Asbury Theological Seminary, {{said that}} while the text might {{contribute}} to the study of Gnosticism in the 2nd or 4th century, it should not be considered significant for those studying Jesus in a 1st-century historical context. He further explained that, [...] "during the rise of the monastic movement, you had quite a lot of monk-type folks and evangelists who travelled {{in the company of a}} sister-wife" [...] and that the term [...] "wife" [...] was open to interpretation.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there is}} some debate among Bible translators about the correct reading of Luke 2:2. Instead of {{translating}} the registration as taking place [...] "when" [...] Quirinius was governor of Syria, some versions translate it as [...] "before" [...] or use [...] "before" [...] as an alternative, which Harold Hoehner, F.F. Bruce, Ben <b>Witherington</b> and others have suggested may be the correct translation. While not in agreement, Emil Schürer also acknowledged that such a translation can be justified grammatically. According to Josephus, the tax census conducted by the Roman senator Quirinius particularly irritated the Jews, {{and was one of}} the causes of the Zealot movement of armed resistance to Rome. From this perspective, Luke may have been trying to differentiate the census at the time of Jesus’ birth from the tax census mentioned in Acts 5:37 that took place under Quirinius at a later time. One ancient writer identified the census at Jesus’ birth, not with taxes, but with a universal pledge of allegiance to the emperor.|$|E
500|$|Mainstream evangelicalism has {{consistently}} opposed prosperity theology as heresy and prosperity ministries have frequently come {{into conflict with}} other Christian groups, including those within the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. Critics, such as Evangelical pastor Michael Catt, have argued that prosperity theology has {{little in common with}} traditional Christian theology. Prominent evangelical leaders, such as Rick Warren, Ben <b>Witherington</b> III, and Jerry Falwell, have harshly criticized the movement, sometimes denouncing it as heretical. Warren proposes that prosperity theology promotes the idolatry of money, and others argue that Jesus' teachings indicate a disdain for material wealth. In Mark: Jesus, Servant and Savior, R. Kent Hughes notes that some 1st-century rabbis portrayed material blessings as a sign of God's favor. He cites Jesus' statement in Mark 10:25 that [...] "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" [...] (KJV) as evidence to oppose such thinking.|$|E

2500|$|From 12 to 15 January 1942, Walker joined Vanoc, Volunteer, and the {{destroyer}} [...] {{as the local}} escort of Convoy WS 15, consisting of 22 troopships bound [...] from the River Clyde in Scotland [...] for Suez, Egypt; Bombay, India and Singapore; during {{the first leg of}} her voyage in the Northwestern Approaches. On 17 February 1942, she joined Convoy WS 16 [...] 21 troopships headed for Suez and Bombay [...] in the Clyde to serve along with <b>Witherington,</b> {{the destroyer}} , and a large Home Fleet force consisting of the battleship , the aircraft carriers [...] and , the light cruiser , and the destroyers , , , , , , , and , as escort.

2500|$|This {{is brought}} {{out in the}} 1984 (but not the 2011) edition of the NIV, which renders agapao as [...] "truly love" [...] and phileo as [...] "love". Ben <b>Witherington</b> III {{suggests}} that this indicates [...] "Jesus' gracious condescension to the level that Peter was prepared to respond at this juncture." [...] William Hendriksen argues that in his third question, Jesus is calling into question even Peter's [...] "subjective attachment" [...] and affection, {{and that is why}} it says [...] "Peter was grieved because he said to him this third time..." [...] (John 21:17).|$|E
2500|$|Earlier Peter {{had denied}} Jesus three times. Now, in {{response}} to Jesus' questioning, Peter affirms his love for Jesus three times. William Hendriksen notes some other correspondences between this episode and that of Peter's denial. For example, it is at a charcoal (ἀνθρακιὰν) fire where Peter first denied Jesus (John 18:18), and now is asked to confess his love for his master (John 21:9). Ben <b>Witherington</b> III suggests that [...] "John has the threefold restoration {{take place in a}} setting similar to where the threefold denial did. It's like revisiting the scene of the crime, only this time getting it right." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first Bengal Artillery {{unit was}} raised in 1749. [...] It was {{originally}} titled 1 Company, Bengal Artillery and was quartered in Fort William, Calcutta. [...] The early records of the Battery were destroyed in the sacking of Calcutta in 1749, so the details are limited. [...] However, {{it is known that}} the Battery was commanded by Capt <b>Witherington</b> and consisted of 5 other officers, 4 sergeant-bombardiers, 4 corporals, 100 gunners and 2 drummers. [...] The company, much as like today, was double-hatted; as well as carrying out the normal artillery duties it also performed engineering and labouring tasks.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Ben <b>Witherington</b> III {{points out}} an {{inconsistency}} {{related to the}} James Ossuary. He {{points out that the}} James Ossuary came from Silwan, not Talpiot. In addition, the James Ossuary had dirt on it that [...] "matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem." [...] In his opinion, this is problematic, because [...] "the ossuaries that came out of Talpiot came out of a rock cave from a different place, and without such soil in it." [...] Therefore, he believes {{that it is difficult to}} believe that the one known family member of Jesus was buried separately and far away from Jesus' family.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1940, Volunteer was {{detached}} {{to serve}} under Rear Admiral (Destroyers) in the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands {{and support the}} operations of Allied forces in the Norwegian Campaign, which began on 9 April when Germany invaded Norway. She was assigned to escort convoys between the United Kingdom and Norway. The first of these was Convoy NP 1, the first troop convoy to Norway, which she joined Vanoc, Whirlwind, <b>Witherington,</b> the light cruisers [...] and , the destroyer , and the netlayer [...] in escorting between 11 and 15 April as it crossed from the River Clyde in Scotland to Norway. She escorted similar convoys until 26 April, when she joined the destroyers , , , , and [...] as the escort for the aircraft carriers [...] and [...] during air operations in defence of fleet units at Andalsnes and Namsos, Norway. While thus engaged, she made an unsuccessful attack on a German submarine on 27 April before escorting Glorious to Scapa Flow for refuelling and aircraft replenishment.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 January 1942, Volunteer put to sea {{from the}} Clyde with Vanoc, Walker, <b>Witherington,</b> and the {{destroyer}} [...] {{as the local}} escort of the military convoy WS 15 during its passage of the Northwestern Approaches, detaching on 15 January {{to return to the}} Clyde. Similarly, she departed the Clyde on 23 March 1942 with the destroyers , , , , , , and [...] and the escort destroyer [...] as the local escort for the military convoy WS 17 while it transited the Northwestern Approaches during the first leg of its voyage to the Middle East. After Keppel achieved a radio direction-finding fix on the German submarine U-587 on 26 March 1942, the escorts sighted the submarine on the surface and expended all of their depth charges in attacking her after she submerged. Volunteer shared credit with Leamington and the escort destroyers [...] and [...] for sinking U-587 in the North Atlantic west of Ushant at [...] with the loss of her entire crew of 42. Volunteer detached from the convoy later that day to return to the Clyde.|$|E
2500|$|With {{reference}} to the DNA tests, <b>Witherington</b> wrote in his blog: [...] "he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these folks are interrelated…. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all." [...] This quote clarifies {{the fact that the}} documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the [...] "Jesus son of Joseph" [...] and the [...] "Mariamne" [...] in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. {{that they did not have}} the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.|$|E
