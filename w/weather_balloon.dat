5|$|The wing intercepted Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 Bear bombers on many occasions, {{the first}} of which {{occurred}} off Long Island on 25 April 1975. Many of these incidents involved escorting the Bears to Cuba.

5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a <b>weather</b> <b>balloon.</b> The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent <b>weather</b> <b>balloon</b> position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} people to use <b>weather</b> <b>balloons</b> was Léon Teisserenc de Bort, the French meteorologist. Starting in 1896 he {{launched}} hundreds of <b>weather</b> <b>balloons</b> from his observatory in Trappes, France. These experiments led to his discovery of the tropopause and stratosphere. [...] Transosondes, <b>weather</b> <b>balloons</b> with instrumentation meant to stay at a constant altitude {{for long periods of time}} to help diagnose radioactive debris from atomic fallout, were experimented with in 1958.|$|R

5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big <b>weather</b> <b>balloon</b> filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

25|$|In 1925, Fort Vail {{was renamed}} Fort Monmouth.

25|$|Firstly, the {{underlying}} idea of Bruns has not proved viable (there were needs for refraction observations near the astronomical horizon, which—as Julius Bauschinger could {{show a little}} later—in principle can not be obtained with the required accuracy). On the other hand, the progress in the direct measurement of atmospheric data (<b>weather</b> <b>balloon</b> ascents) has since made the painstaking accuracy of this data from refraction observations unnecessary. In the time between PhD and habilitation Hausdorff completed the yearlong-volunteer military requirement and worked for two years as a human computer at the observatory in Leipzig.|$|E
25|$|Astronaut Gordon Cooper {{reported}} {{suppression of}} {{a flying saucer}} movie filmed in high clarity by two Edwards AFB range photographers on May 3, 1957. Cooper said he viewed developed negatives of the object, clearly showing a dish-like object with a dome on top and something like holes or ports in the dome. When later interviewed by James McDonald, the photographers and another witness confirmed the story. Cooper said military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor the photographers ever heard what happened to it. The incident was also reported in a few newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times. The official explanation was that the photographers had filmed a <b>weather</b> <b>balloon</b> distorted by hot desert air.|$|E

25|$|For over a decade, {{one aspect}} of the climate change story seemed to show a {{significant}} difference between models and observations. In the tropics, all models predicted that with a rise in greenhouse gases, the troposphere would be expected to warm more rapidly than the surface. Observations from weather balloons, satellites, and surface thermometers seemed to show the opposite behaviour (more rapid warming of the surface than the troposphere). This issue was a stumbling block in understanding the causes of climate change. It is now largely resolved. Research showed that there were large uncertainties in the satellite and <b>weather</b> <b>balloon</b> data. When uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets (with better treatment of known problems) are in agreement with climate model results.|$|E

500|$|Forecasters at the SPC {{initially}} {{underestimated the}} atmospheric conditions that would support tornadic development that afternoon and evening; around 4:00a.m. CDT, Doppler radar and wind profile data indicated a [...] jet streak {{along the border}} of California and Nevada, with <b>weather</b> <b>balloon</b> soundings sent up the previous evening by National Weather Service offices in the western United States and numerical computer model data failing to detect the fast-moving air current as it moved ashore from the Pacific Ocean. In addition, the dry line was diffused, with surface winds behind and ahead of the boundary moving into the region from a southerly direction. SPC meteorologists began to recalculate model data during the morning {{to account for the}} stronger wind profiles caused by the jet streak; the data acknowledged that thunderstorms would occur within the Central Plains, but disagreed on the exact area of greatest severe weather risk.|$|E
