5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always {{believed}} that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments neither the State nor the Federal Government has any authority to regulate or censor the content of speech, I have never believed that any person {{has a right to}} give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases.|$|E
25|$|I {{think it}} is up to the states to work out their social {{problems}} if possible, and <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always been interested in seeing that the Negro has a square deal, I have never dissipated my strength against the particular stone wall of segregation. I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and we might as well recognize this.|$|E
60|$|For {{the last}} little <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> even lost, but now redoubling my efforts, I began {{once more to}} {{overhaul}} the chase.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{done with}} the valley of Nethermere. The valley of Nethermere had cast me out many years before, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> fondly {{believed}} it cherished me in memory.|$|R
60|$|KNOX. There {{was nothing}} to do in the office and I thought I'd get in my beauty sleep <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the chance.|$|R
500|$|Eyschen was {{not alone}} in letting his {{principles}} obstruct government business. [...] In the summer of 1915, Eyschen pushed to further reduce the role of the Catholic Church in the state school system. [...] Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde objected. [...] A fervently religious Catholic (as was most of the country, but not her late father, who was Protestant), she was reputed to have said, [...] "I will not allow their most precious heritage [...] to be stolen <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the key." [...] Marie-Adélaïde refused to budge, inviting Eyschen to resign if he could not accept her decision. [...] Eyschen nearly did, but decided to control himself. [...] Nevertheless, he would not be long in the job.|$|E

[...] He hastened on this errand, and quickly returned, having pawned the article for twenty dollars, which he gave to make comfortable my precious babies.|$|E
2500|$|I was not {{involved}} in the struggle for gay rights as a youth. ...I did not [...] "come out of the closet" [...] voluntarily—circumstances forced me out. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no problem with being publicly identified as homosexual, it would be dishonest of me to present myself as one who was in the forefront of the struggle for gay rights. ...I fundamentally consider sexual orientation to be a private matter. As such, it has not been a factor which has greatly influenced my role as an activist.|$|E
6000|$|All this <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{spoken to}} Umslopogaas in a feigned voice, my father, but now I spoke again {{and in my}} own voice, saying:-- ...|$|R
60|$|The {{thing of}} most moment was that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gotten track of Steele. <b>I</b> hurried ahead. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{listening}} back there moments had elapsed and evidently {{he had walked}} swiftly.|$|R
60|$|The {{fellow was}} a marvellous swordsman and evidently in practice, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not gripped the hilt of a sword for ten long {{years before that}} morning.|$|R
2500|$|I find {{in myself}} innumerable ideas of things which, {{though they may}} not exist outside me, can't {{be said to be}} nothing. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> some control over my {{thoughts}} of these things, I do not make the things up: they have their own real and immutable natures. Suppose, for example, that I have a mental image of a triangle. While it may be that no figure of this sort does exist or ever has existed outside my thought, the figure has a fixed nature (essence or form), immutable and eternal, which hasn't been produced by me and isn't dependent of my mind.

60|$|Don Car. I was, lady; but, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> life, I {{will never}} be again.|$|E

6000|$|... "I missed him," [...] {{answered}} Maxwell, with immense relief. [...] "But <b>I</b> {{should not}} <b>have</b> let him <b>have</b> the piece <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the slightest hope of your taking it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{speaking}} Darius brought the pungy {{into the wind}} again, and she was standing directly away from the man we had been so eager to capture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{last time}} I saw Shane {{before his death}} would {{probably}} have been about over a year before hand, and to this day the length of not seeing him once between his passing upsets me more than anything. I wish <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> seen him some how <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the chance, <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> hugged him <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the chance, <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> told him how much <b>I</b> loved him <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the chance. <b>I</b> miss him so much, he was the best dude ever and it still makes me cry to this day that he is not with us.What Shane’s passing has taught me and that I want to pass on to as many people as I possibly can, is to show love to all your homies all the time. You dont relise how important someone is in your life until they are gone. Give your bro a hug, tell him how much he means to you, because one day you wont have the chance.Hand shakes are for Strangers! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not drunk, but dying,' said he. 'But thank Heaven that I {{have seen}} a French officer <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> still {{strength}} to speak.' ...|$|E
60|$|OEdip. Thou {{shalt not}} die. Speak, then, who was it? speak, <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sense to {{understand}} the horror; For I grow cold.|$|E
60|$|Cort. Run, run behind me, {{there you}} may be sure, <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> life, I will your life secure. [CYDARIA gets behind him.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned to}} take Jicks by the hand. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{speaking}} to Oscar {{the child had}} slipped away from me. Not a sign of her was to be seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then don't think I will. I 'm {{a pretty}} poor affair, Polly, but I 'm not mean {{enough to do}} that, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ve</b> got a {{conscience}} {{and a pair of}} hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I always feel--oh, I {{never can}} help feeling," [...] she said, [...] "that nothing {{could happen to}} you, that God Himself could not take you from me, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hold of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|CHARLES. Ay, ay, it's very true; but, hark'ee, Rowley, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> by Heaven I'll give; so, damn your economy! {{and now for}} hazard. [...] [Exeunt.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{suppose the}} fact is, Cuthbert, that <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{flattering}} myself your visit was to me, you really {{came down to}} see Brander?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dears," [...] he said, kindly, as {{they went}} up to kiss him, [...] "I hope nothing disagreeable has {{happened}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two {{years have}} not changed {{you as much as}} they have changed me," [...] Ronald said; [...] "besides, you were busy in {{destroying}} papers, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nothing to do but to watch you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a letter and a paper. The {{decision}} was in his favour. There was practically no defence. There couldn't very well have been in face of the disclosures, and, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a certain sympathy with Ada at first, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> none now." ...|$|R
60|$|No, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{been going}} {{cautiously}} all the <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had confidential agents trickling through the country some time, whose office was to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees, and to gnaw {{a little at}} this and {{that and the other}} superstition, and so prepare the way gradually for a better order of things. I was turning on my light one-candle-power at a time, and meant to continue to do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay {{where you}} are, boy, and keep up heart; <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a pound, your father shall have half of it; {{and you know}} Mark Armsworth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all, mother. It is {{only that}} you are now captain of the ship, and have got to give your orders instead of {{carrying}} them out yourself. Father did not pull up the ropes or go aloft to furl the sails, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no doubt he had plenty to do in seeing that his orders were carried out. You will be worse off than he was, for he had John Wilkes, and others, who knew their duty, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got almost everything to learn." ...|$|E
6000|$|At last Tom said, [...] "Oh, {{where have}} you been all this <b>while?</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been looking for you so long, and I have been so lonely." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{stooped to}} pick up the pieces, rating him for his {{carelessness}} as I gathered them, for <b>I</b> wished to <b>have</b> time to think, although for a long <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> expected this. When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> found them all I placed them upon the table, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|All this <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{gaining ground}} with Mr. Rankeillor, and in {{proportion}} as I gained ground, gaining confidence. But at this sally, which I made with {{something of a}} smile myself, he fairly laughed aloud.|$|R
60|$|Abel {{shook his}} head and stroked his smart beard. I always {{suspected}} that beard of being Abel's last surviving vanity. It was always so carefully groomed, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no evidence that he ever combed his grizzled mop of hair.|$|R
