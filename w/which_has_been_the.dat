5|$|With the cap {{on growth}} {{in the town of}} Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve {{increasing}} demands of tourists. Major development proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.|$|E
5|$|A major {{capital works}} program was also {{undertaken}} to prepare RAAF bases for the Hornets. Over $150 million was spent upgrading the runways, hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF Base Williamtown, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> main F/A-18 base throughout the aircraft's service. The pre-existing airfield at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory was also {{developed into a}} major air base between 1985 and 1988 {{at a cost of}} $215 million so that it could accommodate No.75 Squadron. Until this time the squadron had been stationed at RAAF Base Darwin which, due to its location on Australia's north coast, was vulnerable to damage from cyclones and difficult to defend during wartime.|$|E

5|$|Opinions of the Tribunal {{cannot be}} {{questioned}} by any court. This includes the Tribunal's {{view of the}} validity of any law, the bill of <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of a reference to a Tribunal. This means that although the Tribunal lies outside the normal hierarchy of the courts since it does not hear appeals from any courts, its opinions are binding on all other courts. It is technically open for the President, on Cabinet's advice, to refer the same matter to the Tribunal for its re-consideration.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{is now a}} ruin, and {{all that}} remains above ground is a large grey {{sandstone}} wall, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> only remnant of any building on the site {{since at least the}} early 18th century. It includes two large tracery windows, decorated by red sandstone, which stand out against the grey. Red sandstone also appears {{at both ends of the}} walls, suggesting at least two more windows, and meaning that the wall would have been at least twice the length of the surviving fragment when built. Beneath the large windows are two smaller ones, suggestive of an undercroft, and a flue runs between the sets of windows. The wall fragment is thought to be 14th century, likely dating from the reconstruction in 1354.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the date}} {{specified}} above, more than 300 men had completed their Birmingham career after playing in at least 25 and fewer than 100 senior competitive matches. Several of these took an important role with the club after they retired as players. Harry Morris, who joined the club's board of directors in 1903, was instrumental in planning the St Andrew's stadium, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> club's home ground since 1906. In his role as Birmingham's chief scout in the 1960s, Don Dorman was responsible for recruiting youngsters including Trevor Francis– the first player transferred between British clubs for a £1million fee– and future internationals Bob Latchford and Kenny Burns. Bill Harvey, Arthur Turner and Steve Bruce went on to manage the club. Turner led the team to their highest league finish and to the FA Cup Final in 1956, while Birmingham gained promotion to the Premier League twice under Bruce's managership.|$|E

5|$|In South America, {{especially}} in Patagonia, {{there is an}} active modern sheep industry. Sheep keeping was largely introduced through immigration to the continent by Spanish and British peoples, for whom sheep were a major industry during the period. South America has {{a large number of}} sheep, but the highest-producing nation (Brazil) kept only just over 15 million head in 2004, far fewer than most centers of sheep husbandry. The primary challenges to the sheep industry in South America are the phenomenal drop in wool prices in the late 20th century and the loss of habitat through logging and overgrazing. The most influential region internationally is that of Patagonia, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> first to rebound from the fall in wool prices. With few predators and almost no grazing competition (the only large native grazing mammal is the guanaco), the region is prime land for sheep raising. The most exceptional area of production is surrounding the La Plata river in the Pampas region. Sheep production in Patagonia peaked in 1952 at more than 21 million head, but has steadily fallen to fewer than ten today. Most operations focus on wool production for export from Merino and Corriedale sheep; the economic sustainability of wool flocks has fallen with the drop in prices, while the cattle industry continues to grow.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{continue}} to be featured in modern literature, from the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and following books from The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis, to the comedic Cowardly Lion in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The advent of moving pictures saw the continued presence of lion symbolism; {{one of the most}} iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo the Lion, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. The 1960s saw the appearance of what is possibly the most famous lioness, the Kenyan animal Elsa in the movie Born Free, based on the true-life book of the same title. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in cartoons, such as the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} major {{settlements}} in the county are Dorchester, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> county town since at least 1305, and Weymouth, a major seaside resort since the 18th century. Blandford Forum, Sherborne, Gillingham, Shaftesbury and Sturminster Newton are historic market towns which serve the farms and villages of the Blackmore Vale in north Dorset. Beaminster and Bridport are situated in {{the west of the}} county; Verwood and the historic Saxon market towns of Wareham and Wimborne Minster are located to the east. Lyme Regis and Swanage are small coastal towns popular with tourists. Under construction on the western edge of Dorchester is the experimental new town of Poundbury commissioned and co-designed by Prince Charles. The suburb, which is expected to be fully completed by 2025, was designed to integrate residential and retail buildings and counter the growth of dormitory towns and car-oriented development.|$|E

5|$|True Thescelosaurus remains {{are known}} {{definitely}} only from late Maastrichtian-age rocks, from Alberta (Scollard Formation) and Saskatchewan (Frenchman Formation), Canada, and Wyoming (Lance Formation), South Dakota (Hell Creek Formation), Montana (Hell Creek), and Colorado (Laramie Formation), USA. With {{the exception of}} birds, {{it was one of}} the last genera of dinosaurs, its remains being found as close as 3meters to the boundary clay containing the iridium layer that closes the Cretaceous. There are reports of teeth from older, Campanian-age rocks, particularly from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, but these specimens are not from Thescelosaurus and are much more likely those of Orodromeus. More specimens are known than have been officially described for this genus, such as the Triebold specimen, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> source of several skeletal casts for museums.|$|E
