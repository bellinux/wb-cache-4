25|$|An autobiographical {{memory is}} a {{personal}} representation of general or specific events and personal facts. Autobiographical memory also refers to memory of a person's history. An individual does not remember exactly everything {{that has happened in}} one's past. Memory is constructive, where previous experience affects how we remember events and what <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> recalling from memory. Autobiographical memory is constructive and reconstructed as an evolving process of history. A person's autobiographical memory is fairly reliable; although, the reliability of autobiographical memories is questionable because of memory distortions.|$|E
25|$|Overlapping sub-problems {{means that}} the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any {{recursive}} algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: F'i = F'i1 + F'i2, with base case F1=F2=1. Then F43 =F42+F41, and F42 =F41+F40. Now F41 is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both F43 as well as F42. Even though {{the total number of}} sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems that}} {{on the level of}} the organ, the leaf may be the {{ancestor}} of the flower, or at least some floral organs. When we mutate some crucial genes involved in flower development, <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with a cluster of leaf-like structures. Thus, sometime in history, the developmental program leading to formation of a leaf must have been altered to generate a flower. There probably also exists an overall robust framework within which the floral diversity has been generated. An example of that is a gene called LEAFY (LFY), which is involved in flower development in Arabidopsis thaliana. The homologs of this gene are found in angiosperms as diverse as tomato, snapdragon, pea, maize and even gymnosperms. Expression of Arabidopsis thaliana LFY in distant plants like poplar and citrus also results in flower-production in these plants. The LFY gene regulates the expression of some gene belonging to the MADS-box family. These genes, in turn, act as direct controllers of flower development.|$|E

500|$|Some {{scientists}} now {{consider that the}} effects of global dimming have masked the effect of global warming to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise.

500|$|In 2010, Arjona {{wanted to}} change his musical style; after experimenting with using as few {{instruments}} as possible, he obtained a sound similar to an a capella performance (simplifying his sound) and introduced {{what he called a}} [...] "stripped-down acoustic effort" [...] to his music. This was heard on his twelfth studio album, Poquita Ropa. Arjona produced the album with Dan Warner, who has worked with Shakira, Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera. When promoting the album Arjona said, [...] " [...] are like women; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes, more beauty.

500|$|Asked in February 2017 {{if there}} would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, Cornell replied, [...] "It's always a possibility. I mean, we've been talking about it for at least three or four years now. We were talking about {{actually}} picking dates, and it just ended up not working out because everybody's so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that's taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it's really honestly as simple as <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> having a window of time where it's comfortable for everybody and we want to do it, because I definitely feel like everybody's up for it." [...] On May 18, 2017, Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit after performing at a show with Soundgarden, ending the possibility of a reunion.|$|E
500|$|Philosophers and non-philosophers {{differ in}} their intuitions about what {{consciousness}} is. While most people have a strong intuition {{for the existence of}} what they refer to as consciousness, skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions. [...] Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of [...] "consciousness" [...] <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.

500|$|Before {{beginning}} work, {{the development}} team commissioned {{two pieces of}} music that they felt would inspire the right emotional tone for the game to guide their efforts. They created a number of prototypes, including concepts focused on growing flowers and based around human consciousness. The team decided that a prototype centered on petals floating in the wind best captured the emotions they wanted to evoke. They made keeping the player in a peaceful emotional state their design focus, and removed elements that frustrated players such as petal collection requirements to unlock levels and game mechanics that were too traditional and made the players too excited. The team tried to not place any barriers in the levels, allowing the player to go anywhere in an open world, but realized that without a few guidelines, such as the camera focusing on new flowers or segmenting the levels, players became confused and frustrated. Chen described the process as [...] "almost like we wanted to throw away the traditional game design, but <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> picking up all the pieces we threw away and putting them back because we know those are actually needed to deliver a good guided experience". The overall development time was two years, but the team spent three quarters of {{that time in the}} prototyping stage.

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a B+. The review stated that [...] "untangling this web of shifting allegiances and identities requires intense concentration. Hang on, though; the payoff's worth it". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, noting that it was [...] "X-Files in top form". He praised how the character of Samantha Mulder was presented, saying that [...] "In the seasons to come, <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with enough Samantha's [...] to fill a clown-car, but here, the reveal is shocking, effective, and unsettling"; and also felt that the episode's flashforward cold open was particularly well-handled. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, wrote that [...] "Colony" [...] presents a moral dilemma for the characters, noting that [...] "on the surface Mulder's quest appears righteous, however, {{the results of his}} quest would suggest otherwise", and adding [...] "generally the ideology that focuses on a single life's (be that human or alien) importance is successful, whereas Mulder's ideology of finding the truth at all costs is not". Duchovny's portrayal of Fox Mulder in this episode has been cited {{as an example of the}} character's reversal of traditional gender roles—his openness and vulnerability when confronted with what he believes is his prodigal sister casts him [...] "in a pattern typically engendered as female." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, after Marvel Studios was {{integrated}} into The Walt Disney Studios with Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter, {{it was reported}} that the studios' creative committee would have [...] "nominal" [...] input on the films moving forward, though would continue to consult on Marvel Television productions, which remained under Perlmutter's control. All key film decisions going forward will be made by Feige, D'Esposito and Victoria Alonso. At the end of the month, on how much story is developed for future films of the universe, Feige said there are [...] "broad strokes" [...] though sometime [...] "super-specific things. But for the most part, in broad strokes that are broad enough and loose enough that, if through the development of four of five movies {{before we get to the}} culmination ... we still have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up.</b> So that all the movies, hopefully when they're finished, will feel like they're all interconnected and meant to be and planned far ahead, but really can live and breathe enough as individual movies to be satisfying each and of themselves."

500|$|Following the {{suspension}} of operations at {{three out of four}} BPI plants, members of the media and leaders were invited by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to tour the BPI facility that remained open in South Sioux City, Nebraska. The founders of BPI gave campaign contributions to Branstad in 2010, and to other candidates' campaigns. Branstad stated to ABC News that the contributions were not a factor in his decision regarding having the event. Texas Governor Rick Perry, Nebraska Lieutenant Governor Rick Sheehy, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, and South Dakota Lieutenant Governor Matt Michels, toured the South Sioux City, Nebraska, plant in an attempt to allay [...] "inaccurate information" [...] that they stated as having caused [...] "an unnecessary panic among consumers". The publicity tour emerged with the promotional slogan, [...] "Dude, it's beef!" [...] News reporters were not allowed to ask employees at BPI any questions during the tour. BPI asserts that social media and ABC News [...] "grossly misrepresented" [...] their product. BPI eventually sued ABC News for defamation. On March 28, 2012, Branstad stated, [...] "The problem is, we take this off the market, then <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with a fatter product that's going to cost more and it's going to increase the obesity problem in this country". Safeway and other retailers that have removed the product from their shelves or product lines have stated they will not raise the price of their beef. Branstad also stated that he would recommend that Iowa state public schools continue to use ground beef which contains the product, and stated plans to [...] "send a letter to the state's public schools, encouraging them to continue to buy LFTB".|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle gave {{a largely}} {{negative}} review. [...] "A.I. exhibits all its creators' bad traits {{and none of}} the good. So <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg." [...] Dubbing it Spielberg's [...] "first boring movie", LaSalle also believed the robots {{at the end of the}} film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the [...] "useless" [...] Jar Jar Binks, yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic Albert Einstein. Peter Travers gave a mixed review, concluding [...] "Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future." [...] But he still put the film on his top ten list that year for best movies. David Denby in The New Yorker criticized A.I. for not adhering closely to his concept of the Pinocchio character. Spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film, stating that many of the [...] "so called sentimental" [...] elements of A.I., including the ending, were in fact Kubrick's and the darker elements were his own. However, Sara Maitland, who worked on the project with Kubrick in the 1990s, claimed that one of the reasons Kubrick never started production on A.I. was because he had a hard time making the ending work. James Berardinelli found the film [...] "consistently involving, with moments of near-brilliance, but far from a masterpiece. In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment." [...] Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, [...] "There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began." ...|$|E
