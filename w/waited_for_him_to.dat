25|$|The 2000 Tour de France brought Ullrich, Marco Pantani and Armstrong {{against each}} other for the first time. Armstrong proved too strong and won then and again in 2001. Ullrich crashed in 2001 and Armstrong <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return to his bike. Ullrich cited his failure to defeat Armstrong as why he fell into {{depression}} next year.|$|E
25|$|When Toole {{was unable}} to resume his {{position}} at Dominican in January, the school had to hire another professor. This greatly upset his mother and on January 19, 1969 they had a horrible final argument. He stopped by the house {{the next day to}} pick up some things and spoke only to his father, as Thelma was out at the grocery store. He left home for the final time and withdrew $1500 from his saving account. After a week she called the police, but without any evidence to his whereabouts, they took a report and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> surface. Thelma became convinced that Toole's friends the Rickels knew where he was and called them repeatedly, even though they denied knowing where he had gone.|$|E
25|$|Krishna {{had a large}} force {{called the}} Narayani Sena and was himself a great warrior. Duryodhana and Arjuna thus both went to Krishna at Dwarka to ask for his help. Duryodhana arrived first and found Krishna asleep. Being arrogant and viewing himself as equal to Krishna, Duryodhana chose a seat at Krishna's head and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> rouse. Arjuna arrived later and being a humble devotee of Krishna, chose to sit and wait at Krishna's feet. When Krishna woke up, he saw Arjuna first {{and gave him the}} first right to make his request. Krishna told Arjuna and Duryodhana that he would give the Narayani Sena to one side and himself as a {{non-combatant}} to the other. Since Arjuna was given the first opportunity to choose, Duryodhana was worried that Arjuna would choose the mighty army of Krishna. When given the choice of either Krishna's army or Krishna himself on their side, Arjuna on behalf of the Pandavas chose Krishna, unarmed on his own, relieving Duryodhana, who thought Arjuna to be the greatest fool. Later Arjuna requested Krishna to be his charioteer and Krishna, being an intimate friend of Arjuna, agreed wholeheartedly and hence received the name Parthasarthy, or 'charioteer of the son of Pritha'. Both Duryodhana and Arjuna returned satisfied.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's {{commitment}} to overseeing {{the release of}} the Concert for Bangladesh documentary film prevented him from being able to start on the follow-up to his All Things Must Pass triple album until midway through 1972. Another delay was caused by producer Phil Spector's unreliability, as Harrison <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> turn up {{for the start of the}} sessions. Author Bruce Spizer writes that [...] "the eccentric producer's erratic attendance caused George to realize the project would never get done if he kept waiting for Spector", and by October that year, Harrison had decided to produce the album alone.|$|E
500|$|García Márquez met Mercedes Barcha {{while she}} was at school; they decided to {{wait for her to}} finish before getting married. [...] When he was sent to Europe as a foreign correspondent, Mercedes <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return to Barranquilla. Finally they married in 1958. The {{following}} year, their first son, Rodrigo García, now a television and film director, was born. In 1961, the family traveled by Greyhound bus throughout the southern United States and eventually settled in Mexico City. García Márquez had always wanted to see the Southern United States because it inspired the writings of William Faulkner. Three years later the couple's second son, Gonzalo, was born in Mexico. Gonzalo is currently a graphic designer in Mexico City.|$|E
500|$|On 24 June, Pirlo {{produced}} a Man of the Match {{performance in the}} quarter-finals against England, as Italy won 4–2 on penalties after the game had finished 0–0 in extra time. Pirlo scored in the shoot-out with an audacious chipped penalty down {{the centre of the}} goal, also known as a Panenka. Following the match Pirlo spoke of his eloquent penalty, stating, [...] "At the moment I saw the goalkeeper making strange movements, so I <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> move and hit it like that... It was easier for me to chip it at that stage. Maybe my effort put some pressure on England." [...] Pirlo completed more passes than the entire England midfield, as he managed 131 passes, the most of any player during the match, and the second most in a single match {{in the history of the}} European Championship, behind Xavi, with an 87% pass completion rate, as Italy finished the match with 63% ball possession. He also ran 11.58 kilometres throughout the match, covering more distance than any England player.|$|E

500|$|Arnold Schwarzenegger {{was quickly}} cast. He became {{available}} in February 1996 after Fox's remake of Planet of the Apes {{was held up}} again; Columbus also exited that project to work on Jingle All the Way. The film marks Schwarzenegger's fourth appearance as the lead in a comedy film, following Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Junior (1994). Schwarzenegger was paid a reported $20 million for the role. He enjoyed the film, having experienced last-minute Christmas shopping himself, and was attracted to playing an [...] "ordinary" [...] character in a family film. Columbus initially wanted Joe Pesci to play Myron. Comedian Sinbad was chosen instead, partly due to his similar height and size to Schwarzenegger. Sinbad was suggested for the part by Schwarzenegger's agent, but the producers felt he was unsuited {{to the role of}} a villain as it could harm his clean, family-oriented comedy act and reputation, although Sinbad felt the character would generate the audience's sympathy rather than hate. Furthermore, he missed the audition due to his appearance with First Lady Hillary Clinton and musician Sheryl Crow on the USO tour of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but Columbus <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return to allow him to audition and, although Sinbad felt he had [...] "messed" [...] it up, he was given the part. He improvised the majority of his lines in the film; Schwarzenegger also improvised many of his responses in his conversations with Sinbad's character.|$|E
2500|$|Rabottini took a lead of two-and-a-half {{minutes into}} the final [...] of the stage, but Stefano Pirazzi {{launched}} an attack from the chase group for his second such attack of the stage, having attacked on the Culmine di San Pietro, before he was closed down by other riders. With Damiano Cunego (...) and Amets Txurruka (...) marking {{each other in the}} small group, 's Alberto Losada counter-attacked, and Cunego could not follow his move as Txurruka joined Losada. Losada went clear of Txurruka and Pirazzi and set off after Rabottini, while in the group of overall contenders, Cunego's team-mate Michele Scarponi attacked with only Basso, 's Sergio Henao and Joaquim Rodríguez (...) for company. Rodríguez accelerated further, catching and passing Pirazzi and Txurruka, while team-mate Losada <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> help his team-mate on the climb; he carried on without Losada, catching Rabottini inside the final [...] Rabottini latched on to Rodríguez, and took him {{on the outside of the}} final left-hand turn and beat him to the line for his first victory since the 2011 Tour of Turkey. Rodríguez reclaimed the maglia rosa from Hesjedal, while fourth-placed Henao claimed the young rider classification lead from team-mate Rigoberto Urán.|$|E
