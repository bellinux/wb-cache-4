40|$|An {{interface}} logic circuit permitting {{the transfer of}} information between two computers having asynchronous clocks is disclosed. The information transfer involves utilization of control signals (including request, return-response, ready) to generate properly timed data strobe signals. Noise problems are avoided because each control signal, upon receipt, is verified by at least two clock pulses at the receiving computer. If control signals are verified, a data <b>strobe</b> <b>pulse</b> is generated to accomplish a data transfer. Once initiated, the data strobe signal is properly completed independently of signal disturbances in the control signal initiating the data strobe signal. Completion of the data strobe signal is announced by automatic turn-off of a return-response control signal...|$|R
40|$|An {{optoelectronic}} system generating synchronous, strobed {{sheet of}} laser light developed {{for use in}} making visible flow of air about model helicopter rotor. Used in wind-tunnel tests to determine actual locations of vortices for comparison with locations predicted by mathematical models to validate models. Each blade tip produces vortex. By establishing successive vortex locations, researcher determines trajectory of vortex pattern. Light-sheet strobe circuits provide selection of blade positions, strobe-pulse durations, and multiple pulses per revolution for rotors having two to nine blades. To make flow visible, vaporizing propylene glycol injected upstream of model. System also provides calibrated trigger delay of <b>strobe</b> <b>pulses,</b> adjustable strobe-pulse durations, selectable number of blades, and slip-sync mode to make flow visible as though in slow motion...|$|R
5000|$|BenQ later {{developed}} their own native [...] "BenQ Blur Reduction" [...] technology, integrated into several of their gaming monitors. This offers a strobe backlight which can be easily turned on and off by the user. There is no control over the strobe timing or strobe length for the user, although third party utilities have been produced for this purpose. Newer firmware for the BenQ Blur Reduction monitors allow direct user control over the <b>strobe</b> <b>pulse</b> (timing) and <b>strobe</b> length (persistence) directly from the Service Menu. More customization is available by using a higher Vertical Total (from 1498-1502, depending on what does not cause errors), which effectively tricks the Mstar scaler into working with a larger blanking interval, as if the vertical screen size were longer. This effectively pushes the strobe crosstalk farther down {{the bottom of the}} display, improving strobe image quality, but with some drawbacks (like a faint scanlines effect, also seen in strobe LightBoost mode).|$|R
50|$|MSX {{machines}} used {{a slightly}} {{modified version of}} the port, replacing one of the analog inputs with a second trigger, and the other with a strobe pin. Under normal operation, any Atari style joystick could be used, although it would lack the second trigger button. The strobe pin was used to support mouse input. Electrically, a mouse generates what is essentially a random stream of pulses as it moves. On systems like the ST and Amiga, custom hardware was used to carefully track these in order for the motion to be smoothly followed, as the CPU might become too busy with other tasks to follow the rapid interrupts. Less powerful 8-bit designs did not have the performance to smoothly track a mouse without additional hardware, and the MSX designs, based on off-the-shelf hardware, lacked this ability. Instead, the tracking hardware was moved into the mouse. The mice held two 8-bit values tracking the movement in X and Y since the last time they had been polled. To read the values out, the strobe pin was pulled high four times. With each pulse, a nibble of the two bytes was output on the four directional pins in serial fashion. The <b>strobe</b> <b>pulse</b> also reset the value to zero, starting the polling process over again. MSX mice were expensive, and this led to adaptors for PS/2 style mice, which operated along similar principles.|$|R
50|$|A {{grove of}} slender {{stainless-steel}} rods rises from a plate. This vase vibrates at 30 cycles per second; the rods flex rapidly, in harmonic curves. Set {{in a dark}} room, they are lit by <b>strobes.</b> The <b>pulse</b> of the flashing lights varies--they are connected to sound and proximity sensors. The result is that when one approaches a Tsai or makes a noise in its vicinity, the thing responds. The rods appear to move; there is a shimmering, a flashing, an eerie ballet of metal, whose apparent movements range from stillness to jittering, and back to a slow, indescribably sensuous undulation.|$|R
40|$|The AD 667 is a {{complete}} voltage output 12 -bit digital-to-analog converter including a high stability buried Zener voltage reference and double-buffered input latch on a single chip. The converter uses 12 precision high speed bipolar current steering switches and a laser trimmed thin-film resistor network to provide fast settling time and high accuracy. Microprocessor compatibility is achieved by the on-chip doublebuffered latch. The design of the input latch allows direct interface to 4 -, 8 -, 12 -, or 16 -bit buses. The 12 bits of data from the first rank of latches can then {{be transferred to the}} second rank, avoiding generation of spurious analog output values. The latch responds to <b>strobe</b> <b>pulses</b> as short as 100 ns, allowing use with the fastest available microprocessors. The functional completeness and high performance in the AD 667 results from a combination of advanced switch design, high speed bipolar manufacturing process, and the proven laser wafer-trimming (LWT) technology. The AD 667 is trimmed at the wafer level and is specified to ± 1 / 4 LSB maximum linearity error (K, B grades) at + 25 °C and ± 1 / 2 LSB over the full operating temperature range. The subsurface (buried) Zener diode on the chip provides a low noise voltage reference which has long-term stability and temperature drift characteristics comparable to the best discrete reference diodes. The laser trimming process which provides the excellent linearity, is also used to trim the absolute value of the reference as well as its temperature coefficient. The AD 667 is thus well suited for wide temperature range performance with ± 1 / 2 LSB maximum linearity error and guaranteed monotonicity over the full temperature range. Typical full-scale gain TC is 5 ppm/°C. Microprocessor-Compatibl...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} issue encountered when fusing data {{received from}} multiple sensors is {{the accuracy of}} the timestamp associated with each piece of data. This is particularly important in applications such as Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) where vehicle velocity forms {{an important part of the}} mapping algorithms; on fastmoving vehicles, even millisecond inconsistencies in data timestamping can produce errors which need to be compensated for. The timestamping problem is compounded in a robot swarm environment due to the use of non-deterministic readily-available hardware (such as 802. 11 -based wireless) and inaccurate clock synchronisation protocols (such as Network Time Protocol (NTP)). As a result, the synchronisation of the clocks between robots can be out by tens-to-hundreds of milliseconds making correlation of data difficult and preventing the possibility of the units performing synchronised actions such as triggering cameras or intricate swarm manoeuvres. In this thesis, a complete data fusion unit is designed, implemented and tested. The unit, named BabelFuse, is able to accept sensor data from a number of low-speed communication buses (such as RS 232, RS 485 and CAN Bus) and also timestamp events that occur on General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins referencing a submillisecondaccurate wirelessly-distributed "global" clock signal. In addition to its timestamping capabilities, it can also be used to trigger an attached camera at a predefined start time and frame rate. This functionality enables the creation of a wirelessly-synchronised distributed image acquisition system over a large geographic area; a real world application for this functionality is the creation of a platform to facilitate wirelessly-distributed 3 D stereoscopic vision. A ‘best-practice’ design methodology is adopted within the project to ensure the final system operates according to its requirements. Initially, requirements are generated from which a high-level architecture is distilled. This architecture is then converted into a hardware specification and low-level design, which is then manufactured. The manufactured hardware is then verified to ensure it operates as designed and firmware and Linux Operating System (OS) drivers are written to provide the features and connectivity required of the system. Finally, integration testing is performed to ensure the unit functions as per its requirements. The BabelFuse System comprises of a single Grand Master unit which is responsible for maintaining the absolute value of the "global" clock. Slave nodes then determine their local clock o. set from that of the Grand Master via synchronisation events which occur multiple times per-second. The mechanism used for synchronising the clocks between the boards wirelessly makes use of specific hardware and a firmware protocol based on elements of the IEEE- 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP). With the key requirement of the system being submillisecond-accurate clock synchronisation (as a basis for timestamping and camera triggering), automated testing is carried out to monitor the o. sets between each Slave and the Grand Master over time. A common <b>strobe</b> <b>pulse</b> is also sent to each unit for timestamping; the correlation between the timestamps of the di. erent units is used to validate the clock o. set results. Analysis of the automated test results show that the BabelFuse units are almost threemagnitudes more accurate than their requirement; clocks of the Slave and Grand Master units do not di. er by more than three microseconds over a running time of six hours and the mean clock o. set of Slaves to the Grand Master is less-than one microsecond. The common <b>strobe</b> <b>pulse</b> used to verify the clock o. set data yields a positive result with a maximum variation between units of less-than two microseconds and a mean value of less-than one microsecond. The camera triggering functionality is verified by connecting the trigger pulse output of each board to a four-channel digital oscilloscope and setting each unit to output a 100 Hz periodic pulse with a common start time. The resulting waveform shows a maximum variation between the rising-edges of the pulses of approximately 39 ¥ìs, well below its target of 1 ms...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{microwave}} transmitter {{and receiver}} circuits {{have been developed for}} implementing UWB (Ultra-Wideband) impulse radar imaging sensor operating in frequency band 0. 2 to 4 GHz. with tunable operating frequency band. The fundamental system design parameters such as the required transmitting pulse power and the pulse duration were estimated for a presumed specific application, the pavement assessment. The designed transmitter is the tunable monocycle pulse generator with tuning capability for the output pulse duration from 450 - to 1200 - ps, and has relatively high transmitting pulse power from 200 to 400 mW. Tuning of the pulse duration was implemented by novel PIN diode switch configuration and decoupling circuit, and boosting of transmitting pulse power was made possible by using a high power pulse driving circuit and SRD coupling circuit. The synchronous sampling receiver system was designed by using the integrated sampling mixer and two reference clock oscillators placed in the {{transmitter and receiver}} respectively for timing control. A novel integrated CSH (Coupled-Slotline Hybrid) sampling mixer has been developed along with the design of the <b>strobe</b> <b>pulse</b> generator appropriate for the impulse radar system. The integrated sampling mixer has unprecedented conversion loss of 2. 5 dB for the pulse signal, bandwidth 5. 5 GHz, and dynamic range 50 dB. The introduced UWB LNA (Low Noise Amplifier) design operating up to 4 GHz should be useful for weak signal detection applications. The design of the UWB microstrip quasi-horn antenna was optimized for short pulse transmission with respect to the input return loss and the pulse stretching effect. For signal detection in the signal processing stage, the background subtraction technique and B-scan data format were used. A novel signal monitoring technique was introduced in the signal processing to compensate the frequency modulation effect of the reference clock. The test results for the complete system with respect to some sample multi-layer structures shows good receiving pulse waveform with low distortion, enough pulse penetration depth for 13 ?? pavement sample structure, and minimum 1 -in of range resolution...|$|R

Chris Tucker from Billboard explained that [...] "Madonna {{returns with a}} song that will restore faith among her minions, fans of pop music and radio programmers". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that Madonna kept her pop touch in [...] "Hung Up" [...] and called it a love song which is both happy as well as sad. Alan Light from Rolling Stone called the song candy coated. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly {{was impressed by the}} song and said [...] "'Hung Up' shows how effortlessly she [...] can tap into her petulant inner teen". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine compared the song to the remix of Gwen Stefani's 2004 single [...] "What You Waiting For?". Ed Gonzalez from the same magazine called the song the biggest hit of her career. Margaret Moser from The Austin Chronicle said that the song <b>strobes</b> and <b>pulses</b> along with another album track [...] "Forbidden Love". Peter Robinson from The Guardian commented that [...] "Hung Up" [...] is Madonna's [...] "most wonderfully commercial single since the mid Eighties". Alexis Petridis from The Guardian said that the song could have been more campy by addition of Liza Minnelli inspired vocals in the background and lyrics which talk about Larry Grayson.|$|R
2500|$|In early 1974 Split Enz {{undertook}} {{a series of}} radio-sponsored [...] "Buck-A-Head" [...] ($1 per head entry) shows which played in theatres rather than in pubs or clubs. Taking advantage of this, Phil and Tim decided that, rather than slogging {{it out on the}} traditional pub circuit, they would now only perform in theatres and concert halls, which were better suited to the band's unique performance style and enabled them to stage a full theatrical presentation. Under Noel Crombie's guidance the band developed elaborate sets, costumes, hairstyles and makeup, [...] and performances were punctuated by odd happenings. At one concert, they brought Rayner's auntie on stage to perform an impromptu tap dance during one of the songs and this was a great success, but they realised that they couldn't really take her on tour with them, so it Crombie's spoon playing routine was substituted and soon became an essential part of each show. For an early NZ TV performance with a [...] "desert island" [...] theme they brought in a load of sand and created a miniature indoor beach, complete with palm trees and a wading pool, with band members dressed as hankie-hatted tourists, reclining on deck chairs and sipping drinks. For another now-legendary live performance of their live epic [...] "Stranger Than Fiction", a female friend was recruited to crawl across the stage during the song, under <b>pulsing</b> <b>strobe</b> lights, with a bloodied axe apparently embedded in her skull.|$|R
