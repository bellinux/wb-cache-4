5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow <b>with</b> <b>time</b> while others decay <b>with</b> <b>time.</b> Among those that grow <b>with</b> <b>time,</b> some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly <b>with</b> <b>time</b> due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase <b>with</b> <b>time,</b> though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E
