Morphdb. hu is {{the outcome of}} a severalyear collaborative effort and represents the resource with the <b>widest</b> coverage and <b>broadest</b> <b>range</b> of applicability presently available for Hungarian. The grammar resource is the formalization of well-founded theoretical decisions handling inflection and productive derivation. The lexical database was created by merging three independent lexical databases, and the resulting resource was further extended. 1...|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st century, ties widened to 3+1/2 to 3+3/4 in <b>wide,</b> with a <b>broad</b> <b>range</b> of {{patterns}} available, from traditional stripes, foulards, and club ties (ties with a crest or design signifying a club, organization, or order) to abstract, themed, and humorous ones. The standard length remains 57 in, though other lengths vary from 117 cm to 152 cm. While ties as wide as 3+3/4 in inches are still available, ties under 3 in wide also became popular, particularly with younger men and the fashion-conscious. In 2008 and 2009 the world of fashion saw a return to narrower ties.|$|R
40|$|Looking at the {{frequently}} used English words on billboard ads in Jakarta main streets, one {{may have a}} presumptive thought that English will dominate Indonesian language. The assumption, though, {{has led to the}} analysis of the role of both languages on billboard ads and the possibility of English control over Indonesian. The study presented purposive language uses. English, regardless of its incorrect use, was associated with the Indonesian modern, urban and youth’s lifestyle, hence the prestigious status of English. On the other hand, Indonesian and its dialects, particularly the Betawi-Indonesian, are employed to cover <b>wider</b> and <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> of audience. Indonesian language is a national identity of Indonesians, and has historically gained highest status among hundreds of local languages in Indonesia. Thus, in spite of the presence of English in Indonesian language use, the former will not diminish the latter. As a matter of fact, the two languages serve dif- ferent types of readers...|$|R

40|$|The Luria Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery (LNNB) was {{administered}} {{on a group}} of 40 schizophrenic patients, 30 brain damaged subjects and 30 normal controls. The data were analysed using SPSS software. Discriminant function analysis results suggested overall hit rate of 77 %. On MANOVA all the clinical scales of the LNNB were found to discriminate significantly amongst the groups. The schizophrenic patients performed better than brain-damaged but had poor performance in comparison to normal controls. The findings indicated high discriminative accuracy and clinical effectiveness of the LNNB in Indian population. Attempts to outline neuropsychological aspects of specific psychiatric disorders have grown geometrically since mid 1970 's (Dean, 1985; Levin et al., 1989). Neuropsychological test have been found to have several advantages over neurological instruments. First these have a <b>wider</b> sensitivity to <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> of problems than individual neurological tests (Filskov &...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{characterization}} of melanin using analytical methodologies {{has proved to}} be difficult due to its heterogeneity, insolubility in <b>wide</b> pH and <b>broad</b> <b>range</b> of solvents. The present study was undertaken to characterize melanin extracted from an environmental Aspergillus fumigatus AFGRD 105 by studying its genes, chemical properties and spectral data. A gene based approach to confirm the type of melanin carried out indicated the extracted melanin to be of the dihydroxynaphthalene type. On comparison with synthetic melanin, UV–Vis and IR spectra of the extracted melanin revealed characteristic peaks that can be further used for confirmation of DHN-melanin extracted from any source. Solid state 13 C NMR spectroscopy established the presence of the hydroxyl-naphthalene moiety and validated the results obtained by genetic analysis. The correct assignment of the observed spectral frequency characteristic of functional groups can be further adapted in future works that deal with binding capacities and biomolecule systems involving melanin...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} advancement in terahertz radiation sources in the past decade, making milliwatt terahertz power levels accessible in both continuous-wave and pulsed operation. Such high-power terahertz radiation sources circumvent the need for cryogenic-cooled terahertz detectors such as semiconductor bolometers and necessitate the need for new types of calibrated, room-temperature terahertz detectors. Among various types of room-temperature terahertz detectors, pyroelectric detectors {{are one of the most}} widely used detectors, which can offer <b>wide</b> dynamic <b>range,</b> <b>broad</b> detection bandwidth, and high sensitivity levels. In this article, we describe the calibration process of a commercially available pyroelectric detector (Spectrum Detector, Inc, SPI-A- 65 THz), which incorporates a 5 mm diameter LiTaO 3 detector with an organic terahertz absorber coating...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the design and {{creation}} of interactive multimedia systems is a difficult and challenging task. Most interactive multimedia systems differ from conventional computer systems by being functionally more complex and by addressing a <b>wider</b> and <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> of inexperienced or novice users. The increased complexity in functionality is often a result of integration, time variation, and navigation. Furthermore, years of research within software engineering shows that improvements in software design processes require systematic work practices that involve well-founded methods. This paper reports from an empirical study of a conventional software analysis and design for the design of an interactive multimedia system. The primary purpose of the study is to investigate software engineering concepts for the design of interactive multimedia systems. The actual activities and concepts of the method are empirically evaluated against a typical desktop-based interactive multimedia system and weakness and strength of the analysis and design are discovered. It is concluded that more software engineering concepts are not well suited for interactive multimedia systems design. The main reason is that more of the concepts are intended for the analysis and design of work processes in a given, specific work environment. However, the rigid focus on work processes and tasks is useless since the complexity of the future system is not hidden in work tasks. The challenge of designing a coherent and affective interactive multimedia system lacks conceptual support and foundation. It is indicated that future analysis and design methods need to address other aspects of systems design than previous methods. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{are living}} in a converged world. We can at last put behind us the debate over whether {{convergence}} is about one device, multiple devices or multiple distribution channels. And thankfully television is not dead. However, while convergence offers flexibility and convenience, we may have in the process of getting to convergence reduced our ability to think creatively and innovate. As distribution of content has broadened {{to a wide variety of}} platforms, the ability to provide a richer and deeper experience may have been diminished. And while the economic pie may not have grown and content budgets have to be stretched across an ever <b>wider</b> or <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> of platforms, audiences for this content have diversified and multiplied. Today, I want to touch briefly on whether organisations have changed sufficiently to accommodate these platforms, in particular the television industry, and what are the consequences if any if they haven 2 ̆ 7 t or they don 2 ̆ 7 t. How well are our communications leaders adapting to this new environment? Can our content makers reach these new audiences and are the content budgets being stretched too far in order to accommodate more platforms? What role do advertisers play? And how do we compete with global organisations such as Google and Bebo. Is the key to success to think global act local? In what areas can and do we succeed? These are all really big questions and while I will try to attempt to answer some of them in the next half hour I hope what I do is to stimulate debate and discussion about the best ways to address the...|$|R
