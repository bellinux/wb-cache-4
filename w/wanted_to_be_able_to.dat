5|$|Day {{focussed}} on the girls' education, in {{the style}} of Emile. He expanded on the teaching they had received from the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.|$|E
5|$|On {{becoming}} king in 548, Thurisind immediately {{found himself}} in a difficult situation. Sometime during 546–548, the Byzantine Empire had conspired to convince the Lombards under Audoin to move into Pannonia (modern Hungary), a former Roman province bordering the Danube river. Justinian hoped this would keep open the land route from the Balkans to Italy while containing the Gepids, who he considered a serious menace to Byzantine interests on the Balkan frontier. The Gothic War between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines had been raging on the Italian peninsula since 535; Justinian <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> rush troops to Italy if they were needed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{independent}} and major record labels {{bid for the}} right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> put the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100,000 records. Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate.|$|E

5|$|The Menzies {{government}} {{was reluctant to}} choose as interim replacement the A-5 or the F-4, {{which could not be}} deployed until 1966 and would cost A$120–180 million. Waiting for the TSR-2 or TFX in 1969 or 1970 seemed to pose great risk, but when considering Hancock's findings in September 1963 it <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> offer a substantial response to the Labor party's criticism of its defence strategy. The British and American governments competed on behalf of their nations' unbuilt bombers, as both believed that export sales would increase domestic support for the aircraft. The Menzies government viewed the British promise to deploy a squadron of V bombers in Australia for interim defense until the TSR-2 was ready as unacceptable for both technical and political reasons. Beyond its cost, the Royal Air Force had not ordered the TSR-2; the Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Louis Mountbatten, who opposed it, advised the Australians against buying the aircraft and the RAAF feared being the only customer.|$|E

Tribes fought the states in an effort both to maintain tribal sovereignty and to protect Indian gaming revenues to support economic development.

He was born left-handed but <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> play shortstop like Vizquel. Thus, at nine, he taught himself to throw right-handed as well.

500|$|According to Sestero and Greg Ellery, Wiseau {{came to the}} Birns and Sawyer film lot, {{rented a}} studio, and bought a [...] "complete Beginning Director package," [...] which {{included}} the purchase of two brand new film and HD cameras. Wiseau, confused {{about the differences between}} 35 mm film and high-definition video, decided to shoot the entire film in both formats simultaneously, using a custom-built apparatus that housed both cameras side-by-side and required two crews to operate. Commenting on his decision to shoot the film in this way, Wiseau said that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> say that he was the first director to film an entire movie simultaneously in two formats, although ultimately only the 35mm footage was used in the final edit.|$|E

The size of the restrictor plate was reduced by [...] and the cars were required to run with softer springs and a smaller rear spoiler. These changes were intended to reduce the effectiveness of two-car style drafting and to make the cars more challenging to turn.

[...] "They really fought hard for and {{won the right to}} make an R-rated movie." [...] Paramount executives went as far to prepare graphs displaying how much more money a PG-13-rated South Park feature would perhaps accumulate. The William Morris Agency, which represented Parker and Stone, pushed for movie production to begin as soon as possible, while public interest was still high, instead of several years into its run, as was done with Beavis and Butt-head Do America, possibly because Beavis and Butt-head and South Park were owned by Viacom Global Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom after Doug Herzog left Viacom Media Networks on January 12, 2017.|$|E
500|$|After the {{negative}} {{experience with the}} preceding , which were too weak to engage foreign battleships, and too slow to catch cruisers, the Italian navy wanted a new battleship that returned to a larger, more effective size. In particular, they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> challenge the new s being built in neighboring Austria-Hungary. They returned to the [...] gun that was standard in most other navies of the day, but sacrificed armor protection to achieve high speed.

Benedetto Brin initially wanted to arm the ships with only two of the 12-inch guns and twelve [...] guns, but after his death, Admiral Ruggero Alfredo Micheli altered the design to double the number of 12-inch guns, at the expense of eight of the medium-caliber pieces.|$|E

Since Musker and Clements <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> move [...] "the camera around a lot like Steven Spielberg or James Cameron," [...] the delay in production was beneficial since [...] "the technology had time to develop in terms of really moving the camera."

500|$|McCartney's {{father was}} a trumpet player and pianist, who had led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an upright piano in the front room, {{encouraged}} his sons to be musical and advised Paul to take piano lessons, but Paul preferred to learn by ear. He gave Paul a nickel-plated trumpet for his fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, McCartney traded it for a £15 Framus Zenith (model17) acoustic guitar, since he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> sing while playing. He {{found it difficult to}} play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings. McCartney wrote his first song, [...] "I Lost My Little Girl", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] on the piano.
