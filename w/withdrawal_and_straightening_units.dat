Storage reservoirs, as well as water <b>withdrawal</b> (<b>and</b> return of heated water, respectively) affect temperature profiles and sediment load. Fragmentation, channelization <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> of rivers accelerate clogging and restrain fish from upward migration and evacuation to more suitable habitats.|$|R
40|$|ESAB is a {{world leader}} in {{production}} of welding consumables and equipment. The company manufactures, among other things, welding electrodes. A roller <b>straightening</b> <b>unit</b> {{is used in the}} cutting process to straighten the wire, which the welding electrode consists of, by adjusting some of the rollers during operation. According to ESAB’s standard and the European machinery directives, moving parts of machinery, such as rollers of the roller <b>straightening</b> <b>unit,</b> must be out of the operator’s reach. Guards and protective devices should achieve their safety function with minimal downtime and the least reduction in productivity. The main purpose with this project is to draw up protection device proposals for roller <b>straightening</b> <b>units</b> <b>and</b> based on drawings implement one suitable concept...|$|R

40|$|Regarding <b>straightening</b> <b>unit</b> as the {{research}} object, considered the different of roller spacing, {{a mathematical model}} of intermesh schedule suitable to the 2800 seven-roller strong heavy plate straightening machine was deduced by the geometric method. According to the mathematical model, the intermesh schedules of several specifications of plate were calculated, and the finite element model of straightening process {{was established in the}} finite element analysis software Abaqus. By analysing, it was found that those plates after straightening cannot meet the requirement of flatness, due to the existence of the work hardening. The bending deflection of the last <b>straightening</b> <b>unit</b> was modified <b>and</b> the new calculation formula of intermesh schedule was obtained. The values of the modified coefficients were determined by the finite element method. The intermesh schedules of other specifications of plate were calculated by the modified calculation formula and then verified it in Abaqus. The simulation results showed that those plates after straightening meet the requirement of flatness. So, {{the research}} results provide a theoretical basis for development of a new plate <b>straightening</b> machine <b>and</b> formulation of intermesh schedule...|$|R

30|$|The MAC {{external}} fixation {{system is}} a versatile approach to upper limb deformities, and {{it is capable of}} correction of carpal translation for wrist stabilization while improving hand and limb function, in addition to gradual lengthening. This series of three cases represents the unique utilization of the MAC fixator in treating four different aspects of treatment of the radial club hand deformity: the fixator system may be used for ulnar lengthening <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> after previous wrist centralization (Patient 1), for ulnar lengthening <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> {{in the case of an}} unstable wrist (Patient 2), for wrist distraction and centralization preceding fusion (Patient 2), and simultaneous ulnar lengthening <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> with wrist stabilization (Patient 3).|$|R
40|$|Improving the {{economic}} environment <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> out {{the economic}} order and deepening reform {{are the two}} major tasks in Chinese economic work at the present time.

It pointed out that "improvement <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> out" were necessary to create conditions for deepening the reform, and that in implementing the former course, the latter needed to coordinate with it. Neither of the two are our aims, only means to enable the economy to develop in a sustained, stable, and coordinated way. ...|$|R
