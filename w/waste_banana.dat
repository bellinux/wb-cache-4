50|$|Banana flour {{production}} {{has been offered}} {{as a solution to}} high rates of <b>waste</b> among <b>banana</b> crops by both researchers and officials of various countries. Many unripe green bananas are culled and thrown out as unsuitable for sale or export. These culled green bananas are still suitable for banana flour production and, if used for this purpose, would significantly reduce <b>waste</b> in <b>banana</b> production. Thus banana producers will be able to secure greater profits from their crops, the environmental impact of those crops would be reduced, and world food production would be increased as a once wasted food stuff would now be utilized. Chilean officials have started production of an overripe banana flour made from overripe banana peels and the overripe banana fruit. This reduces <b>waste</b> by utilizing <b>bananas</b> typically thrown out when unsold or accidentally over ripened, which can occur to as much as 20% of bananas brought to market. In these ways, banana flour can reduce waste on both ends of banana crop production.|$|R

Individual OFMSW components were placed into nylon mesh bags and subjected to various fermentation periods (solids retention time, SRT) within the inlet of a functioning plug-flow biogas fermentor.

Phytoremediation of this polluted soil with non-edible plant like Jatropha curcas offers an environmental friendly and cost-effective method for remediating the polluted soil. In this study, phytoremediation of soil contaminated with 2. 5 and 1 (w/w) waste lubricating oil using curcas and enhancement with organic <b>wastes</b> <b>Banana</b> skin (BS), brewery spent grain (BSG) and spent mushroom compost (SMC) was undertaken for a period of 180 days under room condition. 56. 6 % and 67. 3 % loss of waste lubricating oil was recorded in Jatropha remediated soil without organic amendment for 2. 5 % and 1 % contamination, respectively. However addition of organic waste (BSC) to Jatropha remediation rapidly increases the removal of waste lubricating oil to 89. 6 % and 96. 6 % in soil contaminated with 2. 5 % and 1 % oil, respectively. Jatropha root did not accumulate hydrocarbons from the soil, but the number of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria was high in the rhizosphere of the Jatropha plant, thus suggesting that the mechanism of the oil degradation was via rhizodegradation. These studies have proven that J. curcas with organic amendment has a potential in reclaiming hydrocarbon-contaminated soil. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} assess the quality of co-composted {{shredded}} Municipal Solid Wastes (MSW) with fishery <b>wastes,</b> <b>banana</b> mulch <b>wastes</b> and aerobically composted slaughterhouse wastes. They are most common in Southern Lebanon and are likely candidates to investigate the carbon and nitrogen amendments to the MSW. The overriding goal {{of this study is}} to make the co-composting method as practical as possible for ordinary people to reproduce it in natural field settings by using a low cost technology and a good quality fertilizer. At a low maintenance cost, three initial trials were executed in this study to optimize the composting process of these waste ingredients. The objective of the first two trials was to evaluate composting processes in two different bioreactors and using the two different mix ratios of co-composted waste material. However the third trial`s objective was to develop and validate the composting process of 4 different waste mix combinations by using commercially available plastic barrels as self-heating bioreactors. The evaluations are focused on process indices during composting and chemical indices of carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio of the final compost. A mathematical optimization model is presented. Components of the composting are estimated in order to satisfy C/N ratio in the range between 20 and 30. The chosen ideal weight of the composting is 25 kg. Output data of optimizatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} of fructo-oligosaccharides from banana peels was aimed in this study. Experimental parameters were particle size, solvent type, temperature (40 - 600 C) and time (10 - 210 minutes). 30 % of yield was obtained when optimum sized peels (2 * 7 * 10 mm) were extracted with pure acetone at relatively low temperature (500 C) during 90 minutes. Total fructo-oligosaccharide content was found nearly 33 % {{of the sugar}} components of the extracts, and nystose was absent. The degree of polymerization was {{lower than those of}} other fructo-oligosaccharide containing plants (< 6). It was concluded that GRAS-statued fructo-oligosaccharides can be produced from a solid <b>waste,</b> a <b>banana</b> peel...|$|R
40|$|The aim ofthis {{research}} is to investigate the influence offermented <b>banana</b> <b>waste</b> (FBVV) utilization in broilerfeeding that could be enriched by starbio probiotic. Fermented FBW by Rhizopus oligosphorus {{was used in this}} study. Tests were carried out by mean of the complete randomized design (CRD) with 5 treatments and 4 repetitions. In addition, variation between the treatments was observed by applying Duncant Multiple Range Test. Five treatments for each feed composition were set to without FBW (A), 20 % ofFBW+O, 25 % starbio probiotic (8), 30 % ofFBW+ 0, 25 % starbio probiotic (e), 40 % of FBW+O, 25 % starbio probiotic (D) and 50 % of FBW+ 0. 25 % starbio probiotic (E) respectively. Results showed that FBW utilization is having very significant influence to improving broiler performance such as body weight and feed consumption (P 0, 05). Therefore, the fermented <b>banana</b> <b>waste</b> could be appropriately used up to 30 % ofbroilerfeed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAiming for {{sustainable}} and low-cost production, bioethanol production using lignocellulosic wastes, such as sugarcane bagasse and <b>waste</b> from <b>banana</b> crops, {{has been extensively}} explored. The recovery step is usually carried out during the distillation process and is challenging, particularly regarding energy issues. This study aimed to evaluate the bioethanol recovery from <b>banana</b> culture <b>waste</b> {{as a function of}} the reflux ratio in a process employing a batch distillation column. Tests were performed using a standard mixture of ethanol and water and using total reflux and ratios 0. 5, 1 and 2. As expected, the best result was obtained with the highest reflux ratio, and it was under this condition that the broth obtained from the fermentation process was distilled. The maximum ethanol t in the distillate was 67 % (wt%), which is less than the 93 % composition that was obtained using the standard mixture; however, this is a promising result because inferior values are typically obtained in distilleries using a single column. Also, this value is close to others reported in literature for bioethanol distillation obtained with different residues and higher reflux ratio. Batch distillation is appropriate and feasible for implementation in the production of bioethanol from <b>banana</b> <b>waste</b> in small production units intended for the production of biofuels, beverages or commercial alcohol...|$|R
