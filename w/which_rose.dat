5|$|Arabian horses also {{spread to}} the rest of the world via the Ottoman Empire, <b>which</b> <b>rose</b> in 1299. Though it never fully {{dominated}} the heart of the Arabian Peninsula, this Turkish empire obtained many Arabian horses through trade, diplomacy and war. The Ottomans encouraged formation of private stud farms in order to ensure a supply of cavalry horses, and Ottoman nobles, such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt also collected pure, desert-bred Arabian horses.|$|E

Healthcare premium cost increases in the employer market continued to moderate. For example, healthcare premiums for those covered by employers rose by 69% from 2000-2005, but only 27% from 2010 to 2015, with only a 3% increase from 2015 to 2016.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian rule in Palestine {{resulted}} {{in the destruction of}} Acre and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated.

5|$|A further legacy saw {{the sales}} of Fleming's novels rise sharply {{after the release of}} Dr. No and the {{subsequent}} films. In the seven months after Dr. No was released, 1.5 million copies of the novel were sold.

Between the years 1962 to 1967, a total of nearly 22.8 million Bond novels were sold.|$|E

Under Fandi, SAFFC ended the 2001 season without winning a trophy and were 2002 S.League champions by a 20-point margin. Fandi then simultaneously served as assistant national coach, helping Singapore win the Tiger Cup in 2005, and coach of the Young Lions, <b>which</b> <b>rose</b> {{from the bottom of}} the S.League in 2003 to two third-place finishes in 2004 and 2006.|$|E

She was the daughter of prōtostratōr and megas doux Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos, after whom Alexios was named. On his father's side, Alexios was also closely related to the imperial family of the Palaiologoi, through his grandmother, Martha Palaiologina, a sister of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1261). Alexios married Theodora Akropolitissa, daughter of Constantine Akropolites and granddaughter of the historian George Akropolites. They had one child, Michael Philanthropenos, who also became a general.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{diversification}} in markets and products, Argentina managed to escape the trap of a single-staple economy and sustained its economic growth over six decades. The combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, <b>which</b> <b>rose</b> 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local prices. Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands, from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio Argentino Roca.|$|E

5|$|From 1863, part of King's Cross was an {{intermediate}} station. On the extreme {{east of the}} site, King's Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from Finsbury before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York Road Tunnel to join the City Widened Lines to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) <b>which</b> <b>rose</b> to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the Northern City Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} year the RNLI raised £10,000, however by 1849, income had dropped to £354. Finding itself in {{financial}} difficulties, the RNLI accepted a government subsidy of £2,000, <b>which</b> <b>rose</b> in subsequent years. This lasted until 1869, when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies; in addition, the government's imposition of bureaucracy and regulations were detrimental to the service. It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new impetus to fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £10,000. The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year.|$|E
5|$|Later, but not {{precisely}} dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which {{at first glance}} appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. Other dacite domes <b>which</b> <b>rose</b> on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak. An upper limit of 10,000years has been set for the domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity.|$|E

5|$|The sealing of North West Coastal Highway {{was nearing}} {{completion}} in 1973; additional resources provided {{to complete the}} work resulted in the final section, Port Hedland to Roeburn, being finished in only five months. An official opening ceremony was held at South Hedland on 6 December 1974, with the road pronounced open by Premier Charles Court. The final cost {{of the project was}} approximately $31million, substantially more than the initial estimate of $17million. This was mainly due to two factors: increased construction standards, and inflation, <b>which</b> <b>rose</b> from 4% to 13% between 1970 and 1974.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage and}} {{associated}} props took twenty-four semi-trailer trucks to transport. The setup {{consisted of a}} main stage with three elevators and a turntable (<b>which</b> <b>rose</b> and lowered), a central runway with LED and strobe lights connected to a central stage with a LED view screen in the construction and an elevator. The two secondary runways were raised up into the stands and also had view screens inside the construction. Two projection screens were raised above the audience so those who couldn't get {{a clear view of}} the stage could still see the performance. There were also 3 LED screens that moved around during the performance, including one semicircular transparent screen lowered onto the stage during the video interludes.|$|E

5|$|According to Hindu mythology, {{the lands}} of Kerala were {{recovered}} from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram ("The Land of Parasurama")). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded {{as far as it}} reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land <b>which</b> <b>rose</b> from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend was later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with Keralolpathi, which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such as land tenure and administration, to the story of Parasurama. In medieval times Kuttuvan may have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolise his lordship over it.|$|E

5|$|Decades {{of civil}} war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly {{to the demise of}} the old {{aristocracy}} of Rome, which was gradually replaced in prominence by a new Italian nobility during {{the early part of the}} 1st century AD. One such family were the Flavians, or gens Flavia, <b>which</b> <b>rose</b> from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Vespasian's grandfather, Titus Flavius Petro, had served as a centurion under Pompey during Caesar's civil war. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC. Nevertheless, Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro's son Titus Flavius Sabinus I. Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible equestrian status through his services as tax collector in Asia and banker in Helvetia (modern Switzerland)). By marrying Vespasia Polla he allied himself to the more prestigious patrician gens Vespasia, ensuring the elevation of his sons Titus Flavius Sabinus II and Vespasian to the senatorial rank.|$|E
