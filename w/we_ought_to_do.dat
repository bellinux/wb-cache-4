500|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of its revival, {{the race was}} subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government. On 7 June 2016, the organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written {{an open letter to}} him to which Ecclestone had not replied. Sport for Rights {{made it clear that they}} did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public. Ecclestone replied a week later, saying that Formula One had [...] "a clear conscience" [...] on human rights and added: [...] "I tell you what <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> As far as we are concerned, not have any races where there is corruption in the country. Can you tell me where we are going to be racing?" ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{response}} to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says: [...] "No doubt we do instinctively prefer {{to help those who}} are close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but what <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> {{and it is difficult to}} see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was known}} for his essays, most {{particularly}} The Power of the Powerless, in which he described a societal paradigm in which citizens were forced to [...] "live within a lie" [...] under the communist regime. In describing his role as a dissident, Havel wrote in 1979: [...] "...we never decided to become dissidents. We have been transformed into them, without quite knowing how, sometimes we have ended up in prison without precisely knowing how. We simply went ahead and did certain things that we felt <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and that seemed to us decent to do, nothing more nor less." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1964–65 Johnson was {{pressured}} by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in South Vietnam; moreover, a plurality in the polls {{at the time were}} in favor of military action against the communists, with only 26 to 30 percent opposed. Johnson revised his priorities, and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of January with yet another change of government in Saigon. He then agreed with Mac Bundy and McNamara, that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation. Johnson said, [...] "Stable government or no stable government in Saigon we will do what <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I'm prepared to do that; we will move strongly. General Nguyễn Khánh (head of the new government) is our boy".|$|E
2500|$|Critics of DeLillo {{argue that}} his novels are overly stylized and intellectually shallow. In James Wood's review of Zadie Smith's 2000 novel White Teeth, he {{dismissed}} {{the work of}} authors like Dellilo, Wallace, and Smith as [...] "hysterical realism". Bruce Bawer famously condemned DeLillo's novels insisting they weren't actually novels at all but [...] "tracts, designed to batter us, again and again, with a single idea: that life in America today is boring, benumbing, dehumanized...It's better, DeLillo seems to say in one novel after another, to be a marauding murderous maniac – and therefore a human – than to sit still for America as it is, with its air conditioners, assembly lines, television sets, supermarkets, synthetic fabrics, and credit cards." [...] George Will proclaimed the study of Lee Harvey Oswald in Libra as [...] "sandbox existentialism" [...] and [...] "an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship." [...] DeLillo responded [...] "I don't take it seriously, but being called a 'bad citizen' is a compliment to a novelist, at least to my mind. That's exactly what <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> We ought to be bad citizens. We ought to, {{in the sense that}} we're writing against what power represents, and often what government represents, and what the corporation dictates, and what consumer consciousness has come to mean. In that sense, if we're bad citizens, we're doing our job." [...] In the same interview DeLillo rejected Will's claim that DeLillo blames America for Lee Harvey Oswald, countering that he instead blamed America for George Will. DeLillo also figured prominently in B. R. Myers's critique of recent American literary fiction, A Reader's Manifesto.|$|E
