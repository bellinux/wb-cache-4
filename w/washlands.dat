5|$|The {{bridge at}} Deeping Gate carries the date 1651, {{and is a}} Grade II* listed stone {{structure}} with three round arches. After the remains of Deeping High lock and Deeping Low lock, there is a junction where the old course, the Maxey Cut, the South Drain and the Folly River, also a drain, meet. The river is officially navigable below this point. Through Crowland and Cowbit {{to the edge of}} Spalding, the river is laid out with <b>washlands,</b> which were historically used as pasture, because the river was allowed to flood the land when tidal levels prevented the water discharging into the sea. The river is bounded on the north and west by a bank, while the New River, a drainage channel to the south and east of it, is bounded by another bank. The land between the channels forms Crowland High Wash, Crowland Fodder Lots and Cowbit Wash. The southern bank is variously named Corporation Bank, Wash Bank and Barrier Bank. These wash lands were designed to be flooded in extremis, although the building of the Coronation flood relief channel has made this purpose obsolete.|$|E
25|$|Further upriver, a {{flood relief}} channel was built at Bolton upon Dearne, and more <b>washlands</b> were formed between Wath railway bridge and Adwick bridge. The Bolton Ings and Old Moor <b>washlands</b> were next to be created, to be {{followed}} by those at Wombwell Ings, where the River Dove joins the Dearne, Darfield, Houghton and Cudworth. Some of the storage capacity was lost as a result of mining schemes, and a regulator was installed at Bolton in 1972, allowing the flow to be restricted by a sluice gate. During the flooding in 2007, all of the <b>washlands</b> filled to capacity, although the Bolton regulator could not be operated as it had been vandalised. Some damage to the Houghton <b>washlands</b> resulted from the extremely high water levels, which overtopped the banks and caused erosion to take place. Following the floods, a reassessment of the function of the regulators was carried out, and in view of the costs of maintaining them, the Environment Agency intend to remove them once some reconfiguration of the river channel has been completed. This work will ensure that the <b>washlands</b> fill and empty at the appropriate points in a flood cycle.|$|E
25|$|The River Rother {{is managed}} by the Environment Agency to {{mitigate}} flooding in the Catcliffe and Rotherham areas, {{through a series of}} regulators and <b>washlands.</b> The regulators are used to hold back the flow of the river, and the <b>washlands</b> consist of low-lying land adjacent to the river which flood when the flows are held back. This allows flood flows on the River Don to pass through Rotherham before the water from the Rother does so. There are three regulators, at Canklow, Woodhouse Mill and Meadowgate.|$|E
40|$|In many river {{floodplains}} in the UK {{there has}} been a long history of flood defence, land reclamation and water regime management for farming. In recent years, changing policies with respect to farming, environment and flood management are encouraging a re-appraisal of land use in rural areas. h 1 particular, there is scope to develop, through the use of appropriate promotional mechanisms, <b>washland</b> areas which will simultaneously accommodate winter inundation, support extensive farming methods, deliver environmental benefits, and do this in a way which can underpin the rural economy. This paper explores the feasibility of flood storage and <b>washland</b> creation, the likely economic impacts of this type of development, and the financial and institutional mechanisms required to achieve implementation. The outcome is the identification and assessment of a <b>washland</b> package within the UK agri-environment framework. However, given the diversity of circumstance and practice, it is suggested that a range of options, and not just those associated with management agreements and annual payments, is used for the management and administration of <b>washland</b> areas. Key words: flood defence, water management, land use, <b>washland</b> areas, rural economy, agri-environment...|$|R
50|$|Clifton, Rawcliffe and Poppleton ings are {{temporary}} storage area (<b>washland</b> scheme) for water that flows down the River Ouse in York, England.|$|R
50|$|This {{is one of}} many flood {{defenses}} {{that make}} up a scheme. Other projects include River Foss Barrier, Leaky dams, ings, <b>washland</b> storage basin, walls, and embankments.|$|R
25|$|The river {{has been}} the subject of channel engineering, to ease the problem of flooding. A new channel was {{constructed}} for it near its mouth in the 1950s, as the old route had been affected by subsidence. <b>Washlands,</b> which can be progressively flooded as water levels rise, were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s. A flood relief channel and a regulator to restrict the flow was built at Bolton upon Dearne. During the 2007 United Kingdom floods, all of the <b>washlands</b> filled to capacity, but the regulator could not be operated as it had been vandalised.|$|E
25|$|The {{river is}} navigable to Bawtry, {{although}} navigation rights were removed in 1972. It {{is also important}} for conservation, with the Idle <b>Washlands</b> {{and some of the}} sand and gravel pits of the Idle Valley being designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} areas of {{grassland}} {{adjacent to the}} lower Idle, which are subject to periodic flooding, and which provide habitat for wintering and breeding birds. They form the Idle <b>Washlands</b> Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Historically, a much greater area would have functioned in this way, but {{much of it is}} now cut off from the river by high flood defence banks. The <b>Washlands</b> SSSI once covered an area of 250 hectares, which was used as grazing pasture during the summer months and was often covered by shallow flooding in the winter, but during the 1980s, further flood defence work and land drainage reduced this area to 88 hectares. Some work has been carried out under the National Environment Programme to ensure that the wildfowl and wader habitat is not lost completely, and the Environment Agency have produced a water level management plan to further protect the SSSI. Parts of the Mother Drain are also a designated SSSI.|$|E
50|$|Fenn <b>Washland</b> is a 4.9 hectare Local Nature Reserve in South Woodham Ferrers in Essex. It {{is owned}} by Essex County Council and managed by the Council {{as a part of}} the nearby Marsh Farm Country Park.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Washland</b> or washes {{are areas}} of land {{adjacent}} to rivers which are deliberately flooded {{at times when}} the rivers are high, to avoid flooding in residential or important agricultural areas. [...] They often provide for overwintering wildfowl, and several include important nature reserves.|$|R
50|$|To {{facilitate}} the drainage of the <b>washland,</b> {{there is a}} third, unembanked river between the two Bedford Rivers, alongside the Old Bedford River and known as the River Delph. It drains into the New Bedford River 2 to 3 km south of Denver Sluice.|$|R
25|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} assessment of flood risks caused by the River Don and its tributaries, the River Dearne Improvement Scheme was implemented between 1963 and 1973. It was recognised that simple enlargement of the river channel would not provide a satisfactory solution, as it would just move the problem to the River Don, and therefore a series of <b>washlands</b> were created, which could be progressively flooded if required, without affecting centres of population. Near the mouth of the river, Dearne Mouth washland, which is now known as the Denaby Ings Nature Reserve, was created in 1963, and a manually operated sluice allowed the flow of the river to be diverted through the floodbank and into the washland when there were high levels at the junction with the River Don. The sluice was rebuilt in 1973. Additional <b>washlands</b> were created at Harlington and North Ings, and the river was straightened and realigned.|$|E
25|$|A short {{section of}} the river in Chesterfield was once navigable, and may become so again {{as part of a}} {{development}} project, while there are plans to use the course from Rother Valley Country Park to Rotherham for the Rother Link, which would connect the Chesterfield Canal to the River Don Navigation. The lower river is managed because of flood risk: three regulators can restrict its flow. Their operation normally causes flooding of <b>washlands,</b> rather than of centres of population, which might otherwise be inundated.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1958, {{flooding}} was {{a persistent}} problem near the lower {{reaches of the}} river, with Beighton, Catcliffe, Treeton and Woodhouse Mill particularly at risk. When the River Rother Improvement Scheme was first proposed in September 1958, analysis of flood flows revealed that peaks flows on the Rother generally reached the River Don at Rotherham after the peak flow on that river had already passed. Enlarging the channel of the Rother {{would have resulted in}} the peak flows reaching the Don earlier, effectively moving the problem of flooding downstream to Rotherham. The scheme therefore recognised the need to create and manage <b>washlands</b> to hold back the excess flow under these conditions.|$|E
50|$|This is {{described}} by Natural England as one of Britain's few remaining areas of <b>washland</b> which are vital {{for the survival of}} wildfowl and waders. Wintering wildfowls include wigeons, teals, pintails and Bewick's swans. The rich flora in ditches include uncommon species such as frogbit, water violet and flowering rush.|$|R
50|$|The {{science of}} Fen {{drainage}} {{was not well}} understood when the first enclosure acts were passed, and {{it was thought that}} flooding might be worse if the embankments were placed too close to the river. Consequently, the Dales Head Dyke was constructed, about 1 mi {{to the west of the}} Witham, and the land between it and the river was used as <b>washland,</b> and was flooded for up to nine months each year. By 1797, the process was better understood, and an Act of Parliament authorised the reclaiming of 2800 acre of <b>washland,</b> by moving the banks much closer to the river, and extending the banks at the sides of several fens to join the repositioned flood bank. A drainage engine was to be moved from Blankney Fen to Martin Fen, and the documents were to be stored in a chest in Timberland Church, where they could be viewed on payment of one shilling (5p).|$|R
5000|$|The New River is a {{drainage}} {{system in the}} South Holland district of Lincolnshire, England. [...] near Crowland it flows very roughly eastwards, following the general line of the River Welland but {{a little to the}} south. It skirts the settlements of Crowland and Cowbit before flowing into the Welland at [...] near Little London.The land enclosed between the Welland and the New River is referred to as <b>Washland,</b> [...] and [...] being the principal areas. <b>Washland</b> was designed to be sacrificially flooded as a relief of high river levels. The current land usage, and the rights of the drainage authorities to flood it can be traced back at least to an act of parliament of George III, and amended in 1847. The arrangement is not theoretical. Cowbit Wash was flooded annually to protect Spalding until the creation of the Coronation Channel allowed excess water to bypass the town. Even now the option to overspill onto the Wash is available.|$|R
25|$|The severe floods of 2007 {{were the}} result of some 80 million cubic metres of {{rainfall}} falling on South Yorkshire on 25 June 2007. The level of the River Rother at Rotherham reached the highest level ever recorded, at , and the regulators were manned 24 hours a day in order to manage the water. However, there was a power failure at Canklow regulator, and the site had to be evacuated due to the threat posed by the possible breaching of the dam at Ulley Reservoir. The Meadowgate regulator was closed, and resulted in all four of the Rother Valley Country Park lakes flooding within the next 12 hours. Most of the car park and the watersports centre was also flooded, but water levels dropped over the next three days and little damage was caused. Assessment following those floods has led the Environment Agency to conclude that the regulators are expensive to maintain, and that they should be removed once some of the flood banks have been remodelled to ensure that the <b>washlands</b> fill and empty at the correct levels in a flood cycle.|$|E
500|$|Before 1626 the River Don had two outlets, {{an eastern}} branch that meandered across Hatfield Chase {{to enter the}} River Trent, and a {{northern}} branch, which was a Roman navigation channel, and joined the River Aire at Turnbridge, near East Cowick. Cornelius Vermuyden's drainage scheme for Hatfield Chase, begun in 1626 and largely completed by 1628, included the construction of Ashfield Bank, which ran for [...] along the southern bank of the Don from Fishlake to Thorne, cutting off the eastern branch. Navigation to Sandtoft {{was made possible by}} the provision of a navigable sluice in the bank, which had lifting gates and a [...] lock chamber. A further bank some distance to the east of the northern channel ran for [...] from Thorne to Turnbridge to provide <b>washlands,</b> which would flood when high levels in the Aire prevented the Don discharging into it.|$|E
500|$|The River Welland is a lowland {{river in}} the east of England, some [...] long. It drains part of the Midlands eastwards to The Wash. The river rises in the Hothorpe Hills, at Sibbertoft in Northamptonshire, then flows {{generally}} northeast to Market Harborough, Stamford and Spalding, to reach The Wash near Fosdyke. It is a major waterway across {{the part of the}} Fens called South Holland, {{and is one of the}} Fenland rivers which were laid out with <b>washlands.</b> There are two channels between widely spaced embankments with the intention that flood waters would have space in which to spread while the tide in the estuary prevented free egress. However, after the floods of 1947, new works such as the Coronation Channel were constructed to control flooding in Spalding and the washes are no longer used solely as pasture, but may be used for arable farming.|$|E
25|$|The Ouse Washes are {{an internationally}} {{important}} area for wildlife. Sandwiched between the Old Bedford and New Bedford rivers, they consist of <b>washland</b> {{which is used}} as pasture during the summer but which floods in the winter, and are the largest area of such land in the United Kingdom. They act as breeding grounds for lapwings, redshanks and snipe in spring, and are home to varieties of ducks and swans during the winter months.|$|R
50|$|The Environment Agency {{carried out}} flood {{alleviation}} {{work on the}} New Cut Drain in 2013, {{to reduce the risk}} of properties flooding. The work involved sheet piling of some 770 yd of the drain, and installation of perforated filter drains to collect surface water. A new flood bank between the river and the Willows Estate was constructed, and parts of the existing bank between the New Cut Drain and the Freshney <b>Washland</b> Flood Storage Reservoir were removed, to allow more water to be impounded when river flows are high.|$|R
50|$|In 1630, King Charles I {{granted a}} {{drainage}} charter to the 4th Earl of Bedford who engaged the Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden {{to construct the}} two Bedford rivers. The purpose of the new rivers was to facilitate drainage of the Great Ouse between Earith and Downham Market. The area between the rivers is 20 mi long and almost a mile wide and acts as <b>washland,</b> i.e. a floodplain during the winter and, increasingly, also in summer. When they are flooded this causes a 30 mi detour for local residents.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{regulator}} to {{be installed}} was at Woodhouse Mill. It is a vertical sluice gate, and is situated at the downstream end of the Woodhouse Mill <b>washlands</b> nature reserve. A railway embankment crosses the nature reserve, and flood arches allow the water to flood {{both sides of the}} tracks. There are no floodbanks between the river and the reserve, which results in it flooding soon after the gate is closed. The mechanism here was manufactured by Ransomes and Rapier in 1956, and the regulator was commissioned in 1959. The Canklow regulator, situated close to the A630 link road from junction 33 on the M1 motorway, is also a vertical sluice gate, which when closed causes progressive flooding of seven washland areas {{on both sides of the}} M1, capable of holding [...] of flood water. It was installed in 1969 as part of a major road-building project, which saw the M1 motorway and the A630 road built across the <b>washlands.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the Hatfield Level {{drainage}} project {{which started}} in 1626, the Dutch civil engineer Cornelius Vermuyden diverted the Don northwards along Turnbridgedike. He constructed Dikesmarsh bank some distance {{to the east of}} the channel, so that the intervening land could be used as <b>washlands.</b> The main work was completed by 1628, but after flooding in 1629, a [...] "Great Sluice" [...] was constructed at the junction between the river and the Aire, with 17 openings which were , probably by Hugo Spiering, who had assisted Vermuyden on the main project. The <b>washlands</b> had insufficient capacity, and in 1632 work started on a new channel, which would run for [...] from Newbridge, near Thorne, eastwards to enter the Ouse at the site of Goole, [...] upstream of the Trent. Water levels here were between [...] lower than at Turnbridge. This new channel was called the [...] "Dutch River", and was finished in 1635, at a cost of £33,000. It ended in a sluice at Goole, and was never intended to be navigable, as boats could access the Aire at Turnbridge. The sluice was later swept away in a flood and never replaced.|$|E
2500|$|Next {{it turns}} to the south east and passes under the A637 road, the M1 {{motorway}} and the sliproads which form part of Junction 38, to reach Darton. The Cawthorne Dike joins from the west as it {{turns to the}} east and passes under the Wakefield to Barnsley railway line. The B6428 crosses on Barugh Bridge, a single-span bridge made of rock-faced stone, which bears the date 1850 on the north-west buttress. As the river approaches Barnsley, the remains of the Barnsley Canal follow it on the south bank. Beyond the A61 Old Mill Lane bridge there was a mill, after which an aqueduct carried the canal over the river. Two more road bridges follow, the second of which carries the A633 Grange Lane. Just before the bridge is Priory Mill, a thirteenth-century mill which was heavily rebuilt by Sir William Armyne in 1635, and further remodelled in the nineteenth century. It was powered by a leat from the river, which supplied internal water wheels. Water from the leat was also channelled to Monk Bretton Priory, where it flushed the kitchens and the reredorter. Next there are two former railway bridges which now carry footpaths. Soon sections of the disused Dearne and Dove Canal run parallel to the river, and after passing under two more railway bridges, the course turns to the south to reach Darfield, below which the River Dove joins from the west. The river turns to the east again, passing to the north east of a series of lakes which form the Dearne Ings and Old Moor <b>washlands.</b> On {{the opposite side of the}} channel are the Bolton Ings <b>washlands,</b> which cover [...] and have been acquired by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). In 2011, the site was in its early stages of development, but the reedbeds have attracted spoonbills and avocets, and are expected to act as a breeding ground for bitterns in due course. After the <b>washlands,</b> the river flows to the north of Wath upon Dearne, and to the south of Bolton on Dearne.|$|E
50|$|The area {{targeted}} by the OWLP scheme focuses on the distinctive rural, open and tranquil landscape surrounding the Ouse Washes; this landscape includes important wetland and <b>washland</b> habitats set within productive agricultural land. The project focuses on {{the area around the}} Old Bedford River and New Bedford River in the Cambridgeshire and Norfolk Fens and includes the RSPB nature reserves to its south, near St Ives and Fen Drayton. This unique landscape area includes or abuts a large number of vibrant small settlements and is close to the market towns and cities of Downham Market, Chatteris, March, Littleport, Ely, Cambridge and St. Ives.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{analyzes}} {{the consequences for}} risk distribution of the French Flood Prevention Action Programme (PAPI). By redirecting floods from the most vulnerable to the least vulnerable areas, PAPIs expose farmers to greater flood risks.

The article outlines {{the results of an}} exhaustive survey of all PAPI programmes in France, which examined the way the compensation policies are set up locally. Results of the survey showed that the proposed policies may be financially non-viable. Several more viable risk-sharing solutions are then discussed, involving insurance schemes, state intervention and local institutions.

500|$|A new sluice was {{constructed}} at Newbridge, incorporating tidal gates, which effectively prevent tides from passing further up the river. The {{removal of the}} navigation works at Ham proved particularly difficult, and acted as a training exercise for the Territorial Royal Engineers. Men from the 205 (Wessex) Field Squadron RE (TA) used [...] of explosives {{to blow up the}} half-lock and a mud-filled barge which could not be moved. The river banks were raised to give more protection to the villages of Creech St Michael, Ham and Ruishton, but the channel was still only capable of discharging , whereas the channels through Taunton were designed to handle , and were unlikely to overflow until discharges reached [...] Curry Moor is therefore used as a <b>washland,</b> and excess water floods over it, to be pumped out at a later date by the Curry Moor pumping station, situated {{on the banks of the}} river below the railway bridge. The programme began in 1965 and was completed in 1967.|$|R
2500|$|The {{flooding}} of Fishlake and Sykehouse {{resulted from}} there being insufficient <b>washlands</b> {{to hold the}} flow of the Don while the sluice at Turnbridgedike was closed by high water levels in the Aire. A navigable sluice was constructed at Turnbridgedike, including a lock chamber which was [...] and 17 discharge gates, each [...] The structure was probably built by Hugo Spiering, who assisted Vermuyden, and was called the Great Sluice. This still did not fully alleviate the problems of flooding, and so a new [...] embanked channel was constructed from Newbridge to the River Ouse at Goole between 1632 and 1635. The river levels at Goole were some [...] lower than at Turnbridgedike, and so discharge was more efficient. The total cost of the channel and outfall sluice was £33,000. There was no navigable connection to the Ouse at Goole, as boats continued to access the Aire at Turnbridgedike. The channel eventually became the wide Dutch River after two drains were swept into one following a great flood.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the East and West rivers join, they are only just above the [...] contour. Once joined, the river flows in a northerly direction, past Fletland Mill, a former grain mill which was built in 1759, and Kate's Bridge weir, where a modern bridge carries the A15 road over it. This {{bypasses}} a single-arched bridge built in the late 1700s, which has a female head carved on the keystone of the western face, presumed to be the Kate after whom the bridge is named. Beyond the bridges, the river becomes a typical Fens high level carrier, embanked {{on both sides and}} partially straightened, with counter drains {{on both sides of the}} channel, to collect seepage through the banks, as the normal water levels are higher than the surrounding land. At Tongue End the waters of the Bourne Eau join. The river below here is navigable for its last , and there was once a navigable connection to the Bourne Eau, but the Tongue End pumping station now sits between the two rivers, to aid drainage of the land to the west. The Weir Dyke drain runs along the north bank of the Bourne Eau and then the west bank of the Glen, to join the South Forty-Foot Drain near Guthram Gowt. For some distance either side of Tongue End, the Counter Drain runs a considerable distance to the east of the channel, creating <b>washlands</b> between them which can be flooded if water is not able to dischange from the river into the Welland estuary, as a result of the state of the tides. A little before Guthram Gowt, the Counter Drain turns to the east to reach Pode Hole pumping station, which plays an important part in the drainage of Deeping Fen.|$|E
50|$|Further upriver, a {{flood relief}} channel was built at Bolton upon Dearne, and more <b>washlands</b> were formed between Wath railway bridge and Adwick bridge. The Bolton Ings and Old Moor <b>washlands</b> were next to be created, to be {{followed}} by those at Wombwell Ings, where the River Dove joins the Dearne, Darfield, Houghton and Cudworth. Some of the storage capacity was lost as a result of mining schemes, and a regulator was installed at Bolton in 1972, allowing the flow to be restricted by a sluice gate. During the flooding in 2007, all of the <b>washlands</b> filled to capacity, although the Bolton regulator could not be operated as it had been vandalised. Some damage to the Houghton <b>washlands</b> resulted from the extremely high water levels, which overtopped the banks and caused erosion to take place.

This work will ensure that the <b>washlands</b> fill and empty at the appropriate points in a flood cycle.|$|E
50|$|Freshney Bog was {{constructed}} in 2001 as a <b>washland,</b> {{which could be used}} to hold excess water when the channel below it could not cope with the flow in the river. It is {{a major part of the}} flood defence system for Grimsby. During the floods of 2007, more than a full month's rainfall fell in 24 hours on the river catchment. Groundwater levels rose by over 16 ft in the week prior to the floods, and with the ground saturated, the capacity of the river and the New Cut Drain was exceeded. Freshney Bog storage area filled up, but had insufficient capacity for the volume of water, and as a result, flooding occurred, which affected 200 houses. At Laceby Beck gauging station, normal levels of the river vary between 0.62 and 2.55 ft, but on 21 June 2007, they reached 3.25 ft. Flooding resulted at several locations along the River Freshney, although the level was well below the maximum recorded level of 7.96 ft, which occurred on 14 July 1985 at 5:30 in the morning.|$|R
40|$|The Zagórów <b>washland</b> (the Natura 2000 sites, Ostoja Nadwarciańska and the Warta Landscape Park) {{included}} in the eco-logical compensation project, provide an example of ecoturism potential to obtain information on the flora {{of the region and}} to conduct nature observations. This area is characterized by varied landscape and considerable floristic diversity. At-tractiveness of the area for ecotourism was evaluated using a method proposed by Mahon and Miller based on relevés pre-pared in the years 2011 - 2012 and landscape records. Results indicate that this area thanks to its predominantly natural landscape resulting from the variety in land relief may be attractive for ecotourism. This is confirmed by the presence of protected species, observations of natural succession in flood meadows, high resistance to recreation land use assessed based on the threshold load index, as well as considerable health-promoting and psychoregulatory value of distinguished communities. Moreover, this object provides an opportunity to investigate the effect of water management on vegetation, and thus to observe succession changes and to control them, which is also an element connected with pure science and edu-cation in the promotion of environmental protection and management...|$|R
50|$|The Royal Commission of Sewers {{reversed}} the decision when it met at Huntingdon in 1639, and an Act of Parliament passed in 1649 authorised William Russell, 5th Earl of Bedford {{and his associates}} to further drain the land. The Act divided the Bedford Level into three parts, {{each with its own}} Board of Commissioners, and so the North Level, the Middle Level and the South Level were formed. Vermuyden again managed the works, which included the cutting of the New Bedford River, running parallel to the Old Bedford Level, which created a huge <b>washland</b> covering 4700 acre from Earith to Salters Lode to store flood water. Most of the work carried out was in the Middle Levels; some took place in the North Levels, but Vermuyen's plan for the South Level of a channel to prevent water from the rivers on {{the eastern edge of the}} fens from ever entering the lowlands was shelved, and was not finally implemented until the Cut-off Channel was built in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The South Level Barrier Bank to the east and the Middle Level Barrier Bank to the west were constructed to protect the Middle Level from the flood waters. The work was again declared to be complete in 1656.|$|R
