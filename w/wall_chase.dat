5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 44 laps to go. Kyle Busch drove under Logano in turn 3 to {{take the}} lead with 43 to go. The sixth caution of the race flew for a multi-car wreck in turn 1. Going into the turn, Kenseth got loose, slid up the track and slammed the <b>wall.</b> <b>Chase</b> Elliott slammed into his rear. Checking up to avoid Kenseth, Kurt Busch got loose, clipped Carl Edwards and sent both of them spinning. Kenseth said he didn't [...] "know what happened. I just turned off in there and spun off before I honestly knew what was happening. I don’t know why it spun out. I tried to save it the best I could and just got hit hard from behind and ended up wrecking it.” Elliott said what happened was [...] "disappointing. What a fast race car. Just a terrible job on my behalf. It’s pitiful. Run three races and finished one. Bad job on my end. I know better to miss a wreck like that.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 33 laps to go. Truex's car, {{being stuck}} in fourth gear, stalled on the restart and caused a log jam with cars swerving to avoid him, {{which led to}} a number of cars making contact with one another. Kenseth worked on Hamlin for a number of laps before retaking the lead with 30 laps to go. The fifth caution of the race flew with 29 laps to go for a two-car wreck on the frontstretch. Entering turn 1, Alex Bowman - subbing for the injured Dale Earnhardt Jr. - suffered a tire blowout and slammed the <b>wall.</b> <b>Chase</b> Elliott also suffered a tire blowout, but avoided the wall. Bowman said after the race that he thought Edwards [...] "was backing up because he was blocked in as I was leaving the pit box. My left-rear hit his right-rear as I was leaving. It caved it in enough, we thought we would be fine, but obviously, when I got into (Kurt Busch) it was already going down. They knew we were here for sure and I had a blast.” He added that what happened was [...] "really unfortunate — the worst we would have finished was about seventh or eighth. I hate the circumstances obviously, and I hope Dale Jr. is feeling better, but we had a top-10 car all day long.” ...|$|E

50|$|Baldwin and Cynthia are {{the only}} ones left alive, with Yorga supernaturally mocking Baldwin {{throughout}} the estate. However, Yorga seals their exit routes while his brides slowly close in on the two. They duck into a darken hallway, but when Baldwin turns on the lights, he finds himself confronted by all the brides (including Ellen and Mitzi) with Yorga behind them who calls Cynthia over to his side. Yorga takes her away preparing to transform her into a new bride, while leaving his army of brides to finish off Baldwin. Baldwin somehow escapes the brides and gives pursuit (along the way, grabbing an iron battle-axe from a <b>wall),</b> <b>chasing</b> the two up to the balcony. The two men fight, with Yorga gaining the advantage. Just as he's about to kill Baldwin via choking. Cynthia's memories of the brides killing her family resurfaces causing her to realize Yorga was responsible for their deaths. She strikes Yorga in the chest with Baldwin's battle-axe. With Yorga stunned by the action, Baldwin uses the moment to throw Yorga off the balcony, killing him.|$|R

2500|$|Branyan {{suffered}} through an injury-plagued season in , appearing in 74 games, including 42 starts, for the Reds. He began the {{season on the}} disabled list, recovering from arthroscopic surgery. Branyan was reinstated from the disabled list on May 29. Branyan's shoulder {{was said to be}} at less than 100 percent but the Reds reinstated him despite his preference to undergo more rehab. On June 25, Branyan was fined an undisclosed amount after an in game incident against the Chicago Cubs. During the seventh-inning of that game, pitcher Paul Wilson hit outfielder Moisés Alou with a [...] pitch, and during the bottom of the inning Cubs' pitcher Kyle Farnsworth threw inside on Wilson during his at-bat which lead to a fight between Farnsworth and Wilson. Branyan, who was in the dugout, had to be restrained by teammates after a verbal altercation with Cubs' first baseman Eric Karros during the fight between the two pitchers. His home run on June 7, against Toronto Blue Jays' pitcher Jeff Tam was his first of the season. It was also 100th home run hit at the Great American Ball Park. His pinch-hit grand slam off Brooks Kieschnick on July 21 against Milwaukee was his first career pinch-hit home run and third career grand slam. He returned to the disabled list on August 13 with a right ankle sprain he obtained while sliding into the <b>wall</b> <b>chasing</b> a foul ball on [...] hit by San Francisco Giants' second baseman Ray Durham on August 1. After returning from the disabled list on August 28, he started 27 of the Reds' final 29 games of the season.

40|$|Temperierung and {{preservation}} of architectural heritage. The Northern Italy experiences critically reconsidered. The “Tempering” advantages are different, depending on local climates, on building characteristics, but also the idea of preservation, and the architectural design concept are concerned. In Northern Italy there are now numerous examples, that reflect different approaches and working methods. The Palace Cattaneo in Cremona was almost certainly the first of them, in 1996. The Tempering seemed well satisfy the preservation requirements, if it is conceived as conservation of historical matter. It avoided the great size of piping and devices, and big bores characterizing the traditional systems. It was not practiced any <b>wall</b> <b>chasing</b> in plasters and masonry. In some places the copper pipe was left exposed. Furthermore, the tempering was integrated with the electrical system and in this purpose special pieces were designed. The brick walls with clay mortar, 60 cm. thick, let suppose good results. This pilot experience show few errors, e. g. in the building insulation, in the placement of tubes and circuits, in the general design. There were differences compared to the first Bavarian examples: the rooms were normally more than four meters height, and needed a summer cooling, which even requires additional equipment. In this case the existing eighteenth -nineteenth century hot air system, a very common type of heating in the city, provided cooling. A second example, again at Cremona, destined to a school, is the palace Pallavicino (2002 - 2005). It was a complex of different buildings, much transformed over time and had lacked the refined details of Cattaneo Palace. In this case it was made a base of 90 cm. in plaster, adapted to use, that contained a double circuit of copper pipes. The size of the largest rooms make the system slightly undersized. Also {{in this case it}} is appropriate to describe less successful aspect On these three cases, relatively complete and consistent, you can start a discussion useful for further development...|$|R

Roger is unfazed and tries to continue to have the Lambdas voted out for stealing his car, until Sunny reveals that Roger set them up and kidnapped them. Roger states that it doesn't matter since he will always be cool, popular, and good-looking and the Lambdas will always be weird, different, and pathetic, and that there's nothing they can do or say about it. Lewis takes a moment and quietly agrees with Roger, stating that there's nothing he can say, but that there is [...] "something I've gotta do about it."

50|$|Jack Windom {{experiences}} a sensation of {{awe at the}} reception of the Hindoo dagger from his old chum, Tom, who was traveling in India. Hanging the dagger on the wall. Jack goes out. For some time Jack has discerned a coolness in his wife, and his jealous misgivings were verified when he returned and found her in company with a stranger. Seizing the dagger from the <b>wall</b> he <b>chases</b> the recreant lover {{from the house and}} then follows the wife to the bathroom, wither she has flown in terror. Mercilessly he plunges the dagger and flies the place. The lover in hiding sees him leave and returns, and calling aid succeeds in reviving the wife, who afterwards with careful treatment recovers and marries her paramour. However, either from the baneful influence of this diabolical dagger, or the woman's capricious nature, just one year later the second husband enacts the same scene, but with fatal results. He leaves the place, and has hardly disappeared when the first husband, who was thought to be dead, is drawn by an irresistible power back to view what to him seems to be the scene he left one year before, for there on the bathroom floor is the woman just as he apparently left her, with the dagger beside her. The sight drives him mad and the dagger is made to perform the final act of its mission.|$|R
50|$|During {{the events}} of the two {{chapters}} of the story thus far, it is heavily implied that, for reasons yet unknown, Drew and other close employees began dabbling in occult magic and dark rituals that resulted in Bendy coming to life as a humanoid monster whose physical body is made mostly of ink. Evidence of this includes cardboard cutouts of Bendy littered around pentagrams in multiple rooms, as well as a room with coffins, a substance that appears to be blood, and more pentagrams in it. In addition to his frightening appearance, Bendy's presence has apparently resulted in the entire animation studio becoming haunted, leading to paranormal activity and the animation of both shapeless monsters (which act as enemies that the player must defeat to progress), and other characters from his cartoon show. So far, whenever Bendy appears ink begins to pour down from the <b>walls</b> and a <b>chase</b> begins where the player must rush to an available exit before Bendy catches up, an event that would lead to an instant Game Over.|$|R

The session was open to both championship drivers and co-drivers. Craig Lowndes set the fastest time during the session, ahead of Mark Winterbottom and Jason Bright. The second free practice session, held on Thursday afternoon, was only open to co-drivers and was forty-five minutes in length. Winterbottom's co-driver Steven Richards topped the session ahead of the Triple Eight Race Engineering co-drivers Paul Dumbrell and Warren Luff. The Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG of Andrew Thompson suffered damage after a brake line was severed by debris, causing Thompson to hit the <b>wall</b> at the <b>Chase.</b> The third free practice session was held later on Thursday, this time a one-hour-long session open to all drivers. Reigning Bathurst winner Jamie Whincup was quickest, three-quarters of a second faster than Winterbottom with David Reynolds in third.

Alex Davison also crashed at Reid Park, causing significant damage to the side of his car but it was repaired in time for the following day's sessions.|$|R
60|$|Tom turned {{towards him}} with a slowly rising flush of anger in his face. Three hundred pounds! Under the most {{favourable}} market conditions that he could imagine his prized Clover Fairy would hardly fetch a hundred, yet here {{was a piece of}} varnished canvas, painted by his half-brother, selling for three times that sum. It was a cruel insult that went home with all the more force because it emphasised the triumph of the patronising, self-satisfied Laurence. The young farmer had meant to put his relative just a little out of conceit with himself by displaying the jewel of his possessions, and now the tables were turned, and his valued beast was made to look cheap and insignificant beside the price paid for a mere picture. It was so monstrously unjust; the painting would never be anything more than a dexterous piece of counterfeit life, while Clover Fairy was the real thing, a monarch in his little world, a personality in the countryside. After he was dead, even, he would still be something of a personality; his descendants would graze in those valley meadows and hillside pastures, they would fill stall and byre and milking-shed, their good red coats would speckle the landscape and crowd the market-place; men would note a promising heifer or a well-proportioned steer, and say: “Ah, that one comes of good old Clover Fairy’s stock.” All that time the picture would be hanging, lifeless and unchanging, beneath its dust and varnish, a chattel that ceased to mean anything if you chose to turn it with its back to the <b>wall.</b> These thoughts <b>chased</b> themselves angrily through Tom Yorkfield’s mind, but he could not put them into words. When he gave tongue to his feelings he put matters bluntly and harshly.|$|R
6000|$|In ancient time, as story tells, The saints {{would often}} leave their cells, And stroll about, but hide their quality, To try good people's hospitality. [...] It happen'd on a winter's night, As {{authors of the}} legend write, Two brother hermits, saints by trade, Taking their tour in masquerade, Came to a village hard by Rixham,[2] Ragged and not a groat betwixt 'em. It rain'd {{as hard as it}} could pour, Yet they were forced to walk an hour From house to house, wet to the skin, Before one soul would let 'em in. They call'd at every door: [...] "Good people, My comrade's blind, and I'm a creeple! Here we lie {{starving}} in the street, 'Twould grieve a body's heart to see't, No Christian would turn out a beast, In such a dreadful night at least; Give us but straw and let us lie In yonder barn to keep us dry." [...] Thus in the stroller's usual cant, They begg'd relief, which none would grant. No creature valued what they said, One family was gone to bed: The master bawled out half asleep, [...] "You fellows, what a noise you keep! So many beggars pass this way, We can't be quiet, night nor day; We cannot serve you every one; Pray take your answer, and be gone." [...] One swore he'd send 'em to the stocks; A third could not forbear his mocks; But bawl'd as loud as he could roar [...] "You're {{on the wrong side of}} the door!" [...] One surly clown look't out and said, [...] "I'll fling the p--pot on your head: You sha'nt come here, nor get a sous! You look like rogues would rob a house. Can't you go work, or serve the King? You blind and lame! 'Tis no such thing. That's but a counterfeit sore leg! For shame! two sturdy rascals beg! If I come down, I'll spoil your trick, And cure you both with a good stick." [...] Our wand'ring saints, in woful state, Treated at this ungodly rate, Having thro' all the village past, To a small cottage came at last Where dwelt a good old honest ye'man, Call'd thereabout good man Philemon; Who kindly did the saints invite In his poor house to pass the night; And then the hospitable sire Bid Goody Baucis mend the fire; Whilst he from out the chimney took A flitch of bacon off the hook, And freely from the fattest side Cut out large slices to be fry'd; Which tost up in a pan with batter, And served up in an earthen platter, Quoth Baucis, [...] "This is wholesome fare, Eat, honest friends, and never spare, And if we find our victuals fail, We can but make it out in ale." [...] To a small kilderkin of beer, Brew'd for the good time of the year, Philemon, by his wife's consent, Stept with a jug, and made a vent, And having fill'd it to the brink, Invited both the saints to drink. When they had took a second draught, Behold, a miracle was wrought; For, Baucis with amazement found, Although the jug had twice gone round, It still was full up to the top, As they ne'er had drunk a drop. You may be sure so strange a sight, Put the old people in a fright: Philemon whisper'd to his wife, [...] "These men are--Saints--I'll lay my life!" [...] The strangers overheard, and said, [...] "You're in the right--but be'nt afraid: No hurt shall come to you or yours: But for that pack of churlish boors, Not fit to live on Christian ground, They and their village shall be drown'd; Whilst you shall see your cottage rise, And grow a church before your eyes." [...] Scarce had they spoke, when fair and soft, The roof began to mount aloft; Aloft rose ev'ry beam and rafter; The heavy wall went clambering after. The chimney widen'd, and grew higher, Became a steeple with a spire. The kettle to the top was hoist, And there stood fastened to a joist, But with the upside down, to show Its inclination for below: In vain; for a superior force Applied at bottom stops its course: Doom'd ever in suspense to dwell, 'Tis now no kettle, but a bell. [...] The wooden jack, which had almost Lost by disuse the art to roast, A sudden alteration feels, Increas'd by new intestine wheels; But what adds to the wonder more, The number made the motion slower. The flyer, altho't had leaden feet, Would turn so quick you scarce could see't; But, now stopt by some hidden powers, Moves round but twice in twice twelve hours, While in the station of a jack, 'Twas never known to turn its back, A friend in turns and windings tried, Nor ever left the chimney's side. The chimney to a steeple grown, The jack would not be left alone; But, up against the steeple rear'd, Became a clock, and still adher'd; And still its love to household cares, By a shrill voice at noon declares, Warning the cookmaid not to burn That roast meat, which it cannot turn. [...] The groaning-chair began to crawl, Like a huge insect, up the wall; There stuck, and to a pulpit grew, But kept its matter and its hue, And mindful of its ancient state, Still groans while tattling gossips prate. The mortar only chang'd its name, In its old shape a font became. [...] The porringers, that in a row, Hung high, and made a glitt'ring show, To a less noble substance chang'd, Were now but leathern buckets rang'd. [...] The ballads, pasted on the <b>wall,</b> Of Chevy <b>Chase,</b> and English Mall,[3] Fair Rosamond, and Robin Hood, The little Children in the Wood, Enlarged in picture, size, and letter, And painted, lookt abundance better, And now the heraldry describe Of a churchwarden, or a tribe. A bedstead of the antique mode, Composed of timber many a load, Such as our grandfathers did use, Was metamorphos'd into pews; Which yet their former virtue keep By lodging folk disposed to sleep. [...] The cottage, with such feats as these, Grown to a church by just degrees, The holy men desired their host To ask for what he fancied most. Philemon, having paused a while, Replied in complimental style: [...] "Your goodness, more than my desert, Makes you take all things in good part: You've raised a church here in a minute, And I would fain continue in it; I'm good for little at my days, Make me the parson if you please." [...] He spoke, and presently he feels His grazier's coat reach down his heels; The sleeves new border'd with a list, Widen'd and gather'd at his wrist, But, being old, continued just As threadbare, and as full of dust. A shambling awkward gait he took, With a demure dejected look, Talk't of his offerings, tythes, and dues, Could smoke and drink and read the news, Or sell a goose at the next town, Decently hid beneath his gown. Contriv'd to preach old sermons next, Chang'd in the preface and the text. At christ'nings well could act his part, And had the service all by heart; Wish'd women might have children fast, And thought whose sow had farrow'd last; Against dissenters would repine. And stood up firm for [...] "right divine;" [...] Carried it to his equals higher, But most obedient to the squire. Found his head fill'd with many a system; But classic authors,--he ne'er mist 'em. [...] Thus having furbish'd up a parson, Dame Baucis next they play'd their farce on. Instead of homespun coifs, were seen Good pinners edg'd with colberteen;[4] Her petticoat, transform'd apace, Became black satin, flounced with lace. [...] "Plain Goody" [...] would no longer down, 'Twas [...] "Madam," [...] in her grogram gown. Philemon was in great surprise, And hardly could believe his eyes. Amaz'd to see her look so prim, And she admir'd as much at him. [...] Thus happy in their change of life, Were several years this man and wife: When on a day, which prov'd their last, Discoursing o'er old stories past, They went by chance, amidst their talk, To the churchyard, to take a walk; When Baucis hastily cry'd out, [...] "My dear, I see your forehead sprout!"-- [...] "Sprout;" [...] quoth the man; [...] "what's this you tell us? I hope you don't believe me jealous! But yet, methinks, I feel it true, And really yours is budding too-- Nay,--now I cannot stir my foot; It feels as if 'twere taking root." [...] Description would but tire my Muse, In short, they both were turn'd to yews. Old Goodman Dobson of the Green Remembers he the trees has seen; He'll talk of them from noon till night, And goes with folk to show the sight; On Sundays, after evening prayer, He gathers all the parish there; Points out the place of either yew, Here Baucis, there Philemon, grew: Till once a parson of our town, To mend his barn, cut Baucis down; At which, 'tis hard to be believ'd How much the other tree was griev'd, Grew scrubby, dy'd a-top, was stunted, So the next parson stubb'd and burnt it.|$|R
