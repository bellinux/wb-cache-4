5000|$|Weinstein kept {{demanding}} {{cuts to the}} film's length, {{and some}} of those cuts were eventually made. In December 2001, Jeffrey Wells reviewed a purported workprint of the film as it existed in the fall of 2001. Wells reported the <b>work</b> <b>print</b> lacked narration, was about 20 minutes longer, and although it was [...] "different than the theatrical version ... scene after scene after scene plays exactly the same in both." [...] Despite the similarities, Wells found the <b>work</b> <b>print</b> to be richer and more satisfying than the theatrical version. While Scorsese has stated the theatrical version is his final cut, he reportedly [...] "passed along the three-hour-plus print version of Gangs on tape friends and confided, 'Putting aside my contractual obligation to deliver a shorter, two-hour-and-forty-minute version to Miramax, this is the version I'm happiest with,' or words to that effect." ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{advertising}} in Motion Picture News announcing its release date, Katharine Rogers, in L. Frank Baum: Creator of Oz, believes that Alliance found the film inferior {{and refused to}} distribute it.

Baum himself thought that exchanges and exhibitors dismissed the film [...] "rather arbitrarily" [...] based on the Oz Company name.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between camera stocks and print stocks involves {{a difference in}} the recording process. When the <b>work</b> <b>print</b> or edit master has been approved, the Original Camera Negative (OCN) is assembled by a negative cutter using the edited <b>work</b> <b>print</b> or EDL (edit decision list) as a guide. A series of Answer Prints are then made from the OCN. During the Answer Print stage, corrections in the film's density and color are corrected (timed) to the filmmakers' tastes. Interpositive (IP) prints are struck from the OCN, checked to make sure they look the same as the custom timed Answer Print, and then each IP is used to make one or more Dupe Negative (DN) copies. The release prints are then generated from the DN(s). Recently, with the development of digital intermediate (DI), it has become possible to completely edit, composite visual effects, and color grade the image digitally at full resolution and bit-depth. In this workflow, the answer print is generated digitally and then written out to the IP stage using a laser film printer.|$|E
