For example, the {{military}} traditionally mounts {{what is known}} as the Queen's Guard (or King's Guard during the reign of a male monarch), which is made up of contingents of infantry and cavalry soldiers who are charged with guarding the royal residences in Canada and the United Kingdom. Canada has mounted the King's/Queen's Guard eight times since 1916, including Canadian Coronation Contingents for King George VI in May 1937 and for Queen Elizabeth II in May 1953. Also, whenever the sovereign or a member of her family is in Ottawa, they will lay a wreath at the National War Memorial (which itself was dedicated in 1939 by King George VI) and <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> if at a Canadian war monument overseas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{alcohol abuse and}} domestic violence was explored between Phil and Kathy culminating in the slow deterioration of their marriage, which the BBC claims [...] "gripped viewers" [...] throughout 1997. It has been noted that EastEnders were attempting to spread the message that abusive relationships are transmitted {{from one generation to}} the next within this storyline. Phil is eventually shown to blame [...] "his destructiveness on a response to self-hate: violence [...] the basis of his problem: his father had beaten him as a kid and he fears that he <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to his son." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{inductive}} reasoning, {{one makes}} {{a series of}} observations and infers a new claim based on them.

That next Monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations, it does not prove she will walk by the market every Monday. First of all, it is not certain, regardless of the number of observations, that the woman always walks by the market at 8am on Monday. In fact, Hume would even argue that we cannot claim it is [...] "more probable", since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} that gave {{its name to}} the war had occurred in 1731, off the coast of Florida, when the British brig Rebecca was boarded by the Spanish patrol boat La Isabela, commanded by the guarda costa (effectively privateer) Juan de León Fandiño. After boarding, Fandiño cut off the left ear of the Rebeccas captain, Robert Jenkins, whom he accused of smuggling (although Franklin’s Pennsylvania Gazette for October 7, 1731, says it was Lieutenant Dorce). Fandiño told Jenkins, [...] "Go, and tell your King that I <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> if he dares to do the same." [...] In March 1738, Jenkins was ordered to testify before Parliament, presumably to repeat his story before a committee of the House of Commons. According to some accounts, he produced the severed ear as part of his presentation, although no detailed record of the hearing exists. The incident was considered alongside various other cases of [...] "Spanish Depredations upon the British Subjects", and was perceived as an insult to Britain's honour and a clear casus belli.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the many}} issues Phil {{has been used}} to cover is {{alcoholism}} and the consequences the condition has upon the sufferer's life. The relationship between alcohol abuse and domestic violence was explored between Phil and his wife Kathy (played by Gillian Taylforth) culminating in the slow deterioration of their marriage, which gripped viewers throughout 1997. Of particular note is an episode where Phil attends Alcoholics Anonymous (February 1997), an [...] "alien and uncomfortable arena" [...] where he was forced to talk about his condition, expose his vulnerability and reveal the basis of his problem – the physical abuse he'd received from his father and his fear that he <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Writer Jacquetta May, who once played Rachel Kominski in the show, evaluated the episode in an article about social realism, education and the moral messages within EastEnders storylines, commenting: [...] "The episode blames his destructiveness on the 'male' response to self-hate: violence. It says that unless problems are worked through (the female method), they will be repeated generation after generation". This particular episode has also been used in a study by the Stirling Media Research Institute, where men were asked questions about the violence contained within a spectrum of broadcast television material. The study reported that much group discussion centred on the Alcoholics Anonymous group scene, which was, for the most part, seen as an accurate depiction of an AA group therapy session. In addition, Phil's portrayal of a suffering alcoholic was also seen as realistic and a [...] "typical portrayal of bottled-up masculinity".|$|E
