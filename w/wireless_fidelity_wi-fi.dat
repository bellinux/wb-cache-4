40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{internet}} took {{off as a}} data network for sending email and browsing websites. The option of putting voice traffic on to the net has been in consideration ever since internet was able to transmit media. This is otherwise called Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). VoIP is implemented in Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANET) but its range is considerably small. This leads to congestion and improper Quality of Service (QoS). Current implementation of VoIP over MANET has issues like hidden and exposed terminal problems. In order for MANET to expand its connectivity, there {{should be at least}} one node within its range. As the range of MANET is a disadvantage, distant connectivity is an issue. In this paper, a method has been proposed to use mobile <b>Wireless</b> – <b>Fidelity</b> (<b>Wi-Fi)</b> hotspot instead of MANET for VoIP. For this, mobile nodes are connected within a range of a hotspot network (100 ft.) for audio transmission. This scenario would be simulated using both mobile hotspot and MANET and the results are compared for better understanding. Main aspects like efficient data transmission, QoS and security are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Hybrid Wireless Mesh Network is {{a special}} case of infrastructural mesh network which {{utilizes}} heterogeneous wireless networks for communication. The integration of WMNs with other networks such as the Internet, cellular, IEEE 802. 11, IEEE 802. 15, IEEE 802. 16, sensor networks, etc., can be accomplished through the gateway and bridging functions in the mesh routers. An integrated security mechanism is a key challenge in the integration on such networks. In this paper, we analyze {{the problems in the}} integration of various heterogeneous wireless network’s. Thereafter, we proposed a integrated security framework for the hybrid WMN which helps in building a secured environment for communication within the network. The proposed mechanism efficiently uses the characteristics of WMN’s, mutual authentication and secretes key cryptography to provide a integrated security for heterogeneous wireless mesh networks. WMN has gained considerable attention in recent years not only due to its fast deployment, easy maintenance and low upfront investment compared with traditional wireless networks, but also its support of the existing wireless networks, such as wireless sensor networks, <b>wireless</b> <b>fidelity</b> network (<b>Wi-Fi),</b> and so on.

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} are now proliferating {{due to the}} success of the IEEE 802. 11 b protocol, also known as "Wi-Fi" (<b>Wireless</b> <b>Fidelity).</b> A <b>Wi-Fi</b> network is characterized by a set of base stations (also called access points) placed throughout the environment and connected to the traditional wired LANs. This technology allows nomadic users a broadband access to the Internet if they are in the transmission range of an access point. A new business model, named Wi-Fi Hot Spots, is now emerging to exploit the potentialities of this technology. A hot spot is a "critical" business area, e. g., airports, stations, hotels, where users can have wireless access by subscribing a contract with the hot spot operator, or with a wireless Internet service provider (WISP). Due to the random access nature of the Wi-Fi technology, if the number of users connected to the same access point increases, the QoS experienced may quickly degrade. This generates complains from the users that, as a consequence, may change their WISP. In order to be competitive, a Wi-Fi hot spot operator needs simple and effective mechanisms to control the congestion therefore guaranteeing the QoS, and (at the same time) maximizing his/her revenues. In this paper we present and evaluate a price-based policy for the access control in a Wi-Fi hot spot. Our policy, named Price-based Congestion Control (PCC), controls the hot spot traffic by dynamically determining the access cost as a function of the current load in the hot spot. We develop a theoretical framework to compute for any load condition the access cost to maintain the hot spot in its optimal operating point, for any load condition.

30|$|While current {{wireless}} {{local area}} network (WLAN) implementations reach the <b>wireless</b> <b>fidelity</b> (WiFi) consumer market with triple-band demand, optical wireless communications (OWC), specifically those based on indoor visible light communication (VLC) technology or light fidelity (LiFi), possess a broad spectrum and ubiquitous layout. When used for WLAN, VLC [1] utilizes a light-emitting diode (LED) to transmit visible light data. From the physical layer to the network layer, studies on VLC have gradually explored networking issues related to the design and maintenance of VLC networks. VLC links have directionality and vulnerability characteristics, owing to the straight propagation and common obstruction of visible light, respectively. Therefore, research on VLC networking encounters several challenges related to these characteristics that differ from those of either <b>wireless</b> <b>fidelity</b> or femtocell networks, such as illuminant layout design, VLC multi-user access, visible light channel resource allocation, and mobility management.|$|R
