The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers.</b> However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

On the shop floor, Bevin directly encouraged the formation of joint production committees to extend worker’s participation in industry. By June 1944, almost 4,500 such committees were in existence, covering 3.5 million workers. By the end of the war, the joint production committees were intervening in areas once considered to be the sacrosanct domain of employers, such as health, <b>welfare,</b> <b>transfers</b> of labour, machine staffing, technology, piece rate fixing, and wage payment systems. These developments brought about significant improvements to conditions in the workplace, with a Mass-Observation survey carried out in 1942 noting that [...] "the quick sack and the unexplained instability" [...] of the 1930s had practically vanished. During the 1940s, significant improvements in occupational health and safety standards were brought about both by the rising bargaining power of workers within the older [...] "staple" [...] sectors of the economy and the rise of [...] "the pro-active wartime and post-war state." ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{interactive}} relationships among <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers,</b> income distribution, and government change, {{controlling for the}} effects of demographic and economic variables. We argue that governments are involved in the redistribution of resources to enhance political stability and survival rather than enhancing economic performance or wealth equality. Hence, they tend to respond to groups that are essential for their political survival. Although the presented empirical results are not conclusive, they tend to support our first hypothesis-namely, that <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> increase income inequality. They also provide important insights into the relationships between <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> and three kinds of government change by testing the three other hypotheses. <b>Welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> reduce the likelihood of irregular government change, increase the chance of the same party remaining in office, and have no effect on the major regular government change characteristic of democracies. While the first two kinds of government change are typical of autocratic or semidemocratic societies, the third is characteristic of democratic nations. The implication is that the governments in the first two societies are more capable of using <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> to prolong their tenure than their democratic counterparts. This finding is important {{in the sense that it}} provides a major reason why many autocratic governments are long-lived (e. g., in Zaire, Indonesia, and the Soviet Union) compared with democratic governments. In general, governments utilize <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> to alter their political future. This goal can be successful in the long run only if it does not increase income inequality that can threaten the stability of the political regime. Hence, the policy choices that a government makes to maintain political power through redistribution of resources can be undermined by demographic structures and by the long-term effects of such redistribution of resources...|$|E
3000|$|Aside {{from the}} working {{incentives}} <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> may generate {{and the way}} in which time is allocated across home production and work effort, it is important to emphasize that results shown in the empirical analysis correspond to short-term responses of working behavior to <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> and might not be taken as program’s average treatment effects. As discussed in the literature review, most of the studies evaluating the effect of CCTs on labor supply (in Latin America) do not find significant changes in working behavior of adults. However, [...] "disincentive effects on adult labor supply are found only for the program that made the most generous transfers, the RPS in Nicaragua" [...] (Fiszbein and Schady 2009). This piece of evidence suggests that income effects generated by <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> may depend on the amount of the transfer relative to individual’s earned income 14.|$|E

30|$|Along the document, we {{have argued}} that, {{although}} CCTs {{may not have}} long-term or permanent effects on labor supply of adults, {{it may be the}} case that individuals reduce their working intensity in the short-term as a response to <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers.</b> Our empirical analysis is based on the plausible assumption that payment schedules of Juntos are orthogonal to interview dates of ENAHO survey, and, using this identifying assumption, we are able to construct measures of temporal distance to test whether the recentness of cash transfers affects benefit recipients’ labor supply. In particular, we find that working hours of recipients are reduced when the cash transfer was observed to happen within one week before the interview took place. In this section we discuss some possible paths through which it is possible to observe short- but not long-term effects of <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> on labor supply of adults.|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{the social}} {{altruism}} and social threat hypotheses, the present investigation challenges prior macro-level studies that assume {{that there is a}} nonrecursive relationship between <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> and the aggregate level of homicide. The bivariate auto-regressive integrated moving average analyses of the number of individuals receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits and total and disaggregated counts of homicide reveal no evidence of simultaneity bias. However, as predicted by social altruism theory, the results support the conclusion that prior research is probably tainted by offense aggregation bias. That is, the number of AFDC recipients is, as pre-dicted, negatively associated with the level of familial homicides but is not associated with either the level of nonfamily, felony-related, nonfelony-related, or total homicides. The implications of these findings for the welfare-crime relationship are discussed. This article is concerned with the macro-level association between welfare and homicide within the United States. At first glance, one might be tempted to wonder why there might be any interest in the further examination of this relationship. After all, the extant empirical literature appears to be rather clear and consistent. Beginning with DeFronzo’s (1983) ground-breaking cross-sectional multivariate analysis, <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> have been reported to negatively affect homicide rates cross-culturally (Messner & Rosenfeld, 1997) across standard metropolitan statis...|$|E

This effect, however, is still large enough to distort the distribution of migration flows and, possibly, offset the potential benefits of migration as an inflow of mobile labour into countries with traditionally immobile native workers.

In the following lines we try to disentangle the potential income effect generated by the <b>welfare</b> <b>transfer</b> from the aforementioned confounding effects. To do so, we begin by exploring whether the reduction in working hours brought up by the <b>welfare</b> <b>transfer</b> is evenly distributed along the whole week or if it is concentrated in a particular day or days of the reference week. Under the hypothesis that the reduction in hours of work is being driven by time spent in purchasing goods (once we control for the potential anticipation and transportation effects), one should expect that the effect of the transfer is grouped in a particular day of the week (say, the day which is closer to the payment date).|$|R

40|$|Korpi and Palme's (1998) classic "The Paradox of Redistribution and Strategies of Equality" {{claims that}} {{universal}} social policy better reduces poverty than social policies targeted at the poor. This article revisits Korpi and Palme's classic, {{and in the}} process, explores and informs a set of enduring questions about social policy, politics, and social equality. Specifically, we investigate the relationships between three dimensions of <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers</b> - "transfer share" (the average share of household income from <b>welfare</b> <b>transfers),</b> low-income targeting, and universalism - and poverty and preferences for redistribution. We analyze rich democracies like Korpi and Palme, but also generalize to a broader sample of developed and developing countries. Consistent with Korpi and Palme, we show: a) poverty is negatively associated with the transfer share and universalism; b) redistribution preferences are negatively associated with low-income targeting; and c) universalism is positively associated with the transfer share. Contrary to Korpi and Palme, redistribution preferences {{are not related to}} transfer share or universalism; and low-income targeting is not positively associated with poverty and not negatively associated with transfer share. Therefore, instead of the "paradox of redistribution" we propose two new paradoxes of social policy: noncomplementarity and undermining. The non-complementarity paradox {{is that there is a}} mismatch between the dimensions that matter to poverty and the dimension that matters to redistribution preferences. The undermining paradox emphasizes that the dimension (transfer share) that most reduces poverty tends to increase with the one dimension (low-income targeting) that reduces support for redistribution...|$|E
