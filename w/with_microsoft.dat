5|$|In 2015, Smartsheet started {{introducing}} closer integrations <b>with</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Office products, in part {{thanks to}} changes Microsoft was making in {{their products to}} work better with third-party software. In January 2015, Smartsheet added support for Microsoft's identity management software Azure Active Directory, which allowed users to log into products like Excel and Smartsheet with the same login. Users can also now make changes to smartsheets directly from Microsoft Outlook. In 2016 Smartsheet introduced Sights, a configurable dashboard that shows metrics such as how a team is performing against key performance indicators.|$|E

In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain assets from GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon software development kit (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some assets from EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products.

5|$|Around 2012, {{development}} of The Witness for the next-generation of consoles with improved hardware capabilities became a possibility, and Blow {{and his team}} started looking at this opportunity. They had discounted the Wii U, again citing low specs, and decided {{to choose between the}} PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One platform. At the time of this decision, Sony was able to provide hardware information and development kits. Sony has also sought out independent developers like Blow to learn about the upcoming PlayStation 4 in preparation for its launch, while Microsoft had not yet released firm specifications for their console. Blow opted to go with the PlayStation platform; this decision was also aided by representatives from Sony that were interested in bringing the game to their system, and a larger trend of Sony to bring more downloadable and independently-developed games to their next console in contrast to Microsoft's tighter controls. Blow affirmed that there was no monetary deal involved with this decision. Blow also later acknowledged that he has had difficulties working <b>with</b> <b>Microsoft</b> in the past, and had previously explained several of the issues he had to go through <b>with</b> <b>Microsoft</b> to release his earlier game, Braid. The Witness had been planned as a launch-window title for the PlayStation 4 in 2013, a time-limited console exclusive. The Windows and iOS versions, at this point, were planned to be released alongside the PlayStation 4 version, barring any development delays that Blow and his team encountered. Other console versions would come later, if they opted to develop for them.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, SAS {{was one of}} Inc. Magazine's {{fastest growing}} {{companies}} in America from 1979 and 1985. It grew more than ten percent per year from $10 million in revenues in 1980 to $1.1 billion by 2000. In 2007, SAS revenue was $2.15 billion, and in 2013 its revenue was $3.02 billion. By the late 1990s, SAS was the largest privately held software company. The Associated Press reported that analysts attributed the growth to aggressive R spending. It had the highest ratio of its revenues spent on R in the industry for eight years, setting a record of 34 percent of its revenues in 1993, as it {{was working on a}} new menu-based interface. The company began its relationship <b>with</b> <b>Microsoft</b> and development for Windows operating systems in 1989. Shortly afterwards it established partnerships with database companies like Oracle, Sybase and Informix.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{designer}} Peter James described Flight Unlimited IIIs {{development as}} a struggle, thanks {{to a lack of}} interest from Electronic Arts and from Looking Glass's management. Placed in direct competition <b>with</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Flight Simulator 2000 and Fly!, the game failed to capture sufficient market share. It became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops, with roughly 20,000 units sold in the United States during 1999. This contributed to the company's closure in 2000. The game was well received by critics, who praised its terrain rendering and dynamic weather. Its simulated physics were lauded by several reviewers, but others felt that the physics were imprecise, and that the game's system requirements were extremely high.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft is an American public {{multinational}} corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports {{a wide range}} of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions.

Microsoft would also come to dominate the office suite market <b>with</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Office.

5|$|Windows 10 {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} original release in July 2015; critics praised Microsoft's decision {{to provide a}} desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was panned for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, Xbox Live integration, {{as well as the}} functionality and capabilities of Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer <b>with</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Edge. However, media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory update installation, privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, and the adware-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.|$|E
