25|$|During {{the first}} match against India at Galle, Gunaratne was injured with a {{fracture}} {{in his left}} thumb. The injury occurred when he dived to take a catch of Shikhar Dhawan, while fielding at second slip. <b>With</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> {{was taken to the}} hospital, where doctors advised him to quit playing for six to eight weeks following reconstructive surgery in Colombo. Therefore, Sri Lanka played the match with 10 players and finally lost the match by 304 runs. Finally, Gunaratne was dropped from the whole India tour.|$|E
25|$|João das Regras {{claimed that}} Beatrice of Portugal, {{daughter}} of Ferdinand I {{had no right}} to claim the throne because her father's marriage with Leonor Telles was void, due to the previous marriage of Leonor with João Lourenço da Cunha and also due to the uncertain behaviour of Leonor Telles, which created doubts about the identity of Beatrice's father. Along <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> also claimed that she married John I of Castile, who was her relative, without the dispensation of the Pope.|$|E
25|$|He {{played on}} in {{domestic}} cricket for {{another couple of}} seasons, although without any outstanding success, before bowing out with a game against Trinidad and Tobago in the 1998–99 Busta Cup. Ironically, his first-innings bowling performance {{was one of his}} most economical: his 10 overs went for only 19. However, the second innings was a different story as his no-ball problem returned with a vengeance. He sent down 12 of them in the space of seven wicketless overs, and <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> left the first-class game for good.|$|E

25|$|A serious blow to Kovalevsky's {{career was}} dealt by a scandalous affair {{involving}} fake promissory notes. Back in 1896, {{he met the}} actress and entrepreneur Elizaveta Shabel'skaya, and they had an affair. But in 1902, he became interested in Maria Ilovayskaya and accused his former lover of faking promissory notes in his name. The controversy dragged on until 1905. To marry Ilovayskaya, Kovalevsky divorced his wife, Ekaterina Lukhutina, on the premise of her unfaithfulness. <b>With</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> promised to the consistory, under the oath, that he never failed to perform his conjugal responsibilities. His wife, however, accused him of lying and perjury, and {{in order not to}} discredit the Ministry of Finance, Kovalevsky was forced to resign as Deputy Finance Minister in 1902. His duties in the Ministry of Finance were filled by Vassily Timiryazev.|$|E
25|$|McNabb's 2005 {{season began}} with turmoil and ended {{on the injured}} reserve list. While not {{speaking}} with his main target, Terrell Owens, and all the distractions {{that came with the}} Owens controversy, McNabb was named the NFC's Player of the Month for September. That month, McNabb threw for 964 yards, eight touchdowns and only two interceptions in three games, leading the Eagles to a 2-1 record. McNabb carried that momentum into October as he went 33-for-48 (68.8 completion percentage), threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns en route to leading the Eagles to a memorable come-from-behind victory at an unfriendly Arrowhead Stadium against the Kansas City Chiefs. McNabb could not keep the momentum rolling, however, as the Eagles lost four straight games. Over that span, McNabb posted a quarterback rating higher than 72 only once, on November 6, at the Washington Redskins. After playing with a sports hernia and sore thumb, McNabb's season was finally over after a disastrous effort at home on November 14 on Monday night against the rival Dallas Cowboys. McNabb was intercepted by Roy Williams {{towards the end of the}} game, and tried to tackle the defender when Scott Shanle came in and tackled McNabb to the ground. McNabb had injured his groin on the play and was placed on the injured reserve list later that week. Mike McMahon replaced him at quarterback, and went 2–5 as a starter, with the Eagles finishing the season with a 6–10 record overall. Though low for his standards, McNabb put up respectable numbers in 2005. In nine games, he threw for 2,507 yards, 16 touchdowns and nine interceptions. To go along <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> completed 59.1% (211-357) of his passes. Prior to his season-ending injury, McNabb was on pace to throw for 4,457 yards, which would have easily eclipsed his career high of 3,875, set in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Dessalines and Pétion {{remained}} {{allied with}} France until they switched sides again, in October 1802, and {{fought against the}} French. As Leclerc laid dying of yellow fever and heard that Christophe and Dessalines had joined the rebels, he reacted by ordering all of the blacks living in Le Cap be killed by drowning them in the harbour. In November, Leclerc died of yellow fever, like much of his army. His successor, the Vicomte de Rochambeau, fought an even more brutal campaign. Rochambeau waged a near-genocidal campaign against the Haitians, simply killing everybody who was black. Rochambeau imported about 15, 000 attack dogs from Jamaica, who had trained to savage blacks and mulattoes. At the Bay of Le Cap, Rochambeau had blacks drowned so that no-one would eat fish from the bay for months afterward as no one wished to eat the fish that had eaten human flesh. Bonaparte, hearing {{that most of his}} army in St. Domingue had died of yellow fever and the French only held Port-au-Prince, Le Cap and Les Cayes sent about 20, 000 reinforcements to Rochambeau. Dessalines matched Rochambeau in his vicious cruelty. At Le Cap, when Rochambeau hanged 500 blacks, Dessalines replied by killing 500 whites and sticking their heads on spikes all around Le Cap, so that the French could see what he was planning on doing to them. Rochambeau's atrocities helped rally many former French loyalists to the rebel cause. Many on both sides had come to see the war as a race war where no mercy was to be given, and the Haitians were just as brutal as the French, as they burned French prisoners alive, cut them up with axes, or tied to a board and sawed them into two. Having sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in April 1803, Napoleon began to lose interest in his failing ventures in the Western Hemisphere. He was more concerned about France's European enemies such as Great Britain and Prussia. <b>With</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> withdrew a majority of the French forces in Haiti to counter the possibility of an invasion from Prussia, Britain, and Spain on a weakened France.|$|E

500|$|Highway 61 Revisited {{was issued}} {{at the end}} of August 1965. When Dylan went on tour that fall he asked the future members of The Band to {{accompany}} him in performing the electric half of the concerts. [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] took the closing slot on his setlist and held it, with rare exceptions, through the end of his 1966 [...] "world tour." [...] On May 17, 1966, during the last leg of the tour, Dylan and his band performed at Free Trade Hall in Manchester, England. Just before they started to play the track, an audience member yelled [...] "Judas!", apparently referring to Dylan's supposed [...] "betrayal" [...] of folk music. Dylan responded, [...] "I don't believe you. You're a liar!" [...] <b>With</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> turned to the band, ordering them to [...] "play it fucking loud".|$|E
500|$|Maynard {{found the}} pirates {{anchored}} {{on the inner}} side of Ocracoke Island, on the evening of 21November. [...] He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey, but unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack. [...] He stopped all traffic from entering the inlet—preventing any warning of his presence—and posted a lookout on both sloops to ensure that Teach could not escape to sea. [...] On {{the other side of the}} island, Teach was busy entertaining guests and had not set a lookout. [...] With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about24 of Adventures sailors, he also had a much-reduced crew. [...] Johnson (1724) reported that the pirate had [...] "no more than twenty-five men on board" [...] and that he [...] "gave out to all the vessels that he spoke <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had forty". [...] "Thirteen white and six Negroes", was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty.|$|E

500|$|Earl Sigurd {{had a hard}} {{battle against}} Kerthialfad, and Kerthialfad came on so fast that he laid low all {{who were in the}} front rank, and he broke the array of Earl Sigurd right up to his banner, and slew the banner-bearer. Then he got another man to bear the banner, and there was again a hard fight. Kerthialfad smote this man too his death blow at once, and so on one after the other all who stood near him. Then Earl Sigurd called on Thorstein the son of Hall of Sida, to bear the banner, and Thorstein was just about to lift the banner, but then Asmund the White said, [...] "Don't bear the banner! For all they who bear it get their death." [...] "Hrafn the Red!" [...] called out Earl Sigurd, [...] "bear thou the banner." [...] "Bear thine own devil thyself," [...] {{answered}} Hrafn. Then the earl said, [...] "`Tis fittest that the beggar should bear the bag;'" [...] and <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> took the banner from the staff and put it under his cloak. A little after Asmund the White was slain, and then the earl was pierced through with a spear.|$|E
500|$|Rhys' mother, Elaine (Sancia Robinson), was {{introduced}} in November 2011. Barber revealed in his interview with Kilkelly that their backstory would be explored and stated that it would explain [...] "a lot more about why Rhys {{is the way he}} is". He added that there would be [...] "a big revelation" [...] about Elaine coming up. Elaine suffers from a degenerative spinal condition and has to use a wheelchair. Rhys was forced to care for her when his father ran out on them both. Rhys tries to keep his life on Ramsay Street separate from his family, so when Elaine asks him if she can spend Easter with him, he makes up excuses as to why she cannot visit him. Barber revealed to an Inside Soap writer that Elaine realises Rhys is lying to her and she starts to wonder if he is ashamed to be seen with her. Rhys' actions when his housemates arrive appear to confirm his mother's suspicions. While they wonder who Elaine is, he makes up an excuse. Barber explained [...] "Rhys pretends he's visiting one of his patients. Elaine is really hurt and embarrassed when he comes out <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> realises, and feels terrible." ...|$|E
500|$|Duality {{is another}} common theme in Caligari. Dr. Caligari is {{portrayed in the}} main {{narrative}} as an insane tyrant, and in the frame story as a respected authority and director of a mental institution. As {{a result of this}} duality, the viewer cannot help but suspect a malevolent aspect of him {{at the conclusion of the}} film, even despite all evidence indicating he is a kind and caring man. Even within the main narrative alone, Dr. Caligari lives a double life: holding a respectable position as the asylum director, but becoming a hypnotist and murderer at night. Additionally, the character is actually a double of the [...] "real" [...] Caligari, an 18th-century mystic whom the film character becomes so obsessed <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> desires to penetrate his innermost secrets and [...] "become Caligari". Francis also takes on a double life of sorts, serving as the heroic protagonist in the main narrative and a patient in a mental institution in the frame story. Anton Kaes described the story Francis tells as an act of transference with his psychiatrist, as well as a projection of his feelings that he is a victim under the spell of the all-powerful asylum director, just as Cesare is the hypnotized victim of Dr. Caligari. The Cesare character serves as both a persecutor and a victim, as he is both a murderer and the unwilling slave of an oppressive master.|$|E

500|$|Robson {{appeared}} on The Today Show on May 16, 2013, {{to discuss the}} allegations. Robson told interviewer Matt Lauer that Jackson was [...] "a pedophile and a child sexual abuser" [...] who [...] "performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him" [...] over a seven-year period, beginning in 1990 when Robson {{was seven years old}} when he visited Jackson's Neverland Ranch for the first time. In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had [...] "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's [...] "special friend" [...] in 1990. In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call me every day and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial. He said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
