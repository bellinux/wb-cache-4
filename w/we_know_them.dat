5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> today started {{to emerge in}} the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E
25|$|Many {{cultures}} have used {{and continue to}} use additional descriptive terms in identifying individuals. These terms may indicate personal attributes, location of origin, occupation, parentage, patronage, adoption, or clan affiliation. These descriptors often developed into fixed clan identifications that in turn became family names as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> today.|$|E
25|$|As for {{shoelaces}} in {{the sense}} that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> in modern times, the Museum of London has documented examples of medieval footwear dating from {{as far back as the}} 12th century, which clearly show the lacing passing through a series of hooks or eyelets down the front or side of the shoe.|$|E
60|$|Yet in a dim {{confused}} way I {{think he}} was making out a case. In schools as <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>them,</b> and {{with the sort of}} assistant available, the sort of assistant who has been trained entirely on the old lines, he could see no other teaching so effectual in developing attention, restraint, sustained constructive effort and various yet systematic adjustment. And that was as far as his imagination could go.|$|R

25|$|Iowa {{is often}} {{credited}} with {{the start of the}} high school movement in the U.S. Around 1910, secondary schools as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> today were established across the state, which was unprecedented at the time. As the high school movement gathered pace and went beyond Iowa, there was clear evidence of how more time spent in school led to greater income.|$|E
25|$|The cones are {{conventionally}} labeled {{according to}} the ordering of the wavelengths of the peaks of their spectral sensitivities: short (S), medium (M), and long (L) cone types. These three types do not correspond well to particular colors as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them.</b> Rather, the perception of color is achieved by a complex process that starts with the differential output of these cells in the retina {{and it will be}} finalized in the visual cortex and associative areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened. This set {{the pattern}} for modern railways. It was the world's first inter-city {{passenger}} railway {{and the first to}} have 'scheduled' services, terminal stations and services as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> today. The railways carried freight and passengers with also the world's first goods terminal station at the Park Lane railway goods station at Liverpool's south docks, accessed by the 1.26 mile Wapping Tunnel. In 1836, at the Liverpool end the line was extended to Lime Street Station in Liverpool's city centre via a 1.1 mile long tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Hernan Cortés wrote, in a 1520 letter, {{that the}} Aztecs raised {{and sold the}} little dogs as food. Small dogs such as Chihuahuas were also used as living hot-water bottles during illness or injury. Some historians believe this {{practice}} is where the idea of pain being transferred to animals from humans originated, which gave way to rituals such as burning the deceased with live dogs, such as the Techichi, to exonerate the deceased human's sins.Chihuahuas as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> today remained a rarity until the early 20th century; the American Kennel Club (AKC) did not register a Chihuahua until 1904.|$|E
25|$|Early {{papers on}} {{geosynthetics}} (as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> today) in the 1960s documented their use as filters in the United States and as reinforcement in Europe. A 1977 conference in Paris brought together {{many of the}} early manufacturers and practitioners. The International Geosynthetics Society (IGS) founded in 1982 has subsequently organized a worldwide conference every four years and its numerous chapters have additional conferences. Presently, separate geosynthetic institutes, trade-groups, and standards-setting groups are active. Approximately twenty universities teach stand-alone courses on geosynthetics and almost all include the subject in geotechnical, geoenvironmental, and hydraulic engineering courses. Geosynthetics are available worldwide and the activity is robust and steadily growing.|$|E
25|$|The Great Lakes are {{estimated}} to have been formed {{at the end of}} the last glacial period (the Wisconsin glaciation ended 10,000 to 12,000 years ago), when the Laurentide Ice Sheet receded. The retreat of the ice sheet left behind a large amount of meltwater (see Lake Algonquin and Lake Chicago) that filled up the basins that the glaciers had carved, thus creating the Great Lakes as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> today. Because of the uneven nature of glacier erosion, some higher hills became Great Lakes islands. The Niagara Escarpment follows the contour of the Great Lakes between New York and Wisconsin. See also Glacial Lake Iroquois and Champlain Sea.|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacture}} of economical, reliable ballpoint pens as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing {{capabilities of the}} early 20th century. Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available. Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens. If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear. Ink reservoirs pressurized by piston, spring, capillary action, and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.|$|E
25|$|Breeds as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> today did {{not exist}} before Victorian times, but local {{variations}} of the ancestors of current breeds came into America along with their owners and livestock. Included are some that are now extinct or that have merged into other breeds. These may have included some British herding dogs, native dogs from North America (originating in Asia/Siberia), as well as dogs from Germany and Spain including the Carea Leonés. For many centuries, shepherds {{were more interested in}} dogs' working abilities than their appearance. As a result, over time, shepherds interbred dogs that they believed would produce better workers for the given climate and landscape. In the eastern U.S., terrain and weather conditions were similar to that of Europe, so the existing imported breeds and their offspring worked well there.|$|E
25|$|The sea {{made one}} more {{important}} intrusion into West Virginia during Middle Mississippian time, approximately 330 million years ago, {{resulting in the}} deposition of the Greenbrier Formation, predominantly limestone, the last marine deposit of significance in the State. At the close of Mississippian time, about 310 million years ago, West Virginia was essentially a land area, subject to erosion. Early in the succeeding Pennsylvanian Period, the area dropped to near sea level and for more than 50 million years continued to sink {{at about the same}} rate that deposition was taking place. Permian Period, roughly 270 to 225 million years ago, the Appalachian Orogeny began which played a major part {{in the formation of the}} Appalachian Mountains as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> today. Never again has the sea invaded West Virginia.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the period, {{horses were}} rarely {{considered}} breeds, but instead were defined by type: by describing their purpose or their physical attributes. [...] Many of the definitions were not precise, or were interchangeable. [...] Prior to approximately the 13th century, few pedigrees were written down. Thus, many terms for {{horses in the}} Middle Ages did not refer to breeds as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> today, but rather described appearance or purpose.|$|E

On the other hand, Richard Fernicola notes that 1916 was a [...] "shark year" [...] as fishermen and captains were reporting hundreds of sharks swimming in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Ellis remarks that [...] "to try to make the facts as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>them</b> conform to the 'rogue shark' theory is stretching sensationalism and credibility beyond reasonable limits."
