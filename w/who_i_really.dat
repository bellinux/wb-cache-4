During his lifetime, Bashō was {{recognized}} for his works in the collaborative haikai no renga form; today, after centuries of commentary, he is recognized as the greatest master of haiku (then called hokku). Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned; and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is justifiably famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> am is in linking haikai verses." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction {{of myself as a}} new artist in a way, because for the first time people are really seeing and getting to know <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it away from me. And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E
500|$|Mauboy grew up {{listening}} to country singers Patsy Cline, Dolly Parton and Slim Dusty; she credits country music as her first love of music, saying the genre [...] "is <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>really,</b> really am deeply." [...] Mauboy also grew up {{listening to}} hip-hop rappers Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Mauboy cites Mariah Carey as her main influence and inspiration, stating that she has [...] "drawn a lot of inspiration from watching and listening to her live performances". She grew {{up listening to}} many of Carey's songs and was inspired by her vocal style and songwriting, [...] "I loved 'Dreamlover' and 'Fantasy' – and picked up loads of tips from her style of singing. She taught me that the lyrics you write have to come from personal experiences – I really felt her music. Now I aspire to writing honest lyrics with real feelings that people can relate to." [...] Mauboy also names Whitney Houston as another influence, stating that she looks up to her and Carey [...] "for their outstanding vocal performances". Her other musical influences are John Farnham and Beyoncé. Mauboy is also inspired by fellow Indigenous Australian women such as Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman and actress Deborah Mailman.|$|E

She dilated on her ladyship's kindnesses to me, on the effrontery and wickedness of my procedure, and so came at last to the terms of my penance.

2500|$|According to Loveless, [...] "...I {{learned so}} much about what to feel in a song from those years of playing those clubs. I was saddened {{sometimes}} because I thought 'I left Nashville, I left all that for this? What happened to me? What is wrong with me?' But I think what was happening was that I was beginning to find... me. Find <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> was. And {{what kind of person}} I was inside and out. I still believe to this day it happened the way it was supposed to happen.|$|E

He was a great person, {{one of the few}} that I find was really true to himself. He {{was one of the few}} riders <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> admired for his honesty and his frankness. We talked about a lot of {{different}} things outside of cycling and I was fortunate to really get to know him when my career stopped. I believe he was also one of the generation that was cut short in the early nineties because he was not able to fulfill the rest of his career. But he was a great rider." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{bands that}} defined and embraced the gothic rock genre {{included}} Bauhaus, [...] early Adam and the Ants, the Cure, the Birthday Party, Southern Death Cult, Specimen, Sex Gang Children, UK Decay, Virgin Prunes, Killing Joke, and the Damned. Near {{the peak of}} this first generation of the gothic scene in 1983, The Face Paul Rambali recalled that there were [...] "several strong Gothic characteristics" [...] in the music of Joy Division. In 1984, Joy Division's bassist Peter Hook named Play Dead {{as one of their}} heirs: [...] "If you listen to a band like Play Dead, <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> like, Joy Division played the same stuff that Play Dead are playing.

5000|$|... "Sanctuary" [...] utilises the {{introductory}} riff of Maxine Brown's 1964 version of [...] "Oh No Not My Baby". Regarding the song's meaning, Cilmi explained, [...] "I met someone <b>who</b> <b>I</b> felt <b>really</b> comfortable with {{and all those}} feelings that come with feeling comfortable with someone. The song is kind of about that, although I'm not even friends with that person any more." ...|$|R
2500|$|.....in Buddhism {{the image}} of the mother as the {{embodiment}} of compassion is used a lot. She'll do anything for the children. As a mother I felt that depth of love and commitment and having somebody <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> would give my own life for—it was very powerful {{to have that kind of}} relationship. I also felt that I didn't really grow up until I had my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children. More so I think meeting the challenges of motherhood with what I had learned made my practice very rich.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{described}} the release as her most personal work, developed throughout her entire lifetime. She explained, [...] "I never looked deeply at the pain from my past, {{never tried to}} understand that pain and work it through. It was a journey I had avoided. But one I now had to face." [...] Robert Hilburn added, [...] "Jackson found a universal symbol to use in exploring issues of insecurity and self-worth. At some point, everyone is {{on the wrong side}} of the velvet rope, excluded because of race, social status, age or some other division." [...] Jackson regarded commercial success as a secondary consideration, commenting, [...] "I needed to express who I was and what I'd learned. I found out <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> was... If that can inspire people who hear this album to do the same, I'd rather have that than the biggest selling album in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several critics {{observed}} Beyoncé's persona [...] "Sasha Fierce" [...] and I Am... Sasha Fierce {{album to}} be influenced by Damita Jo. The Sydney Morning Herald stated [...] "When Janet Jackson released the album Damita Jo after the Super Bowl nipple furore, she told us that [...] "Damita Jo is one of the characters that lives inside of me". And now Beyonce wants us to know that this album ... reflects how: [...] "I have someone else that takes over when it's time for me to work and when I'm on stage, this alter ego that I've created kind of protects me and <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> am." [...] The Courant commented [...] "her musical forebear Janet Jackson is occasionally known as Damita Jo, so why shouldn't Beyonce have an alter-ego, too?". The rear artwork of Jennifer Lopez's Rebirth drew comparisons to Jackson's Damita Jo album cover, depicting Lopez topless in a similar pose amidst a white backdrop. Critics cited [...] "Just a Little While" [...] to influence Crystal Kay's [...] "Busy Doing Nothing" [...] and Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Cherry Pie." [...] The Washington Times likened Whitney Houston's [...] "Like I Never Left", a duet with Akon, to being inspired by Jackson's [...] "My Baby," [...] which featured Kanye West. AllMusic compared the erotic tone of Jill Scott's [...] "" [...] to the album's suggestive content. Furthermore, Lil' Kim released a remix of the album's title track.|$|E

5000|$|B.o.B {{explained}} the album title {{comes from a}} concept of his: [...] "Strange Clouds {{is kind of a}} science-fictiony kind of title, mixed with recreational activities. It's really like a fusion between the hip-hop lifestyle and the people whose thoughts cross into the other realm of thinking, outside of the norm, which may be considered strange or weird, or unique. And, I feel like it's all about [...] these two different worlds — on the ground level to the skies. If that makes sense." [...] B.o.B previously promised fans a [...] "different sound" [...] compared to his debut: [...] "I feel like the sound is a continuum from the last album, just more mature, more refined, more conversational at moments. You know, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> bring people closer to <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am, and what makes me think, and … my story, growing up as a kid and just letting people know <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am <b>really.</b> <b>I</b> don’t think people really know enough of <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am. You know, <b>I</b> had a <b>really</b> good year last year, and it happened <b>really</b> fast … <b>I</b> needed to sit down for year. I recorded my album — I spent about 13-14 months on it. I’m ready to really build the connection with my fans." ...|$|R

40|$|A growing {{literature}} suggests marketing practice is declining in influence within the firm. Diagnostic opinions {{as to why}} this is occurring, and prescriptions as to {{what should be done}} are varied. This dissertation proposes narrative as a tool for both understanding and addressing the problem of marketing 2 ̆ 7 s declining influence. Narratology is a humanities-based discipline which explores what stories are, what they do, and how they work. It is well suited for exploring how influence is generated, gained and/or lost, within social and organizational settings. This dissertation suggests that narrative significantly impacts understanding which business function (marketing, finance, accounting, etc.) has greater influence within the firm. Moreover, by understanding how narrative carries influence between marketing and finance, marketers may be able to compete more effectively with other business function narratives. 22 depth interviews were collected of finance and marketing managers within firms, repeated across 10 firms of various sizes and in various industries. 689 narrative events and descriptions were used for analysis. Narratological investigation revealed three themes concerning marketing and finance 2 ̆ 7 s narrative competition, Theme # 1, 2 ̆ 2 Finance as Watchdog 2 ̆ 2; Theme # 2, 2 ̆ 2 <b>Who</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Really</b> Managing the Brand? 2 ̆ 2 and Theme # 3, 2 ̆ 2 How Finance is Your Marketing? 2 ̆...|$|R

At a Detroit radio station, she met Mick Jagger as both were scheduled to be interviewed. He asked her out but her father would not permit it, concerned about drugs. She introduced the Beatles at their first performance at Detroit in 1964 at the Olympic Arena. In a later interview she stated that “It was strange at that time because the Motown sound was big then and the Beatles seemed {{just like any other}} group. At that time <b>I</b> didn’t realize <b>who</b> <b>I</b> was <b>really</b> with. During the performance girls started throwing things, {{then all of a sudden}} it got really wild, everything sort of went out of control and we were all literally carried off stage - and that was it. Everything was a mess. It wasn’t until later, looking back, that I completely understood the phenomena.” ...|$|R
