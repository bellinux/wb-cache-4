5|$|I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{down with}} Wale before I wrote the hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's {{one of those}} songs, one of those tracks {{and one of those}} videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
5|$|A {{free agent}} in March 2001, Henderson {{returned}} to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and {{on the final day}} of the season collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson. That final game was also Padre Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play. After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. With Gwynn having 3,141 hits, it was just the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3,000 career hits; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games together for the 1928 A's.|$|E
25|$|The retry of Deck’s penalty phase {{began on}} April 29, 2003, {{where he was}} brought into court wearing shackles. The defense objected to Deck being visibly restrained, stating that Deck’s {{behavior}} did not justify shackles. The defense stated the only justification for shackling Deck {{would have been if}} he caused a disturbance in the courtroom. However, he did not. The defense also suggested other measures that the court could have taken to ensure safety instead of shackling Deck. These measures included adding extra security guards to the courtroom, and having the people who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the gallery walk through metal detectors. However, the defense’s objections were overruled. Deck’s attorneys once again objected during voir dire. Deck’s defense thought that asking jurors if the shackles biased them was not enough to ensure that Deck would receive reliable sentencing. The court overruled the objection again, stating “The objection that you’re making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will remain in legirons and belly chain.” The jury once again sentenced Deck to death.|$|E

500|$|Once {{the news}} of the cause of death of the Ngo {{brothers}} began to become public, the United States became concerned at their association with the new junta and their actions during the coup. US Secretary of State Dean Rusk directed Lodge to question Minh about the killings. Lodge cabled back, initially backing the false story disseminated by the generals, saying that their story was plausible because of the supposedly loaded pistol being left {{on the floor of the}} vehicle. Rusk was worried about the public relations implications the bloody photographs of the brothers would generate. Lodge showed no alarm in public, congratulating Đôn on the [...] "masterful performance" [...] of the coup and promising diplomatic recognition. Đôn's assertion that the assassinations were unplanned proved sufficient for Lodge, who told the State Department that [...] "I am sure assassination was not at their direction." [...] Minh and Đôn reiterated their position in a meeting with Conein and Lodge on the following day. Several members of the Kennedy administration were appalled by the killings. The Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs W. Averell Harriman declared that [...] "it was a great shock to everybody that they were killed." [...] He postulated that it was an accident and speculated that Nhu may have caused it by insulting the officers who were supervising him. Embassy official Rufus Phillips, who was the US adviser to Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, said that [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and cry", citing the killings as a key factor in the future leadership troubles which beset South Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "one of those rare movies where I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> {{in the front row}} and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision". Broadway star Nathan Lane, who was the voice of Timon the meerkat in The Lion King, has said Finding Nemo was his {{favorite}} animated film. Ed Park of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants." [...] Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure." [...] Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of L.A. Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As gorgeous a film as Disney's ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy." [...] Jeff Strickler of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying it [...] "proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The underwater backdrops take your breath away. No, really. They're so lifelike, you almost feel like holding your breath while watching." [...] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Parental anxiety may not be the kind of stuff children's films are usually made of, but this perfectly enchanting movie knows how to cater to its kiddie audience without condescending to them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Minton's Playhouse {{became so}} popular {{in those days}} that the house band began to develop ways of weeding out the musicians who couldn't play that <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in. According to bassist Milt Hinton, Gillespie {{prompted}} the band to play standards, such as Gershwin's [...] "I Got Rhythm", in difficult keys in order to discourage beginners from sitting in.

2500|$|Before {{starting}} {{the filming of}} Guzaarish, Bhansali visited Ajmer Dargah in Rajasthan for seeking blessings. Bhansali also met the singing legend Lata Mangeshkar, whom he had revealed {{to be the source}} of inspiration to him, to seek her blessings before he fully embarked on filming Guzaarish.During the meeting, Mangeshkar told that she was a big fan of Bhansali's films and that she was fortunate to be the source of inspiration behind such a talented director's film. She told the media members that [...] "..Even I had heard that he makes his singers hear my songs over and over again before making them sing. I've always been a big fan of Sanjay's films, specially Black. I remember watching the Filmfare Awards in the year of Black. Every time the nominations were announced I prayed for Black to win. And it did. If I'm a source of inspiration to him then I count myself fortunate".Bhansali candidly admitted that he was very much afraid of meeting Lata since [...] "..one doesn't hobnob with one's god". He added that once he reached her home, he [...] "... just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and gaze at her. I realized in person she's as magical as she is in her singing. There's something other-worldly about her, a quality I haven't encountered in anyone else in my life".|$|E

6000|$|When {{he got in}} he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down at once in {{the little}} creaky chair by the fire, but Ethel came flitting from the newly bought {{typewriter}} with arms extended and prevented him. [...] "Oh!--it has been dull," [...] she said.|$|E
50|$|Now imagine {{someone else}} {{comes along and}} <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down. The empty row has a poor view; so he does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> there. Instead, {{a person in the}} crowded row moves into the empty seat the first person left behind. The empty seat moves one spot closer to the edge and the person waiting <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down. The next person follows, and the next, et cetera. One could say that the empty seat moves towards the edge of the row. Once the empty seat reaches the edge, the new person can sit down.|$|R

60|$|Prescott felt {{suddenly}} limp and nerveless; now that help was near at hand, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down; {{but he held}} on until he limped into the hut, where two men stood awaiting him.
