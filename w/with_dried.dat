40|$|AIMS: The corneal {{temperature}} change following each blink {{was investigated in}} patients <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> eye using an infrared radiation thermometer. METHODS: Twenty patients <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> eye and 20 normal controls were enrolled in this study. Subjects kept their eyes open for 10 seconds without blinking and corneal temperature was measured every second with a recently improved infrared radiation thermometer. RESULTS: In the 20 patients <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> eye, corneal {{temperature change}} after keeping the eye open for 10 seconds was 0. 21 (SD 0. 06) degree C while it was 0. 61 (0. 28) degree C in the 20 normal patients (p = 0. 0001). In an exponential equation, the inclination of the slope of a patient <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> eye was smaller than the normal. The correlation coefficient was r = 0. 79 (0. 16) in patients <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> eye and r = 0. 90 (0. 07) in normal patients. The mean K value of patients <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> eye was 0. 20 (0. 13) /second and that of normal subjects was 0. 31 (0. 19) /second (p = 0. 03). CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate the usefulness of this thermometer for measuring corneal temperature {{in the evaluation of}} dry eye. Decrease in corneal temperature with each blink in patients <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> eye was smaller than in normal subjects...|$|R

5|$|Females lay {{from ten}} to three hundred eggs at a time, {{depending}} on species, fertilising {{them with the}} stored sperm as they do so. Many species deposit the eggs on moist soil or organic detritus, but some construct nests lined <b>with</b> <b>dried</b> faeces, and may protect the eggs within silk cocoons. In most species, the female abandons the eggs after they are laid, but some species in the orders Platydesmida and Stemmiulida provide parental care for eggs and young.|$|E
5|$|Gaza's cuisine is {{characterized}} by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also {{played an important role}} in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas ("chard and lentils") and bisara (skinless fava beans mashed <b>with</b> <b>dried</b> mulukhiya leaves and chilies).|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served <b>with</b> <b>dried</b> fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{develop a}} method that can {{maintain}} egg freshness during practical storage conditions, eggs were coated with chitosan and stored <b>with</b> or without <b>dry</b> ice. The physicochemical and microbiological quali-ties of eggs were evaluated during 14 d of storage at 4 and 23 °C without dry ice and at 23 °C <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> ice. The combination of chitosan coating and dry ice signifi-cantly inhibited a Haugh unit decrease during storage at 23 °C. No difference in functional properties, such as foaming ability, foam stability, and viscosity, among treatments was observed, but chitosan coating and storage <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> ice decreased the rate of pH increase and moisture loss in albumen at d 7 and 14. The eggs treated with chitosan coating and storage <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> ice had a significantly lower number of Salmonella Typh-imurium inoculated on the egg surface than did control eggs during storage at 23 °C. Results revealed {{that the combination of}} chitosan coating and storage <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> ice limited the moisture loss, CO 2 emission, and pH in-crease, which helped maintaining the freshness of eggs. Microbial growth was also inhibited during storage at 23 °C. Effects of chitosan coating and storage <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> ice on the freshness and quality of egg...|$|R

The test-results of these mushrooms showed 2,770 Becquerels per kilo in March and 955 Becquerels per kilo in October, far above the limit of 500 Becquerels per kilo set by the Japanese government. The mushrooms were checked for contamination {{in the first week of}} November, after requests of concerned people with questions about possible contamination of the food served.

25|$|While the {{production}} of 40 by 60cm paper remains economically important, the amate production of the San Pablito has since diversified. New products include envelopes, bookmarks, cutout figures, and booklets, as well as sheets {{in a variety of}} colors, textures and sizes up to 1.20 by 2.40 meters. There are also varieties decorated <b>with</b> <b>dried</b> flowers and leaves. In addition to traditional Nahua customers, amate paper is now sold to industries who use it to produce other end products such as lampshades, furniture covers, wallpaper and parquet flooring. The success of amate paper commercialization has caused the population here to forego most other economic activities such as agriculture and even other handcrafts such as pottery and weaving.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, {{spaghetti}} {{is often}} {{served with a}} distinct, slightly sweet yet flavourful meat sauce (the base {{of which would be}} tomato sauce or paste and ketchup), frequently containing ground beef or pork and diced hot dogs and ham. It is spiced with some soy sauce, heavy quantities of garlic, dried oregano sprigs and sometimes <b>with</b> <b>dried</b> bay leaf, and afterwards topped with grated cheese. Other pasta dishes are also cooked nowadays in the Filipino kitchen, like carbonara, pasta with alfredo sauce, and baked macaroni. These dishes are usually cooked for gatherings and special occasions, like family reunions or Christmas. Macaroni or other tube pasta is also used in sopas, a local chicken broth soup.|$|E
