Matthew began creating the melody and track, and I started working on the lyrics. I remember staying in bed for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E
5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover <b>what</b> <b>things</b> are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E

Likewise, Shakespeare's attention was not merely to habitual outward behaviour, but to the most transitory, fleeting inward impressions.

500|$|He {{returned}} to the United States {{in the summer of}} 1856 and began his college duties. Towards the end of his professorship, then-president of Harvard Charles William Eliot noted that Lowell seemed to have [...] "no natural inclination" [...] to teach; Lowell agreed, but retained his position for twenty years. He focused on teaching literature, rather than etymology, hoping that his students would learn to enjoy the sound, rhythm, and flow of poetry rather than the technique of words. He summed up his method: [...] "True scholarship consists in knowing not <b>what</b> <b>things</b> exists, but what they mean; it is not memory but judgment." [...] Still grieving the loss of his wife, during this time Lowell avoided Elmwood and instead lived on Kirkland Street in Cambridge, an area known as Professors' Row. He stayed there, along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap, until January 1861.|$|E
500|$|Join Hands {{was written}} {{over a period}} of six months. In 1979, the band watched news reports from Iran, {{including}} scenes of repression and curfews; {{it was one of the}} first times they had seen images of people being shot and killed on television. In England, the political situation was also unstable, with rubbish piling up in the streets of London. Siouxsie Sioux saw it as [...] "a real time, everything in flocks and uncertain but also festering underneath, and because this stuff from the past that was just left there rotting there and it needed to be acknowledged and then cleaned up, not just swept away still rotting". The band were inspired by these events. The theme of war emerged through the songs: rather than a pro-military message, the lyrics were meant to capture the spirit of <b>what</b> <b>things</b> were like at the time. Miranda Sawyer stated that Join Hands took [...] "the very un-rock'n'roll topic of World War I as its inspiration".|$|E

2500|$|Bob Thomas, senior {{executive}} {{of the church in}} the early 1970s, gave a prosaic description.The immediate goal of the E-meter is to enhance communication. In other words, just to take a parallel: if an analyst were allowing his patient to free-associate, and the patient were connected in some way with a galvanometer which showed the analyst <b>what</b> <b>things</b> the patient mentioned were emotionally charged and <b>what</b> <b>things</b> were not emotionally charged, a lot of time would be saved. So it's simply an assist for the practitioner to direct the individual to areas which he himself may not realize are troubled or charged with emotion or are repressed; and to better direct his attention into those areas ...The E-meter is a simple psycho-galvanometer. It's got some increased sensitivity built into it and the myological reactions that you sometimes get in the galvanometer have been damped out by the circuitry, so that the mental reactions, the reactions of the spirit, on the body are emphasized and can be read more clearly. But that's simply the design of the circuitry; it doesn't basically affect the kind of device. It registers what is called, commonly, the psychogalvanomic reflex, which is a reflex that is a poorly understood mechanism of the psyche. The body resistance seems to vary when the individual thinks of a painful or pain-associated or traumatic-associated concept, or word or idea. ...

He doesn’t believe anyone will ever return so when things start to fall apart between the pair he laments: “I’ll never see anyone again.” ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{period of}} {{ministry}} includes the Discourse on the Church in which Jesus anticipates a future community of followers, and explains {{the role of}} his apostles in leading it. It includes the parables of The Lost Sheep and The Unforgiving Servant in Matthew 18 which also refer to the Kingdom of Heaven. The general theme of the discourse is the anticipation of a future community of followers, {{and the role of}} his apostles in leading it. Addressing his apostles in 18:18, Jesus states: [...] "what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and <b>what</b> <b>things</b> soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven". The discourse emphasizes the importance of humility and self-sacrifice as the high virtues within the anticipated community. It teaches that in the Kingdom of God, it is childlike humility that matters, not social prominence and clout.|$|E
2500|$|Yeasayer {{wanted a}} {{recording}} place close to Brooklyn, but removed from it. The band members aimed to streamline their songwriting processes by only doing <b>what</b> <b>things</b> were necessary in whatever parts without embellishing with long songs. According to Revitte, nobody was [...] "married to anything" [...] and minute things like vocal lines were recorded and rerecorded until done right. Sometimes whole sections were redone from scratch. The engineer also helped the band with advice about what other groups their evolving work sounded like. Yeasayer created {{music in the}} context of thinking about the music they liked, including interesting works from contemporaries. The aim was to craft pop songs unapologetically and embrace the genre as much as possible. Wilder has noted that Keating singing lead vocals gives songs an added extra as he has [...] "a true pop voice", while he and Tuton do not.|$|E
2500|$|However, Liu's {{nomination}} was harshly criticized by Senate Republicans for allegedly failing to disclose 117 {{of his more}} controversial writings and speeches. On April 6, 2010, Liu submitted the 117 requested items to the committee as a supplemental to the original questionnaire. The committee hearing had been postponed twice particularly due to Republican opposition to Liu's judicial qualifications and record. Liu defended his writings as a scholar by saying that [...] "there’s a clear difference between <b>what</b> <b>things</b> people write as scholars and how one would approach {{the role of a}} judge". On April 6, 2010, a letter was sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy by the seven committee Republicans to request a third postponement, which was subsequently rejected. Liu was also criticized for lack of trial-level experience. Prior to his nomination, Liu had not served as a judge and had argued only one case at the appellate court level as a lawyer.|$|E

2500|$|The fourth {{discourse}} in Matthew 18 {{is often called}} the Discourse on the Church. It includes the parables of The Lost Sheep and The Unforgiving Servant which also refer to the Kingdom of Heaven. The general theme of the discourse is the anticipation of a future community of followers, {{and the role of}} his apostles in leading it. Addressing his apostles in 18:18, Jesus states: [...] "what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and <b>what</b> <b>things</b> soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven", see also Binding and loosing. This power is first given to Peter in chapter 16 after Peter confesses that Jesus is the [...] "son of the living God". [...] In addition to the powers of binding and loosing, Peter is given the keys to the kingdom of heaven, and is sometimes considered the [...] "rock" [...] on which Christ built his Church.

2500|$|Dasein is a German {{word and}} is {{sometimes}} translated as [...] "being-there" [...] or [...] "being-here" [...] (da combines in its meaning [...] "here" [...] and [...] "there", excluding the spatial-relational distinction {{made by the}} English words; Sein is the infinitive, [...] "to be"). It is the German form of the existential expletive, which, as in most European languages, is expressed idiomatically. Heidegger, after Nietzsche, used the word, but as a gerund synonym for [...] "human being" [...] or [...] "human entity." [...] A Dasein is then a new coinage for a being that is there, in a familiar world, and in a mood. Dasein also has unique capacities for language, intersubjective communication, and detached reasoning. Heidegger {{does not want to}} get tied up with overused and ambiguous words such as [...] "person," [...] "consciousness," [...] "soul," [...] or [...] "spirit," [...] so Dasein is a new way of approaching something all of those other words point towards, but without the connotations. Dasein is the starting point of Heidegger's ontology. It is typically thought to apply to humans, but it could apply to any being that fulfills the definition's characteristics which he states. What makes a being a Dasein is as follows: Dasein is a being whose being is an issue for itself; every Dasein has an a priori sense of [...] "mineness," [...] or being one's self; Dasein is always thrown into the world, meaning it finds itself within a world, meaning no Dasein has ever been decontextualized. We are all world-bound, submerged, entangled, and engaged with our ontico-ontological surroundings through care, concern, and moods. Dasein has various modes of being-in-the-world, which are the subject of much of Heidegger's analysis in Being and Time. Furthermore, average humans have a pre-ontological (general intuitive sense of being) understanding of being insofar as they understand <b>what</b> <b>things</b> are and that they are e.g. [...] "My dog is brown" [...] or [...] "Today is Sunday." [...] Heidegger believed that this pre-reflective understanding of being, that which determines entities as entities, helps constitute our unique existence as human beings, thus the coinage of [...] "Dasein." ...|$|E
