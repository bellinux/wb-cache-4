25|$|The oldest known {{surviving}} {{example of}} the icon of Christ Pantocrator was painted in encaustic on panel in the sixth or seventh century, and survived the period of destruction of images during the Iconoclastic disputes that twice racked the Eastern church, 726 to 787 and 814 to 842. It was preserved in Saint Catherine's Monastery, in the remote desert of the Sinai. The gessoed panel, finely painted using a <b>wax</b> <b>medium</b> on a wooden panel, had been coarsely overpainted around the face and hands at some time around the thirteenth century.

50|$|Before World War I, Bettini {{brought his}} {{collection}} of master recordings to France. During World War II, {{most of them were}} destroyed. Due to the combination of that loss, the very small number of copies previously produced, and the fragile and chemically unstable nature of the <b>wax</b> <b>medium,</b> Bettini cylinders are now extremely rare; a few dozen are known to exist. Only the recordings he made of an elderly Pope Leo XIII in 1903 (not in 1884, as mistakenly reported in some 2014 news items about papal recordings) were more widely distributed and have consequently survived in multiple copies in both the cylinder and disc formats.|$|E

40|$|In my work I {{explore the}} {{exterior}} parts and interior sensations of the body, using both recognizable and imaginative abstract elements. Through this work I address issues affecting the body, specifically physical, sexual and verbal abuse. I’m interested {{in moments of}} trauma and their effects on the body. In my paintings I raise the questions: {{what goes on in}} the body? What could go on inside the body? What happens in the mind of person during a time of fear, and how does the body react to that? What would this look like on a canvas? My work explores the ways in which violence and stress affect people and bodies. In my paintings, I destroy and recreate my own work. I build the thickness of oil paint with <b>wax</b> <b>medium,</b> layering it on canvas then scraping it off. I also use a liquid medium allowing the paint to glide onto the canvas. By pouring it, I only have a certain amount of control over where and how it moves. This tension between my body and the canvas relates to my interest in understanding the body and its inner sensations. Specifically, trying to understand how a type of abuse can affect the body, and how I would imagine that would look with paint. I essentially try to explore this by bringing what’s within, derived internally, out onto the canvas. Influences for my work come from various sources, for instance, photographs, books, film stills, and personal experiences. When I reference something in my work, I take a part of it, for instance a section of a photograph or film still. By taking only a section from this source and putting it in my work, I’m intentionally hiding something from the viewer. My overall intention is to disorient the viewer leading them to question what is true or false and recognizable or unrecognizable. I explore the unexplainable and unseen, and lead the viewer to question what is true and what is false in the painting. My paintings are filtered through my impulses, memories and imagination. The obscure aspect of my work creates an uneasiness. I play with revealing and hiding what I want the viewer to see...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} cellular and extracellular lipids of Acinetobacter species HO 1 -N indicated basic physiological differences in hexadecane-grown cells. The cellular lipids obtained from hexadecane-grown cells were characterized by 3 - and 18 -fold increases in the phospholipid fraction and the mono- and diglyceride fraction, respectively, over that obtained from nutrient broth-yeast extract-grown cells. The cellular-associated pools of hexadecane were shown to comprise approximately 8 % of the dry cell weight of hexadecane-grown cells. The extracellular lipids obtained from the culture broths of hexadecane-grown cells were comprised of triglyceride, mono- and diglyceride, free fatty acid, and wax ester. These lipids were either absent or present in minor concentrations in the culture broths of nutrient broth-yeast extract-grown cells. The exponential growth of Acinetobacter sp. on hexadecane was characterized by the significant accumulation of free fatty acid, monoglyceride, and diglyceride in the culture <b>medium.</b> <b>Wax</b> ester was shown to represent a minor portion of the extracellular lipids during the exponential growth phase, appearing in significant proportion only after the culture had entered the stationary phase of growth...|$|R
40|$|Wax begonia (Begonia × semperflorens?cultorum Hort.) plants often {{suffer from}} high {{temperature}} stress during hot seasons in Taiwan. Since salicylic acid (SA) {{has proved to}} enhance heat tolerance in many plants, this study evaluates whether exogenous SA applications could alleviate high temperature stress of wax begonias. Plug seedlings of wax begonia ‘Super Olympia’ were treated with 25, 100, 400, 800, with 1600 μM SA before 55 °C, for 2 h of high temperature stress. Results indicated that 25 ? 400 μM SA enhanced heat tolerance by reducing the value of Relative Injury (RI) and Malondialdehyde (MDA), whereas 800, 1600 μM SA had adverse effects. Transplanted plants of wax begonia ‘Super Olympia’ were treated with 25, 100, 400 μM SA before 35 °C, for 16 days of high temperature stress. Results showed that 25 ? 400 μM SA enhanced heat tolerance by maintaining a higher value of Chlorophyll Meter Reading (CMR), reducing leaf thickness {{and the number of}} red spotted leaves. Especially, 100 μM SA treatment had most significant improvement among 25 ? 400 μM SA treatments. The thermo protection period of 100 μM SA maintained significantly for 5 days, based on the lower value of F 0, RI, and MDA, and the higher value of Fm and Fv/Fm. Applying times up to 2 or 3 times extended protective effect significantly, based on reducing the value of RI and MDA, and increasing plant height and number of flowers. Either medium drench or foliar spray treatments improved heat tolerance of <b>wax</b> begonias. <b>Medium</b> drench treatments produced better thermo protection {{based on the results of}} higher Fm and Fv/Fm value. In conclusion, salicylic acid pretreatments with satisfactory concentrations between 25 to 400 μM proved to enhance heat tolerance in the wax begonia. Results recommend medium drench with 100 μM SA per week, up to 2 ? 3 times as the most optimal application of SA...|$|R
50|$|While a young man, Caylus {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} the campaigns of the French army, from 1709 to 1714. After the peace of Rastatt (1714) he {{spent some time in}} travelling in Italy, Greece, the Levant, England and Germany, and devoted much attention to the study and collection of antiquities. He became {{an active member of the}} Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture and of the Académie des Inscriptions. Chief among his antiquarian works must be the profusely illustrated Recueil dantiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grecques, romaines et gauloises (6 vols., Paris, 1752-1755), which was mined by the designers of Neoclassical arts for the rest of the century. His Numismata Aurea Imperatorum Romanorum, treats only the gold coinage of the Roman emperors, those worthy of collection by a grand seigneur. His concentration on the object itself marked a step towards modern connoisseuship, and in his Mémoire (1755) on the method of encaustic painting, the ancient technique of painting with <b>wax</b> as a <b>medium</b> mentioned by Pliny the Elder, he claimed to have rediscovered the method. Diderot, who was no friend to Caylus, maintained that the proper method had been found by J.-B. Bachelier.|$|R
30|$|A {{recent study}} of eleven Roman-Egyptian mummy portraits from Tebtunis (Now Umm el-Breigat) in the Fayum region has attested the use of <b>wax</b> as binding <b>medium</b> [26]. Furthermore, an {{examination}} carried out by Mackay showed that beeswax had {{been used as a}} fixative or a varnish on tombs from the 18 th Dynasty at Thebes. There was evidence in some instances that wax had served as a surface coating, applied specifically to coloured areas. In some instances, wax was detected within the paint layer itself, implying its use as a binder. However, the application of the wax with heat could have driven the wax down into the substrate, which means that its presence below the surface was not a positive indication that it served as a binder [45]. Wax has also been identified as having been present in the tomb of Tutankhamun from the 18 th Dynasty (c. 1550 - 1298 BCE), but again {{it is not clear whether}} the wax was used as a binder or as a coating [21]. This is also the case for several Egyptian cartonnages on which wax has been attested [29]. A recent examination of an Egyptian coffin from the 26 th Dynasty (c. 664 - 525 BCE), showed the use of beeswax as a coating [46] and analyses carried out on the Nebamun paintings in the British Museum also showed the use of beeswax as a varnish, in this case associated with blue/green frit pigments [13]. Finally, a study by Dieteman et al. proved the use of beeswax (as well as animal fat in one of them and egg or glue in another) for four Egyptian mummy portraits [41].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of three denture brushes (Bitufo-B; Medic Denture-MD; Colgate-C) on biofilm removal from upper and lower dentures using a specific dentifrice (Corega Brite). The correlation between biofilm levels on the internal and external surfaces of the upper and lower dentures was also evaluated. A microbiological assay was performed to assess the growth of colony-formed units (cfu) of Candida yeasts on denture surface. Thirty-three patients were enrolled in a 10 -week trial divided in two stages: 1 (control) - three daily water rinses within 1 week; 2 - three daily brushings within 3 weeks per tested brush. Internal (tissue) and external (right buccal flange) surfaces of the complete dentures were disclosed (neutral red 1 %) and photographed. Total denture areas and disclosed biofilm areas were measured using Image Tool 3. 00 software for biofilm quantification. Dentures were boxed with # 7 <b>wax</b> and culture <b>medium</b> (CHROMagarTM Candida) was poured to reproduce the internal surface. Statistical analysis by Friedman's test showed significant difference (p 0. 01). Analysis by the Correlation test showed higher r values (B= 0. 78; MD= 0. 8341, C= 0. 7362) for the lower dentures comparing the surfaces (internal and external) and higher r values (B= 0. 7861, MD= 0. 7955, C= 0. 8298) for the external surface comparing the dentures (upper and lower). The results of the microbiological showed no significant difference (p> 0. 01) between the brushes with respect to the frequency of the species of yeasts (chi-square test). In conclusion, all denture brushes evaluated in this study were effective in the removal of biofilm. There was better correlation of biofilm levels between the surfaces for the lower dentures, and between the dentures for the external surface. There was no significant difference among the brushes regarding the frequency of yeasts...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{was to investigate the}} effect of microwave treatment on the conversion of pyrite in coal in order to enhance its magnetic properties and to aid subsequent desulphurisation by magnetic separation. Key areas of this investigation include:- a review of the fundamental theoretical aspects of heating in an applied microwave field, a detailed literature survey of the potential applications of microwave heating to aid coal desulphurisation, a study of the transformation mechanisms of pyrite by microwave and conventional heating methods, a comprehensive review of the influence of heterogeneity on the dielectric properties of coals and the effect of high power microwave heating on the decomposition of pyrite in a high sulphur coal. A detailed survey of the literature has shown that although a significant amount of work has been reported on the microwave heating of coal, little information is available which examines the mechanism through which different coals heat in an applied microwave field. A study is therefore presented in this thesis which quantifies, for the first time, the structural ordering of carbon in a range of coals of various ranks and the relationship with their dielectric properties. The results show a clear relationship between the structural ordering of carbon in coal and dielectric loss factor. Essentially, as the structural ordering increases, the level of free charge (per unit volume) increases together with electron mobility which results in an increase in dielectric loss factor. The transformation of pyrite to form the more magnetic pyrrhotite and other related decomposition products by conventional radiant heating {{has been the focus of}} much research. However, little attention has been given to the effect of microwave heating on the mechanisms of pyrite transformation in inert and oxygen-containing atmospheres. The study presented in this thesis investigates the effect of temperature, particle size and heat treatment time to establish how these affect the transformation process and the subsequent nature of the final product. This study showed that exposure of pyrite to both conventional and microwave heating methods enhanced its magnetic properties as a result phase alterations at the particle surface. Conventionally heated pyrite samples showed the highest magnetic susceptibility increases, speculated to be due difficulties surrounding the temperature control and measurement of the microwave heated samples. From a review of the literature in this field of research and by SEM observations made for each sample test in this work a general pyrite transformation model as a result of microwave exposure is proposed. The effect of microwave radiation on the conversion of in-situ coal derived pyrite was also investigated. The study presented here extends previous work by others by assessing quantitatively the influence of higher applied microwave power levels on the conversion of pyrite in coal. Samples of run-of-mine high pyritic sulphur content (~ 12 %wt) Kentucky coal were microwave pre-treated at varying exposure times using 8 kW and 15 kW of microwave power operating at a frequency of 2. 45 GHz. This work included initial material characterisation which consisted of TGA, optical microscopy and dielectric property measurement, followed by SEM/EDAX characterisation of both microwave treated and untreated sample specimens. This is the first time that microwave treated coal, embedded in a carnauba <b>wax</b> mounting <b>medium,</b> has been observed by this method with focus on the thermal alterations of the pyrite phase. It was demonstrated that with sufficient power and residence time, the conversion of pyrite to the more magnetic pyrrhotite is achievable using microwave irradiation. The amount of pyrrhotite formed as a result of microwave exposure varies with microwave residence time and forward power level. Comparisons of change in the iron sulphide species in the coal was made between microwave treated and untreated material. Using a multimode microwave cavity it was found that significant amounts of pyrrhotite were formed in 20 s when using 15 kW of microwave power. Treatment at lower power levels in this type of cavity was found to be less effective. The overall effect of treatment on the coal proximate character was minimal.
