25|$|Rivers' first {{marriage}} was in 1955 to James Sanger, {{the son of}} a Bond Clothing Stores merchandise manager. The marriage lasted six months and was annulled on the basis that Sanger did not <b>want</b> <b>children</b> and had not informed Rivers before the wedding.|$|E

You don’t <b>want</b> <b>children,</b> so you fix up your windows with fine mesh screens, the very best you can buy.

25|$|A common {{misconception}} {{was that}} reform educators did not <b>want</b> <b>children</b> {{to learn the}} standard methods of arithmetic. As the NCTM Focal Points made clear, such methods were still the ultimate goal, but reformers believed that conceptual understanding should come first. Reform educators believed that such understanding is best pursued by allowing children at first to solve problems using their own understanding and methods. Under guidance from the teacher, students eventually arrive at an understanding of standard methods. Even the controversial NCTM Standards of 1989 did not call for abandoning standard algorithms, but instead recommended a decreased emphasis on complex paper-and-pencil computation drills and greater attention to mental computation, estimation skills, thinking strategies for mastering basic facts and conceptual understanding of arithmetic operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not <b>want</b> <b>children</b> to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned that if you were going to make a time machine, you would want it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E

500|$|Pixar, which {{produced}} short animated films {{to promote their}} computers, was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature after {{the success of their}} short film Tin Toy (1988), which is told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton and Docter wrote early story treatments which were thrown out by Disney, as they wanted the film to be edgier. After disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was re-written, better reflecting the tone and theme Pixar desired: that [...] "toys deeply <b>want</b> <b>children</b> to play with them, and that this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions".

500|$|Hitler's letters provide {{evidence}} that {{he was fond of}} her, and worried when she participated in sports or was late returning for tea. His secretary Traudl Junge stated that during the war, Hitler telephoned Braun every day. He was concerned for her safety when she was staying in the Munich home he had bought her. Junge further asked Hitler once why he never married. Hitler replied, [...] "...I wouldn't have been able to give enough time to my wife". Hitler told her that he didn't <b>want</b> <b>children,</b> as they would have had [...] "...a very hard time, because they're expected to possess the same gifts as their famous parents and they can't be forgiven for being mediocre". In the end, Hitler and Braun married in the Berlin Führerbunker in late April 1945, less than 40 hours before committing suicide together.|$|E
500|$|The T206 Honus Wagner {{baseball}} card {{depicts the}} Pittsburgh Pirates' Honus Wagner, a dead-ball era baseball player who {{is widely considered}} {{to be one of}} the best players of all time. The card was designed and issued by the American Tobacco Company (ATC) from 1909 to 1911 as part of its T206 series. Wagner refused to allow production of his baseball card to continue, either because he did not <b>want</b> <b>children</b> to buy cigarette packs to get his card, or because he wanted more compensation from the ATC. The ATC ended production of the Wagner card and a total of only 50 to 200 cards were ever distributed to the public (exact number unknown), as compared to the [...] "tens or hundreds of thousands" [...] of T206 cards, over three years in sixteen brands of cigarettes, for any other player. In 1933, the card was first listed at a price value of US$50 in Jefferson Burdick's The American Card Catalog, making it the most expensive baseball card in the world at the time.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{treatment for}} Toy Story, drafted by Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter, had {{little in common}} with the eventually finished film. It paired Tinny, the one-man band from Tin Toy with a ventriloquist's dummy and sent them on a sprawling odyssey. Under studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg, Woody was the main villain, abusing the other toys until they rallied against him; however, after Disney executives saw the storyboards they relinquished creative control to Pixar. The core idea of Toy Story was present from the treatment onward, however: that [...] "toys deeply <b>want</b> <b>children</b> to play with them, and that this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions." [...] Katzenberg felt the original treatment was problematic and told Lasseter to reshape Toy Story as more of an odd-couple buddy picture, and suggested they watch some classic buddy movies, such as The Defiant Ones and 48 Hrs., in which two characters with different attitudes are thrown together and have to bond. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter emerged in early September 1991 with the second treatment, and although the lead characters were still Tinny and the dummy, the outline of the final film was beginning to take shape.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of Dr. Jordan Kenley (John Sloman), Chief Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) replaces his head of {{pediatric}} surgery with Dr. Arizona Robbins, {{a graduate of the}} Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Robbins has a romantic interest in orthopedic 5 year resident Callie Torres, (Sara Ramirez) later goes on to kiss her. The two embark on a relationship, but when Torres' father, Carlos (Héctor Elizondo), learns of the relationship, he threatens to cut her off financially unless she returns home with him. When Torres' father returns to Seattle and continues to reject his daughter's Human female sexuality, Robbins is able to convince him to reconsider. She tells Mr. Torres that her father was able to accept her own sexuality, as she promised him she was still the [...] "good man in a storm" [...] he raised her to be, and that Torres is still the same person he raised. Torres is dismayed to learn that Robbins doesn't <b>want</b> <b>children,</b> and the two come to a conclusion that they cannot continue their relationship, since they both want different things. However, after a shooter enters Seattle Grace with a vendetta for Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), they are in lockdown together, and the two reconcile.|$|E

On how marriage will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "the only way it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship.

Commenting on the couple's future Dawson said that children are [...] "definitely something that they both want, as everything's going well [...] Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".
