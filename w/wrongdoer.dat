Sullivan that gains from illegal traffic in liquor {{are subject to the}} Federal income tax. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rutkin v. United States that the receipt of money obtained by extortion is taxable as income to the <b>wrongdoer.</b> The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in James v. United States that the receipt of money obtained through embezzlement is taxable as income to the <b>wrongdoer,</b> even though the <b>wrongdoer</b> is required to return the money to its owner.|$|E
25|$|Self-forgiveness {{happens in}} {{situations}} where an individual has done something that they perceive to be morally wrong and they consider themselves {{to be responsible for}} the wrongdoing. Self-forgiveness is the overcoming of negative emotions that the <b>wrongdoer</b> associates with the wrongful action. Negative emotions associated with wrongful action can include guilt, regret, remorse, blame, shame, self-hatred and/or self-contempt.|$|E
25|$|The {{exercise}} of ownership over property {{may take a}} number of forms. All that is required is that the defendant exercise control over the chattel in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiff's right of possession.

25|$|Typically {{this element}} is {{expressed}} as {{the intent to}} commit a felony “therein”. The {{use of the word}} “therein” adds nothing and certainly does not limit the scope of burglary to those wrongdoers who break and enter a dwelling intending to commit a felony on the premises. The situs of the felony does not matter, and burglary occurs if the <b>wrongdoer</b> intended to commit a felony at the time he broke and entered.|$|E
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} Abimelech first sent Phicol, {{the captain of}} his host, but {{he was unable to}} pacify Isaac. Then Abimelech sent his friend Ahuzzath, but Isaac still {{remained}} unpacified. When Abimelech then went himself, Isaac allowed himself to be appeased. Hence, the Sages taught that one need not ask another's forgiveness more than three times. If the other does not forgive the third time, then the other becomes the <b>wrongdoer.</b>|$|E
25|$|One notable {{consequence}} {{of the decline in}} use of the second person singular pronouns thou, thy, and thee is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of Early Modern English texts, such as many character interactions in Shakespeare's plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use thou (rather than you) when addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend, or a hated <b>wrongdoer.</b>|$|E

25|$|It is {{interesting}} that the Court of Chancery was acting, here, in its most ancient role, that of a court of conscience. This entailed the moral law applied to prevent peril to {{the soul of the}} <b>wrongdoer</b> through mortal sin. The remedy was given to the plaintiff (the Crown, in this case) to look after the wrongdoer's soul; the benefit to the plaintiff was only incidental. This is also the explanation for specific performance, which compels the sinner to put matters right. The whole conception is mediæval in origin.|$|E
25|$|Status has {{far more}} {{relevance}} {{than in previous}} games. Now, many kinds of weapon, ship, and factory are not purchasable until the player has earned sufficient reputation with the vendor race. With some races, reputation can be earned through trade; with others, the player must earn respect by killing unwanted visitors in the race's space - such as pirates, Khaak, or Xenon. Some races appreciate both. By choosing to be an upstanding citizen, the player can earn {{the right to buy}} powerful new weapons, ships and technologies. By engaging in piracy, destruction, smuggling or other crime the player may lose reputation, and so may lose the privilege to buy things. The persistent <b>wrongdoer</b> may lose the right to land at stations, or even to enter sectors, being attacked on sight. Eventually, the player may find it impossible to buy many of the game's most powerful ships, weapons and technologies (although such things may still be possible to acquire through less orthodox means).|$|E
25|$|For some time, {{especially}} {{through the}} work of D. A. Binchy, the laws were held to be conservative and useful primarily for reconstructing the laws and customs of the Proto-Indo-Europeans just as linguists had reconstructed the Proto-Indo-European language. For instance, historians have seen similarities between Irish and Indian customs of fasting {{as a method of}} shaming a <b>wrongdoer</b> to recover a debt, or to demand the righting of a wrong. Other legal institutions prominent in early Irish law but foreign to most contemporary legal systems, {{such as the use of}} sureties, have been considered as survivals from earlier periods. More recently historians have come to doubt such attributions. While few historians argue that all Irish law comes from church influence, they are today much more wary as to what material is a survival and what has changed. A past may still be suggested for a certain legal concept based on Irish legal terms' being cognate with terms in other Celtic languages, although that information does not prove that the practice described by the legal term has not changed.|$|E

25|$|Contract law {{works best}} when an {{agreement}} is performed, and recourse {{to the courts}} is never needed because each party knows her rights and duties. However, where an unforeseen event renders an agreement very hard, or even impossible to perform, the courts typically will construe the parties to want to have released themselves from their obligations. It may also be that one party simply breaches a contract's terms. If a contract is not substantially performed, then the innocent party is entitled to cease her own performance and sue for damages {{to put her in}} the position as if the contract were performed. She is under a duty to mitigate her losses and cannot claim for harm that was a remote consequence of the contractual breach, but remedies in English law are footed on the principle that full compensation for all losses, pecuniary or not, should be made good. In exceptional circumstances, the law goes further to require a <b>wrongdoer</b> to make restitution for their gains from breaching a contract, and may demand specific performance of the agreement rather than monetary compensation. It is also possible that a contract becomes voidable, because, depending on the specific type of contract, one party failed to make adequate disclosure or they made misrepresentations during negotiations.|$|E

500|$|The {{alternate}} approach taken is the [...] "beneficiary election" [...] approach. This is {{that where}} trust funds are wrongly mixed with the trustee's personal funds, used for an investment, and the money is thus not recoverable, the beneficiaries are allowed to [...] "elect" [...] whether the investment is to be held as a security for the amounts owed to them, or whether to take the unauthorised investment {{as part of the}} trust fund. This is considered the exception, rather than the rule; in Foskett v McKeown, Millett said that [...] "The primary rule in regard to a mixed fund, therefore, is that gains and losses are borne by the contributors rateably. The beneficiary's right to elect instead to enforce a lien to obtain repayment is an exception to the primary rule, exercisable where the fund is deficient and the claim is made against the <b>wrongdoer</b> and those claiming through him".|$|E
50|$|The social {{discipline}} window {{reflects the}} seminal thinking of renowned Australian criminologist John Braithwaite, who has asserted that reliance on punishment {{as a social}} regulator is problematic because it shames and stigmatizes <b>wrongdoers,</b> pushes them into a negative societal subculture and fails to change their behavior. The restorative approach, on the other hand, reintegrates <b>wrongdoers</b> back into their community and reduces the likelihood that they will reoffend.|$|R

The <b>wrongdoer</b> {{would have to pay}} the priests the principal plus 20 percent and bring a trespass offering to the altar. If the <b>wrongdoer</b> died bringing the money and the offering to Jerusalem, the money was to go to the wrongdoer's heirs, and the offering was to be kept on the pasture until it became blemished, when it was to be sold and the proceeds were to go to the fund for freewill offerings.
