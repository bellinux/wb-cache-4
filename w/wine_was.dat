5|$|<b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> {{commonly}} {{drunk and}} was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to Galen's dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially red <b>wine)</b> <b>was,</b> among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and brighten the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually {{had to settle for}} a cheap white or rosé from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman posca) would often be the only available choice.|$|E
5|$|Joseph W. Osborne {{may have}} made the first wine from Zinfandel in California. He planted Zinfandel from Macondray at his Oak Knoll {{vineyard}} just north of Napa, and his <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> much praised in 1857. Planting of Zinfandel boomed soon after, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century it was the most widespread variety in California.|$|E
5|$|Last of the Summer <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> {{the longest}}-running comedy {{programme}} in Britain, and the longest running situation comedy in the world. Each series has between six and twelve episodes; most were thirty minutes in length, with some specials running longer. There were 295 episodes and 31 series between 1973 and 2010, counting the pilot, all episodes of the series, specials, and two films.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wines</b> <b>are</b> {{produced}} {{under three}} different labels. Their very best <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> labelled Strewn Terroir, including their red Strewn Three meritage. Their general <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> simply labelled Strewn.|$|R
50|$|Dimiat <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> usually light bodied {{and very}} aromatic. The <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> usually made with {{some level of}} {{sweetness}} ranging from off-dry to very sweet. In Bulgaria, some dessert <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> made from Dimiat. The <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> often served very chilled and is usually consumed young, without much aging.|$|R
50|$|Red and rosé <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> made from, Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault, Mourvèdre, and Carignan (maximum 30%). Other {{varieties}} {{which may}} be used to a maximum of 20%.The red <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> distinctly characterised by its aromas of black fruit, spice, and pepper. White <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> produced from Clairette blanche, Bourboulenc, Grenache blanc, and Roussane (maximum 30%). A Primeur <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> also produced in all three colours.The minimum alcoholic content for all <b>wines</b> <b>is</b> decreed at 11%.The reds, which comprise approximately 80% of the production, are light and fruity. All <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> generally consumed while they are still young.|$|R
5|$|Several {{members of}} the royal family were viewers of Last of the Summer Wine. While {{presenting}} an OBE to Roy Clarke in 2002, Prince Charles said that his grandmother, the Queen Mother, had introduced him to the show. The Queen told Dame Thora Hird during a 2001 meeting that Last of the Summer <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> her favourite television programme.|$|E
5|$|The grape was domesticated between 7,000 and 4,000 BC {{between the}} Black Sea and Persia; archaeological {{evidence}} shows that <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> being made there by 6,000 BC, reaching Greece and Crete in the fifth millennium BC and Spain by the last millennium BC. Winemaking started in Italy in the ninth century BC, and in France around 600 BC.|$|E
5|$|A {{spin-off}} prequel show, First of the Summer Wine, premiered on BBC1 in 1988. The new programme {{was written}} by Roy Clarke and used different actors to follow {{the activities of the}} principal characters from Last of the Summer Wine {{in the months leading up}} to World War II. Unlike its mother show, First of the Summer <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> not filmed in Holmfirth. Period music was used instead of Ronnie Hazlehurst's score to create a more World War II era atmosphere. New supporting characters were added to those from Last of the Summer Wine. Peter Sallis and Jonathan Linsley were the only actors from the original series to appear in the spin-off: Sallis played the father of his own character from the original show and Linsley appeared during the second series as a different character.|$|E
50|$|All of Inniskillin's <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> VQA <b>wines</b> {{and most}} <b>are</b> varietal, and their range of table <b>wines</b> <b>is</b> marketed in five levels.|$|R
50|$|Rich, {{dry white}} <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> also {{produced}} from {{a blend of}} Marsanne and Roussanne. These <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> also usually left to age, for up to 15 years. Vin de paille or Straw <b>Wine</b> <b>is</b> also produced in this region.|$|R
50|$|Maran Winery, {{opened in}} 1992 in Yerevan. A variety of <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> {{produced}} under the brands St. Anna, Zarm, Noravank, Bagratuni, and Arpa. Areni <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> produced under the brands Areni Maran, Areni Malishka and Areni Yeghegnadzor, while Pinot <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> produced as Avagini Rouge and Avagini Blanc. Pomegranate <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> produced as M. Parajanov, while apricot <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> branded as Maran Apricot. The winery also produces {{a variety of}} fruit vodka labeled as Bark. The company's Bagratuni red dry wine received a bronze medal in the 2014 Decanter World Wine Awards.|$|R
5|$|In modern times, {{water is}} seen as a common choice to drink with a meal. In the Middle Ages, however, {{concerns}} over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and alcoholic beverages were always preferred. They were seen as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water, with the invaluable bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the alcohol content. <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> consumed on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated. Further north it remained the preferred drink of the bourgeoisie and the nobility who could afford it, and far less common among peasants and workers. The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{isolated}} {{communities were}} unable to access produce {{that the majority of}} Britain would such as peppers or aubergines. Artisan Welsh produce was limited or non-existent, farms rarely made their own cheese, and Welsh <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> of poor quality. By the 1990s, historical Welsh foods were going through a revival. Farmers' markets became more popular, Welsh organic vegetables and farm-made cheese started to appear in supermarkets. Other modern Welsh characteristics are more subtle, such as supermarkets offering salty butters and laverbread or butchers labelling beef skirt as 'cawl meat'.|$|E
5|$|Last of the Summer <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> {{nominated}} {{numerous times}} for two British television industry awards. The show was proposed five times between 1973 and 1985 for the British Academy Film Awards, twice for the Best Situation Comedy Series award (in 1973 and 1979) {{and three times}} for the Best Comedy Series award (in 1982, 1983, and 1985). The show was also considered for the National Television Awards four times since 1999 (in 1999, 2000, 2003, and 2004), each time in the Most Popular Comedy Programme category. In 1999 the show won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme.|$|E
50|$|Fortified <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> <b>wine,</b> such as port or sherry, {{to which}} a {{distilled}} beverage (usually brandy) has <b>been</b> added. Fortified <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> distinguished from spirits made from wine in that spirits are produced by means of distillation, while fortified <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> simply <b>wine</b> that has had a spirit added to it. Many different styles of fortified <b>wine</b> have <b>been</b> developed, including port, sherry, madeira, marsala, commandaria, and the aromatized wine vermouth.|$|R
50|$|Strictly speaking, natural <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> <b>wines</b> that <b>are</b> {{produced}} {{without adding}} or removing anything during winemaking, although some growers add tiny quantities of sulphites at bottling, so that strictly speaking their <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> not natural <b>wines,</b> but 'only' organic (and possibly biodynamic).|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} local grape varieties {{appear to}} have <b>been</b> lost. Jordanian <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> therefore of necessity made from imported varieties of Vitis vinifera. Red <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> made using Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Shiraz and Pinot Noir. White <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> made using Chardonnay, Muscat, Pinot Gris, Gewurztraminer and Chenin Blanc.|$|R
5|$|Some of the {{research}} David undertook for English Bread and Yeast Cookery was done with Jill Norman, her friend and publisher. The pair decided that they should produce two further books: Ice and Ices {{and a collection of}} David's early journalism. Like her book on bread, the scope for Ice and Ices grew the more David researched the subject. The compilation of existing essays and press articles took less time, and in 1984 An Omelette and a Glass of <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> published, edited by Norman who became David's literary executor and edited further David works after the author's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. White <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> believed to be cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks {{were considered to be}} warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E
25|$|Dry (non-sweet) white <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} common, {{derived from the}} {{complete}} fermentation of the wort. Sweet <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> produced when the fermentation is interrupted before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol. Sparkling <b>wines,</b> which <b>are</b> mostly white <b>wines,</b> <b>are</b> produced by not allowing carbon dioxide from the fermentation to escape during fermentation, which {{takes place in the}} bottle rather than in the barrel.|$|R
50|$|The Yulupa Series <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> bottled {{exclusively}} for the restaurant market. Varietals include Chardonnay, White Zinfandel, Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, and a sparkling wine called Cuvée Brut. Grapes for these <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> sourced from across California and bottles list California on the labels as the appellation. These <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> considered budget <b>wines.</b>|$|R
50|$|His {{particular}} type of <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> known as Grower Champagne, where grapes used to produce the <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> grown in vineyards owned by the Selosse family, rather than being purchased from other growers. He {{was one of the}} first winemakers to show that small producers can make their own <b>wine.</b> Anselme <b>is</b> considered a pioneer of biodynamics in Champagne and grows his grapes in an organic way. Selosse <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> fermented in oak barrels, in contrast to the majority of Champagne producers who often use stainless steel tanks. Consequently, the <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> often described as artisnal.|$|R
5|$|This Croatian {{vineyard}} contained {{just nine}} Crljenak Kaštelanski vines mixed {{with thousands of}} other vines. In 2002, additional vines known locally as Pribidrag {{were found in the}} Dalmatian coastal town of Omiš. Both clones are being propagated in California under the aegis of Ridge Vineyards, although virus infections have delayed their release. The first Croatian ZPC <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> made by Edi Maletić in 2005. Meanwhile, plantings of Primitivo have increased in California, where it seems to grow somewhat less vigorously than its sibling. Its wines are reputed to have more blackberry and spice flavors.|$|E
5|$|This {{included}} the planting of Pinot noir grapes in the Willamette Valley, a region long thought {{too cold to}} be suitable for viticulture. In the 1970s, more out-of-state winemakers migrated {{to the state and}} started to organize as an industry. The state's land use laws had prevented rural hillsides from being turned into housing tracts, preserving a significant amount of land suitable for vineyards. In 1979, The Eyrie Vineyards entered a 1975 Pinot noir in the Wine Olympics; the <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> rated among the top Pinots in the world, thus gaining the region its first international recognition.|$|E
5|$|Though most provinces {{were capable}} of {{producing}} wine, regional varietals were desirable and <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> a central item of trade. Shortages of vin ordinaire were rare. The major suppliers {{for the city of}} Rome were the west coast of Italy, southern Gaul, the Tarraconensis region of Hispania, and Crete. Alexandria, the second-largest city, imported wine from Laodicea in Syria and the Aegean. At the retail level, taverns or speciality wine shops (vinaria) sold wine by the jug for carryout and by the drink on premises, with price ranges reflecting quality.|$|E
50|$|After {{the primary}} {{fermentation}} of red grapes the free run <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> pumped off into tanks and the skins are pressed {{to extract the}} remaining juice and wine. The press <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> blended with the free run wine at the winemaker's discretion. The <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> kept warm and the remaining sugars are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> left {{to mature}} in vats or barrels {{for several months}} and {{is not allowed to}} leave the wine sheds before 31 March of the year {{following}} the harvest. Quarterly rackings ensure that the lees held in suspension in the <b>wine</b> <b>are</b> gradually removed. Before being bottled, the <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> filtered and the sulfite level is adjusted.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{of the red}} <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> {{meant to}} be {{consumed}} [...] "while waiting for Hermitage and Cote-Rotie to mature." [...] The best <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> found {{in the south and}} the vines in this region can be upwards of 100 years old. Generally the <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> defined by the young fruit that makes them very drinkable while young.|$|R
5|$|<b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} the basic drink, consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes and was quite inexpensive. Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to conserve wine for the workforce. Many types of drinks involving grapes and honey were consumed as well. Drinking {{on an empty}} stomach was regarded as boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals. Prominent Roman alcoholics included Marcus Antonius, and Cicero's own son Marcus (Cicero Minor). Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker.|$|E
5|$|In North America, California is {{the leading}} {{producer}} of Sauvignon blanc with plantings also found in Washington state and on the Niagara Peninsula and Okanagan Valley in Canada. Sauvignon Blanc is also grown in small regions in Ohio along Lake Erie and the Ohio River. In California wine produced from the Sauvignon blanc grape {{is also known as}} Fumé Blanc. This California <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> first made by Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi Winery in 1968. Mondavi had been offered a crop of particularly good Sauvignon blanc grapes by a grower. At that time the variety had a poor reputation in California due to its grassy flavor and aggressive aromas. Mondavi decided to try to tame that aggressiveness with barrel agings and released the wine under the name Fumé Blanc as an allusion to the French Pouilly-Fumé. The usage of the term is primarily a marketing base one with California wine makers choosing whichever name they prefer. Both oaked and unoaked Sauvignon blanc wines have been marketed under the name Fumé Blanc. California Sauvignon blancs tend to fall into two styles. The New Zealand-influenced Sauvignon blanc have more tropical fruit undertones with citrus and passion fruit notes. The Mondavi-influenced Fumé Blanc are more round with melon notes.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> also regularly consumed.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drinks are}} not technically cocktails unless <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> secondary by volume to a distilled beverage, since <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> a fermented beverage not a distilled one.|$|R

2500|$|Sparkling <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> {{mostly white}} and {{contains}} fermentation gases (carbon dioxide). The first sparkling wine {{dates back to}} the very first winemaking.
