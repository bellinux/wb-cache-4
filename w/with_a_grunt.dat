60|$|Lord Belpher {{acknowledged}} the salutation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt,</b> but Reggie was more affable.|$|E
60|$|<b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt</b> {{of disgust}} Brown Bear walked away and {{disappeared}} among the bushes.|$|E
60|$|Hawtry {{answered}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt,</b> {{and devoted}} {{himself to his}} kid. Presently Jack spoke again.|$|E
60|$|The man did {{not look}} up, but held out the paper <b>with</b> <b>a</b> drowsy <b>grunt.</b>|$|R
60|$|And <b>with</b> <b>a</b> great <b>grunt,</b> {{which might}} have meant anything, from {{resignation}} to cordiality, Mr. McEachern capitulated.|$|R
60|$|Jack {{sat down}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>grunt,</b> and <b>with</b> the {{expression}} of dissatisfaction on his face in no way mollified.|$|R
60|$|He woke <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt,</b> and I saw {{his face}} {{in the light of the}} lamps.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} half an hour, {{he tossed}} the twig from him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt.</b>|$|E
60|$|William Bannister sat up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt,</b> {{rubbed his}} eyes, and, seeing strangers, began to cry.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Waite--torn {{between his}} respect for my lord and his dislike of that {{particular}} type of joke--only replied <b>with</b> <b>a</b> doubtful <b>grunt.</b>|$|R
60|$|The other replied <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ungracious <b>grunt,</b> but swung alongside. Martin made {{no further}} attempt at conversation, {{and for several}} blocks {{unbroken}} silence lay upon them.|$|R
60|$|So {{we started}} away, {{the four of}} us together. Presently, however, Arthur and Isobel drew away in front. Allan, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>grunt,</b> stopped to light his pipe.|$|R
60|$|The Governor {{sat back}} in his chair <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt.</b> His secretary, on his {{immediate}} right, leaned towards him.|$|E
60|$|Henry {{acknowledged}} {{receipt of}} the information <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt</b> that slid into a snore as he drifted back into sleep.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps, {{under the}} {{circumstances}} of the moment, this was scarce a welcome speech. At least, Nares received it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt.</b>|$|E
60|$|Miss Mary {{suddenly}} {{broke from}} us <b>with</b> <b>an</b> indescribable <b>grunt,</b> flew, rather than ran, to her sister's bed, and there shook her as one furious schoolgirl would shake another.|$|R
60|$|TWO GENTLEMEN {{who were}} in the {{lavatory}} at the time tried to lift him up: but he was quite helpless. He lay curled up {{at the foot of the}} stairs down which he had fallen. They succeeded in turning him over. His hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with the filth and ooze of the floor on which he had lain, face downwards. His eyes were closed and he breathed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunting</b> noise. <b>A</b> thin stream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.|$|R
5|$|The {{child would}} grow up healthy, but {{with some of the}} {{behaviours}} of a pig. She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in <b>grunts</b> or <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunting</b> sound to her speech. The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Weatherley {{laid down}} his {{newspaper}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt.</b> He {{was alone in}} his private office with his newly appointed secretary.|$|E
6000|$|WAITER. Right, sir. (To Crampton.) Irish for you, sir, I think, sir? (Crampton assents <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt.</b> The waiter looks enquiringly at Valentine.) ...|$|E
60|$|He rounded his regrets <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt.</b> For a {{while there}} was silence, save for the little stir of Ann's {{movements}} preparing the tea.|$|E
60|$|<b>With</b> <b>a</b> hoarse <b>grunt</b> of contempt, Mr. Sikes {{seized the}} glass, {{and threw the}} {{remainder}} of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself: which he did at once.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a moment}} of peril, but Roger came to the rescue. Not to hit his chum, he ran around to the wolf's side and blazed away twice in rapid succession. This was too much for the wolf, and <b>with</b> only <b>a</b> <b>grunt</b> it rolled over and {{stretched}} out dead.|$|R
60|$|Allen went by him <b>with</b> <b>an</b> audible <b>grunt</b> of derision, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dark scowl on his face, but Mattie {{smiled at}} him, with tears {{still in her}} eyes. She had been touched by his vibrant voice; she had no sins to repent of.|$|R
60|$|Herr Grosse {{put back}} his {{magnifying}} glass <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt</b> which {{sounded like a}} grunt of relief, and snatched the handkerchief away from Lucilla.|$|E
6000|$|Horrocks {{answered}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt.</b> [...] "The cone," [...] he said, and then, {{as one who}} recovers himself, [...] "I {{thought you}} did not hear." ...|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{the sound}} of the children's {{footsteps}} had died away down the corridor, Lebel turned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt</b> to his still silent companion.|$|E
6000|$|But Mr. Meiklewham, who did {{not like}} Tyrrel's looks so well as to induce him to become {{approver}} on the occasion, replied <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inarticulate <b>grunt,</b> addressed to the company, and a private admonition to his patron's own ear, [...] "to let sleeping dogs lie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay!" [...] he replied, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>grunt.</b> Then the {{procession}} set off--the trundling wheel-barrow, the swinging hissing tree, the two excited little girls. They {{arrived at the}} door. Down went {{the legs of the}} wheel-barrow on the yard. The man looked at the box.|$|R
60|$|Allen went by him <b>with</b> <b>an</b> audible <b>grunt</b> of derision, {{and there}} was a dark scowl on his face, but Mattie smiled at him, with tears still in her eyes. She had been touched by his vibrant voice; she had no sins to repent of.|$|R
60|$|That {{question}} was answered almost immediately, for Bahama Bill, turning {{the corner of}} several extra large rocks, {{came to a halt}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt</b> of dissatisfaction.|$|E
60|$|The Captain seized Jo's {{hand and}} tried to speak, but could not. After an {{abortive}} effort he turned away <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt</b> and left the room.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} the day M. Bredin {{paid him}} his {{eighteen}} shillings <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grunt,</b> and Paul walked out of the restaurant a masterless man.|$|E
60|$|Babalatchi assented <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ill-humoured <b>grunt.</b> His want {{of success}} in {{penetrating}} the white man's secret as to the locality where the gold was to be found was <b>a</b> sore point <b>with</b> the statesman of Sambir, as the only conspicuous failure in an otherwise brilliant career.|$|R
60|$|Hugh {{handed out}} the bottle to the boatman, {{who took it}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> surly <b>grunt</b> of satisfaction. It was raining steadily, and the wind had almost dropped. An hour later the lads agreed that they were ready for sleep. Hitherto the door had been {{slightly}} open to admit air.|$|R
60|$|In {{less than}} five minutes the place was deserted. Amidst many hasty farewells, wholly unintelligible to the watcher, the two groups of men {{separated}} and climbed into their respective trains. As soon as every one was out of sight the Englishman rose <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>grunt</b> of satisfaction and stretched himself.|$|R
