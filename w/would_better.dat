5|$|Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom was {{announced}} at PlayStation Experience on December 5, 2015. It {{will be released}} for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows on January 19, 2018. Studio Ghibli will not have direct involvement with the game. Hino said that the game <b>would</b> <b>better</b> fulfill the ambitions of the original game, with deeper stories and improved visuals.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{those in}} Europe who own {{large amounts of}} euros are served by high {{stability}} and low inflation. Those who now need to earn euros including countries, which need to pay interest on large debts, are likely better served with a slightly weaker euro leading to more export because a lower euro <b>would</b> <b>better</b> see investors chances for (companies in) southern European countries to grow themselves out of the crisis. As a result, investing there would become less risky and push interest rates for southern countries {{more in line with}} the European average.|$|E
5|$|Information {{obtained}} {{later from}} North Korean prisoners revealed the divisions the Far East Command {{thought to be}} still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and {{were not in the}} bombed area. No evidence was found that the bombing killed a single North Korean soldier. However, the bombing appeared to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries, as artillery fire on UN positions waned substantially following the mission. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks against enemy tactical troops unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers and dive bombers <b>would</b> <b>better</b> support ground forces.|$|E

5|$|Recruited {{by several}} firms in 1975, Romney joined the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), {{reasoning}} that {{working as a}} management consultant {{for a variety of}} companies <b>would</b> <b>better</b> prepare him for a future position as a chief executive. Part of a 1970s wave of top graduates who chose to go into consulting rather than join a large company directly, he found his legal and business education useful in his job. He applied BCG principles such as the growth-share matrix, and executives viewed him as having a bright future there. At the Boston Consulting Group, he was a colleague of Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he formed a friendship that has lasted for more than forty years.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer {{was ordered}} to Carinhall, the {{residence}} of the Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, on 8 February 1945. Göring informed him about the intent to appoint him as Inspekteur der Nachtjäger (Inspector of the night fighter force), a role held by Oberst Werner Streib at the time. Schnaufer pushed back, not wanting to push out his friend and mentor from this position. He argued that he <b>would</b> <b>better</b> serve the German cause fighting the enemy. Göring was convinced and Schnaufer remained in his position as Geschwaderkommodore.|$|E
5|$|Several agencies, {{including}} the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed {{plans for a}} better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, {{and the number of}} response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies <b>would</b> <b>better</b> the aid of those in disastrous situations.|$|E

5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or scratched, the resulting shavings catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since cerium {{is one of the}} first and hence one of the largest lanthanides. Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and <b>would</b> <b>better</b> be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell {{determined}} that Guam, Tinian, and Saipan in the Mariana Islands <b>would</b> <b>better</b> serve as B-29 bases, {{but they were}} in Japanese hands. Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war, and the islands were captured between June and August 1944. Air bases were developed, and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944. These bases were easily resupplied by cargo ships. The XXI Bomber Command began missions against Japan on November 18, 1944.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started by}} {{focusing}} on the game's hardware. The staff first debated what type of monitor to use: black and white or color. They reasoned that using advanced technology <b>would</b> <b>better</b> establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor. The developers estimated that the game would require 4colors, but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16colors. At the time, the designers believed that was more than they would ever need for a game. The monitor's resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game's presentation. Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language. The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film {{was a low}} budget {{production}} as Lombardo did not care for horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt that that style <b>would</b> <b>better</b> suit the special effects in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked on the special effects on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up that would only be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on her. This effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E
5|$|George Lucas {{began writing}} the new Star Wars trilogy on November 1, 1994. The {{screenplay}} of Star Wars {{was adapted from}} Lucas' 15-page outline that was written in 1976, which he designed to help him {{keep track of the}} characters' backstories and events that occurred before the original trilogy. Anakin was first written as a twelve-year-old, but Lucas reduced his age to nine because he felt the lower age <b>would</b> <b>better</b> fit the plot point of Anakin being affected by his mother's separation from him. Eventually, Anakin's younger age led Lucas to rewrite his participation in the movie's major scenes. The film's working title was The Beginning; Lucas later revealed that its true title was The Phantom Menace; a reference to Palpatine hiding his true identity as an evil Sith Lord behind the facade of a well-intentioned public servant.|$|E
5|$|However, Matsui {{had made}} it clear to his {{superiors}} even before he had left Japan in August that he was determined to capture the capital city of China, Nanking, which lay 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Matsui forcefully asserted that the war with China would not end until Nanking was in their control, and he envisaged that the fall of Nanking would result in the total collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's government. After Chiang's fall Matsui hoped {{to play a role in}} forming a new government in China which, according to his own conception, would be a democracy that <b>would</b> <b>better</b> serve the interests of both Japan and the people of China. However, the historian Tokushi Kasahara also sees personal motives behind Matsui's insistence on capturing Nanking. Kasahara suspects that Matsui, as an aging general with a relatively undistinguished military record, desperately wanted to crown his career with one last battlefield victory like the capture of the Chinese capital.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly {{invested}} in {{the purchase of the}} Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building <b>would</b> <b>better</b> serve them as a recording studio. With a facility of his own, Hendrix could work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} striped shirts, with white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that <b>would</b> <b>better</b> withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E
5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and <b>would</b> <b>better</b> immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E

5|$|On Schröter's {{death in}} 1782, Horn {{decided to move}} to Paris to try a living as a musician. He left his home with little money and a {{suitcase}} of clothes. En route to Paris, he encountered a stranger in Hamburg by the name of Winkelman, who persuaded the impressionable Horn that London <b>would</b> <b>better</b> serve the aspirations of a young German musician than France. Winkelman accompanied him to London, but upon arriving, stole almost all of Horn's money and disappeared. Destitute and knowing no English, he wandered the streets of London before encountering a German-speaking Irishman, who sympathised with his plight. The man took Horn to the piano shop of Longman and Broderip at Cheapside, where Horn played the piano for its co-proprietor, Francis Fane Broderip. Impressed, Broderip introduced Horn to the Saxon ambassador John Maurice de Brühl. de Brühl recommended Horn to Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford, who hired him as his daughters' music teacher.|$|E
5|$|Second, Amenhotep I {{appears to}} have nearly {{finished}} preparations for a sed festival, or even begun celebrating it; but Amenhotep I's reign is usually given only 21 years and a sed festival traditionally cannot be celebrated any earlier than a ruler's 30th year. If Amenhotep I had a significant co-regency with his father, {{some have argued that}} he planned to celebrate his Sed Festival on the date he was first crowned instead of the date that he began ruling alone. This <b>would</b> <b>better</b> explain the degree of completion of his Sed Festival preparations at Karnak. There are two contemporary New Kingdom examples of the breaking of this tradition; Hatshepsut celebrated her Heb Sed Festival in her 16th year and Akhenaten celebrated a Sed Festival near the beginning of his 17-year reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} faced {{uncertainty}} relating to {{who would be}} the starting quarterback. While it was expected that Tate Forcier would retain his starting job, the build-up to the season led to a quarterback controversy that turned into a three way battle between Forcier, Denard Robinson, and highly touted recruit Devin Gardner. On defense, Michigan installed a new 3–3–5 formation that the coaches hoped <b>would</b> <b>better</b> suit the players currently on the team. Michigan lost several key players from the previous season, including DE Brandon Graham, the 2009 Big Ten defensive Most Valuable Player, RB's Brandon Minor and Carlos Brown, LB Stevie Brown, and CB Donovan Warren. Michigan suffered a severe blow to its defensive secondary during fall practice, as starting CB Troy Woolfolk suffered a dislocated ankle that ended his season before it began.|$|E
