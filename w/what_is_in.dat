5|$|Many {{poisonous}} or distasteful {{animals that}} advertise their presence with warning coloration (aposematism) use patterns that emphasize rather than disrupt their outlines. For example, skunks, salamanders and monarch butterflies all have high contrast patterns that display their outlines. These advertising patterns exploit the opposite principle to disruptive coloration, for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> effect the exactly opposite effect: {{to make the}} animal as conspicuous as possible.|$|E

The Book of <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the Underworld ('the Egyptian Book of the Dead'), {{an important}} funerary text {{used in the}} New Kingdom, {{is believed to have}} reached its final form during Amenhotep's reign, since it first appears in the decoration of the tomb of his successor Thutmose I. The Ebers papyrus, which is the main source for information on ancient Egyptian medicine, also seems to date to this time (the mention of the Heliacal rise of Sothis by which the early New Kingdom chronology is usually calculated was found on the back of this document).|$|E
5|$|Individuals who are {{intentional}} {{in their}} actions display regularity in their behavior. Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, {{and then use}} hands {{to make contact with}} and manipulate the object. Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E

5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|E

25|$|Ahmadi thought {{emphasizes}} {{the belief that}} Islam is the final dispensation for humanity as revealed to Muhammad {{and the necessity of}} restoring to it its true essence and pristine form, which had been lost through the centuries. Ahmadiyya adherents believe that Ahmad appeared in the likeness of Jesus, to end religious wars, condemn bloodshed and reinstitute morality, justice, and peace. They believe that upon divine guidance he divested Islam of fanatical and innovative beliefs and practices by championing <b>what</b> <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> their view, Islam’s true and essential teachings as practised by Muhammad and the early Islamic community. Thus, Ahmadis view themselves as leading the revival and peaceful propagation of Islam.|$|E

25|$|To {{ensure that}} even the largest structs do not cause a {{performance}} penalty when they are handed off, Swift uses copy on write so that the objects are copied only {{if and when the}} program attempts to change a value in them.

If found guilty, a defendant is absolutely guaranteed <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> effect a retrial, where all evidence and witnesses can be re-examined. A verdict can be overturned by the Italian supreme court, the Corte di Cassazione, which considers written briefs. If the Corte di Cassazione overturns a verdict, it explains what legal principles were violated by the lower court, which must abide by the ruling when re-trying the case. If the Corte di Cassazione upholds a guilty verdict of the appeal trial, the conviction becomes definitive, the appeals process is exhausted, and any sentence is served.|$|E

She shouts his name but there is no response. A little farther away, a car pulls up with Manni and Ronnie inside, who shake hands.

25|$|It {{is common}} to assume that {{buildings}} are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies {{that there is little}} interaction between the triad of the building, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see {{the overwhelming majority of the}} mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. “Building ecology “ is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.|$|E
25|$|Freedom Passes are {{generally}} issued on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> technical terms an Oyster card, {{though it does}} not bear that name. Freedom passes are free travel passes available to Greater London residents who are over a specified age (60 until March 2010, increasing in phases to 66 from March 2020) or with a disability specified in the Transport Act 2000; individual London boroughs have exceptional discretion to issue Freedom Passes to disabled {{people who do not}} meet the national statutory requirements (though they have to fund them). Travel is free at all times on the Tube, DLR, buses and Tramlink, and after 09:30 on most National Rail journeys entirely within the Greater London boundary. Holders cannot put any money or ticket products on a Freedom Pass; to travel outside these times, a separate Oyster card or other valid ticket is required.|$|E
25|$|Baudrillard is not disputing the trivial {{issue that}} reason remains {{operative}} in some actions, that if I want {{to arrive at}} the next block, for example, I can assume a Newtonian universe (common sense), plan a course of action (to walk straight for Xmeters), carry out the action, and finally fulfill my goal by arriving at the point in question. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> doubt is that this sort of thinking enables a historically informed grasp of the present in general. According to Baudrillard, it does not. The concurrent spread of the hyperreal through the media and the collapse of liberal and Marxist politics as the master narratives, deprives the rational subject of its privileged access to truth. In an important sense individuals are no longer citizens, eager to maximise their civil rights, nor proletarians, anticipating the onset of communism. They are rather consumers, and hence the prey of objects as defined by the code.|$|E
