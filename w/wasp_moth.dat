50|$|The Ctenuchina were {{previously}} classified as the Ctenuchinae subfamily of the Arctiidae family. That subfamily contained three tribes: Ctenuchini, Euchromiini (<b>wasp</b> <b>moths),</b> and Syntomini. The Arctiidae family was lowered in rank to the Arctiinae subfamily, and consequently, the three tribes became subtribes (with the -ina suffix). Ctenuchina and Euchromiina were reclassified in the Arctiini tribe, while the Syntomina {{were raised in}} rank to the Syntomini tribe.|$|R
50|$|The Erebidae are {{a family}} of moths in the Noctuoidea superfamily. The family is among the largest {{families}} of moths by species count and contains {{a wide variety of}} well-known macromoth groups. The family includes the underwings (Catocala); litter moths (Herminiinae); tiger, lichen, and <b>wasp</b> <b>moths</b> (Arctiinae); tussock moths (Lymantriinae); piercing moths (Calpinae and others); micronoctuoid moths (Micronoctuini); snout moths (Hypeninae); and zales, though many of these common names can also refer to moths outside the Erebidae (for example, crambid snout moths). Some of the erebid moths are called owlets.|$|R

2500|$|The Arctiinae (formerly {{called the}} Arctiidae) {{are a large}} and diverse {{subfamily}} of moths, with around 11,000 species found all over the world, including 6,000 neotropical species. This group includes the groups commonly known as tiger moths (or tigers), which usually have bright colours, footmen, which are usually much drabber, lichen <b>moths,</b> and <b>wasp</b> <b>moths.</b> Many species have [...] "hairy" [...] caterpillars that are popularly known as woolly bears or woolly worms. The scientific name of this subfamily refers to this hairiness (Gk. αρκτος = a bear). Caterpillars may also go by the name [...] "tussock moths" [...] (more usually, however, this refers to the Lymantriidae).|$|R

50|$|Yellow house bats are fond {{of small}} insects. Depending on the {{habitats}} at the different regions, yellow house bats have different food preys. They prefer to feed on airborne insects, hymenopterans and dipterans, {{which can be found}} under the canopies of tall trees and riparian forests at nights. Small insects such as <b>wasps,</b> bees, <b>moths,</b> and beetles are all fearful of yellow house bats. Larger soft-bodied insects can also become yellow house bats' food.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a lot}} of insects: mosquitoes, flees, <b>wasps,</b> bees, gypsy <b>moths,</b> green crickets, hornets, {{different}} louses, crickets, ladybugs, moths, butterflies, etc. Among {{agricultural pests}} the widest spreads are: potato beetle, turnip beetle, grain weevil and bean weevil.|$|R
50|$|Pseudocharis minima, the Lesser <b>Wasp</b> <b>Moth,</b> is a moth in the Arctiidae family. It was {{described}} by Grote in 1867. It is found on Cuba and in Florida and southern Texas. The habitat consists of pine rocklands, tropical hammocks and the ecotone between hammocks and salt marshes.|$|E
50|$|Some {{invertebrates}} {{are known}} to be unaffected by oleander toxins, and feed on the plants. Caterpillars of the polka-dot <b>wasp</b> <b>moth</b> (Syntomeida epilais) feed specifically on oleanders and survive by eating only the pulp surrounding the leaf-veins, avoiding the fibers. Larvae of the common crow butterfly (Euploea core) also feed on oleanders, and they retain or modify toxins, making them unpalatable to would-be predators such as birds, but not to other invertebrates such as spiders and wasps.|$|E
50|$|Moths {{are known}} to engage in {{acoustic}} forms of communication, most often as courtship, attracting mates using sound or vibration. Like most other insects, moths pick up these sounds using tympanic membranes in their abdomens. An example {{is that of the}} polka-dot <b>wasp</b> <b>moth</b> (Syntomeida epilais), which produces sounds with a frequency above that normally detectable by humans (about 20 kHz). These sounds also function as tactile communication, or communication through touch, as they stridulate, or vibrate a substrate like leaves and stems.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominent}} flower spikes are {{visited by}} many birds and insects. Honeyeaters are common visitors, particularly the New Holland honeyeater, {{as well as}} the fuscous honeyeater, western wattlebird and western spinebill. Other birds recorded foraging include the grey butcherbird and species of thornbill. Insects recorded include ants, bees, <b>wasps,</b> butterflies, <b>moths,</b> flies and beetles. The short-billed black cockatoo breaks off old cones with follicles to eat the seed, often doing so before the seed is ripe.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} mainly insectivorous. Birds consume {{a range of}} small {{invertebrates}} such as beetles, ants, bugs, <b>wasps,</b> grasshoppers, <b>moths,</b> larvae, and spiders, and small quantities of seeds. They forage for their prey in amongst foliage and in the leaf litter {{on the ground that}} may have accumulated as debris during floods. Group members will forage separately, hopping rapidly through the dense undergrowth, but remain in contact with each other by making soft ‘chet’ sounding calls.|$|R
50|$|This frog is {{opportunistic}} at best. It {{will eat}} {{a variety of}} insects, including grasshoppers, ants, <b>wasps,</b> beetles, and <b>moths.</b> These insects comprise more than 50% of the frog's diet. This frog will also eat seemingly unusual animals, such as crustaceans, mollusks, arthropods, and arachnids.|$|R
