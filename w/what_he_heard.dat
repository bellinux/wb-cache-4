5|$|Frith {{had been}} {{listening}} to music from other cultures, particularly Eastern Europe since the mid-1970s. He {{made no attempt to}} notate <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard,</b> but absorbed it and let it find its way later into his own music. On Gravity Frith mixed up all these different musical styles to make new songs out of them.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard,</b> Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E

25|$|In 1986 Carl Sagan {{summarized}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> Soviet commentators {{were saying}} about SDI, {{with a common}} argument being that it was equivalent to starting an economic war through a defensive arms race to further cripple the Soviet economy with extra military spending, while another less plausible interpretation was that it served as a disguise for the US wish to initiate a first strike on the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|During {{his school}} years, Houston {{began to play}} the guitar, having picked up an {{assortment}} of folk songs from his family. It is reported that Houston was regarded as highly intelligent during his time at school, despite the nystagmus that afflicted his eyesight, leaving him to rely heavily on peripheral vision. He learned primarily by memorizing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> in the classroom. Despite his difficulties, Houston came {{to be regarded as}} a well-read individual.|$|E
25|$|New York City producer/composer and jingle writer David Lucas saw {{the band}} perform {{and took them}} into his Warehouse Recording Studio and {{produced}} four demos, with which Pearlman {{was able to get}} the renamed band another audition with Columbia Records. Clive Davis liked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard,</b> and signed the band to the label. The first album was subsequently produced and recorded by Lucas on eight track at Lucas' studio. Winters would leave the band and be replaced by Bouchard's brother, Joe Bouchard.|$|E
25|$|With {{managers}} Rob Lanni and Eric Lawrence of Coalition Entertainment {{representing the}} band, short showcases were arranged with Warner Music Canada, EMI Canada, and Sony Music Canada. Sony Music Canada head of A Richard Zuckerman liked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard,</b> {{and saw the}} potential of the band, its producer, and management. The band signed a record and publishing deal with Sony Music Canada in April 1993, and commenced writing for their debut album. Around the same time, then-17-year-old Jeremy Taggart joined the band as permanent drummer.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Keith went to Nashville, Tennessee, where he hung out and busked on Music Row {{and at a}} place called Houndogs. He {{distributed}} copies of a demo tape the band had made to the many record companies in the city. There was no interest by any of the record labels, and Keith returned home feeling depressed. He had promised himself and God to have a recording contract {{by the time he was}} 30 years old or give up on music as a career. A flight attendant and fan of his gave a copy of Keith's demo tape to Harold Shedd, a Mercury Records executive, while he was traveling on a flight she was working. Shedd enjoyed <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard,</b> went to see Keith perform live and then signed him to a recording contract with Mercury.|$|E
25|$|Gilmour was {{responsible}} for bringing Kate Bush to public attention.

500|$|At the Cologne ISCM Festival in 1960, the Danish {{composer}} Per Nørgård heard Stockhausen's Kontakte {{as well as}} {{pieces by}} Kagel, Boulez, and Berio. He was profoundly affected by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> and his music suddenly changed into [...] "a far more discontinuous and disjunct style, involving elements of strict organization in all parameters, some degree of aleatoricism and controlled improvisation, together {{with an interest in}} collage from other musics" [...]|$|E
500|$|During this time, Du Fu led {{a largely}} {{itinerant}} life unsettled by wars, associated famines and imperial displeasure.

500|$|Following some media controversies, West {{chose to}} record his fifth studio My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in a reclusive manner in Oahu, Hawaii. Like the {{majority}} of the album, [...] "Monster" [...] was composed there. Rapper Rick Ross was invited to Hawaii to work with West, because West was set to produce the song [...] "Live Fast, Die Young", which appeared on Teflon Don, an album by Ross. While Ross was there with West in his recording studio, he actually walked in on West while recording another song. Ross was not initially intended to be featured on West's album, however Ross was so impressed with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> he decided to record a quick, though short verse.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} the story appeared, Hollywood was {{releasing}} adaptations of works set in the South by writers such as Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner. [...] Kurtzman said his inspiration came from his memories of Paris, Texas, where he was stationed during World War II. [...] He learned the Southern drawl used in the story from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> at United Service Organizations (USO) dances. [...] He recalled, [...] "I just wanted a parody of that town. [...] I worked from memory." [...] The scene in which the unemployed townsmen mentally undress Honey Lou affected Art Spiegelman, who saw the possibilities of the comics medium in the formalities of the scene's portrayal of motion.|$|E
500|$|The same panic {{that nearly}} ruined McKinley {{convinced}} Hay that men like himself must take office {{to save the}} country from disaster. [...] By the end of 1894, he was deeply involved in efforts {{to lay the groundwork}} for the governor's 1896 presidential bid. It was Hay's job to persuade potential supporters that McKinley was worth backing. Nevertheless, Hay found time for a lengthy stay in New Hampshire—one visitor at The Fells in mid-1895 was Rudyard Kipling—and later [...] in the year wrote, [...] "The summer wanes and I have done nothing for McKinley." [...] He atoned with a $500 check to Hanna, the first of many. During the winter of 1895–96, Hay passed along <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> from other Republicans influential in Washington, such as Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge.|$|E
500|$|Phillips, meanwhile, {{was always}} on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader {{audience}} the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, [...] "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'" [...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E
