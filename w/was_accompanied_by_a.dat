5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose <b>was</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise {{in front of the}} cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
5|$|Eardwulf {{was evidently}} married {{before he became}} king, as Alcuin reproached him for abandoning his wife for a {{concubine}} soon after his coronation.

Alcuin, while condemning secular oppression of the church, affected surprise that while the Archbishop Eanbald was travelling he <b>was</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large retinue, including soldiers, and that he received and protected the king's enemies. Eanbald was presumably in conflict with Eardwulf over property, but it is likely that he also supported rivals for Eardwulf's throne.|$|E
