40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} the <b>weld</b> <b>current</b> on the {{microstructure}} and mechanical properties of a resistance spot-welded twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steel sheet was investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy–electron back-scattered diffraction (SEM–EBSD), microhardness measurements, a tensile shear test and fractography. Higher weld currents promoted the formation of a macro expulsion cavity in the fusion zone. Additionally, higher weld currents led to a higher indentation depth, a wider heat-affected zone (HAZ), coarser grain structure and thicker annealing twins in the HAZ, and a relatively equiaxed dendritic structure in the centre of the fusion zone. The hardness values in the weld zone were lower than that of the base metal. The lowest hardness values were observed in the HAZ. No strong relationship was observed between the hardness values in the weld zone and the <b>weld</b> <b>current.</b> A higher joint strength, tensile deformation and failure energy absorption capacity were obtained with a <b>weld</b> <b>current</b> of 12 kA, a welding time of 300 ms and an electrode force of 3 kN.

It is observed {{that the nature of}} the real-time current wave forms corresponding to a common rms value can vary in different ac spot welding machines. The variations exist in the values of peak current and in the current-on and -off times in every ac cycle. It is observed that real-time current wave form involving higher peak current leads to slightly larger weld nugget diameter compared to wave form with smaller peak current even if the overall rms value remains similar The real-time current wave form from a medium frequency dc confirms-to a fast rise to the set <b>weld</b> <b>current</b> and remains steady for the complete weld time. A detailed experimental study has depicted that-the real-time ac wave forms especially with high peak values and sharp rise characteristics offer a relatively smaller permissible range of weld currents compared to the wave forms with relatively flatter characteristics. The steady instantaneous current wave form confirming to the medium frequency dc machine has facilitated a larger permissible range of <b>weld</b> <b>current.</b> A numerical analysis of the spot welding process based on finite element process is carried out using both the instantaneous current wave forms and the corresponding rms values of <b>weld</b> <b>current.</b> The predicted weld dimensions using instantaneous current wave forms have showed slightly better agreement with the corresponding measured weld dimensions...|$|E

The working range of the experimentation is decided by test experiments. For joining the work piece by TIG welding for 304 stainless steel (SS 304), the process parameters play an important role. During experimentation it is found that, increase in the welding current result in increase in heat input. This increased heat is utilized to melt the base metal.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of parameters of {{tungsten inert gas}} arc welding on the morphology, microstructure, tensile property and fracture of welded joints of Ni-base superalloy have been studied. Results show that the increase of <b>welding</b> <b>current</b> and the decrease of welding speed bring about the large amount of heat input in the welding pool and the enlargement of width and deepness of the welding pool. The increase of impulse frequency has the same effect on the microstructure compared with the increase of <b>welding</b> <b>current.</b> The effect of welding parameters on the tensile strength and fracture was analyzed. It is found that the root of welding joint is unwelded when the <b>welding</b> <b>current</b> is lower, so that the strength and elongation of welded joint are inferior. And the more welding defects in the welding zone and the more hard and brittle phase precipitates in the overheated zone when the <b>welding</b> <b>current</b> is too high.

The material variations studied include zinc coating integrity, structure, composition, thickness, roughness, oil, and the amount and type of Fe-Zn intermetallics. Process modifications studied include upsloping and downsloping of the <b>weld</b> <b>current,</b> preheat current, postheat current, electrode tip geometry, and applied force. It was found that hot-dipped galvanized materials with coatings which have a very thin Fe-Zn alloy layer have {{a wider range of}} acceptable welding conditions than the commercial galvannealed products, which have a fully alloyed Fe-Zn coating. The decreased lobe width of the galvannealed material is due to the discontinuous Fe-Zn coating structure and morphology.
