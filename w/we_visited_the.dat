We knew that the following Saturday , June 14, would be the Jewish festival of Shavuot and that many will want to come to pray ... it all had to be completed by then.|$|E
500|$|As {{confirmed}} in January 2014, a new court show conceived by Sheindlin titled Hot Bench debuted on September 15, 2014. The courtroom series features {{a panel of}} three judges debating and deciding on cases brought to their TV courtroom. Stated Sheindlin, [...] "When my husband Jerry and I were in Ireland recently, <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> courts and watched a three judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling. I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds {{to serve as the}} judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench." [...] The panel of judges consist of New York State Supreme Court judge Patricia DiMango, and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman. As with Judge Judy, Hot Bench is executive-produced by Randy Douthit, and produced by CBS Television Distribution. It {{is important to note that}} Sheindlin originally desired the title of her personal courtroom series to be [...] "Hot Bench" [...] before producers ultimately settled on [...] "Judge Judy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Indians {{always insisted}} that they took no prisoners. If they did—a thing I firmly believe—they were {{tortured}} and killed {{the night of the}} 25th. As an evidence of this I recall the three charred and burned heads we picked up in the village near the scene of the big war dance, when <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> village with Capt. Benteen and Lieut. Wallace {{on the morning of the}} 27th... I'm sorely afraid, Tony, that we will have to class Hayward's story, like that of so many others, as pure, unadulterated B. S. As a clerk at headquarters I had occasion to look over the morning reports of at least the six troops at Lincoln almost daily, and never saw his name there, or among the list of scouts employed from time to time...I am hoping that some day all of these damned fakirs will die and it will be safe for actual participants in the battle to admit and insist that they were there, without being branded and looked upon as a lot of damned liars. Actually, there have been times when I have been tempted to deny that I ever heard of the 7th Cavalry, much less participated with it in that engagement...My Medal of Honor and its inscription have served me as proof positive that I was at least in the vicinity at the time in question, otherwise I should be tempted to deny all knowledge of the event.|$|E

60|$|Returning to {{the city}} <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> house of Giulio Romano, which stands {{in one of the}} fine, lonesome streets, and at the outside of which we looked.

All these edifices are Gothic, quaint, and some of them sufficiently dilapidated.|$|E
60|$|A word {{now about}} the hard stories we heard the first time <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> ship.

50|$|The Restless Supermarket is the {{etymologically}} dazzling {{story of}} Johannesburg suburb Hillbrow's makeover from frayed Euro-café society to shabby Afro-soul. Through the withering scorn of Aubrey Tearle, the novel's chief crank, <b>we</b> <b>visit</b> <b>the</b> dramatic moment - {{somewhere in the}} early 1990s - when these two worlds collide, often with hilarious results. The book is due to be republished in England in 2014 through And Other Stories Publishing.|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> two long, covered wooden bridges which {{span the}} green and {{brilliant}} Reuss just below where it goes plunging and hurrahing out of the lake. These rambling, sway-backed tunnels are very attractive things, with their alcoved outlooks upon the lovely and inspiriting water. They contain two or three hundred queer old pictures, by old Swiss masters--old boss sign-painters, who flourished before the decadence of art.|$|E

"It {{was barely}} denied," [...] the Report continues, [...] "that {{in the various}} [...] posts of the A.B.I.R. which <b>we</b> <b>visited,</b> <b>the</b> {{imprisonment}} of women [...] hostages, the subjection of the chiefs to servile labour, the [...] humiliations meted out to them, the flogging of rubber collectors, the [...] brutality of the black employés set over the prisoners, were the rule [...] commonly followed." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{another night}} <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> East.

60|$|Then {{we go on}} {{to another}} system of {{machines}} in which lead is reduced to plastic ribbons and cut into shrapnel bullets as the sweetstuff makers pull out and cut up sweetstuff.

6000|$|Reader, shall <b>we</b> <b>visit</b> <b>the</b> {{dear old}} man in his dingy little house in old England while he peruses the {{foregoing}} letter? Yes, let us go. It is worth while travelling between four and five thousand miles to see him read it. Perhaps, {{if you are a}} critical reader, you may ask, [...] "But how came you to know how the old gentleman received the letter?" [...] Well, although the question is impertinent, I will answer it.|$|R

He bent over the oars and sent the boat forward, keeping this up for a succession of minutes during which they both remained silent. His companion, in her place, motionless, reclining--the seat in the stern was most comfortable--looked only at the water, the sky, the trees.

60|$|One evening <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> young Rajah at his residence, {{which has}} rather a good {{appearance}} at a distance, its white walls gleaming through a dark tope of mango, betel, and cocoa-nut. A short rude avenue {{leads to the}} entrance gate, under the trees of which a large bazaar was being held; stocked with cloths, simple utensils, ornaments, sweetmeats, five species of fish from the Teesta, and the betel-nut.|$|E
60|$|I was {{far from}} {{desiring}} that Saul should be punished. The mischief had been wrought, and however bitterly he repented it would not right matters. I believed for the time that Pierre was overly harsh, and would have insisted on going straight to the lad with food, but that I realized how dangerous it might be if <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> shed {{in the rear of}} Master Bemis's shop more often than was absolutely necessary.|$|E
60|$|Our pilgrims {{compress}} {{too much}} into one day. One can gorge sights to repletion as well as sweetmeats. Since we breakfasted, this morning, we have seen enough to have furnished us food for a year's reflection {{if we could have}} seen the various objects in comfort and looked upon them deliberately. <b>We</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> pool of Hezekiah, where David saw Uriah's wife coming from the bath {{and fell in love with}} her.|$|E
