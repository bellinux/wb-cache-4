25|$|Punulu (a {{house for}} menstruating women): {{this house is}} {{on the outside of}} the village. It is {{constructed}} by women and is of lower quality than the other village buildings. Women having their period are considered to be unclean and have to leave their family house to live during five days in this house. They use kitchen equipment only to be used here. They bring with them their youngest children. This house is a gathering place for women during the evening. This hut is also thought to have some sort of reproductive symbolism due to the fact that the hut can be easily seen by the men who are working the fields <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> only women who are on their period, and thus not pregnant, can be there.|$|E
25|$|Both {{indirect}} reciprocity {{and costly}} signaling {{depend on the}} value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects. Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.|$|E
25|$|During the Fear Itself storyline, Steve Rogers {{is present}} when {{the threat of}} the Serpent is known. Following the {{apparent}} death of Bucky at the hands of Sin (in the form of Skadi), Steve Rogers ends up changing into his Captain America uniform. When the Avengers and the New Avengers are fighting Skadi, the Serpent ends up joining the battle and breaks Captain America's shield with his bare hands. Captain America and the Avengers teams end up forming a militia for a last stand against the forces of the Serpent. When it comes to the final battle, Captain America uses Thor's hammer to fight Skadi until Thor manages to kill the Serpent. In the aftermath of the battle, Iron Man presents him with his reforged shield, now stronger for its uru-infused enhancements despite the scar it bears. It is then revealed that Captain America, Nick Fury, and Black Widow are the only ones <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Bucky actually survived the fight with Skadi as Bucky resumes his identity as Winter Soldier.|$|E

500|$|Warner made no {{pretense of}} {{faithfulness}} to his wife, Ann, and kept {{a series of}} mistresses throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The most enduring of these [...] "girlfriends" [...] was an aspiring actress named Jackie Park, who bore a [...] "startling" [...] resemblance to Warner's second wife. [...] The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann Warner pressed her husband to terminate the affair. [...] Although Ann did once have an affair with studio actor Eddie Albert in 1941, she was much more devoted to the marriage by contrast. [...] In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Jack Warner had a softer side. [...] In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Warner on his 1964 autobiography, My First Hundred Years in Hollywood, Ann Warner wrote: [...] "He is extremely sensitive, but there are few <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> because he covers it with a cloak." ...|$|E
500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E
2500|$|A {{potential}} hindrance {{in recruiting}} referees {{is that they}} are usually not paid, largely because doing so would itself create a conflict of interest. Also, reviewing takes time away from their main activities, such as his or her own research. To the would-be recruiter's advantage, most potential referees are authors themselves, or at least readers, <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the publication system requires that experts donate their time. Serving as a referee can even be a condition of a grant, or professional association membership.|$|E

[...] Until her gown heals itself (since a gown is a living part of a faerie), Fanta lives with Ryang's family on earth. Rather than being upset, she is quite happy to stay, mostly because it is the best opportunity to find her father's reincarnation and learn more about him. [...] Ryang, Seho Yun, and Yuri Kim are the only humans <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Fanta is a Faerie since Fanta has wiped the memories of everyone else who has seen her at work.|$|E
2500|$|Known in Romanian {{press as}} War of the palaces (...) was a {{prolonged}} conflict between President Traian Băsescu and Prime Minister Victor Ponta, {{the representatives of}} Cotroceni Palace and Victoria Palace, respectively. In April 2014, conflict between the two has deepened and escalated to threats of imprisonment from both of them. President Traian Băsescu said that if Victor Ponta will try to interfere in the justice risks ending {{up in the hands}} of prosecutors, who will not tolerate that. He also stated that Ponta is deeply corrupt, and his election as president would be a great drama for Romania. In reply, Victor Ponta stated: „(...) I am absolutely convinced that Traian Băsescu will go to jail. I, <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I have always respected the law, I have no fear”.|$|E
2500|$|California, {{the largest}} state by {{population}} {{and number of}} registered vehicles, is unusual among the states in not requiring any form of temporary license plate. Newly-purchased vehicles typically drive around {{for a month or}} more with nothing but a dealer's advertisement or logo on a paper plate insert where the license plate would go; some drivers keep this and some remove it. This makes the new vehicle essentially [...] "untraceable," [...] both by plain visual observation by persons, and by automated means such as license-plate reading systems, red light cameras, and automatic number plate recognition. This has led to an epidemic of drivers of newly-purchased vehicles cheating tolls on bridges and toll roads where a transponder system is used instead of toll booths, causing the state to lose $15–19 million per year. Because of this, new state legislation was adopted in 2016 that will require temporary license plates in California beginning in 2019. This law was inspired by the hit-and-run death of a pedestrian who was struck by a car with dealer paper inserts: because it had no temporary plates, it was impossible to trace the suspect. California's lack of a temporary plate requirement has been jokingly known as the [...] "Steve Jobs loophole" [...] due to the former Apple CEO's habit of keeping rolling six-month leases on a series of Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMGs specifically to avoid having to put license plates on the cars. California's unusual lack of temporary plates is also taken advantage of by criminals, <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a car driving with a dealer ad paper insert is both untraceable and will not raise suspicion.|$|E
