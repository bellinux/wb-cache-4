500|$|... "Ike's Wee Wee" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker. The scene where Mr. Mackey loses the marijuana cigarette in class was inspired by a real event from Parker's life, where a counselor came into his class in seventh grade, and passed around a lit piece of marijuana, which then disappeared. At {{the beginning and end of}} the episode, there are scenes <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> imitate Mr. Mackey's voice to him, while he is oblivious to the fact that he is being made fun of. Parker and his classmates used to do the same thing to their counselor in junior high school, who was the basis for Mr. Mackey's character. Parker said that he was especially proud of Chef's line, [...] "There's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college", which is something Parker believes in, noting that if he had a child, he would tell him: [...] "Do whatever you want, just wait till college because you don't know what the fuck's up right now." [...] Chef's sentence would later return in the season four episode [...] "The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000".|$|E

Students from eight schools around the country participated in the show which featured musical theatre, spoken word and interpretative dance. President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at the event. Smith adopted a school in Greenfield, California also lobbied Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner for increased funding for arts education and that it is a personal issue for him. Smith said [...] "I didn't give a shit about science, math or English when I was in school and music was the only reason I wanted to go. It got me interested in other subjects and I would've never graduated without it. If kids can connect with some sort of art in some way, it will enrich their lives in ways they probably can't fully comprehend at the time." [...] Earlier in the week, Smith was joined by former New York Yankee and musician, Bernie Williams at Savoy Elementary School in Washington, D.C. where together they taught a music class. [...] "These are schools <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> look down at their feet and have no hope and don't feel like they mean anything. They have no self-worth. They need something. This is not a photo-op and just throwing some money. You really roll your sleeves up and immerse yourself in the school." [...] Smith said.|$|E
