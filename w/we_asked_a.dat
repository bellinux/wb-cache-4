6000|$|... "Yep!" [...] said Parkins, [...] "that's {{what things}} were like over there. So {{when we got}} on board the train <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> man when {{it was due to}} get to Vienna, and he said he hadn't the faintest idea!" ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the most}} general {{meaning of the}} word, a model {{is a way of}} {{representing}} something of interest. If <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> biologist to model the visual system, he will probably talk about neurons, dendrites and synapses. On the other hand, if <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> mathematician to model the visual system, he will probably talk about variables, probabilities and differential equations...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh! <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> few questions, {{and brought}} out remarks, with great difficulty, at long intervals. He asked me if lying here was not a great nuisance, and, at last, he grew tired of {{twisting}} his moustache, and went away." ...|$|E
60|$|When he finished, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> few {{questions}} about the queen, and finding that Goliah admitted her claims to royal blood, we told him what we proposed to do, and boldly asked {{him to take the}} position of prime minister in the African community.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> gentleman by us if he {{knew what}} cause was on. He told us Jarndyce and Jarndyce. We asked him {{if he knew}} what was doing in it. He said really, no he did not, nobody ever did, but as well as he could make out, it was over. Over for the day? we asked him. No, he said, over for good.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why don't we {{all live}} in the country?" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, once more looking out of the window. [...] "I'm sure one would think such {{beautiful}} things if one lived in the country. No horrid slum houses to depress one, no trams or motor-cars; and the people all looking so plump and cheerful. Isn't there some little cottage near you, Charlotte, which would do for us, with a spare room, perhaps, in case <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> friend down? And we should save so much money {{that we should be}} able to travel--" ...|$|E
6000|$|October 26.--Here {{we still}} are, fixed by the inexorable wind. Yesterday <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> few old friends, Mr. and Mrs. Osborne, {{and two or}} three others, to tea and talk. I engaged in a new novel, by Mr. Smith,[480] called New Forest. It is written in an old style, {{calculated}} to meet the popular ideas--somewhat like [...] "Man as he is not"[481] and that class. The author's opinions seem rather to sit loose upon him and to be adopted for the nonce and not very well brought out. His idea of a hero is an American philosopher with all the affected virtues of a Republican which no man believes in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{they was}} grand times, these," [...] {{continued}} the marine, with kindly enthusiasm, as {{he observed that}} his comrades in sorrow were becoming interested, and forgetting for the moment their own sorrows and sufferings. [...] "The Blue-Ribbon move was strong in Portsmouth at the time, {{and many of the}} soldiers and sailors joined it. Some time after we had held out a helping hand to the poor civilians, we took it into our heads to invite some of 'em to a grand tea-fight in the big hall, so <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> lot o' the poorest who had faithfully kept the pledge through their first teetotal Christmas; and it was a scrimmage, I can tell you. We got together more than forty of 'em, men and women, and there were about three hundred soldiers and sailors, and their wives to wait on 'em an' keep 'em company!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "ARE you such {{a casual}} acquaintance?" [...] I inquired, with a smile. (It might have shocked Aunt Fanny to hear me; but THAT {{is the way}} <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> young man his {{intentions}} nowadays.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> question, Judge?" [...] he said respectfully, {{although}} {{his voice had}} the unmistakable Western American ring in it, as of one who was unconscious {{that he could be}} addressing any but his peers.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{buy what}} you need, {{just as if}} you {{expected}} to ride the ranges for me to-morrow," [...] said Naab. [...] "The first thing <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> new man is, can he ride? Next, can he shoot?" ...|$|R
60|$|Whenever, as boys, we {{committed}} some boyish fault, {{he never}} displayed outwardly any irritation--he simply altered his manner towards us altogether. We were not soundly lectured, or vehemently threatened, or positively punished in anyway; but, {{when we came}} in contact with him, we were treated with a cold, contemptuous politeness (especially if our fault showed a tendency to anything mean or ungentlemanlike) which cut us to the heart. On these occasions, we were not addressed by our Christian names; if we accidentally met him out of doors, he was sure to turn aside and avoid us; if <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> question, it was answered in the briefest possible manner, as if we had been strangers. His whole course of conduct said, as though in so many words--You have rendered yourselves unfit to associate with your father; and he is now making you feel that unfitness as deeply as he does. We were left in this domestic purgatory for days, sometimes for weeks together. To our boyish feelings (to mine especially) there was no ignominy like it, while it lasted.|$|E
60|$|Helena we visited, {{and also}} a town I had not heard of before, it being of recent birth--Arkansas City. It was born of a railway; the Little Rock, Mississippi River and Texas Railroad touches the river there. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> {{passenger}} who belonged there what sort of a place it was. 'Well,' said he, after considering, and with the air of one who wishes to take time and be accurate, 'It's {{a hell of a}} place.' A description which was photographic for exactness. There were several rows and clusters of shabby frame-houses, and a supply of mud sufficient to insure the town against a famine in that article for a hundred years; for the overflow had but lately subsided. There were stagnant ponds in the streets, here and there, and a dozen rude scows were scattered about, lying aground wherever they happened to have been when the waters drained off and people could do their visiting and shopping on foot once more. Still, it is a thriving place, with a rich country behind it, an elevator in front of it, {{and also a}} fine big mill for the manufacture of cotton-seed oil. I had never seen this kind of a mill before.|$|E
60|$|The slaves are {{certainly}} not overworked--children of ten do more without fatigue--and the Apemama labourers have holidays, when the singing begins early in the afternoon. The diet is hard; copra and a sweetmeat of pounded pandanus are the only dishes I observed outside the palace; but there seems no defect in quantity, and the king shares with them his turtles. Three came in a boat from Kuria during our stay; one was kept for the palace, one sent to us, one presented to the village. It is the habit of the islanders to cook the turtle in its carapace; we had been promised the shells, and <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> tapu on this foolish practice. The face of Tembinok' darkened and he answered nothing. Hesitation in {{the question of the}} well I could understand, for water is scarce on a low island; that he should refuse to interfere upon a point of cookery was more than I had dreamed of; and I gathered (rightly or wrongly) that he was scrupulous of touching in the least degree the private life and habits of his slaves. So that even here, in full despotism, public opinion has weight; even here, in the midst of slavery, freedom has a corner.|$|E
30|$|To {{find out}} whether the method is useful in {{decision}} support, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>an</b> expert neurologist, blinded to the clinical data, to separate PD patients from control subjects only based on the DaTSCAN qualitative assessment; his classification accuracy was calculated and compared to the other two approaches.|$|R
6000|$|When we saw this, we hesitated. Could <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> man {{who owned}} books, and could {{probably}} read, to play second fiddle {{to a woman}} who could not speak the English language, and who for years, perhaps, had devoted the energies of her soul to the sale of pepper-pods? ...|$|R

50|$|<b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> {{friendly}} {{security service}} to approach Baghdad about extraditing Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi and providing information {{about him and}} his close associates. This service contacted Iraqi officials twice, and we passed details that should have {{made it easy to}} find Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi. The network remains in Baghdad. Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi still remains at large to come and go. Since last year, members of this network have been apprehended in France, Britain, Spain and Italy. By our last count, 116 operatives connected to this global web have been arrested.|$|E
3000|$|<b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} {{questions}} in order to ascertain how “typically” (i.e., stereotypically) Middle Eastern, Iranian-American, or Muslim participants {{would appear to be}} from their accent, skin tone, or appearance. We included the following questions: [...]...|$|E
30|$|Next, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} walking form. As shown in Fig. 5, there are four types of walking forms when playing the game. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> participant {{to walk in the}} four walking forms shown in Fig. 19.|$|E
5000|$|Dawkins first recounts {{a famous}} {{religious}} dilemma experienced by Charles Darwin, [...] "I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars." [...] <b>We</b> <b>ask</b> why <b>a</b> caterpillar should suffer such cruel punishment. <b>We</b> <b>ask</b> why digger wasps couldn't first kill caterpillars {{to save them}} from a prolonged and agonizing torture. <b>We</b> <b>ask</b> why <b>a</b> child should die an untimely death. And <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> why <b>we</b> should all grow old and die.|$|R
40|$|A {{year after}} Croatia’s {{accession}} to the European Union on July 1, 2013, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>an</b> academic and a journalist {{to write their}} accounts of the much anticipated ‘return to Europe’. Nenad Zakošek and Ines Sabalić argue that while the government {{has proven to be}} inefficient, ordinary Croats have started to enjoy the benefits of membership...|$|R
40|$|Bielavsky {{introduced}} and investigated {{the class of}} symmetric symplectic spaces, that is, symmetric spaces endowed with a symplectic form invariant with respect to symmetries. Since the theory of symmetric spaces has generalizations, <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> question about their possible symplectic versions. We do construct such generalizations and extend some of Bieliavsky's results. In particular, we classify all 3 -symmetric symplectic spaces...|$|R
30|$|We are {{currently}} planning to undergo such a trial for which <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> grant from French Ministry of Health. This study might {{be dedicated to}} Roger Waters (with salt) and may remove another brick off the wall of recommendations for albumin.|$|E
30|$|For further validation, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> few {{graduate}} students to run MOS-based test {{to rate the}} quality for each configuration. The test was done in a random and blind way (i.e., the students {{were not aware of}} the configuration). The average rating resultsconfirmed clearly the quality difference between each configuration.|$|E
30|$|All {{samples were}} {{evaluated}} with the BI and the PFT, both scales were {{explained to the}} patients and the scales were repeated if the participants did not understand; if a patient could not give us information about themselves, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> carer or a relative. We obtained demographic data of the sample too.|$|E
40|$|In {{this and}} future issues of MPM, <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> panel ofexperts {{to comment on}} a {{pressing}} issue of the day.

If so, why? If not, why not...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCone {{vision has}} been shown to be {{temporally}} inhomogeneous across the visual field. In the periphery, contrast sensitivity is lower for low temporal frequencies and higher for high temporal frequencies.

We show that the rod visual field exhibits only a modest degree of temporal inhomogeneity...|$|R
