25|$|Oppal {{apologized to}} the victims’ {{families}} for not informing them of the appeal before it was announced to the general public. Oppal {{also said that the}} appeal was filed largely for “strategic” reasons, in anticipation of an appeal by the defence. The prosecution’s rationale was that if Pickton appeals his convictions, and if that appeal is allowed, resulting in a new trial, the prosecution will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> that new trial on the original 26 charges of first-degree murder. But the Crown would be precluded from doing so unless it had successfully appealed the original acquittals on the first-degree murder charges, and the severance of the 26 counts into one group of six and one group of twenty.|$|E

American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM radio station WWDC (now WWRC) in Washington, DC first played [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> Your Hand" [...] in mid-December 1963. It {{was not until the}} end of the first week of January 1964 that their records were played in New York City (also accompanied by a major marketing campaign and with similar play frequency), and then the rest of the country, initiating their music's spread across US radio. This caused an increase in demand, leading Capitol to rush-release [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> Your Hand" [...] later that month. Issued on 26 December 1963, with the band's previously scheduled debut there just weeks away, [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> Your Hand" [...] sold a million copies, becoming a number-one hit in the US by mid-January.

The visit, advertised across the United States on five million posters, was a defining moment in the Beatles' history, and the starting-point of the British Invasion.|$|E

500|$|In the United Kingdom, the Beatles had {{experienced}} popularity {{since the start}} of 1963. But in the United States, Capitol Records, owned by the band's record company EMI, had for most of the year declined to issue any of the singles. The phenomenon of Beatlemania in the UK was regarded with amusement by the U.S. press, once it made any comment. When newspaper and magazine articles did begin to appear towards the end of 1963, they cited the English stereotype of eccentricity, reporting that the UK had developed an interest in something that had come and gone a long time ago in the United States: rock and roll. Headlines included [...] "The New Madness" [...] and [...] "Beatle Bug Bites Britain", and writers employed word-play linking [...] "beetle" [...] with the [...] "infestation" [...] afflicting the UK. In late 1963, Capitol Records agreed to release the single [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> Your Hand" [...] with a large accompanying promotional campaign, due to Ed Sullivan's agreement to headline the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. The Beatles' American television debut was on 18 November 1963 on The Huntley-Brinkley Report, with a four-minute long piece by Edwin Newman. On 22 November 1963, the CBS Morning News ran a five-minute feature on Beatlemania in the UK which heavily featured their then current UK hit [...] "She Loves You". The evening's scheduled repeat was cancelled following the assassination of JohnF. Kennedy the same day. On 10 December, Walter Cronkite decided to transmit the piece again on the CBS Evening News, and the resulting interest led to the rush-release of [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> Your Hand" [...] and—only weeks before the Beatles' arrival—a U.S. commercial breakthrough.|$|E

He then asked Jacobs, his London-based, Hove-living celebrity lawyer (Jacobs's other clients included Marlene Dietrich, Diana Dors, Judy Garland, Liberace and Laurence Harvey) to appoint someone specifically to take over the assignment and gave Jacobs power of attorney in the matter.

Murphy stated {{that it would have been}} easy to have Kurt, an atheist, sing an anti-religion song, but instead chose to have him sing about love. Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of this song choice. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News said he [...] "found it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing 'I wanna be your man' about his father", but Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> Your Hand" [...] brought new meaning to the song, which Semigran named her favorite number of the episode. In [...] "Special Education", when given his first opportunity to audition for a Warblers solo, Kurt asks Rachel for advice on selecting a song and she recommends [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] from Evita; the episode cuts between the two as they each sing the song. Both Colfer's and Michele's versions were released as singles, available for digital download, although neither appears on an album. Kurt and Blaine perform the duet [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] during the Christmas-oriented episode [...] "A Very Glee Christmas". The number was released on , and although it was not also released as a single, it nevertheless reached number fifty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100.

[...] A male vocalist accompanies the singer's lyrics, [...] "Unless {{you want to be}} man / Unless you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> hands / Unless you want to be dad".

The Beatles themselves were perplexed by one analysis by Mann: [...] "...one gets the impression that they think simultaneously of harmony and melody, so firmly are the major tonic sevenths and ninths built into their tunes, and the flat-submediant key-switches, so natural is the Aeolian cadence at the end of [...] "Not a Second Time" [...] (the chord progression which ends Mahler's [...] "Song of the Earth")." ...|$|E

Double Fantasy producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings. Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the Fender Bass VI, providing bass on some Beatles numbers ("Back in the U.S.S.R.", [...] "The Long and Winding Road", [...] "Helter Skelter") that occupied McCartney with another instrument. His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including [...] "Imagine", described as his best-known solo work. His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 {{led to the creation of}} the Beatles' first US number one, [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> Your Hand".
