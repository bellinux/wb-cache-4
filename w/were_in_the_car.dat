25|$|Camilleri, {{who was at}} {{this time}} also remanded in custody for {{breaching}} bail conditions, was awaiting trial at Goulburn Correctional Centre. He was again interviewed by police regarding the schoolgirl murders. Police informed Camilleri of Beckett's confession. Camilleri again denied any involvement in the murders, and attempted to implicate Beckett as the lone murderer. Camilleri insisted {{he was in a}} drug induced stupor for {{most of the time the}} girls <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
25|$|Syriani {{testified that}} his wife had hit him almost every day in front of their {{children}} and had called the police about him several times. He did admit to hitting her three or four times during their first five years of marriage. The children contradicted him, saying that the marriage was full of instances of domestic violence from both sides. Their middle daughter, Sara, testified in the penalty phase of the trial that during one argument Syriani chased after Teresa with a pair of scissors, in another instance back-handed her while they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and one time threw her down the stairs by her hair. John said that another time, his father threatened Teresa with a bat.|$|E
40|$|Consider the {{following}} possible utterances, made by, say, Alison: (1) <b>The</b> keys <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> (2) <b>The</b> keys might <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> (3) I believe <b>the</b> keys <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> (4) Frank believes <b>the</b> keys <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> As many philosophers have noted, (3) functions in many contexts much like (1) or (2). (I {{will discuss the}} nature of such contexts below.) That is, it amounts to a hedged assertion about how things <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, rather than an autobiographical report {{that would be the}} first-personal counterpart of (4). One tell-tale sign of this <b>is</b> that <b>in</b> these contexts, it is natural for a hearer, say Barack, who knows that the keys could not possibly <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> to respond to (3) with something like (5) No, <b>the</b> keys can’t <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> I had them in my hand when we came in. Barack intuitively disagrees with Alison, even though his utterance is clearly not about her psychological state; hence, her utterance cannot have been about her psychological states either, at least not exclusively. Barack could use just the same utterance to disagree with (1) ...|$|R

2500|$|Appearing in 1958 was the Auto Union 1000 Sp, a low-slung {{two-seater}} {{sports car}} that was produced for Auto Union by the Stuttgart coach builders, Baur. [...] The fixed-head version was joined in 1961 by a cabriolet. Adorned with tail fins, the stylish modern look of the car {{gave rise to the}} [...] "baby Thunderbird" [...] (schmalspur Thunderbird) soubriquet in the press, and belied the fact that it was, under the skin, another Auto Union 1000, albeit one with an increased compression ratio and a claimed maximum of [...] to place on the road. The 1000 Sp was lower but not (assuming only two people <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car)</b> significantly lighter than the standard-bodied saloon: a claimed maximum speed of 140km/h (87mph) nevertheless put its performance {{at the top of the}} range. It would prove to be the last open top car produced by the company until the Audi 80 cabriolet in 1994.|$|E
60|$|The run to {{the seminary}} did not take long. The Laning girls stood waiting on the porch, and once they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> the machine was headed in the {{direction}} of the Sanderson cottage.|$|E

25|$|For {{some of the}} laps {{more than}} one person has <b>been</b> present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> case for Clarkson's run when he had both Hammond and Jason Dawe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Trinny and Susannah <b>were</b> both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> for each other's runs. Denise Van Outen <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> when Johnny Vaughan did his lap; Van Outen never did a lap driving <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Clarkson was also present as a {{navigator}} for Billy Baxter's laps.|$|R

60|$|The prince, {{escaping}} gracefully from {{a companion}} who remained adamant {{to all his}} advances, had maneuvered his way to their side. The last few steps were taken together. In a few moments they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and ready to start. Stephen, with a stiff little bow, had already departed. Louise leaned out from her place with outstretched hands.|$|E
60|$|Only a few {{passengers}} <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{and they}} were Mexicans at the forward end. This branch train consisted of one passenger-coach, with a baggage-car, attached to a string of freight-cars. Helen told herself, somewhat grimly, that soon she would know surely whether or not her suspicions of Harve Riggs had warrant. If he was going on to Magdalena on that day he must go in this coach. Presently Bo, who was not obeying admonitions, drew her {{head out of the}} window. Her eyes were wide in amaze, her mouth open.|$|E
60|$|I {{made him}} keep on playing {{it all the}} time we <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Now and then he'd get weak and off the key, and I'd turn my gun on him and ask what was the matter with that little gal, and whether he had any {{intention}} of going back on her, which would make him start up again like sixty. I think that old boy standing there in his silk hat and bare feet, playing his little French harp, was the funniest sight I ever saw. One little red-headed woman in the line broke out laughing at him. You could have heard her in the next car.|$|E

60|$|In {{a moment}} the uncle and nephew <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> jolting on the level crossing. The elder man seemed as if {{something}} tight in his brain made him open his eyes wide, and stare. He held the steering wheel firmly. He knew he could steer accurately, to a hair's breadth. Glaring fixedly ahead, he let the car go, till it bounded over the uneven road. There were three coal-carts in a string. In an instant the car grazed past them, almost biting the kerb on the other side. Sutton aimed his car like a projectile, staring ahead. He {{did not want to}} know, to think, to realize, he wanted to be only the driver of that quick taxi.|$|E
60|$|It seems, however, {{certain that}} a {{considerable}} force {{will be moved}} here soon to restore the situation and to relieve Ladysmith. Meanwhile we wait, not without anxiety or impatience. The Imperial Horse, a few mounted infantry, the volunteer cyclists, and the armoured train, patrol daily towards Colenso and the north, always expecting to see the approaching Boer commandos. Yesterday I travelled with the armoured train. This armoured train is a very puny specimen, having neither gun nor Maxims, with no roof to its trucks and no shutters to its loopholes, and being in every way inferior to the powerful machines I saw working along the southern frontier. Nevertheless it is a useful means of reconnaissance, nor is a journey in it devoid of interest. An armoured train! The very name sounds strange; a locomotive disguised as a knight-errant; the agent of civilisation in the habiliments of chivalry. Mr. Morley attired as Sir Lancelot would seem scarcely more incongruous. The possibilities of attack added to the keenness of the experience. We started at one o'clock. A company of the Dublin Fusiliers formed the garrison. Half <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{in front of the}} engine, half in that behind. Three empty trucks, with a platelaying gang and spare rails to mend the line, followed. The country between Estcourt and Colenso is open, undulating, and grassy. The stations, which occur every four or five miles, are hamlets consisting of half a dozen corrugated iron houses, and perhaps a score of blue gum trees. These little specks of habitation are almost the only marked feature of the landscape, which on all sides spreads in pleasant but monotonous slopes of green. The train maintained a good speed; and, though it stopped repeatedly to question Kaffirs or country folk, and to communicate with the cyclists and other patrols who were scouring the country on the flanks, reached Chieveley, five miles from Colenso, by about three o'clock; and from here the Ladysmith balloon, a brown speck floating above and beyond the distant hills, was plainly visible.|$|E

All the Cadets rose to attention, assuming that a high level USAF official <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> Midshipmen rose <b>in</b> similar fashion out of respect for whomever <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> passenger door opened, and first to come out were two men dressed in USAFA capes and caps, followed quickly by USNA's Bill the Goat, after which the supposed Cadets threw off their outer capes/caps exposing their goat-handler sweaters.|$|R
