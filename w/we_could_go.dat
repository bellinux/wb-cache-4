500|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled {{anonymously}} {{with the}} celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, [...] "We asked my parents if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief." ...|$|E
500|$|The budget {{organized}} by Slagel allowed for professional assistance. Bernie Grundman provided audio mastering, Eddy Schreyer worked on remastering, and Bill Metoyer, {{who worked on}} the band's earlier release Haunting the Chapel, acted as sound engineer. The recording featured audio effects such as the intro to [...] "Hell Awaits", a reversed recording of a demonic-sounding voice repeating [...] "Join us", ending with [...] "Welcome back". Still, Araya later stated the album had poor production quality: [...] "Nowadays, production-wise, it's so under par. But for what it was at the time, those are amazing records to me. I guess <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> in and redo it. But why ruin it?" ...|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] finished 32nd in {{ratings for the}} week of September 27– October 4, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 11.8, equivalent to approximately 11.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the seventh best in the show's history. Entertainment Weeklys Dalton Ross lauded it as [...] "the show's best ever musical episode", while Dave Kehr of The New York Times called it a [...] "brilliant ... parody of Broadway musicals that should be required viewing for every Tony viewer." [...] In a list of his favorite episodes, Kevin Williamson of Canadian Online Explorer added, [...] "As pitch-perfect eviscerations of community theatre go, this tops Waiting for Guffman." [...] Series creator Matt Groening has listed {{it as one of}} his own favorites, calling the subplot [...] "Maggie's finest moment", and future Simpsons guest star Trey Anastasio said the episode [...] "may have been the best TV show ever". Executive producer James L. Brooks also listed it as one of his favorites, saying it [...] "showed <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> into areas no one thought <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> into". Following the episode, the Ayn Rand Society called Groening to say they were amazed at the references to Rand. They also asked him if the show was making fun of them.|$|E
500|$|Other parks include: Alexandra Park {{on a hill}} {{overlooking}} the city; Parade Gardens, along the river near the abbey in the city centre; Sydney Gardens, an 18th-century pleasure-garden; Henrietta Park; Hedgemead Park; and Alice Park. Jane Austen wrote [...] "It would be pleasant to be near the Sydney Gardens. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> into the Labyrinth every day." [...] Alexandra, Alice and Henrietta parks were built into the growing city among the housing developments. There is a linear park following the old Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway line. Cleveland Pools were built around 1815 close to the River Avon, now the oldest surviving public outdoor lido in England, and plans have been submitted for its restoration.|$|E
500|$|Bloc Party's {{second album}} A Weekend in the City, {{released}} in 2007, allowed the quartet to evolve sonically by including more electronically tampered soundscapes, but {{the band members}} were not entirely comfortable with more daring musical arrangements when making the record. According to multi-instrumentalist Gordon Moakes, the impromptu November 2007 single [...] "Flux" [...] "opened a door {{to the fact that}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> in any direction" [...] in future works. After the NME Big Gig in February 2008, the band members took a month off from touring and did not interact with each other during that period. Moakes felt that there were no rules when the band re-assembled for studio work. Chief lyricist Okereke completed most of the songwriting before the recording process.|$|E

500|$|The sleeve artwork for Achtung Baby was {{designed}} by Steve Averill, who had created the majority of U2's album covers, along with Shaughn McGrath. To parallel the band's change in musical direction, Averill and McGrath devised sleeve concepts that used multiple colour images to contrast with {{the seriousness of the}} individual, mostly monochromatic images from previous U2 album sleeves. Rough sketches and designs were created early during the recording sessions, and some experimental designs were conceived to closely resemble, as Averill put it, [...] "dance-music oriented sleeves. We just did them to show how extreme <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> and then everyone came back to levels that they were happy with. But if we hadn't gone to these extremes {{it may not have been}} the cover it is now." ...|$|E
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
500|$|Development of Perfect Dark Zero {{began on}} the Nintendo GameCube with a very small team of roughly ten people. At the time, Nintendo had a 49% stake in Rare, making the company a Nintendo second-party developer. According to lead {{designer}} Chris Tilston, [...] "It was basically prototyping, finding out where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> and how we could get there." [...] When Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002, the project {{was transferred to the}} Xbox console and the game's multiplayer mode was redesigned for online play. Tilston revealed that at one point they got to 50 players online simultaneously, but the graphics [...] "just couldn't handle it." [...] Since the initial version of the game pushed the original Xbox hardware [...] "pretty hard", the project was ultimately transferred to the Xbox successor, the Xbox 360. Tilston revealed that the original Xbox version was [...] "about 12 months away" [...] from completion when the shift occurred.|$|E

500|$|In October 2015, Smith {{was cast}} in the [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] of Masters for the second season, having previously worked with Butters and Fazekas on their television series Resurrection. Though the executive producers never thought {{that they would be}} able to get Smith for the series, they developed and wrote Masters with the actor in mind. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The nice thing about that is <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> both ways on it. Maybe we never see him again or maybe we see him again and by the way he's full of Zero Matter now. The last thing you saw was Whitney Zero Mattering him and then getting interrupted. But it's still in him. Either way, we wanted to keep our options open." ...|$|E
500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason}} that when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> in that direction," [...] {{the countess}} agreed; [...] "but I have thought often, Magdalene, {{that we may}} {{possibly}} make our way down to Ostend. Things are much quieter on that line." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{nervous system}} is quite shaken," [...] said the duchess. [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> all <b>go</b> to Brentham. I {{mentioned}} it to Corisande this morning, and I {{was surprised to find}} that she wished to remain in town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{was here}} {{before there was}} quite a rabbit run {{on the other side of}} the cedars behind this bungalow," [...] {{declared}} Gif. [...] "It isn't a long way off. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>go</b> that distance even through the snow." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{next season}} Villa {{did not start}} well {{and they were in}} mid-table at Christmas {{although}} the club was still in the European Cup. In the first round Villa beat Valur 70 on aggregate. In the second round they scored twice at Dynamo Berlin to achieve a 22 draw, which saw them go through due to the away goals rule. These victories were in contrast to their poor performance in the league. By February 1982, the club were lying 19th in the First Division and Saunders resigned. It was later disclosed that the then chairman, Ron Bendall, had offered him a revised, shorter term, contract, which he had refused to accept. Saunders' assistant Tony Barton was promoted in his place. When Barton took over, although Villa were in a poor league position, they were in the quarter-final of the European Cup. In the quarter-finals, they beat Dynamo Kiev over two legs. Gordon Cowans is quoted as saying, [...] "Once we got past Dynamo Kiev we began thinking <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> all the way." [...] In the semi-final, they played Anderlecht over two legs, with Tony Morley scoring to secure Aston Villa's place in the final.|$|E
500|$|In the 1993–94 season, Arsenal contested in the European Cup Winners' Cup, {{having won}} the 1993 FA Cup Final. The club beat Odense BK and Standard Liège {{to reach the}} quarter-finals, with the latter {{described}} as a [...] "breathtaking performance" [...] by Graham, after winning 7–0 at the Stade Maurice Dufrasne. Arsenal defeated Torino of Italy and French representative Paris Saint-Germain to reach the 1994 European Cup Winners' Cup Final alongside Parma, staged at Copenhagen. Without top goalscorer Ian Wright and markers John Jensen and Martin Keown, Arsenal went into the final as outsiders. Although Parma began the match the strongest of both teams, Arsenal opened the scoring through a well taken volley by striker Alan Smith. Defending in numbers, the team held on to record an improbable victory and win the club's second European trophy, after a 24-year wait. After the match Graham praised his team's performance and defended his pragmatic approach; [...] "Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> forward {{a little bit more}} and entertain a bit more, but we play to our strengths, like we did in this match. There's nothing wrong with having a very, very good defence, believe me. We've proved it, and it's a big plus." ...|$|E
500|$|Reyes {{said that}} the album was written solely for [...] "fun {{and the love of}} music, no expectations." [...] Their lyrics were {{inspired}} by personal experience. Nolan and Lazzara had a concept where some of the lyrics could be read [...] "like a play where one line is the boy and the next line is the girl ... Sometimes when you read the lyrics it's a little boring and it's more interesting this way". About half their song titles, according to Nolan, came from [...] "sitting around late at night watching TV". The title of [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)" [...] came when a friend of the band said that someone he knew was [...] "cut from the team". [...] "Great Romances of the 20th Century" [...] includes an audio sample from the film, Beautiful Girls (1996). Lazzara said [...] "The Blue Channel" [...] and [...] "Head Club" [...] were songs that the band used [...] "to get enough songs to fill a record so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on tour". The album's sound would later be described as emo. Around this time, Taking Back Sunday was influenced by emo bands the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{won in the}} [...] "Best Single Episode" [...] {{category}} at the 2010 British Soap Awards, and {{was nominated}} in the [...] "Best Live Event Coverage" [...] category of the Broadcast Digital Awards 2010. It received mixed reviews from critics. Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent rated [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] 4 out of 5, noting that there were [...] "a couple of moments where the seams showed", but that [...] "half the fun in watching was seeing if you could spot them". He praised EastEnders for not [...] "playing safe" [...] by including stunt work, and commented that Ian Beale's line: [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back and do it all again. Do it right this time." [...] could potentially have been [...] "a horrible hostage to fortune", however felt that: [...] "in the end they more than got away with it." [...] Tim Teeman of The Times also rated the episode 4 out of 5, calling the revelation of Stacey as Archie's killer a [...] "genuine surprise", and commenting that [...] "EastEnders Live": [...] "sometimes creaked {{under the weight of}} its own ambitions – but who cares, gold stars for effort." [...] Teeman praised Clements and Turner, feeling that they [...] "excelled themselves despite the odd strained pause", though noted that in the aftermath of Bradley's fall, [...] "the perils of live TV became apparent", commenting that: [...] "The direction slackened at just the wrong moment, and you were left hoping someone would get to a bit of script to ward off any more bizarre shots of Jack and Max fighting to free themselves from a policeman's soft grip." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{also makes}} {{substantial}} use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect {{to accentuate the}} lack of control that humanity as individuals possesses. Often at each stage of his life there is a scene where Nemo {{is subject to the}} whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack all control. This is a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, it is why the smoke never goes back into the cigarette, time is always moving in one direction. [...] At the end when it assumes that the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts, and it begins to reverse. Thus signalling the absolute freedom Nemo had been seeking – being able to live a life without choice, for while you never choose all things remain possible. The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choice and what would happen if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back and change them. In the reveal Mr. Nobody age 118 states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made has just as much significance as any alternate choice. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, to the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width and time), and to the imagination of our former selves. And once the boy Nemo knows the outcomes of either choice, he instinctively opts for another.|$|E
2500|$|Tolstoy {{rejected}} some ecclesiastical teachings, {{calling them}} the [...] "church's argo" [...] and believed in God as a [...] "higher being" [...] and cosmic mind. [...] "I believe God {{gave us the}} power of emotion so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> further than our mind leads us. As a leading force, human emotion is preferable to a thought, just as music is more perfect than a spoken word," [...] he wrote.|$|E
