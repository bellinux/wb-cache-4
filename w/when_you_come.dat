The lyrics deal with a man, who is [...] "unable to escape the brutal realities of the blues", and has been compared with Paul Robeson's [...] "Ole Man River". [...] "Respect" [...] was inspired by a quote of drummer Al Jackson, Jr., who allegedly said to Redding after a tour, [...] "What are you griping about? You're on the road all the time.

Her act was cut from two songs to just one—"Invitation to the Blues"—because of a surprise appearance from Dolly Parton. McEntire was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on January 17, 1986.

500|$|A 2006 study titled An Empirical Analysis of [...] "Acting White" [...] by Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University and Paul Torelli {{suggested}} that the phenomenon probably had little to no effect on students achieving at average levels, but might explain {{a significant role in}} the disparities between black and white students at high achievement levels. Fryer has also written that, in contrast to Fordham and Ogbu's theory, [...] "acting white" [...] prejudices are actually more common the more integrated the school, with historically black schools free of any effects. He found that groups such as Italian immigrants in Boston’s West End and the Maori of New Zealand display similar behaviors. He concluded that there is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.|$|E

500|$|Palmerston died in 1865, {{and after}} a brief {{ministry}} led by Russell, Derby returned to power. In 1866, Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament {{for the first time}} since Albert's death. The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. [...] "Everyone likes flattery," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel." [...] With the phrase [...] "we authors, Ma'am", he complimented her. Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were [...] "a public meeting rather than a woman".|$|E
500|$|... "Run the World" [...] is a midtempo {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and fifty-five seconds (3:55). It was cited by Shane Phoenix of Hot Spots as [...] "bringing back" [...] the old school feel of Lopez's single [...] "Jenny from the Block"; the [...] "feel and style that made 'The Girl from the Block' [...] so famous". The song {{contains}} [...] "nice drum synchs with a real throw back feel", that will [...] "get you tapping your foot and swaging back and forth". Although Lopez did not write the song herself, [...] "Run the World" [...] is based on her relationship with husband Marc Anthony. The song is about a [...] "type of love <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> together you make each other better". Lopez further stated that she believes that since her and Anthony have been together they have made each other better artists and better people — [...] "and that's when you can really run the world".|$|E
500|$|According to the drummer, Jackson, Redding wrote [...] "Respect", after a {{conversation}} they had {{during a break}} in the recording session, in which he told Redding: [...] "You're on the road all the time. All you can look for is a little respect <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> home." [...] An alternative story is told by Redding's friend and road manager, Earl [...] "Speedo" [...] Sims, who states that the song [...] "came from a group I was singing with", and that even though Redding rewrote it, [...] "a lot of the lyric was still there"; Sims adds: [...] "He told me I would get a credit, but I never did". [...] Sims also states that he sang the backing chorus of [...] "Hey hey hey". The song used for the fifth track, [...] "I've Been Loving You Too Long", had been previously recorded in mono with Booker T. Jones on piano and released as a single in April 1965, becoming a number-two hit on Billboards R chart; it was rerecorded in stereo for the album.|$|E

500|$|The Parliamentary {{leader of}} the {{opposition}} Labour party, Harold Wilson, attacked the new Prime Minister as [...] "an elegant anachronism". He asserted that nobody from Douglas-Home's background knew of the problems of ordinary families. In particular, Wilson demanded to know how [...] "a scion of an effete establishment" [...] could lead the technological revolution that Wilson held to be necessary: [...] "This is the counter-revolution... After half a century of democratic advance, of social revolution, the whole process has ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl!" [...] Douglas-Home pooh-poohed this as inverted snobbery, and observed, [...] "I suppose Mr Wilson, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to think of it, is the fourteenth Mr Wilson." [...] He called Wilson [...] "this slick salesman of synthetic science" [...] and the Labour party [...] "the only relic of class consciousness in the country". The opposition retreated, with a statement in the press that [...] "The Labour Party is not interested {{in the fact that the}} new Prime Minister inherited a fourteenth Earldom– he cannot help his antecedents any more than the rest of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{initially}} {{curious about}} Disraeli {{when he entered}} Parliament in 1837, Victoria came to detest him over his treatment of Peel. Over time, her dislike softened, especially as Disraeli took pains to cultivate her. [...] He told Matthew Arnold, [...] "Everybody likes flattery; and, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to royalty, you should lay it on with a trowel". Disraeli's biographer, Adam Kirsch, suggests that Disraeli's obsequious treatment of his queen was part flattery, part belief that this was how a queen {{should be addressed by}} a loyal subject, and part awe that a middle-class man of Jewish birth should be the companion of a monarch. By the time of his second premiership, Disraeli had built a strong relationship with Victoria, probably closer to her than any of her Prime Ministers except her first, Lord Melbourne. When Disraeli returned as Prime Minister in 1874 and went to kiss hands, he did so literally, on one knee; and, according to Richard Aldous in his book on the rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone, [...] "for the next six years Victoria and Disraeli would exploit their closeness for mutual advantage." ...|$|E
500|$|At 32, Grant {{claimed to}} be on the brink of giving up the acting {{profession}} but was surprised by the script of Four Weddings and a Funeral (FWAAF). [...] "If you read as many bad scripts as I did, you'd know how grateful you are <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> across one where the guy actually is funny," [...] he later recalled. Released in 1994, FWAAF became the highest-grossing British film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of $244million, making Grant an overnight international star. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, and among numerous awards won by its cast and crew, it earned Grant his first and only Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It also temporarily typecast him as the lead character, Charles, a bohemian and debonair bachelor. Grant and Curtis saw it as an inside joke that the star, due to the parts he played, was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter, who is known for writing about himself and his own life.
