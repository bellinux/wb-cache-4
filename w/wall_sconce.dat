5000|$|Patch {{engraved}} himself twice, on {{one occasion}} his head {{is attached to the}} body of a bull, and he includes himself in several of his caricature groups. In his paintings in the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter and in the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven he is shown as a sculpted bust displayed on a <b>wall</b> <b>sconce</b> and in the twelve-foot long painting at the Lewis Walpole Library at Yale (another version is at Chatsworth, Derbyshire) of a party of Englishmen at Sir Horace's palazzo in Florence, [...] "The Golden Asses," [...] the artist sits astride the eponymous equine.|$|E
50|$|The main entrances {{provide access}} to {{vestibule}} areas, which are separated from the sanctuary by doors. The eastern vestibule has a hatch in the floor which provides access to the basement (which is otherwise only accessible from an outside doorway on the southeast side). The sanctuary is roughly square, with rows of bench pews divided by three aisles. At the northwest side of the sanctuary is a raised platform with a podium, settee, and chairs. Illumination is provided to the space by kerosene-fueled <b>wall</b> <b>sconce</b> fixtures, and by two ornate brass chandeliers with kerosene lamps covered by frosted globes. Heat is provided {{by a pair of}} wood stoves {{on the north side of}} the room.|$|E
50|$|To {{light the}} room, McKim hired Edward F. Caldwell & Co. of New York {{to design a}} new {{chandelier}} and <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> for the room. The chandelier design was copied from 18th-century English and French chandeliers, and cut glass {{was used for the}} chandelier and <b>wall</b> <b>sconces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dailey {{also created}} <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> for various {{locations}} around the Rainbow Room complex.|$|R

50|$|The 2001 Ghosts of the Abyss {{expedition}} {{attempted to}} gain {{entry to the}} À la Carte Restaurant, {{only to find that}} the aft end of A and B Decks in the seriously damaged stern section had collapsed upon one another. Relatively few artifacts have been recovered from the debris field that are identified with the À la Carte Restaurant. The most noteworthy is the door from a safe once contained in the Restaurant office which is displayed in various travelling exhibitions. Other pieces are a twisted gilt-brass light chandelier, a gilded <b>wall</b> <b>sconce,</b> and many intact pieces from the Spode china dinner service believed to have been made for the Restaurant. In 2012 a paper menu pad from the restaurant was displayed with the traveling Titanic exhibition in Las Vegas.|$|E
5000|$|The Headboard - After {{being taught}} {{how to do a}} headboard, {{complete}} with buttons, the contestants must build one for their rooms. Tex, Dez, and Charmaine eschews the foam-padded headboard that was taught for a wooden one. Joe fails due to not having any buttons (which will cause the fabric to wilt). Casey also fails due to his headboard lacking a wood backing (the wood instead being merely glued on). Dez's surfboard headboard fails also {{due to a lack of}} padding (thinking it unnecessary), and some sharp edges. Tex's simple rope and wood headboard fails due to mounting his headboard over his <b>wall</b> <b>sconce</b> plug, thus removing the ability to unplug the light. Charmaine's ambitious [...] "musical sign" [...] headboard also fails as she runs out of time.|$|E
50|$|Wall Sconces - The contestants must {{install a}} <b>wall</b> <b>sconce</b> {{which uses a}} halogen bulb and stick-on wiring (designed so as to stick on a wall and be hidden behind a coat of plaster). The kit also comes with written {{instructions}} (used by Tex) and instructions on DVD (for everyone else). Tex intends to hang his light on his mirrors, but the outlet is dead {{and he has to}} wire under his mirrors and over some wainscotting. Reluctantly, he moves his light, but he manages to pass after much effort (and mismeasuring the wire three times). Dez manages to pass, though his wiring needs extensive covering as his walls is covered with textured plaster, while Charmaine needs the help of both Jennie and Tiina in installing the lightbulb to pass. Casey fails after hanging his sconce upside-down. Joe cuts off the grounding pin to his light, and installs his wires backwards. He also refuses to screw in a lightbulb (getting Rita and Dez to screw it for him), due to his fear of electrocution. Predictably, he fails.|$|E
50|$|The {{room was}} {{electrified}} in 1891, {{which included the}} installation of bronze <b>wall</b> <b>sconces.</b> By 1901, 40 dining room chairs were moved from the Family Dining Room to the State Dining Room.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls are}} burled {{mahogany}} with ceramic trim. The mantel {{is made of}} imported marble. An Aubosson carpet (since replaced) complemented the paneled walls. The crystal chandeliers and <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> were made in Czechoslovakia.|$|R
50|$|Carl Lopp's hired {{caretaker}} of {{the house}} was charged with felony theft on August 15, 1996 for stealing 30 thousand dollars worth of artifacts from the house, including a tractor, dress, chandelier, copper from the furnace, and <b>wall</b> <b>sconces.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Di Prima {{describes}} Herko’s elegiac performance For Sergio: “He {{arrived in}} black tights and a leotard, with a fierce archaic face mask painted on his face, and whispered {{to us to}} kill all the lights: house lights, stage lights, everything. I noticed he was in toe shoes. Then I stood silent, in awe of {{what was about to}} happen — something sacred and diabolical all at once. Freddie had an antique <b>wall</b> <b>sconce</b> with a mirror, the kind that used to hold a candle, and he lit the taper he had placed in it. And in that dark and suddenly silent theatre with his back to the audience, he began laboriously and slowly to go down one side aisle of the theatre, across the front below the proscenium, and up the other side. En pointe. The only music was the sound of his deliberately exaggerated and labored breathing. And the slow scraping of his toe shoes on the rough floor. The light, the flickering light of the candle reflected his painted face in the mirror in his hand ... He was gone again before any of us could move.” ...|$|E

50|$|Dailey {{was invited}} to work as an {{independent}} artist by Waterford Crystal, Kilbarry, Ireland, in 1998. Dailey visited three times between 1998-1999 to create chandeliers, <b>wall</b> <b>sconces,</b> and seven engraved vases, using particular processes unique to the history and specialty of Waterford Crystal.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} design embodies the Art Deco and Moderne styles. The exterior {{is faced with}} Crab Orchard stone laid in patterns characteristic of Art Deco.

40|$|Stiff black banquettes {{around a}} coffee table, wall hanging (tree of life type), a plant, and a <b>wall</b> <b>sconce</b> {{complete}} the decoration. Biographical Note: Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic) in 1896, Norbert Troller {{served as a}} soldier in World War I, spending time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno.

Pews are simple, {{supported}} by gently curved solid end panels. Light {{is provided by}} a centrally located iron chandelier, supplemented by four hanging lanterns, <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> and decorative fixtures on the bimah and ark platform.|$|R
25|$|Jackson also {{purchased}} three cut-glass chandeliers {{to light}} the room. Each chandelier, which featured 18 whale oil lamps, {{hung from the ceiling}} medallions and were complimented with whale oil <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> and table lamps. There were also 20 spittoons. His expenditures totaled $9,358.27, provided by a friendly Congress eager to make the White House a more elegant symbol of the nation.|$|R
50|$|Doors in {{the corners}} open into side aisles that lead {{all the way to}} the {{elevated}} pulpit, past white pews with walnut railings. More walnut railings and white balusters extend across the front of the platform. A long recessed arch is behind it.

50|$|The {{district}} courtroom on {{the second}} floor is another important space. Its walls have dark green marble bases below mahogany wall panels with walnut burl inlay. Ornate bronze grilles and <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> are original features. The ornamental plaster cornice transitions into a plaster coffered ceiling with alternating octagonal and square designs that have been painted in a polychromatic color scheme.|$|R
50|$|A {{common form}} of home task {{lighting}} is a goose-neck lamp or swing arm light fixture. The adjustable neck allows light {{to be focused on}} the exact task needed, and the swing-arm <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> can be positioned next to a bed or chair, and adjusted to shine light on a printed page. Free standing, adjustable desk lamps are commonly used in home office applications.|$|R
2500|$|Conger {{also added}} several major pieces by Scottish-born New York cabinetmaker Duncan Phyfe. They include {{a pair of}} work tables, side chairs with scroll arms, two card tables, {{and a pair of}} window benches.

On the west wall above a Duncan Phyfe sofa, Conger hung a pair of gilded girandole [...] "bullseye" [...] <b>wall</b> <b>sconces.</b>|$|R
50|$|All of {{the rock}} {{that was used to}} build the castle was quarried on site, and transported the short {{distance}} across the property on a small railroad, which was built solely for this purpose. All of the woodwork throughout the building of the castle was brought in from Italy. All of the wrought iron chandeliers, lamps, and <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> were made in Danbury by Cephas B. Rogers Co.|$|R
50|$|Accent {{lighting}} focuses {{light on}} a particular area or object. It {{is often used to}} highlight art or other artifacts. Common types of accent lights include <b>wall</b> <b>sconces,</b> floodlights, recessed lights, torchère lamps, or track lighting. The brighter light from the accent lamp creates visual interest to a room. Accent lights may also be used to shine {{light on a}} stairway, or as in movie theaters, light a walkway.|$|R
50|$|The building's {{interior}} exhibits Art Moderne and Art Deco finishes and detailing. The lobbies and corridors have {{marble and}} plaster walls, geometrically patterned terrazzo floors, and plaster ceilings with white bronze molding. The ceremonial courtroom is a double-height chamber with wall paneling of light bookmatched wood set in darker wood squares and a coffered plaster ceiling. Light fixtures range from white-bronze-and-glass chandeliers to <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> with Art Deco detailing.|$|R
50|$|The ceiling has coves on {{adjacent}} {{walls to}} improve the sanctuary's acoustics, {{to the point that}} local community concerts are often held at South Granville despite the presence of larger churches in the region. Five brass chandeliers provide light, along with <b>wall</b> <b>sconces.</b> The window behind the choir is filled with a stained glass depiction of the church; the other windows have colored glass framing stippled glass panes.|$|R

25|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{itself is}} painted off-white, with {{the stained glass}} windows, red carpeting, gilding and mahogany trim of the pews providing a contrast. Corinthian columns, creating lateral arcades, provide corbeled support to groin vaults. The arcading partially encloses the balcony. A simulated clerestory level is illuminated by the skylights supplemented by electric lighting in the original <b>wall</b> <b>sconces.</b> The <b>walls</b> themselves are plaster on lath with beaded wainscoting ending in a chair rail.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, a $7 million {{restoration}} and seismic retrofitting was undertaken by developer Ira Yellin and project architect Brenda Levin Associates. As {{part of the}} restoration, a storage area {{at the south end}} of the building was converted to a new rear entrance portico, connecting the building more directly to Biddy Mason Park and the adjacent Broadway Spring Center parking garage. The building's lighting system was also redesigned, bringing in alabaster <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> from Spain.|$|R
50|$|Another form of sculptural {{art that}} uses bronze is ormolu, a finely cast soft bronze that is gilded (coated with gold) {{to produce a}} matte gold finish. Ormolu was popularized in the 18th century in France and is found in such forms as <b>wall</b> <b>sconces</b> (wall-mounted candle holders), inkstands, clocks and garnitures. Ormolu wares can be {{identified}} by a clear ring when tapped, showing that they are made of bronze, not a cheaper alloy such as spelter or pewter.|$|R
