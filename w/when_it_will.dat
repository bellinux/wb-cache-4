5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{inclination}} of its orbit, Eris only passes through a few constellations of the traditional Zodiac; it {{is now in the}} constellation Cetus. It was in Sculptor from 1876 until 1929 and Phoenix from roughly 1840 until 1875. In 2036 it will enter Pisces and stay there until 2065, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> enter Aries. It will then move into the northern sky, entering Perseus in 2128 and Camelopardalis (where it will reach its northernmost declination) in 2173.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{gameplay}} of Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth comprises unarmed {{escape and}} evasion together with investigative exploration, although first-person shooter (FPS) style combat is introduced later on. As with most survival horror video games, ammunition is limited {{and must be}} conserved carefully for situations <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> really be indispensable, occasionally requiring the player to avoid combat even when armed. The game {{as a whole is}} heavily scripted and very linear, with only one path through the chapters from start to finish, in contrast with some earlier survival horror games such as the original Alone in the Dark (which itself was inspired by the Mythos).|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} 105.5, 8, 121.5 and 8 years {{is not the}} only pattern that is {{possible}} within the 243-year cycle, because of the slight mismatch between the times when the Earth and Venus arrive at the point of conjunction. Prior to 1518, the pattern of transits was 8, 113.5 and 121.5 years, and the eight inter-transit gaps before the AD 546 transit were 121.5 years apart. The current pattern will continue until 2846, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be replaced by a pattern of 105.5, 129.5 and 8 years. Thus, the 243-year cycle is relatively stable, but the number of transits and their timing within the cycle will vary over time. Since the 243:395 Earth:Venus commensurability is only approximate, there are different sequences of transits occurring 243 years apart, each extending for several thousand years, which are eventually replaced by other sequences. For instance, there is a series which ended in 541 BC, and the series which includes 2117 only started in AD 1631.|$|E

25|$|Rav Kook wrote rulings {{presenting}} {{his strong}} opposition to people ascending the Temple Mount, {{due to the}} Jewish Laws of impurity.

However, he was very careful to express the fact that the Wailing Wall and the Temple Mount were holy sites which belong to the Jews. Rav Kook also opposed the secular spirit of the Hatikvah anthem, and penned another anthem with a more religious theme entitled haEmunah.|$|E

Warlock allies with Pip the Troll, the assassin Gamora, and Gamora's employer and adoptive father, Thanos of Titan, to oppose the Magus. Eventually, Warlock discovers that the Magus is a future version of himself who traveled back in time after being driven insane {{by the use of}} his Soul Gem. Warlock chooses to alter his timeline by visiting himself a few months into the future and steals his own soul to prevent the Magus from ever existing. Warlock then continues his journeys, knowing he has seen his own death but not knowing exactly <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> happen.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, No.33 Squadron had been {{transferred}} to the recently re-established No.84 Wing, and AMTDU to No.85 Wing, while the Base Support Wing had been superseded by Combat Support Unit Richmond. No.36 Squadron, having transferred its C-130Hs to No.37 Squadron and re-equipped with the C-17 Globemaster, relocated to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in November 2006. The RAAF's DHC-4 Caribous, which had been operated for some years by No.38 Squadron out of RAAF Base Townsville, were retired {{at the end of}} 2009, to be replaced by Super King Airs built by Hawker Pacific. No.37 Squadron was transferred from No.86 Wing to No.84 Wing on 1October 2010. In January 2013, No.35 Squadron was re-formed at Richmond, under the control of No. 84 Wing. Initially a cadre, the squadron will expand to approximately 250 personnel by 2015, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> begin operating the RAAF's ten C-27J Spartan transport aircraft.|$|E

25|$|This {{reflects}} {{the idea that}} workers {{have a vested interest}} in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.|$|E
25|$|Parker and Stone {{continue}} to write, direct, and voice most characters on South Park. Over time, {{the show has}} adopted a unique production process, in which an entire episode is written, animated and broadcast in one week. Parker and Stone state that subjecting themselves to a one-week deadline creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a funnier show. Although initial reviews for the show were negative in reference to its crass humor, the series has received numerous accolades, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, and numerous inclusions in various publications' lists of greatest television shows. Though its viewership is lower than {{it was at the}} height of its popularity in its earliest seasons, South Park remains one of the highest-rated series on Comedy Central. In 2012, South Park cut back from producing 14 episodes per year (seven in the spring and seven in the fall) to a single run of 10 episodes in the fall, to allow the duo to explore other projects the rest of the year. The show is currently renewed through 2019, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> reach its twenty-third season.|$|E

500|$|When Balzac was {{exhibited}} in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising. The Société rejected the work, {{and the press}} ran parodies.
