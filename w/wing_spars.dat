5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45Â°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{recovery}} of the Akutan Zero, technical information from three other downed Zeros was available to the Allies. One Zero (serial number 5349), piloted by Hajime Toyoshima, crashed on Melville Island in Australia following the bombing of Darwin. The Zero was heavily damaged, and Toyoshima became Australia's first Japanese prisoner of the Pacific war. Another Zero, piloted by Yoshimitsu Maeda, crashed near Cape Rodney, New Guinea. The team sent to recover the plane erred when they chopped off the wings, severing the <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> and rendering the hulk unflyable. The third came from China, where Gerhard Neumann was able to reconstruct a working Zero. He used a partly intact Zero (serial number 3372) that had landed in Chinese territory, repaired with salvaged pieces from other downed Zeros. However, bad conditions and the long delivery time from China prevented Neumann's Zero from reaching the United States for testing until after the {{recovery of the}} Akutan Zero.|$|E
5|$|To {{produce the}} 767, Boeing formed {{a network of}} {{subcontractors}} which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of <b>wing</b> <b>spars,</b> the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.|$|E

25|$|Baumann was {{an early}} expert in {{light-weight}} construction techniques and placed the four engines in nacelles mounted between {{the upper and lower}} wing decks to distribute the loads to save weight in the <b>wing</b> <b>spars.</b>|$|E
25|$|Part of the Discovery weight {{optimizations}} {{included the}} {{greater use of}} quilted AFRSI blankets rather than the white LRSI tiles on the fuselage, {{and the use of}} graphite epoxy instead of aluminum for the payload bay doors and some of the <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> and beams.|$|E
25|$|The {{airworthiness}} {{design requirements}} {{applicable to the}} Vickers Viscount and other safe-life transport category aeroplanes did not require retirement lives to be determined taking account of an unpredictable gross defect of the kind inflicted on the wing spar of VH-RMQ by insertion of the flared bush. Similarly, the airworthiness maintenance requirements did not require periodic inspection for fatigue cracking of the <b>wing</b> <b>spars.</b>|$|E

25|$|Items were {{substituted}} with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer to {{make the}} aircraft lighter than a Kitfox Lite. This included the tailwheel leaf spring, <b>wing</b> <b>spars,</b> wing ribs (aluminum on later kits), lift struts, firewall, elevator and fuel tank. A variety of engines may be used such as the Hirth F33, Hirth F-23, Zanzottera MZ 34, 1/2 Volkswagen air-cooled engine and the Zanzottera MZ 201.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of metal}} for {{airframe}} construction {{was by no}} means uncommon: Robert Esnault-Pelterie used steel tubing to construct the fuselage of his aircraft as early as 1907, and Louis Breguet was another notable pioneer of metal construction, using steel channel sections for fuselage construction, steel tube for <b>wing</b> <b>spars,</b> pressed aluminium for wing ribs and aluminium sheeting for fuselage covering - this would not be improved upon until the second half of 1915.|$|E
25|$|The CCW-5 {{accommodated}} five persons, and {{its power}} plants are {{suspended in the}} centre of the 6ft-chord wing channels on tubular frameworks attached to the <b>wing</b> <b>spars.</b> The aircraft draws air through the channels at high velocity, decreasing pressure over the wings and increasing lift. The CCW-5 was claimed to be capable of flying at a sustained speed of 35mph. Production deliveries were scheduled to commence during 1965, but this was never achieved.|$|E

25|$|The Gipsy powered P-1 and P-2 {{were also}} known as the Pander-Gipsy and the Pander Supersport. The two almost {{identical}} aircraft were parasol monoplanes. The wing was slightly tapered with rounded wing tips, mounted over the fuselage by a pair of parallel struts on each side from the forward and aft <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> to the lower fuselage longerons. Centrally, over the fuselage, wing support was provided by four forward and two aft cabane struts.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, WACO Classic Aircraft {{announced}} that it will put the Great Lakes Model 2T-1A-1/2 model biplane back into production. The aircraft had not been available since 1980. The aircraft will incorporate several changes including metal <b>wing</b> <b>spars.</b> It will be offered in two models, a touring model, with a Lycoming IO-360-B1F6 engine and a higher-performance sport model, with a Lycoming AEIO-360-B1G6 engine. Work on the new production model was completed in June 2013 and the base price announced as US$245,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{constant}} chord wings were gimbal mounted {{to the lower}} fuselage, with pairs of streamlined compression struts from about 30% span to the upper fuselage just ahead of each cockpit. The <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> were duralumin structures, though {{the first of the}} two Mussels had spruce ribs. The wing section was the untried, thick RAF 33. The wings and empennage were fabric covered; the fin and unbalanced rudder had a shape not unlike the de Haviiland vertical tail and the horizontal tail was externally braced from below.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a mid-wing open cockpit taildragger. The landing gear was attached by struts {{to both the}} fuselage, and the <b>wing</b> <b>spar.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{low-speed}} concept {{allowed the}} design {{to dispense with}} several features normally found on jet aircraft, notably the sweptback wing. By using a conventional rectangular wing the high-speed drag was greatly increased (see wave drag) but the low-speed lift was likewise greatly increased. Further, the rectangular planform allowed the twin <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> to be single pieces, {{and all of the}} engines, landing gear and cargo could be attached directly to the spar. With a swept wing this would place considerable torque loads on the point where the wings met the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|About 5,000 of {{the total}} of 7,781 Mosquitos built had major {{structural}} components fabricated from wood in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England. Fuselages, wings and tailplanes were made at furniture companies such as Ronson, E. Gomme, Parker Knoll, Austinsuite and Styles & Mealing.Wing spars were made by J. B. Heath and Dancer & Hearne. Many of the other parts, including flaps, flap shrouds, fins, leading edge assemblies and bomb doors were also produced in the Buckinghamshire town. Dancer & Hearne processed much of the wood from start to finish, receiving timber and transforming it into finished <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> at their factory {{on the outskirts of}} High Wycombe.|$|E
25|$|The Diamond DA42 Twin Star is twin-engined low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane, {{commonly used}} as a general aviation aircraft for touring and training purposes. It {{is equipped with a}} retractable tricycle landing gear arrangement and uses a T-tail. The DA42 incorporates a combination of advanced features within the company's first twin-engine design. The airframe is composed from composite materials, making extensive use of carbon fiber reinforced polymers throughout its structure; this construction provides the aircraft with a suitable passive safety level to conform with the established European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Part 21 rules, as well as relatively efficient aerodynamics and essentially unlimited airframe life. The carbon-fiber main <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> possesses exceptional crashworthiness.|$|E

25|$|Jack Riley Sr. {{built the}} first model {{with a team of}} four. With {{encouragement}} from Lycoming, the 125hp Lycoming O-290 four-cylinder engine was selected for the project. Design changes from the basic Navion structure included strengthened <b>wing</b> <b>spars,</b> that supported engine mounts and other components from Piper PA-18 Super Cub, plus new engine nacelles, a faired nose section that replaced the existing engine and cowling, and a new vertical tail and rudder based on the existing horizontal stabilizer. During testing in 1952, the aircraft was initially named the X-16 Bi-Navion. On 10 November 1952, it was granted certification by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), after which it was renamed as the D-16 Twin Navion.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the crash investigation, Fokker improved quality control on the production line, particularly varnishing of the <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> and ribs, to combat moisture. Fokker also strengthened the rib structures and the attachment of the auxiliary spars to the ribs. Existing triplanes were repaired and modified at Fokker's expense. After testing a modified wing at Adlershof, Idflieg authorized the triplane's return to service on 28 November 1917. Production resumed in early December. By January 1918, Jastas 6 and 11 were fully equipped with the triplane. Only 14 squadrons used the Dr.I as their primary equipment. Most of these units were part of Jagdgeschwadern I, II, or III. Frontline inventory peaked in late April 1918, with 171 aircraft in service on the Western Front.|$|E
25|$|The ST {{featured}} two open cockpits {{in tandem}} {{in a metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage of two main frames â one steel, {{the other half of}} steel and half of aluminium alloy (alclad) â to take the loads from the <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> and six more alclad frames; and alclad skin. It had wings in three sections of hybrid construction; the center section integral with the fuselage had tubular steel spars, the front spar a simple tube with an external brace to the upper fuselage, and the rear spar {{in the form of a}} parallel chord truss. The two outer wing panels had wooden spars and alclad ribs, with diagonal rods bracing the wings internally. Alclad sheet was used to form the leading edges, and fabric covered the whole structure. When attached, the outer wings were braced with flying wires to the fixed conventional landing gear and landing wires to the upper fuselage.|$|E
