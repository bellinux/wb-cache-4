5|$|In 1111, Domnall evidently {{seized the}} kingship of the Isles by force. It is {{uncertain}} whether he enjoyed Uí Briain support in this venture. Several years later, {{at a time}} when his aforesaid uncle was gravely ill, Domnall was again active in Ireland. Although he may have openly left the Isles to take advantage of his uncle's demise, it is also possible he <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> by the Islesmen. Domnall was slain in 1115, apparently at the hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. It is possible that he was survived by two sons.|$|E

5|$|In the 1997–98 season, Gunn <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> of the Norwich team by the {{emergence}} of Andy Marshall. With his first-team opportunities at Norwich now limited, he signed a deal with Hibernian in February 1998, for a three-month loan.

5|$|Soviet dissidents {{and human}} rights groups were {{routinely}} repressed by the KGB. Overall, political repression tightened during the Brezhnev era and Stalin experienced a partial rehabilitation. The two leading figures in the Soviet dissident movement during the Brezhnev Era were Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov. Despite their individual fame and widespread sympathy in the West, they attracted little support from {{the mass of the}} population. Sakharov was forced into internal exile in 1979, and Solzhenitsyn <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> of the country in 1974.|$|E

5|$|A French-aligned Haitian general, André Rigaud, had {{instructed}} his forces to attack all foreign shipping within their range of operations. Accordingly, once Experiment and her convoy of merchant ships neared Gonâve, the picaroons attacked them, capturing {{two of the}} American merchant ships before withdrawing. Experiment managed to save the other two ships in her convoy, and escorted them to a friendly port. On the American side, only {{the captain of the}} schooner Mary was killed. Though the picaroons took heavy losses during this engagement, they remained strong enough to continue wreaking havoc among American shipping in the region. Only after Rigaud <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> of power by the forces of Toussaint L'Ouverture, leader of the 1791 Haitian Revolution, did the picaroon attacks cease.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, {{the rival}} Obrenović dynasty seized {{power in the}} country and forced Prince Alexander Karađorđević into exile.

Cochet and Tilden were on the same half of the draw and it set up a {{semifinal}} clash which Cochet <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> of the tournament in five sets. He and Ramillon had a shot at the doubles title but they came short against pro newcomer Don Budge and veteran Ellsworth Vines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of Richard's reign, the {{pressures}} mounted on Walter. Conflicts between his ecclesiastical duties {{and his government}} duties made him the target of criticism from both sides. A dispute in December 1197, over Richard's demand that the magnates of England provide 300knights to serve in France, led to renewed grumbling among the clergy and barons. Richard was also dissatisfied {{with the results of}} the carucage in 1198, so Walter resigned his position of chief justiciar on 11 July of that year. Walter may have resigned willingly, as he had talked of resigning his secular duties since 1194. Some medieval sources, however, stated that he <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> of office by the king.|$|E
