40|$|This {{article will}} examine the {{development}} of the early Quaker movement in England during the 1650 s, and by focusing on one north Lancashire parish, Cartmel, will seek to answer the question: <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>people</b> convert to a religious movement that undermined traditional communal worship, and which required a very public separation from one's neighbours? Disillusionment at the slow pace of religious reform, both nationally and locally, during the late 1640 s and early 1650 s will be highlighted as an explanation as to why a minority of inhabitants enduring a particular set of religious circumstances may have found Quakerism an attractive faith...|$|R

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study of}} white Texans' attitudes toward {{their role in the}} federal Union and their right to secede from it during the antebellum period. The central {{question}} of the study is <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>people</b> so strongly Unionist in 1846 became so strongly secessionist by 1861. In tracing this significant shift in Texans' sentiment, the author especially emphasizes the racial attitudes of white Texans, their emotional defense of the institution of slavery, and their strong conviction that the Negroes, if emancipated, would destroy white society. Of special importance to this study is the relationship of Texans' racial attitudes to their attitudes toward the Union...|$|R
60|$|During my lonely {{walks and}} rides through {{the country about}} our village, I began to cogitate and philosophize upon the present social value of the human ear. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>people</b> in society and in {{domestic}} circles have ears? I asked myself. They do not use them to listen to one another. And then I thought and pondered further, and suddenly the truth came to me: the ears of the present generation are not purveyors to the mind; they are merely agents of the tongue, who watch for breaks or weak places in the speech of others, in order that their principal may rush in and hold the field. They are jackals, who scent out a timid pause or an unsuspecting silence which the lion tongue straightway destroys. Very forcibly the conviction came to me that nowadays we listen only {{for an opportunity to}} speak.|$|E
60|$|We {{went up the}} Brenta one day as far as Oliero, {{to visit}} the famous cavern already mentioned, out of which, from the secret heart of the hill, gushes one of the foamy affluents of the river. It is reached by passing through a paper-mill, fed by the stream, and then through a sort of ante-grot, whence stepping-stones are laid in the brawling current through a {{succession}} of natural compartments with dome-like roofs. From the hill overhead hang stalactites of all grotesque and fairy shapes, and the rock underfoot is embroidered with fantastic designs wrought by {{the water in the}} silence and darkness of the endless night. At a considerable distance {{from the mouth of the}} cavern is a wide lake, with a boat upon it, and voyaging to the centre of the pool your attention is drawn to the dome above you, which contracts into a shaft rising upward to a height as yet unmeasured and even unpierced by light. From somewhere in its mysterious ascent, an auroral boy, with a tallow candle, produces a so-called effect of sunrise, and sheds a sad, disheartening radiance on the lake and the cavern sides, which is to sunlight about as the blind creatures of subterranean waters are to those of waves that laugh and dance above ground. But all caverns are much alike in their depressing and gloomy influences, and since there is so great opportunity to be wretched on the surface of the earth, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>people</b> visit them? I do not know that this is more dispiriting or its stream more Stygian than another.|$|E
6000|$|I {{wonder why}} {{metropolitan}} gales always blow so hard at Walworth. I cannot imagine what Walworth has done, to bring such windy punishment upon itself, as I never fail to find {{recorded in the}} newspapers when the wind has blown at all hard. Brixton seems to have something on its conscience; Peckham suffers more than a virtuous Peckham might be supposed to deserve; the howling neighbourhood of Deptford figures largely in the accounts of the ingenious gentlemen who are out in every wind that blows, and to whom it is an ill high wind that blows no good; but, there can hardly be any Walworth left by this time. It must surely be blown away. I have read of more chimney-stacks and house-copings coming down with terrific smashes at Walworth, and of more sacred edifices being nearly (not quite) blown out to sea from the same accursed locality, than I have read of practised thieves with the appearance and manners of gentlemen--a popular phenomenon which never existed on earth out of fiction and a police report. Again: I wonder why people are always blown into the Surrey Canal, and into no other piece of water! <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>people</b> get up early and go out in groups, to be blown into the Surrey Canal? Do they say to one another, 'Welcome death, so that {{we get into the}} newspapers'? Even that would be an insufficient explanation, because even then they might sometimes put themselves in the way of being blown into the Regent's Canal, instead of always saddling Surrey for the field. Some nameless policeman, too, is constantly, on the slightest provocation, getting himself blown into this same Surrey Canal. Will SIR RICHARD MAYNE see to it, and restrain that weak-minded and feeble-bodied constable? ...|$|E

60|$|As {{to whether}} there are really any fairies or not, that is a {{difficult}} question. Professor Huxley thinks there are none. The Editor never saw any himself, but he knows several people who have seen them--in the Highlands--and heard their music. If ever you are in Nether Lochaber, go to the Fairy Hill, and you may hear the music yourself, as grown-up people have done, but you must goon a fine day. Again, if there are really no fairies, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>people</b> believe in them, all over the world? The ancient Greeks believed, so did the old Egyptians, and the Hindoos, and the Red Indians, and is it likely, {{if there are no}} fairies, that so many different peoples would have seen and heard them? The Rev. Mr. Baring-Gould saw several fairies when he was a boy, and was travelling {{in the land of the}} Troubadours. For these reasons, the Editor thinks that there are certainly fairies, but they never do anyone any harm; and, in England, they have been frightened away by smoke and schoolmasters. As to Giants, they have died out, but real Dwarfs are common in the forests of Africa. Probably a good many stories not perfectly true have been told about fairies, but such stories have also been told about Napoleon, Claverhouse, Julius Caesar, and Joan of Arc, all of whom certainly existed. A wise child will, therefore, remember that, if he grows up and becomes a member of the Folk Lore Society, ALL the tales in this book were not offered to him as absolutely truthful, but were printed merely for his entertainment. The exact facts he can learn later, or he can leave them alone.|$|E
