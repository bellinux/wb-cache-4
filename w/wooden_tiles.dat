Each piece, a flat, <b>wooden</b> <b>tile</b> (known as troop tiles) has its {{movement}} options graphically portrayed on its two sides, giving it alternating movement options based upon {{which side of}} the piece is currently facing upwards.

Its floorpan encompassed what had previously been two corridors running along either side of the old hall, thereby making much better use of space. Furthermore, the old hall had no electricity supply or dressing-rooms, meaning that despite the short-term disruption, Bournemouth School now enjoys a larger and much better-equipped facility for assemblies, productions and other events.|$|R

A lot of material, that is completely functional, but is considered as too defect and therefore useless for wooded furniture factories, is grained down to dust and chippings to eventually getting burnt to ashes and stocked in piles. In this project, a <b>wooden</b> <b>tile</b> was designed and hand crafted from waste wood. The tile was created to use as a décor for floors and walls as well as ceilings and furniture. This to communicate the true life story of the wooden waste as well as to raise awareness of wood as a material and its possibilities in interior design...|$|R
50|$|Included in the 1929 {{building}} project was a chapel for campus worship. The original chapel was quite plain {{and did not}} contain any pews, musical instruments, art glass windows, or even a pulpit and altar. It {{was not until the}} 1930s that the chancel was decorated {{with the help of a}} local craftsman. For decades the chapel featured a small wooden altar, a pulpit, a lectern, <b>wooden</b> pews, <b>tile</b> floors, a Wick's organ, and three art glass windows behind the altar. Unfortunately, the low ceiling and small amount of natural light detracted greatly from the atmosphere.|$|R

Local artisans reconstructed <b>wooden</b> and <b>tile</b> roofs over the grand gallery and batteries using traditional carpentry methods, and consolidated the stone galleries of the fortress.

The lack of evidence for roofing materials, makes it likely that the roofs were covered with split <b>wooden</b> <b>tiles</b> or shingles.|$|E

Beginning with the Jesuit missionaries, who began to build churches out of local, {{accessible}} resources, Chiloé became known for its churches (Churches of Chiloé) that were made entirely of native timber in order to withstand the weather.

Some editions use logos that depict a dictionary entry about the term [...] "Wiktionary", {{based on the}} previous English Wiktionary logo, which was designed by Brion Vibber, a MediaWiki developer.

Some communities adopted the winning entry by [...] "Smurrayinchester", a 3×3 grid of <b>wooden</b> <b>tiles,</b> each bearing a character from a different writing system. However, the poll did not see as much participation from the Wiktionary community as some community members had hoped, and a number of the larger wikis ultimately kept their textual logos.|$|E
40|$|The author {{describes}} {{the theme of}} how great fires were instrumental {{in the creation of}} new urban developments in the early modern period. In Zagreb, for instance, very few buildings were made of fireproof materials. Most of the city’s buildings were made of timber and rooftops with wooden frames covered with <b>wooden</b> planks, <b>tiles,</b> or straw. The greatest fires in Zagreb communities occurred in the years 1624, 1645, 1674, 1706, and 1731. Threat of fire affected the spatial dispersion of the population and the construction of new streets with canals, which provided water for extinguishing fires. Due to a new building style which sought to use fireproof materials, cities established municipal brickyards. In order to have a fire alert system, cities also hired night watchmen, who appear in historical records as early as the seventeenth century...|$|R
