In early 1942, in a controversial move, the AAF Technical Training Command began leasing resort hotels and apartment buildings for large-scale training sites (accommodation for 90,000 existed in Miami Beach, Florida, alone). The leases were negotiated for the AAF by the Corps of Engineers, often to the economic detriment of hotel owners in rental rates, <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> <b>clauses,</b> <b>and</b> short-notice to terminate leases.|$|R

40|$|The {{peculiarity}} of {{the basic}} means of production, just as of all the instruments of labor, is that, {{taking part in the}} process of production during a lengthy period of time, they preserve their natural form up to the end of their productive life. Gradually they transfer their value to the newly manufactured produce, and consequently after each process of production their <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> increases <b>and</b> their remaining value decreases. The <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of basic means is not always proportional to their age, for it depends on the volume of work performed {{and a number of other}} facts. At the same time <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> {{of the basic}} means determines their efficiency, the time of their final quitting the ranks and the time for replacement. The data on the duration of <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> also are the basis for the determination of the norms of assignments for amortization and of the effectiveness of repairs, etc. All this shows the necessity of correctly calculating the <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of the basic means and its great significance for the national economy. ...|$|R

The principles described by reliability engineering (bathtub curve) were used to describe the process of accumulation of <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> as a function of time. For the typical type of paper representative of ~ 70 – 80  % of Western library and archival collections, we looked at the ‘random failure phase’ when material weakens, {{as well as at the}} ‘wear-out failure phase’ during which reduction in DP becomes so pronounced that <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> (mechanical failure) becomes increasingly likely.

40|$|<b>Wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> from tyres {{significantly}} {{contributes to}} the flow of (micro-) plastics into the environment. This paper compiles the fragmented knowledge on tyre <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> characteristics, amounts of particles emitted, pathways in the environment, and the possible effects on humans. The estimated per capita emission ranges from 0. 23 to 4. 7 kg/year, with a global average of 0. 81 kg/year. The emissions from car tyres (100 %) are substantially {{higher than those of}} other sources of microplastics, e. g., airplane tyres (2 %), artificial turf (12 – 50 %), brake <b>wear</b> (8 %) <b>and</b> road markings (5 %). Emissions and pathways depend on local factors like road type or sewage systems. The relative contribution of tyre <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> to the total global amount of plastics ending up in our oceans is estimated to be 5 – 10 %. In air, 3 – 7 % of the particulate matter (PM 2. 5) is estimated to consist of tyre <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> indicating that it may contribute to the global health burden of air pollution which has been projected by the World Health Organization (WHO) at 3 million deaths in 2012. The <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> also enters our food chain, but {{further research is needed to}} assess human health risks. It is concluded here that tyre <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> is a stealthy source of microplastics in our environment, which can only be addressed effectively if awareness increases, knowledge gaps on quantities and effects are being closed, and creative technical solutions are being sought. This requires a global effort from all stakeholders; consumers, regulators, industry and researchers alike...|$|R
