30|$|Silicon {{nanowires}} (SiNWs) attract significant {{attention because}} of their potential applications in many fields like sensors, transistors, lithium batteries, diodes, and photovoltaics [1 – 5]. Particularly, they can be applied on silicon solar cells as an antireflection coating, due to low average reflectance values [6, 7].

Among these synthesis methods, <b>wet</b> chemical <b>etching</b> has been frequently used to prepare SiNWs.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{a new way to}} micromachine h 111 i oriented plates on h 001 i silicon wafers by anisotropic <b>wet</b> chemical <b>etching.</b> The process involves double-sided wafer-processing. Precision alignment, however, is only required at one side. There are basically two ways to etch silicon: dry and <b>wet</b> chemical <b>etching.</b> In micromachining, the control of the shape of the structure is accomplished by anisotropic etching through mask openings. The anisotropy of <b>wet</b> chemical <b>etching</b> is related to the crystal structure of silicon, while that of dry etching stems from the momentum of ions impinging the substrate. The latter gives us much more freedom of design, however, the control of dry etching is much more cumbersome and the equipment much more expensive. Therefore, any new process trick {{to increase the number of}} geometries that can be obtained by <b>wet</b> chemical anisotropic <b>etching</b> is of interest. In this paper, techniques are demonstrated to etch thin f 111 g plates in h 100 i silicon. These plates can be used as building blocks in, for example, microfluidic systems for valves and pumps. All micromaching processes described in this paper are accomplished in 25 wt % KOH at 78 C. Figure 1. Cross-section of etch pits resulting from <b>wet</b> chemical anisotropic <b>etching</b> of h 001 i silicon. The dashed lines indicate planes, parallel to the walls of the large etch pit. If one is able to etch along these lines, h 111 i oriented plates can be fabricated. Figure 1 shows the typical etch pits which are obtained when etching h 001 i silicon. The etch pits are bounded by f 111 g planes. ...|$|R
