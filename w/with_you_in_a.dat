No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E
2500|$|April – The church {{published}} an extensive interview with Oaks and general authority Lance B. Wickman in April {{to clarify the}} church’s stance on homosexuality. In the interview, Wickman states that the church [...] "doesn't counsel against" [...] conversion therapy and that it [...] "may be appropriate" [...] for an individual to use clinical therapy to seek to diminish or eliminate homosexual feelings. However, Oaks states they [...] "can't endorse" [...] the [...] "aversive therapies" [...] recommended {{in the past to}} fix [...] "this affliction" [...] and they [...] "don’t accept responsibility for those abuses" [...] suffered by individuals who had experienced this now disavowed therapy method. On same-sex civil unions and domestic partnerships, Elder Oaks states that giving these couples the same government rights given to a man and woman marriage is [...] "not right" [...] and [...] "not appropriate". He added that a mixed-orientation marriage would be appropriate for a gay member who could [...] "deal with [...] feelings" [...] and [...] "put them in the background" [...] and felt a [...] "great attraction" [...] to someone of the opposite sex. They compared devout homosexual Mormons to those with physical or mental disabilities who will also not be able to marry, and adds that [...] "same-gender attraction did not exist in the pre-earth life and neither will it exist in the next life." [...] As far as family acceptance and inclusion of homosexual children they gave some example conversation lines like, [...] "don’t expect to stay overnight. Don’t expect to be a lengthy house guest. Don’t expect us to take you out and introduce you to our friends, or to deal <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public situation that would imply our approval of your 'partnership'." [...] He further stated [...] "the Lord’s way is to love the sinner while condemning the sin".|$|E
2500|$|The first {{promotion}} {{was considered}} to be very successful. Rosen noted that they considered the million-dollar goal as a best-case scenario, but once the sale actually started, [...] "it was immediately clear that we were on to something". Rosen would later attribute part of the success to Ars Technica writer Mike Thomspon, stating that he [...] "immediately saw the potential" [...] of the Bundle in an article written for the website just prior to the Bundle's sale period. Brandon Boyer of Boing Boing believed that it provided a model that [...] "seems it could and should be repeated". The move to offer games in a price and manner that consumers were willing to buy was contrasted to larger software publishers that place artificial limitations on their content; Mike Masnick of Techdirt believed the Humble Bundle promotion worked as it [...] "focus on giving people real reasons to buy, rather than just feeling entitled to define the terms under which they buy and looking for ways to limit those who want to interact <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different manner". The source for the promotion's website has been requested of Wolfire by several other groups, according to Rosen; Rosen continues to believe that many similar charitable sales {{can be seen in the}} future from the Humble Bundle's success. For future Bundles, Rosen desires to include lesser-known titles in contrast to World of Goo and Braid, but has had to already reject some developers' requests to be included in a Bundle, claiming the games' quality may tarnish the Humble Indie Bundle branding. Instead, he believes smaller games with no wide profile and are [...] "legitimately good" [...] would be ideal for inclusion in future Bundles.|$|E
