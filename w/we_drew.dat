25|$|The opening Test at Brisbane has {{a history}} of having {{important}} psychological effects on the teams. The four England teams before ours had all lost there. Even Len Hutton's eventually victorious side went down there by an innings. <b>We</b> <b>drew</b> the match and I believe this was the turning point of our tour. Nobody expected us to come out of it with our pride intact.|$|E

Not only the first game, because {{that could have been}} an accident – with the weather conditions etc. No, the performance we achieved in Liverpool under bad circumstances – I've never seen such a hectic situation. <b>We</b> <b>drew</b> that game 2–2 and never really had problems. For me, it was the proof that we were at the international level." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pest of the West" [...] is {{the first}} episode in the series that the crew used Wacom Cintiqs for the drawings, instead of pencils. Series {{background}} designer Kenny Pittenger said that [...] "the only real difference between the way we draw now and the way <b>we</b> <b>drew</b> then is that we abandoned pencil and paper during the fifth season." [...] The crew began the shift while {{they were working on}} the episode. Pittenger said that [...] "it was while we were working on 'Pest of the West', one of the half-hour specials, that we made the switch… did you notice?" [...] The shift to Wacom Cintiqs let the designers and animators draw on the computer screen and make immediate changes or undo mistakes. Pittenger said [...] "Many neo-Luddites—er… I mean, many of my cohorts—don't like working on them, but I find them useful. There's no substitute for the immediacy of drawing on a piece of paper, of course, but digital nautical nonsense is still pretty fun." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2008, {{the crew}} shifted to using Wacom Cintiqs for the {{drawings}} instead of pencils.

500|$|Visually, the animators were {{influenced}} by both traditional Chinese and Japanese artwork. In the specific case of Mulan, [...] "The characters' simple lines... resemble classic Asian painting", {{as demonstrated by the}} animators' innovate [...] "'less is more' approach" [...] to traditional animation. Chinese artist Chen Yi mentored the animators, [...] "helping [...] to come up with these designs." [...] Mark Henn served as Mulan's supervising animator. Animating the character in her male disguise as [...] "Ping" [...] offered an unprecedented challenge for Henn. In order to solve this unique dilemma, Henn was provided with [...] "the opportunity to... adjust her design a little bit so that when she was disguised as Ping, as a soldier, that she was physically a little different in how <b>we</b> <b>drew</b> her than when she was herself as Mulan." [...] Physically, Mulan was also designed to appear less feminine than preceding traditional Disney animated heroines, specifically Pocahontas from Pocahontas (1995) and Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), because [...] "you can't pass as a man in the army with a Barbie-style figure." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. While most episodes consisted of two shorts that were about eleven minutes long or specials that lasted the whole episode, certain episodes were made of one full eleven-minute episode, and two shorts, one of which was seven minutes long and the other only four minutes long. The animation was handled overseas in South Korea at Rough Draft Studios. Throughout the series run, from 1999 to 2008, SpongeBob SquarePants was drawn and animated using pencils. In 2008, the crew shifted and used Wacom Cintiqs for the drawings, instead of pencils. The episode [...] "Pest of the West" [...] was the first episode in the series that the crew used it.

2500|$|Gail Stevens came {{on board}} to oversee casting globally. Stevens had worked with Boyle {{throughout}} his career and was well known for discovering new talent. Meredith Tucker was appointed to cast out of the US. The film-makers then travelled to Mumbai in September 2007 with a partial crew and began hiring local cast and crew for production in Karjat. Originally appointed {{as one of the}} five casting directors in India, Loveleen Tandan has stated, [...] "I suggested to Danny and Simon Beaufoy, the writer of Slumdog, {{that it was important to}} do some of it in Hindi to bring the film alive [...] They asked me to pen the Hindi dialogues which I, of course, instantly agreed to do. And as <b>we</b> <b>drew</b> closer to the shoot date, Danny asked me to step in as the co-director." [...] Boyle then decided to translate nearly a third of the film's English dialogue into Hindi. The director fibbed to Warner Independent's president that he wanted 10% of the dialogue in Hindi, and she approved the change. Filming locations included shooting in Mumbai's megaslum and in shantytown parts of Juhu, so film-makers controlled the crowds by befriending onlookers. Filming began on 5 November 2007.|$|E
