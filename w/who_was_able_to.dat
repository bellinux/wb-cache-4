5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death {{less than}} a month after her {{daughter}} Mary was born, Mary was raised by Godwin, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> provide his daughter with a rich, if informal, education, encouraging her to adhere to his own liberal political theories. When Mary was four, her father married a neighbour, with whom, as her stepmother, Mary came to have a troubled relationship.|$|E
5|$|Artistically, the Grand National {{experiment}} {{was a success}} for Cagney, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> move away from his traditional Warner Bros. tough guy roles to more sympathetic characters. How far he could have experimented and developed will never be known, but back in the Warner fold, he was once again playing tough guys.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Guillory {{made her}} screen debut in a TV {{adaptation}} of Jilly Cooper's novel, Riders, {{for which the}} casting directors needed a young actress <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> ride a horse.

5|$|City won {{immediate}} promotion as Second Division champions in 1902–03, with Meredith scoring 22 {{goals in}} 37 appearances and claiming a hat-trick against Chesterfield Town. Maley {{managed to find}} him a suitable inside-right partner in Jimmy Bannister, who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed the ball through to Meredith. He also played Sammy Frost at half-back, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> win the ball and bring Meredith into the play, and signed outside-left Frank Booth to balance the attack. Maley encouraged teamwork, meaning there was less pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders.|$|E
5|$|Europium {{was first}} found in 1890 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who {{obtained}} basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not {{accounted for by}} samarium or gadolinium. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> isolate it in 1901; he then named it europium.|$|E
5|$|The IP address {{leads to}} another live feed similar in nature {{to the first}} one. However, the chair is empty this time. There is another number painted on the wall, which Black recognizes as a case file number from {{his time in the}} FBI—the case {{concerned}} Avatar, a serial killer <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> evade all attempts at capture. Avatar sends Black a coded message twice, and places a woman in the chair on the feed, keeping her face hidden. Roedecker realizes that, through image differencing, the two messages contain additional information—a sound clip from The Mikado, known to be Avatar's favourite operetta.|$|E

5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|In Greek folklore, a stikhio (στοιχείο) was {{a spirit}} that {{protected}} his territory against the adverse stikhio spirits from other territories. In Albanian tradition, a dragoi was a dragon-man with enormous {{strength and the}} power to fly; he was born with a caul. He saved his region from a kuçedra or kulshedra, a female serpentine demon. In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could be controlled by an evil sorcerer called a şolomonar, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> ride on that demon. The notion of a şolomonar named a vîlva, who protected his village against attacks of vîlvas from other villages, was marginally encountered in some places of Romanian Banat.|$|E
5|$|In his welterweight debut and {{his first}} fight under Team Rough House affiliation, Wallhead was victorious. The fight took place at Cage Warriors: Strike Force 3 where Wallhead faced Greco-Roman wrestler Steve Singh-Sidhu. Though Wallhead had dropped to welterweight, {{he still had a}} {{considerable}} weight advantage over his opponent who weighed in at 3.5kg less than Wallhead. This perhaps was significant as Singh-Sidhu's strikes seemed to have little bearing on Wallhead, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> land takedowns and a standing choke. Midway through the first round, Singh-Sidhu appeared to be backing away from Wallhead, who chased him down with punches and knees to the head. After a shin strike to the head, Singh-Sidhu's corner threw in the towel, resulting in a first-round TKO victory for Wallhead.|$|E

5|$|Longstreet {{served with}} {{distinction}} in the Mexican–American War with the 8th U.S. Infantry. He fought under Zachary Taylor as a lieutenant in May 1846 in the battles of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma, while saying {{nothing in his}} memoirs about his personal role in the battles. He fought again with Taylor's army at the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846. He received brevet promotions to captain for Contreras and Churubusco and to major for Molino del Rey. In the Battle of Chapultepec on September 12, 1847, he {{was wounded in the}} thigh while charging up the hill with his regimental colors; falling, he handed the flag to his friend, Lt. George E. Pickett, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reach the summit.|$|E
5|$|Muldoon was {{accomplished}} at other sports, including lacrosse. He played professionally for a Vancouver club in 1911. He {{was also an}} ice dancer <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> skate, as well as play hockey, while on stilts. In 1914, he took over as the coach and manager of the Portland Rosebuds. For the 1915 season, he changed teams, and went to Seattle to manage a new team in the PCHA, the Metropolitans. He spent eight seasons coaching in Seattle, and amassed a record of 115 wins, 105 losses, and four ties. The Metropolitans competed several times for the Stanley Cup. The Mets played for the Stanley Cup three times under his leadership, and winning it once in 1917 during their first trip. Muldoon was the first and, at age 30, youngest coach of a Stanley Cup Championship team based in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} co-productions of the 1970s, both made in 1979, {{occurred}} in Kuwait and Spain. The Kuwaiti show, Iftah Ya Simsim, which ran until 1990, {{was the first}} of its kind in the Arab world. It used Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and was broadcast in 22 Arab countries. The show continued to be well-known decades after it went off the air. It returned in 2013, and had similar goals and objectives as the original version, including the use of MSA. Barrio Sésamo, made in Spain, featured a snail character <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hide a thousand and one things in her shell. One of the show's Muppet characters, Dr. Valentin Ruster, was based upon Dr. Valentin Fuster, a native Spaniard who worked at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Dr. Fuster's likeness was created to educate children in Spain about exercise and eating healthy.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the naval}} bureaus, however, {{there was still}} much resistance. In mid-to-late 1904, Poundstone {{continued}} to lobby the General Board while C protested that the final determinant in a naval battle would be the light guns—and in any case such a large uniform battery was not feasible. Poundstone replied with a design of his own creation, which he called USS Possible and fit twelve 11-inch guns on a ship that displaced 19,330 long tons. With support from Lieutenant Commander William Sims, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cite the increasingly accurate long-gunnery of the Navy, and interest shown in the project by President Roosevelt, the bureaucratic stalling ended.|$|E
5|$|As Ethalion subdued Thetis the {{remainder}} of the British squadron continued southwards in pursuit of Santa Brigida. Pillon was an experienced officer with a good knowledge of the Northern Spanish coast and he intended to lose his pursuers in the rocky channels of Cape Finisterre. Early on 17 October he reached Spanish coastal waters, rounding Finisterre just beyond the Monte Lora rocks. Captain Gore on Triton, which was in full flow at seven knots, was unaware of the obstacle and at 05:00 crashed into them, coming to a juddering halt and inflicting severe damage to his ship's hull. Gore was able however to bring Triton off soon afterwards and continued pursuit, assisted by Digby on Alcmene <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> block Pillon's route into Porte de Vidre. Both frigates opened fire on Santa Brigida at 07:00 as the Spanish ship sought shelter in the rocks at Commarurto close to the safe harbour at Muros, Pillon's movement hampered by the coastal rias that blocked the wind. After an hour of resistance, with Naiad belatedly approaching, Pillon was forced to surrender his ship to superior British forces. Santa Brigida had lost two men killed and eight wounded, Alcmene one killed and nine wounded and Triton a single man wounded.|$|E
5|$|As {{the gang}} exited the {{property}} and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw {{a group of three}} men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Goldring Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man {{was the one who had}} killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1890, Bronisława — who {{a few months earlier}} had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political activist — invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her {{a year and a half}} longer to gather the necessary funds. She was helped by her father, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> secure a more lucrative position again. All that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself. In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw. She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891. She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near Warsaw's Old Town. The laboratory was run by her cousin Józef Boguski, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E
5|$|Cotto {{returned}} to action on February 21, 2009, in a card {{held at the}} Madison Square Garden, sporting {{the first of his}} trademark tattoos which he has expanded on ever since. This time competing against Michael Jennings for the vacant WBO welterweight title. After both pugilists used the first round to study their opponent's style, the tempo accelerated during the second. In the third, Cotto pursued the offensive more fluidly, connecting with jabs and hooks. One round later, Cotto scored two knockdowns on Jennings, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue until the recess. In the fifth, Jennings was trapped against the ropes, which Cotto utilized to connect a right hook to score a third knockdown. Jennings incorporated, but the referee decided to stop the fight. With this action, Cotto was awarded a technical knockout victory, in the process winning his second championship in the welterweight division. On April 8, 2009, Cotto fired his uncle from the team's staff, following a violent discussion where his property was damaged. However, neither side expressed interest in pursuing any sort of legal action. Consequently, Cotto named Joe Santiago, who had served as the team's nutritionist as his new trainer.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31BC, Octavian {{consolidated}} his political power and in 27BC was named Augustus by the Roman Senate, becoming the first Roman emperor. Around this time, Tiridates II of Parthia briefly overthrew Phraates IV, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly reestablish his rule {{with the aid of}} Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as {{a small price to pay}} to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the building of a new temple to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the breastplate scene on his statue Augustus of Prima Porta.|$|E
