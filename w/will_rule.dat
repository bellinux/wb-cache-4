5|$|In Throne of Blood, a Japanese {{adaptation}} of the play, Fleance is replaced by Yoshiteru, a character played by Akira Kobu. The Macbeth and Banquo characters, Washizu and Miki, are told by an old woman spinning wool in a hut that while Washizu <b>will</b> <b>rule</b> the Forest Castle one day, Miki's son Yoshiteru will eventually inherit it for himself. Washizu takes the throne {{and at one point}} is about to make Yoshiteru his heir, but changes his mind when his wife tells him she is pregnant. Washizu instead arranges to have Yoshiteru and his father killed, but Yoshiteru escapes. Another adaptation filmed in India, Maqbool (2003), replaces Fleance with a character named Guddu. Maqbool (Macbeth) attempts to have Guddu murdered to strengthen power within the organised crime circle. Guddu, however, survives and marries the daughter of the former crime lord.|$|E

25|$|Bowling, in cricket, is {{the action}} of {{propelling}} the ball toward the wicket defended by a batsman. A player skilled at bowling is called a bowler; a bowler {{who is also a}} competent batsman is known as an all-rounder. Bowling the ball is distinguished from throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition, which restricts the angle of extension of the elbow. A single act of bowling the ball towards the batsman is called a ball or a delivery. Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an over. Once a bowler has bowled an over, a teammate will bowl an over {{from the other end of}} the pitch. The Laws of Cricket govern how a ball must be bowled. If a ball is bowled illegally, an umpire <b>will</b> <b>rule</b> it a no ball. If a ball is bowled too wide of the striker for the batsman to be able to play at it with a proper cricket shot, the bowler's end umpire <b>will</b> <b>rule</b> it a wide.|$|E

25|$|PE usually {{results from}} a blood clot in the leg that travels to the lung. The risk of blood clots is {{increased}} by cancer, prolonged bed rest, smoking, stroke, certain genetic conditions, estrogen-based medication, pregnancy, obesity, and after some types of surgery. A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air, fat, or amniotic fluid. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in combination with test results. If the risk is low a blood test known as a D-dimer <b>will</b> <b>rule</b> out the condition. Otherwise a CT pulmonary angiography, lung ventilation/perfusion scan, or ultrasound of the legs may confirm the diagnosis. Together deep vein thrombosis and PE are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE).|$|E
25|$|Erasmus {{continues}} his experiment with his ward Gilbertus Albans, whom he names his Mentat.

Realizing that hrethgir <b>will</b> <b>rule</b> the universe, he suggests to Gilbertus that he teach the other humans to “think efficiently.” Erasmus apparently survives the battle when Gilbertus smuggles away his memory core.|$|E
