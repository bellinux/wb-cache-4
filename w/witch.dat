2500|$|Ginzburg {{noted that}} whether the benandanti were {{themselves}} <b>witches</b> or not was {{an area of}} confusion in the earliest records. Whilst they combated the malevolent <b>witches</b> and helped heal those who were {{believed to have been}} harmed through witchcraft, they also joined the <b>witches</b> on their nocturnal journeys, and the miller Pietro Rotaro was recorded as referring to them as [...] "benandanti witches"; for this reason the priest Don Bartolomeo Sgabarizza, who recorded Rotaro's testimony, believed that while the benandanti were <b>witches,</b> they were 'good' <b>witches</b> who tried to protect their communities from the bad <b>witches</b> who would harm children. Ginzburg remarked that it was this contradiction in the relationship between the benandanti and the malevolent <b>witches</b> that ultimately heavily influenced their persecution {{at the hands of the}} Inquisition.|$|R
