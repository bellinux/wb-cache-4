5|$|With the {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, designed to combat {{a shortage of}} manpower due to wars against Jugurtha, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Now soldiers would join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> equipped as heavy infantry with the same, state purchased equipment.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of Snow White, work had continued on the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series of shorts. Mickey Mouse switched to Technicolor in 1935, by which time the series had added several major supporting characters, among them Mickey's dog Pluto and their friends Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, Goofy, and Pluto <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> appearing in series of their own by 1940, and the Donald Duck cartoons eclipsed the Mickey Mouse series in popularity. The Silly Symphonies, which garnered seven , ended in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Isabella {{is accused}} of driving a stolen van and taken into custody, while the other {{survivors}} reunite for safety. After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} the survivors of Flight 180 they <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> dead, which explains why the survivors are dying in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E

5|$|With {{the formal}} {{military}} reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, intended to combat {{a shortage of}} manpower from wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Instead, it was decreed that soldiers would join the legion as a career, rather than as service to the city, and <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> equipped as medium infantry with the same state-purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{started in}} March 2008, and later {{finished}} on August {{in the same}} year. Before principal photography commenced, director Colm McCarthy participated in helicopter shots over London. In each block of episodes, {{the cast and crew}} would often film all scenes held in certain locations at once, for instance all scenes set on the Grid, although taking place in different parts of each episodes, <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> filmed together before moving on to another set. However, the cast had trouble following the storylines with this method. A different Director of Photography was hired in each episode. Because of this, the filming style inside the Grid set changed in every episode. To film public shots, a small filming crew were used as to not attract too much attention from passers by. However, by using the small crew, they and the actors generally film the scenes unnoticed by the public, which the producers felt gave the characters such gravitas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} round of group matches during the 1979 Benson & Hedges Cup, a one-day cricket competition, Somerset County Cricket Club faced Worcestershire County Cricket Club at New Road, Worcester, on 24 May 1979. The result of the match would help to {{determine}} which teams progressed to the quarter-finals of the competition. If Somerset lost the match, and Glamorgan won their match, then Somerset, Worcestershire and Glamorgan <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> level on points, and bowling strike rate would be used as a tie-breaker. Brian Rose, Somerset's captain, realised that if he batted first and declared the innings closed after just one over, it would protect Somerset's strike rate advantage and guarantee them qualification. Somerset scored just one run from their over, and Worcestershire then took ten balls to score the two runs they needed to win. The match was completed in 18 minutes, and consisted of only 16 legal deliveries.|$|E

5|$|Later, in April 2003, No Doubt {{went into}} hiatus {{to take a}} break to spend time with their {{families}} before starting to compile Everything in Time; The Singles 1992–2003, a greatest hits album featuring songs from their previous studio albums; and Boom Box, a box set compiling The Singles 1992–2003, Everything in Time, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom, which <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> released on the same date. The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 22, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 4, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Philip, {{disappointed}} by the spoils in Mysia, proceeded south and plundered the towns and cities of Caria. He invested Prinassus, which held out bravely at first, but when Philip set up his artillery, he sent an envoy into the city offering to let them leave the city unharmed or they <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> killed. The citizens decided to abandon the city. At this stage in the campaign, Philip's army {{was running out of}} food, so he seized the city of Myus and gave it to the Magnesians in return for food supplies. Since the Magnesians had no grain, Philip settled for enough figs to feed his whole army. Subsequently, Philip turned north in order to seize and garrison the cities of Iasos, Bargylia, Euromus and Pedasa in quick succession.|$|E

25|$|A spinners weasel {{is similar}} to a swift, however it does not adjust to various sized hanks.
