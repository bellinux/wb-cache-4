Changes in thiamin pyrophosphotransferase activity and thiamin pyrophosphate content were followed for 6 days in soybean (Merr.) seedlings.

Seed that was dried using high-temperature (45 °C) air exhibited lower early seedling dry weight accumulation when compared to low-temperature (35 °C) treatments. In embryo culture experiments, an extended germination period was observed for excised embryos from high-temperature (HT) treatments compared to low-temperature (LT). This observation coincided with reduced respiration rates for imbibing axis tissue from HT samples. In addition, uptake rates continued to increase for LT samples through the first 6 h <b>of</b> <b>imbibition</b> while rates for HT axes were constant. Mitochondria isolated from HT treated axis tissue that had been imbibed for 4 h exhibited no respiratory control. However, ADP/O values of 0. 79 and 0. 77 were recorded for NADH and succinate assays, respectively, for mitochondria from LT treated axes. Electron micrographs of cells from the radicle meristem region showed that mitochondrial development during the initial 24 h <b>of</b> <b>imbibition</b> was impaired in HT treated samples compared to LT tissue. A visible disruption of the matrix structure in HT tissue after 0 and 6 h <b>of</b> <b>imbibition</b> resulted in the apparent degeneration of some mitochondria at 24 h while others appear to have achieved repair. Analysis of nucleotide extracts of imbibed axis tissue by high performance liquid chromatography showed lower triphosphate nucleoside levels in HT samples.

This study aims to develop a new eco-friendly and corrosion-inhibiting admixture based on EPS 180 exopolysaccharides, biopolymers used in coatings already studied for the corrosion inhibition on steel in seawater. C 15 rebars embedded in CEMI and CEMV cement paste containing EPS 180 were immersed in natural seawater and their electrochemical behaviour was studied using open circuit potential measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These tests highlight the decrease of the cathodic reaction kinetics due to the EPS 180 action at the rebars surface, and the absence of effect on the passive layer.

30|$|A pore {{network model}} {{was used in}} this paper to {{investigate}} the factors, in particular, throat radius, wettability and initial water saturation, causing water block in low permeability reservoirs. A new term — ‘relative permeability number’ (RPN) was firstly defined, and then used to describe the degree <b>of</b> <b>water</b> block. <b>Imbibition</b> process simulations show that the RPN drops in accordance with the extension of the averaged pore throat radius from 0.05 to 1.5 μm, and yet once beyond that point of 1.5 μm, the RPN reaches a higher value, indicating the existence of a critical pore throat radius where water block is the maximum. When the wettability of the samples changes from water-wet to weakly water-wet, weakly gas-wet, or gas(oil)-wet, the gas RPN increases consistently, but this consistency is disturbed by the RPN dropping for weakly water-wet samples for water saturations less than 0.4, which means weakly waterwet media are more easily water blocked than water-wet systems. In the situation where the initial water saturation exceeds 0.05, water block escalates along with an increase in initial water saturation.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{the rate}} <b>of</b> <b>imbibition</b> by {{isolated}} cotyledons of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr cv Wayne) indicated that water uptake rates were slowed by low temperatures and by low initial moisture contents of the tissue. The role <b>of</b> <b>water</b> viscosity in the temperature effects on imbibition was examined, and a linear relation between imbibition rate and the reciprocal of viscosity was found only for seeds of very high initial moisture content. Adding solutes which lowered the surface tension, or increased the wetting ability <b>of</b> the <b>water,</b> yielded markedly increased rates <b>of</b> <b>imbibition,</b> especially for tissue of low initial moisture content. The data are interpreted as indicating a first component <b>of</b> <b>water</b> entry which is a wetting reaction influenced by the surface tension <b>of</b> the <b>water,</b> and a second component which resembles water flow through a porous matrix and {{is influenced by the}} water viscosity. We speculate that damage to soybeans during imbibition, such {{as in the case of}} chilling injury, may be particularly related to the initial wetting reaction rather than to the longer-term imbibitional rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{activity of}} the seeds begins with water uptake, resulting in tissues rehydration and triggering metabolic events of germination. In this context, the present study aimed to verify {{the influence of the}} physiological quality and initial humidity in the <b>water</b> absorption rate <b>of</b> Dalbergia nigra seeds. The seeds were collected at two different sites, representing lots I and II. Seeds belonging to the two lots were placed to hydrate in water, in desiccators with relative humidity between 95 - 99 % at 15 oC and 25 oC, until they reached near four hydration levels: 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 % of seeds moisture content. The lots were evaluated for germination, germination speed index (GSI) and mean germination time (MGT). Then, the changes in the water uptake by seeds of the two lots were evaluated after they reached the desired moisture levels, by analyzing the curves <b>of</b> <b>imbibition.</b> The experimental design was completely randomized. The lots I and II were classified as presenting high and low vigor, respectively. The results indicated that the rate <b>of</b> <b>imbibition</b> varied with initial moisture content. So the difference between the curves begins at stage II <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> absorption process. Dalbergia nigra seeds with lower physiological quality require longer periods <b>of</b> <b>imbibition</b> to reach phase III and complete the germination process...|$|R
40|$|Ultraweak {{luminescence}} (UWL) from mealy and vitreous wheat grain was investigated. Before {{the investigation}} the mealy and vitreous wheat grains were moistened {{in water for}} a period of 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. The grains were then dried to the mass they had before moistening. UWL measurements were made twice before and during <b>imbibition</b> <b>of</b> the grains. At the imbibition phase UWL was measured for 8 h. It was observed that UWL depended on the grain structure and the time of moistening. As moistened grain was of a more porous structure a higher UWL emission in the initial phase <b>of</b> <b>imbibition</b> was noted. Then UWL from the grains with a more porous structure quickly decayed. Finally after 8 h <b>of</b> <b>imbibition</b> UWL from moistened and not moistened grains was of similar intensity...|$|R
