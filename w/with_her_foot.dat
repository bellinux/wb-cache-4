5|$|Sen discovers paper shikigami {{attacking a}} dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku transformed. When a grievously-injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. When she reaches Haku, a shikigami that stowed away {{on her back}} {{transforms}} into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She transforms Yubaba's baby son Boh into a mouse, creates a decoy baby and turns Yubaba's bird creature into a tiny bird. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. After Haku dives to the boiler room with Sen and Boh on his back, she feeds him part of the dumpling, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spiritualist mediums {{have also}} claimed psychokinetic abilities. Eusapia Palladino, an Italian medium, could {{allegedly}} cause objects to move during séances. However, {{she was caught}} levitating a table <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> by the magician Joseph Rinn and using tricks to move objects by the psychologist Hugo Münsterberg. Other alleged PK mediums that were exposed as frauds, include Anna Rasmussen and Maria Silbert.|$|E
25|$|Among the neo-Platonists and, later, their Christian interpreters, Aphrodite Ourania is {{associated}} with spiritual love, and Aphrodite Pandemos with physical love (desire). A representation of Aphrodite Ourania <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> resting on a tortoise {{came to be seen}} as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love; it {{was the subject of a}} chryselephantine sculpture by Phidias for Elis, known only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer Pausanias).|$|E

25|$|Face {{covering}} veils with caps of otter {{were worn}} {{in the streets}} by women in public in Xinjiang as witnessed by Ahmad Kamal in the 1930s. In order to properly mount her stirrup <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot,</b> one Turki woman had to temporarily lift her veil to see better. The face of the girl who was to marry Ahmad Kamal was covered by the veil. Nura Han removed her face veil after marring Ahmad Kamal. A cap of otter and a veil was worn by Nura Han. Muslim women faced no risk in Urumqi of being deveiled by the government (hookemet) so Ahmad Kamal wore a face veil and women's attire to escape.|$|E
500|$|American singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson covered [...] "Toxic" [...] {{regularly}} on her 2010 Everybody Tour. Michaelson's version ends {{with her and}} the band doing a dance break set to Spears's original song. American pop band Selena Gomez & the Scene performed a tribute to Spears during their 2011 We Own the Night Tour. The medley of hits included [...] "...Baby One More Time", [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy", [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Toxic", mixed similar to the Chris Cox Megamix included in Greatest Hits: My Prerogative. They also performed a cover of [...] "Hold It Against Me". During her debut on U.S. TV singing show The Voice, American singer Melanie Martinez sang [...] "Toxic" [...] playing an acoustic guitar and a tambourine <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot.</b> Three of the judges, Adam Levine, Cee Lo Green and Blake Shelton, hit the [...] "I Want You" [...] button for her. On December 2, 2016, Madonna covered the song during a live concert broadcast through Facebook Live.|$|E
500|$|Like Bhattacharya, Meena Kelkar, {{author of}} Subordination of Woman: a New Perspective, feels that Ahalya was made venerable {{due to her}} {{acceptance}} of gender norms; she ungrudgingly accepted the curse while acknowledging her need for punishment. However, Kelkar adds that another reason for making Ahalya immortal in scripture could be that her punishment acts as a warning and deterrent to women. Patriarchal society always condemns Ahalya as a fallen woman. In Bhavabhuti's 8th-century play Mahaviracharita, which alludes to Ahalya's redemption in a verbal spat with Parashurama, Satananda is mocked {{as the son of}} Ahalya, the adulteress. Jaya Srinivasan, in her discourses on tales from the Hindu epics, says that though Ahalya's action was [...] "unpardonable", she was redeemed by the divine touch of dust from Rama's feet. Jaya adds that Ahalya's actions and the resultant curse are a warning that such immoral behaviour leads to doom, although sincere penitence and complete surrender to God can erase the gravest sins. In Hindu Tamil weddings in India and Sri Lanka, Ahalya appears as a symbolic black grinding stone, which the bride touches <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> while promising not to be like Ahalya. The bride is also shown the star associated with the chaste Arundhati, who is cast as her ideal. The well-known treatise on sexual behaviour, the Kama Sutra (301–600), also mentions Ahalya and Indra while discussing how lust destroys men. However, it also urges men to seduce women by telling the romantic tales of Ahalya.|$|E

2500|$|At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Patterson {{finished}} first {{overall in the}} preliminary round and qualified for the all-around and balance beam finals. The United States, including Patterson, struggled in the team final: She under-rotated her vault, stubbed the low bar <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> on the uneven bars, and had several wobbles on balance beam and a lunge forward on her dismount. She later admitted to being distracted after a rushed start on vault, with her coach saying, [...] "The beginning of the competition was stressful. It set the tone." [...] The U.S. women, the reigning world champions, settled for silver.|$|E
