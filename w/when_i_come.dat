500|$|The {{following}} year, Murphy {{starred in}} Red Lights with Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver's character {{who is a}} paranormal investigator. [...] Murphy considered working with De Niro to {{have been one of}} the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: [...] "My first scene <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to visit him my character is supposed to be terrified and intimidated. There was no acting involved. The man has presence. You can't act presence. I'll never have that. Watching him use it...when you put a camera on it, it just becomes something else." ...|$|E
500|$|Featuring tracks such as [...] "Too Much Love Will Kill You" [...] and [...] "Heaven for Everyone", {{the album}} also {{contains}} the song [...] "Mother Love", the last vocal recording Mercury made {{prior to his}} death, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor and Deacon later added the instrumental track. After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he [...] "wasn't feeling that great" [...] and stated, [...] "I will finish it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back, next time." [...] However, he never made {{it back into the}} studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song.|$|E

500|$|Dickinson {{attended}} {{primary school}} in a two-story building on Pleasant Street. Her education was [...] "ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl". Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to [...] "keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> home, how many new things you have learned". While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests {{that her mother was}} regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she [...] "always ran Home to Awe [...] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none." ...|$|E
500|$|Both the Imperial Austrian Ambassador in London, Count Wratislaw, and the Duke of Marlborough {{realised}} {{the implications}} of the situation on the Danube. The Dutch, however, who clung to their troops for their country's protection, were against any adventurous military operation as far south as the Danube and would never willingly permit any major weakening of the forces in the Spanish Netherlands. Marlborough, realising the only way to ignore Dutch wishes was by the use of secrecy and guile, set out to deceive his Dutch allies by pretending to simply move his troops to the Moselle – a plan approved of by The Hague – but once there, he would slip the Dutch leash and link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany. [...] "My intentions", wrote the Duke from The Hague on 29 April to his governmental confidant, Sidney Godolphin, [...] "are to march with the English to Coblenz and declare that I intend to campaign on the Moselle. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> there, to write to the Dutch States that I think it absolutely necessary for the saving of the Empire to march with the troops under my command and to join with those that are in Germany ... in order to make measures with Prince Lewis of Baden for the speedy reduction of the Elector of Bavaria." ...|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day, Alice wrote a {{much shorter}} letter to Louis {{in which she}} looked forward to their meeting, and hoped that [...] "my letter did not distress you – but {{it is better to}} be quite honest about all one's feelings". Despite marital problems, Alice remained a strong supporter of her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, and Louis and Alice became the Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse. Her continued unpopularity in Darmstadt, however, coupled with her mother not wanting her in England, caused strain, and she and her children spent July and August in Houlgate, Normandy, where Louis often visited them. She was hurt by her reputation in Darmstadt, and she became increasingly bitter towards it; Louis wrote in August 1877 expressing the hope that [...] "bitterness of the salt water will drive away the bitterness that you still feel against Darmstadt. Please my darling, don't speak so harshly of it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to join you – it would quite spoil my happiness at seeing you again." [...] Alice took Louis's letter to heart, responding: [...] "I shall certainly say nothing to you about Darmstadt when you come...I have no intention of saying anything unpleasant, least of all to you. You shake off anything unpleasant like a poodle shaking off the water {{when it comes to the}} sea – natures like yours are the happiest in themselves, but they are not made to help, comfort and advise others, nor to share with others the heat of life's noon-day or the cool of the evening, with insight, understanding and sympathy." [...] In response, Louis sent a letter that [...] "made [...] cry", and after this letter, Alice's letters to Louis were more encouraging, assuring him of his ability to make decisions by himself.|$|E

2500|$|The album also {{featured}} the song [...] "Mother Love", the last vocal recording Mercury made, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor and Deacon later added the instrumental track. After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury {{had told the}} band he [...] "wasn't feeling that great" [...] and stated, [...] "I will finish it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> back, next time"; however, he never made {{it back into the}} studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song. Both stages of recording, before and after Mercury's death, were completed at the band's studio in Montreux, Switzerland. The album reached No. 1 on the UK charts immediately following its release, and has sold 20 million copies worldwide. On 25 November 1996, a statue of Mercury was unveiled in Montreux overlooking Lake Geneva, almost five years to the day since his death.|$|E
2500|$|The tour, choreographed by Tina Landon, {{was officially}} {{announced}} on December 9, 2009, {{while on the}} set of the music video for [...] "Hard". She also announced some dates for the European leg of the tour on her official website. It went on to gross over $9.1 million in North America from 26 shows according to Pollstar, and the 2011 Australian leg of the tour added another $10 million to the total. English singer-songwriter Pixie Lott was selected as the opening act for the UK shows, along with last minute additions of Tinchy Stryder and Tinie Tempah. In an interview with MTV, she stated, [...] "We've been ... coming out with different ideas and cool things that we can do. Things that we've never seen before, daring things – but now is when we really start with the rehearsal and we get into the nitty-gritty and the details of everything" [...] while describing the vibe of the tour as [...] "daring". She continued to comment on the tour stating, [...] "expect some sexy surprises <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> to the UK. I'll go all out on the tour, which I hope to bring to some UK festivals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Approximately three {{quarters}} of comfort women died, and most survivors were left infertile due to sexual trauma or sexually transmitted diseases. Beatings and physical torture {{were said to be}} common. The women who were not prostitutes prior to joining the [...] "comfort women corps", especially those taken in by force, were normally [...] "broken in" [...] by being raped. One Korean woman, Kim Hak-sun stated in a 1991 interview about how she was drafted into the [...] "comfort women corps" [...] in 1941: [...] "When I was 17 years old, the Japanese soldiers came along in a truck, beat us , and then dragged us into the back. I was told if I were drafted, I could earn lots of money in a textile factory...The first day I was raped and the rapes never stopped...I was born a woman but never lived as a woman...I feel sick <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> close to a man. Not just Japanese men, but all men-even my own husband who saved me from the brothel. I shiver whenever I see a Japanese flag...Why should I feel ashamed? I don't have to feel ashamed." [...] Kim stated that she was raped 30–40 times a day, everyday of the year during her time as a [...] "comfort woman". Reflecting their dehumanized status, Army and Navy records where referring to the movement of [...] "comfort women" [...] always used the term [...] "units of war supplies". One Japanese Army doctor, Asō Tetsuo testified that the [...] "comfort women" [...] were seen as [...] "female ammunition" [...] and as [...] "public toilets", as literally just things to be used and abused, with some [...] "comfort women" [...] being forced to donate blood for the treatment of wounded soldiers. At least 80% of the [...] "comfort women" [...] were Korean, who were assigned to the lower ranks while Japanese and European women went to the officers with for example Dutch women captured in the Netherlands East Indies (modern Indonesia) being reserved exclusively for the officers. Korea is a Confucian country where premarital sex was widely disapproved of, and since the Korean teenagers taken into the [...] "comfort women corps" [...] were almost always virgins, it was felt that this {{was the best way to}} limit the spread of venereal diseases that would otherwise incapacitate soldiers and sailors.|$|E
