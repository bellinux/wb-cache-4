5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> on the alloy.|$|E
25|$|Some metals may {{be forged}} cold, but {{iron and steel}} are almost always hot forged. Hot forging {{prevents}} the <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> that would result from cold forging, which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece. Also, while <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> may be desirable in some circumstances, other methods of hardening the piece, such as heat treating, are generally more economical and more controllable. Alloys that are amenable to precipitation hardening, such as most aluminium alloys and titanium, can be hot forged, followed by hardening.|$|E

25|$|All of the {{following}} forging processes can be performed at various temperatures; however, they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the recrystallization temperature. If the temperature is above the material's recrystallization temperature it is deemed hot forging; if the temperature is below the material's recrystallization temperature but above 30% of the recrystallization temperature (on an absolute scale) it is deemed warm forging; if below 30% of the recrystallization temperature (usually room temperature) then it is deemed cold forging. The main advantage of hot forging {{is that it can}} be done more quickly and precisely, and as the metal is deformed <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> effects are negated by the recrystallization process. Cold forging typically results in <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> of the piece.|$|E

25|$|Machinability can be {{difficult}} to predict because machining has so many variables. Two sets of factors are the condition of work materials and the physical properties of work materials. The condition of the work material includes eight factors: microstructure, grain size, heat treatment, chemical composition, fabrication, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength. Physical properties are those of the individual material groups, such as the modulus of elasticity, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and <b>work</b> <b>hardening.</b> Other important factors are operating conditions, cutting tool material and geometry, and the machining process parameters.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the case}} {{is the single most}} {{expensive}} part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better. Cases that are loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be work hardened or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures. Use of moderate pressure loads extends the life of the case significantly, not to mention saving quite a bit of wear and tear on the barrel. <b>Work</b> <b>hardening</b> can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its malleability, and is unable to survive swaging back into shape during the resizing operation. Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away {{from the rear of the}} case. Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front of the thick web of brass at the base. If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun. This generally requires a special stuck case removal tool to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the initial}} stage, or primary creep, or {{transient}} creep, the strain rate is relatively high, but decreases with increasing time and strain {{due to a}} process analogous to <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> at lower temperatures. For instance, the dislocation density increases and, in many materials, a dislocation subgrain structure is formed and the cell size decreases with strain. The strain rate diminishes to a minimum and becomes near constant as the secondary stage begins. This {{is due to the}} balance between <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> and annealing (thermal softening). The secondary stage, referred to as [...] "steady-state creep", is the most understood. The microstructure is invariant during this stage, which means that recovery effects are concurrent with deformation. No material strength is lost during these first two stages of creep.|$|E
50|$|Aluminum {{and brass}} are typical {{workpieces}} with good to excellent machinability ratings. Cast iron, mild steel and plastic have good ratings. Stainless steel has a poor rating {{because of its}} toughness and it tends to <b>work</b> <b>harden</b> as it is machined.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{steel-framed}} bikes do {{not have}} a removable derailleur hanger, because a steel dropout and hanger is stronger and therefore less likely to be damaged, and also it is more malleable and less likely to <b>work</b> <b>harden</b> during deformation and generally can be bent back into shape without breaking.|$|R
50|$|Skiving or {{scarfing}} machines cut material off in slices, usually metal, {{but also}} leather or laminates. The process {{is used instead}} of rolling the material to shape when the material must not be <b>work</b> <b>hardened,</b> or must not shed minute slivers of metal later which is common in cold rolling processes.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Work</b> <b>hardening</b> {{happens to}} all cases, even {{low-pressure}} handgun cases. The sudden {{increase in pressure}} upon firing hits the brass like a hammer, changing its crystalline structure and making it more brittle. The neck of the case, if it becomes too brittle, will be incapable of standing the strain of resizing, expanding, crimping, and firing, and will split during loading or firing. While a neck split during firing is not a significant danger, a split neck will render the case incapable of holding the bullet in place, so the case must be discarded or recycled as a wildcat cartridge of shorter overall length, allowing the split section to be removed. [...] The simplest way to decrease the effects of <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> is to decrease the pressure in the case. Loading to the minimum power level listed in the reloading manual, instead of the maximum, can significantly increase case life. Slower powders generally also have lower pressure peaks, and {{may be a good}} choice.|$|E
2500|$|Hot {{extrusion}} is a {{hot working}} process, which means it is done above the material's recrystallization temperature to keep the material from <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> {{and to make it}} easier to push the material through the die. Most hot extrusions are done on horizontal hydraulic presses that range from [...] Pressures range from , therefore lubrication is required, which can be oil or graphite for lower temperature extrusions, or glass powder for higher temperature extrusions. The biggest disadvantage of this process is its cost for machinery and its upkeep.|$|E
2500|$|With bottlenecked {{cartridge}} cases, {{choosing the}} right sizing die can also be important. Full length sizing of cartridges is often thought to greatly shorten case life by <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> {{the full length of}} the case, which can cause the case neck to split, although some studies show that the number of reloads possible with a case is essentially the same for either full length sizing as for neck sizing only if the issue is one of neck hardening. If the reloaded cartridges are going {{to be used in the}} same firearm in which they were previously fired, though, and if that firearm has a bolt action or other action with a strong camming action on closing, then full length resizing may not be needed. A collet neck sizing die can be used to size just the case neck enough to hold the bullet, and leave the rest of the case unsized. The resulting cartridge will chamber into the specific rifle that previously fired it, though the fit might be tight and require more force to chamber than a full length resized case. The use of a neck-sizing die in conjunction with moderate pressure loads may extend the life of the case significantly by minimizing the amount of case that is work hardened or stretched. This is especially true for reloads intended for military rifles with intentionally large chambers such as the Lee–Enfield in [...]303 British. [...] The use of partial length or neck sizing for cartridges used in such large chambers permits effectively switching the headspacing from relying on the rim of a rimmed cartridge to the shoulder of the bottle neck transition instead, increasing the number of times a rimmed military cartridge can be reloaded from once to perhaps 5 or more times, all while avoiding dangerous incipient head separations. [...] One final form of limiting case wear is, unfortunately, limited strictly to benchrest shooters with custom-cut chambers. The chamber of these rifles is cut so that there is just enough room, typically just a few thousandths of an inch, in the neck area. [...] The result of using this type of chamber is that fired rounds don't require any resizing whatsoever once the case is fired. [...] The brass will 'spring back' a bit after firing, and will properly hold a new bullet without further manipulation. Some refer to this as a 'fitted' neck, however it is a function of both the carefully cut precision neck and the case adjusted to fit with very little clearance.|$|E
25|$|Stainless steels have poor {{machinability}} {{compared to}} regular carbon steel {{because they are}} tougher, gummier and tend to <b>work</b> <b>harden</b> very rapidly. Slightly hardening the steel may decrease its gumminess and {{make it easier to}} cut. AISI grades 303 and 416 are easier to machine because of the addition of sulphur and phosphorus.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{effect the}} load {{has on the}} {{indentation}} is the piling-up or sinking-in of the surrounding material.

5000|$|Mangalloy has fair yield {{strength}} but very high tensile strength, typically anywhere between 350 and 900 megapascals (MPa), which rises rapidly as it <b>work</b> <b>hardens.</b> Unlike {{other forms of}} steel, when stretched to the breaking point, the material does not [...] "neck down" [...] (get smaller at the weakest point) and then tear apart. Instead, the metal necks and <b>work</b> <b>hardens,</b> increasing the tensile strength to very high levels, sometimes as high as 2000 MPa.

40|$|Abstract. An SUS 316 L and a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy powders {{are treated}} by Mechanical Milling (MM) process, {{which is one}} of SPD processes, and then {{sintered}} by Hot Roll Sintering (HRS) process. The HRS process consolidates powder by hot rolling of an evacuated metal pipe filled with the powder at elevated temperatures. Those MM powders have a heavy deformed microstructure at the surface region and have a <b>work</b> <b>hardened</b> microstructure in the core region of the powder. In the surface region, a nano grain structure forms after the MM treatment in both materials. In case of the SUS 316 L powder, such a nano grain structure consists of an equiaxed nano ferrite (c) grains which has transformed from nano austenite (i) grains. Volume fraction of the c phase decreases with distance from the surface of powder. During HRS the (c + i) nano-duplex structure changes to (sigma (u) + i) nano-duplex structure by transformation of the c to the u phase. Thus, the SUS 316 L HRS material consists of a hybrid structure. That is, a (u + i) nano-duplex structure at the powder shell region, and a <b>work</b> <b>hardened</b> i structure in the powder core region. In case of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V MM powder, though no remarkable transformation occurs, a heavy deformed shell and <b>work</b> <b>hardened</b> core hybrid structure is also produced in the powder. By HRS the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V MM powder demonstrates a hybrid structure consists of an equiaxed nano grain structure and a coarse martensit...|$|R
