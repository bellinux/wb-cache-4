It was {{produced}} by ITV Studios (formerly known as Granada) until 2013, when Shiver Productions took over. First broadcast in January 2005, the show has either four or five amateur chefs competing against each other hosting a dinner party for the other contestants. Each competitor then rates the host's performance with the winner winning a £1,000 cash prize which is announced by the competitor who hosted the dinner party on Friday. An element of comedy {{is added to the}} show through comedian Dave Lamb, who provides a dry and bitingly sarcastic narration.|$|E
25|$|The 1992 film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> a prequel to the TV series. It {{tells of}} the {{investigation}} into the murder of Teresa Banks and the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer. Director David Lynch and most of the television cast returned for the film, with the notable exceptions of Lara Flynn Boyle, who declined to return as Laura's best friend Donna Hayward and was replaced by Moira Kelly, and Sherilyn Fenn due to scheduling conflicts. Also, Kyle MacLachlan returned reluctantly as he wanted to avoid typecasting, so his presence in the film is smaller than originally planned. Lynch originally shot about five hours of footage that was subsequently cut down to two hours and fourteen minutes. Most of the deleted scenes feature additional characters from the television series who ultimately did not appear in the finished film. Around ninety minutes of these scenes are included in the complete series Blu-ray that was released on July 29, 2014.|$|E

500|$|Ray Harding {{wrote the}} script for [...] "Episode 523". Bruce Andrews from Charles Sturt University noted that {{it is one of}} only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast. The {{producers}} asked Rod Hardy to direct the episode, due to his experience of directing other television weddings. Hardy believed that [...] "the magic of the episode" [...] is captured best in two close-up shots of Scott and Charlene. The director recalled [...] "The image that stays <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> the close-up of Kylie as she arrives and then the close-up on Jason's face, and those two looks epitomised what the whole scene was about." [...] The episode was shot [...] "in great secrecy" [...] three months before it was broadcast on Australian television. The shoot was initially delayed due to bad weather. Due to a limited budget, there were very few extras on set and crew were asked to stand in at the church instead. The scenes were shot in soft focus, creating [...] "a halo effect" [...] around Charlene as she walked up the aisle.|$|E

2500|$|After Fire Walk with Me was released, Lynch {{reportedly}} planned {{two more}} films {{that would have}} continued and then concluded the series' narrative. But in a 2001 interview, {{he said that the}} Twin Peaks franchise is [...] "dead as a doornail." [...] In 2014, however, it was announced that the series would continue with Lynch involved. Lynch said that Twin Peaks: Fire Walk <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> very important to understanding what’s coming. In 2017, the third season of the TV series was released.

2500|$|In Ethics, Dietrich Bonhoeffer {{pointed out}} another conflict, between /("He {{who is not}} <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters") and /("For he who is not against us [...] is for us [...] "). Bonhoeffer called these two sayings [...] "the claim to exclusiveness and the claim to totality". [...] He argued that both are {{necessary}} and that [...] "The cross of Christ makes both sayings true." [...] D.A. Carson commented similarly, adding he thought {{there are two different}} contexts where /describe the attitude listeners are to have to other possible disciples: when in doubt, be inclusive, while /describe the standard listeners should apply to themselves: be in no doubt of one's own standing. Other commentaries argue that, juxtaposed, the sayings declare the impossibility of neutrality.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} {{language}} foregrounding authority by {{references to the}} crown and throne is found in Act 2, Scene 1, as Edward laments {{the death of his}} father; [...] "His dukedom and his chair <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> left" [...] (l.90), to which Richard answers, specifically foregrounding the issue of language and the importance of words, [...] "For 'chair and dukedom', 'throne and kingdom' say" [...] (l.93).

After decapitating York, Margaret points out the head to Henry, saying, [...] "Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy/That sought to be encumbered with your crown" [...] (2.2.2–3).

Edward then says to Margaret, [...] "You that are king, though he do wear the crown" [...] (2.2.90). Later, in Act 2, Scene 6, when Edward is blaming Margaret for the civil war, he says to Henry that if she hadn't provoked the House of York [...] "thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace" [...] (l.19). He then says to Warwick, [...] "For in thy shoulder do I build my seat" [...] (l.99).
