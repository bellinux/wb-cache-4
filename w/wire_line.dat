2500|$|In hollow waveguides (single conductor), TEM {{waves are}} not possible, since Maxwell's Equations will give that the {{electric}} field must then have zero divergence and zero curl and {{be equal to}} zero at boundaries, resulting in a zero field (or, equivalently, [...] with boundary conditions guaranteeing only the trivial solution). [...] This contrasts with two-conductor transmission lines used at lower frequencies; coaxial cable, parallel <b>wire</b> <b>line</b> and stripline, in which TEM mode is possible. [...] Additionally, the propagating modes (i.e. TE and TM) inside the waveguide can be mathematically expressed as the superposition of TEM waves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For {{designing}} PCBs (printed circuit boards), it is {{very important}} to find out the locations and the frequencies giving large peak values of the voltages. Electrostatic capacity exists between the <b>wire</b> <b>lines</b> of PCBs. The characteristics of the capacitors depend on the distance between the <b>wire</b> <b>lines.</b> From this reason, we have to analyze circuits including nonlinear capacitors. In that case, the frequency characteristics become distorted, compared with linear circuits. If the distortion becomes large, the characteristics has unstable region. In this article, we propose a SPICE-oriented algorithm to analyze frequency characteristics with unstable region and to find the peaks of the frequency characteristics. I...|$|R

50|$|Currently {{the policy}} being {{set forth by}} the FCC has two {{different}} levels of regulation. One for fixed line, <b>wire</b> <b>line</b> communications {{and the other for}} wireless communications. Their current tenets strictly regulate network neutrality on <b>wire</b> <b>line</b> networks. However the commission is placing as many mandates on wireless communications. This means that wireless telecommunications providers are not permitted to block any website, but they may block applications and services unless they are direct competitors to the provider's content or services. This difference between the two technologies creates a major loophole in telecommunications policy, as most providers have already begun the shift from wired to wireless network infrastructures.|$|E
