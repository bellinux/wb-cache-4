500|$|McKinley's most {{controversial}} Cabinet appointment {{was that of}} John Sherman as Secretary of State. Sherman had an outstanding reputation but old age was fast reducing his abilities. [...] McKinley needed to have Hanna appointed to the Senate so Senator Sherman was moved up. [...] Sherman's mental faculties were decaying even in 1896; this was widely spoken of in political circles, but McKinley {{did not believe the}} rumors. Nevertheless, McKinley sent his cousin, William McKinley Osborne, to have dinner with the 73-year-old senator; he reported back that Sherman seemed as lucid as ever. McKinley wrote once the appointment was announced, [...] "the stories regarding Senator Sherman's 'mental decay' are without foundation... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> last I was convinced both of his perfect health, physically and mentally, and that the prospects of life were remarkably good." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E
500|$|Santoro was {{recommended}} by Paulo Autran, who acted {{along with him}} in the TV series Hilda Furacão. After seeing Santoro's acting, he was Bodanzky's first choice for Neto's role; [...] "I never even thought of another person. ... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> I was impressed with his giving of himself to the role/character. I knew that Neto was him." [...] Santoro read the book and was [...] "shocked," [...] which led him to contact Carrano; after talking to the author, he was convinced to take the role. He found the story [...] "very moving, but kind of over the top," [...] and was worried about overacting and making the character [...] "fake." [...] To prepare himself for the role, he talked with interns and watched productions on the subject, among them the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Miloš Forman.|$|E

500|$|As the 1915 {{season was}} set to get underway, Coach Yost reported, [...] "Johnny {{told me he was}} feeling fine <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> recently, {{although}} he doesn’t weigh as much as he used to." [...] Despite Yost's hopes, Maulbetsch fell far short of the prior year's performance in 1915. [...] He was several pounds lighter after the illness and surgery, and it was noted that [...] "a few pounds means much to a man of Maulbetsch's weight." [...] In the opening game against Lawrence, Maulbetsch scored three touchdowns, but he was [...] "woefully weak on interference." [...] Playing against Mount Union, Maulbetsch made several big gains, including a 50-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. [...] His difficulties returned in the season's third game against Marietta, as [...] "Maulbetsch was powerless to stop the Marietta forward pass, all of the successful ones being directed toward his side of the line." ...|$|E
500|$|Downey {{acknowledged}} the potential controversy over his role: [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, it's always about how well you commit to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell , I would've stayed home." [...] Jackson stated: [...] "When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> [...] he, like, became a black man ...It was just good acting. It was weird on the set because he would keep going with the character. He's a method actor." [...] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: [...] "When people see the movie— {{in the context of the}} film, he's playing a method actor who's gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously." [...] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.|$|E
2500|$|According to Yevgenii Pasternak, [...] "I couldn't {{recognize}} {{my father}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> that evening. Pale, lifeless face, tired painful eyes, and only {{speaking about the}} same thing: 'Now it all doesn’t matter, I declined the Prize.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In Don's first 15 games, he hit [...]345 with 6 {{home runs}} and 21 RBI, {{challenging}} early for the NL's rare triple crown title. [...] On Demeter's early success, Philadelphia Phillies manager Eddie Sawyer remarked, [...] "Seldom have I seen a player come so far so fast. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{for the first time}} late last season, he was just another journeyman. Now he's a real good-looking ball player." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{picked him}} for the first Test, and on the very first {{occasion}} he touched a ball in Test rugby he found himself opposed one-on-one by Stu Wilson, then widely rated the number-one winger in the world, in the middle of Lancaster Park. Campese stood Wilson up and ran around him so easily that he might have been playing Test Rugby for years. He did it once or twice again before the match was over and on one occasion scored a try. I was enthused, and so was the media. They wrote of him in glowing terms next day... I don't believe I have ever lost the sense of wonder at his ability which I felt <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> run around Stu Wilson on Lancaster Park." ...|$|E
2500|$|And in {{the same}} year, Gibb was seen around town with a Hungarian singer Sarolta Zalatnay, but he later insisted: [...] "I'm not a Casanova and it's all most unfortunate. I've never been publicised to be available. Because of the stories of my affairs with Lulu and Sarolta, the fans feel, 'Oh, we won't bother about Maurice because he's always got a steady girl'. Gibb {{recalled}} the first meeting with his future-in-laws, [...] "I went up to Glasgow to meet Lu's parents, and I was told that Billy, who is younger than Lu, {{would be at the}} station to meet me. I got off the train and was walking along the platform <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> I didn't need to speak, I knew it was Billy and I went up to him and said, 'You're Billy, aren't you?', he said, 'You must be Maurice' and we had met". The couple married on 18 February 1969 and divorced in 1973. Their careers and his heavy drinking forced them apart and they divorced, childless, in 1973. [...] Gibb later stated they both drank: [...] "We didn't have any responsibilities, we'd just party." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, EastEnders {{scriptwriter}} Tony Jordan revealed {{how it was}} {{his idea}} to bring Den back in 2003. Jordan had started working at EastEnders in 1989, after Den had already left the series. Jordan {{had always wanted to}} write material for Den and Angie and so he campaigned for the return of Den for many years. He told the Daily Mirror, [...] "At story conferences I'd say, 'How do we know he's dead? They never found a body'. Eventually, just to shut me up, they made me write an episode where Den's body was found and identified by his ring." [...] Jordan finally got his way in 2003; however, according to the writer, Leslie Grantham's internet sex scandal spelled the demise of the character. Commenting on this, Jordan said, [...] "If [...] hadn't come out I think it would have worked and he'd still be in the show. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> on screen after those revelations came out, suddenly I couldn't believe in the character any more. I was starting to love the character and buying into all of it, but after that I saw him as Leslie Grantham - not Den Watts. He was older, and flawed in all the wrong ways. I think a lot of viewers felt the same, and the cast as well, probably." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was like}} the face of some ancient archangel, judging justly after heroic wars. There was {{laughter}} in the eyes, and in the mouth honour and sorrow. There was the same white hair, the same great, grey-clad shoulders that I had seen from behind. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> from behind I was certain he was an animal, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> in front I {{knew he was a}} god." ...|$|E
