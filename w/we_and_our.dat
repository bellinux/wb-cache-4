2500|$|Deleuze adapts the {{doctrine}} of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference. [...] "With univocity, however, {{it is not the}} differences which are and must be: it is being which is Difference, {{in the sense that it}} is said of difference. Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is <b>we</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being." [...] Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one substance, God or Nature. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating process, an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding. Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula [...] "pluralism = monism".|$|E

[...] Moon said that, [...] "Nance has done a really good job of providing detailed information about the growth and activities of ISIS components". He praised the author's ability to structure the book as a reference resource, writing, [...] "there is a wealth of factual information on ISIS".
