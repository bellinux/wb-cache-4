5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{to explore the}} island of Rasay, which could be done only on foot, I last night obtained my fellow-traveller’s permission to leave him for a day, he being unable to take so hardy a walk. Old Mr Malcolm M’Cleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany me, was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and I, attended by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance {{on the top of}} Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.|$|E

25|$|We {{would often}} cross the broad avenue with the martial {{sounding}} name... The one that separated Courbevoie from Puteaux. It {{was in the}} peaceful garden of that welcoming household {{only a few years}} before the terrible year of 1914 that forms were born that, 50 years later, one would still think were new! <b>We</b> <b>returned</b> there often and soon we were spending our Sunday afternoons not merely conversing about aesthetic novelties but rather kicking a ball around or indulging in a spot of archery.|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as <b>we</b> <b>returned,</b> towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E
500|$|Military {{pressure}} was stepped up still further; during summer [...] "the training of all Albanian officers, cadets, and noncoms in the Soviet Union or the East European satellite countries {{was brought to}} a stop. Since then, there has been not a single Albanian studying at a military academy in the Eastern Bloc. It has been impossible, therefore, for the Tirana Government to keep its army up-to-date on military theory." [...] In March Albania had not been invited to attend {{a meeting of the}} Warsaw Treaty states. Hoxha later recalled that [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> from Moscow , the provocations at the [...] base were increased and in order to exert pressure on and impress us, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, Firyubin, came to Tirana with two other 'deputies': the first deputy-chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army and Navy, Antonov, and the deputy chief of the Supreme Staff of the Soviet Navy, Sergeyev. They came allegedly 'to reach agreement', but in fact they brought us an ultimatum: The Vlora base must be put completely and solely under Soviet command, which was to be subordinate to the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> down Broadway, {{it seemed to}} me that the city was flying before some awful calamity. [...] "Why," [...] said I, [...] "Colonel, what under heaven is the matter? Everyone appears to be {{pitching}} out their furniture, and packing it off." [...] He laughed, and said this was the general [...] "moving day." [...] Such a sight nobody ever saw unless it was in this same city. It seemed a kind of frolic, as if they were changing houses just for fun. Every street was crowded with carts, drays, and people. So the world goes. It would take a good deal to get me out of my log-house; but here, I understand, many persons [...] "move" [...] every year.|$|E

2500|$|From 1859 until 1866, the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia had a red-yellow-blue Romanian tricolor, with {{horizontal}} stripes, {{as national}} flag. The flag was described properly in Almanahul român din 1866: [...] "a tricolor flag, divided in three stripes, red, yellow {{and blue and}} laid out horizontally: red above, blue below and yellow in the middle". Although the Ottoman Empire did not allow the United Principalities {{to have their own}} symbols, the new flag gained a degree of international recognition. Relating prince Cuza's May–June 1864 journey to Constantinople, doctor Carol Davila observed: [...] "The Romanian flag was raised on the great mast, the Sultan's kayaks awaited us, the guard was armed, the Grand Vizier at the door... The Prince, quiet, dignified, concise in his speech, spent 20 minutes with the Sultan, who then came to review us… Once again, the Grand Vizier led the Prince to the main gate and <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to the Europe Palace, the Romanian flag still fluttering on the mast...".|$|E
2500|$|From the {{earliest}} days of Zionist settlement, Jewish immigrants wrote popular folk music. At first, songs were based on borrowed melodies from German, Russian, or traditional Jewish folk music with new lyrics written in Hebrew. Starting in the early 1920s, however, Jewish settlers made a conscious effort to create a new Hebrew style of music, a style that would tie them to their earliest Hebrew origins and that would differentiate them from the style of the Jewish diaspora of Eastern Europe, which they viewed as weak. This new style borrowed elements from Arabic and, to a lesser extent, traditional Yemenite and eastern Jewish styles: the songs were often homophonic (that is, without clear harmonic character), modal, and limited in range. [...] "The huge change in our lives demands new modes of expression," [...] wrote composer and music critic Menashe Ravina in 1943. [...] "... and, just as in our language <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to our historical past, so has our ear turned to the music of the east ... as an expression of our innermost feelings." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} [...] "Wrestling with Zion," [...] {{he urged the}} Jews [...] "not to provoke the anger of the native people by doing them wrong...we should be {{cautious}} in our dealings with a foreign people among whom <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to live, to handle these people with love and respect and, needless to say, with justice and good judgment. [...] And what do our brothers do? [...] Exactly the opposite! [...] They were slaves in their Diasporas, and suddenly they find themselves with unlimited freedom, wild freedom that only a country like Turkey [...] can offer. [...] This sudden change has planted despotic tendencies in their hearts, as always happens to former slaves [...] [...] They deal with the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, trespass unjustly, beat them shamefully for no sufficient reason, and even boast about their actions. [...] There is no one to stop the flood {{and put an end}} to this despicable and dangerous tendency. [...] Our brothers indeed were right when they said that the Arab only respects he who exhibits bravery and courage. [...] But when these people feel that the law is on their rival's side and, even more so, if they are right to think their rival's actions are unjust and oppressive, then, even if they are silent and endlessly reserved, they keep their anger in their hearts. And these people will be revengeful like no other.|$|E

2500|$|When the two steamers {{began their}} journey {{down the coast}} again, it wasn't long before they found three of the prahus. The water was shallow that the Rainbow had the Jolly Bachelor in tow and her captain, the rajah mudah, {{intended}} to release the other ship {{as soon as they}} were in a good firing position. Brooke then asked his Sarawakian followers if the three vessels in front of him were that of pirates, to be sure, and they said yes, so as soon as the Sulus realised they were under attack they began killing the captives while fleeing to dangerous waters. Father McDougall later wrote the following; [...] "So we took to our stations, loaded our guns, and prepared for action. The leading boat had already gained on the other two and was going nearly as fast as the steamer herself. I never saw fellows pull so. We put on all steam, cast off the Jolly, and tried to get in between her and the point, but she beat us, and passed inside of us into shallow water, where we could not follow. Then she opened her fire upon us, which <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> with interest. She, like the others, had no heavy guns, but they all carried three long brass swivels, called lelahs, and plenty of rifles and muskets." [...] The bishop went on to say that one of the captured pirates revealed to him that each of their swivels took seven men to lift and there was forty rifles and muskets aboard each boat, or more.|$|E
