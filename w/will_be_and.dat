5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

25|$|Hardin's ecophilosophy reveals one {{particular}} method to mitigate healthcare costs.

25|$|Through all {{entities}} in its publicâ€“private system, the US spends more {{per capita than}} any other nation in the world, but is the only wealthy industrialized {{country in the world}} that lacks some form of universal healthcare. In March 2010, the US Congress passed regulatory reform of the American health insurance system. However, since this legislation is not fundamental healthcare reform, it is unclear what its effect <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>and</b> as the new legislation is implemented in stages, with the last provision in effect in 2018, it will be some years before any empirical evaluation of the full effects on the comparison could be determined.|$|E
25|$|Lauren Cassidy, {{played by}} Karle Warren: She is Amy's daughter, {{six years old}} {{at the start of the}} series. A mostly well-adjusted girl, she is going through the pains of {{childhood}} and preadolescence with divorced parents, but a loving family. She struggles over her father's relationship with Leesha, whom she likes at first. When Lauren is 12, her uncle Peter takes her for her haircut and she returns home with her long straight hair cut into a hipper, shoulder-length cut. Her boyfriend Victor turns out to be the son of her mother's boyfriend, David McClaren, which causes Lauren to feel awkward and disgusted. When Amy becomes pregnant with David's child, Lauren reveals what a total blow to her social life this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>and</b> is furious. She later becomes accepting and supporting of her mother after she miscarries. Toward the end of the series, Lauren begins to hang out with a group of friends who embrace the straight edge culture, which puts her at odds with her mother.|$|E

25|$|Party Shuffle {{was renamed}} iTunes DJ in iTunes 8. When iTunes was updated to 8.1, {{quite a few}} {{features}} were added to iTunes DJ. The free Apple Remote application for the iPhone and iPod Touch was also updated {{at this time that}} added a new iTunes DJ option in the settings screen when the user is connected to a Wi-Fi network and a new song request feature is enabled in iTunes DJ on the hosts. Along with the song request feature voting on songs in the queue was added, the more votes a song gets the higher in the queue it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>and</b> the sooner it will be played. Song voting can only be done when song requesting is enabled and in two ways: the first by right clicking on a song in the iTunes DJ queue on the host's computer in iTunes, the second is in the Remote application ether connected with the iTunes DJ option by a guest or by the host in the full playlist section. When song requesting is enabled a customizable welcome message is displayed below the host's shared library name in the button used to connect to iTunes DJ.|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} lossy audio encoding, such {{as creating}} an MP3 data stream, {{there is a}} trade-off {{between the amount of}} data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a bit rate, which specifies how many kilobits per second of audio are desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 data stream <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> <b>and,</b> generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, compression artifacts (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard. A sample of applause compressed or an excerpt of triangle instrument with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings on perceptual codecs tend to avoid using this type of extremely critical sound materials however this type of artifacts generated by percussive sounds is barely perceptible on the MP3 format due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band filterbank of Layer II on which the MP3 format is based.|$|E
