5|$|The U.S. KAL007 Victims' Association, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Hans Ephraimson-Abt, successfully lobbied U.S. Congress and the airline industry to accept an agreement that <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> that future victims of airline incidents would be compensated quickly and fairly by increasing compensation and lowering the burden of proof of airliner misconduct. This legislation has had far reaching effects for the victims of subsequent aircraft disasters.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{had played}} several matches already, which was unusual as the Super Cup would {{normally}} {{have been the}} first significant match the two teams had played. Liverpool had been forced to enter the first qualifying round of the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, despite being champions. They had failed to finish in the top four during the 2004–05 FA Premier League, which <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> Champions League qualification. UEFA granted them special dispensation to enter the competition as holders. Meanwhile, CSKA Moscow {{were in the middle of}} their domestic season. At the time of this match they were second in the 2005 Russian Premier League, seven points behind leaders Lokomotiv Moscow.|$|E
5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in July 2000, the Avalanche, Nuggets and Pepsi Center {{were finally}} bought by real estate {{entrepreneur}} Stan Kroenke in a $450million deal. Kroenke is the brother-in-law of the Lauries; his wife Ann is Nancy Laurie's sister. Liberty retained only a 6.5% stake {{of the sports}} franchises. As part of the deal, Kroenke placed the teams into a trust that <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> the teams will stay in Denver until at least 2025. After the deal, Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, some {{manufacturers}} (notably Samsung) introduced SSD controllers that extended {{the concept of}} BGC to analyze the file system used on the SSD, to identify recently deleted files and unpartitioned space. Samsung claimed that this <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> that even systems (operating systems and SATA controller hardware) which do not support TRIM could achieve similar performance. The operation of the Samsung implementation appeared to assume and require an NTFS file system. It is not clear if this feature is still available in currently shipping SSDs from these manufacturers. Systematic data corruption has been reported on these drives {{if they are not}} formatted properly using MBR and NTFS.|$|E
5|$|In 793 the {{vulnerability}} of the English east coast was exposed when the monastery at Lindisfarne was looted by Vikings and a year later Jarrow was also attacked, events which Steven Plunkett reasons <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> that the East Anglians were governed firmly. Æthelberht's claim to be a king descended from the Wuffingas dynasty (suggested by the use of a Roman she-wolf and the title REX on his coins) could be because of a need for strong kingship {{as a result of the}} Viking attacks.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} spring Augustus {{suffered}} a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> {{the continuation of the}} Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.|$|E
5|$|Jervis had the {{reputation}} as a disciplinarian and {{put in place a}} new system that <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.|$|E
5|$|Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education was {{a runaway}} best-seller. During {{the eighteenth century}} alone, Some Thoughts was {{published}} in at least 53 editions: 25 English, 16 French, six Italian, three German, two Dutch, and one Swedish. It was also excerpted in novels such as Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740–1), and it formed the theoretical basis of much children's literature, particularly that of the first successful children's publisher, John Newbery. According to James Secord, an eighteenth-century scholar, Newbery included Locke's educational advice to legitimise the new genre of children's literature. Locke's imprimatur <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> the genre's success.|$|E

5|$|The {{guns were}} {{controlled}} from a Battery Commander's Post on the roof, from where commands {{to the gun}} detachments could be relayed via voice pipes. Three depression range finders were installed on the roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns' targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes. Rather than firing all the guns at once, the guns were positioned {{so that they could}} be fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in Europe was shaky {{during this time}} and Sweden was going through financial problems. Charles XI's guardians decided to negotiate an alliance with France in 1671. This <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> that Sweden would not be isolated {{if there was a}} war, and that the national finances would improve thanks to French subsidies. France directed its aggression against the Dutch in 1672, and by the spring of 1674, Sweden was forced to take part by directing forces towards Brandenburg, under the lead of Karl Gustav Wrangel.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completing}} training McKellar {{was deemed}} to have exceptional eyesight which {{earned him a}} reputation as a good marksman in air-to-air combat. Yet, paradoxically, when shooting with his rifle he was a well below average shot – a trait he shared with some other successful pilots. MacKellar was a keen sportsman. He believed physical fitness was a critical attribute in aerial combat; fitness, he believed, <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> that the mind and body were always at their peak of alertness, and enable a pilot to react swiftly within a fluid battle situation.|$|E

5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E
5|$|Insistent {{that his}} party take an equal {{role in the}} {{coalition}} government, Bruxner formed a good working relationship and long-lasting friendship with Stevens that <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> the government's stability. The Stevens government had significant success, reducing Lang's 2 million pound deficit by 75%. However, one significant problem was that Stevens had trouble with an unruly backbench, and increasingly depended upon Bruxner and the Country Party. As Deputy Premier, Bruxner saw himself as loyal to Stevens, but still managed to push through several initiatives that specifically benefited rural areas, including another royal commission {{on the question of}} new States in 1935. The May 1935 election saw Stevens and Bruxner retaining government against a divided and fractious Labor opposition and Bruxner was returned unopposed again in his seat.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1905, President Roosevelt further {{consolidated}} {{power in}} Panama by appointing Magoon Minister to Panama, to replace John Barrett. This put Magoon in the unique {{position of being}} both a governor of a U.S. territory and a diplomat to the country of which that territory was an enclave. During the tenure of Governor Davis, there had been friction between him and Minister Barrett. This double appointment <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> that the two roles could not work at cross-purposes. Magoon would draw two salaries in the arrangement, an issue which would come up later to haunt him. With influential posts in both Panama proper and the Canal Zone, Magoon was an exceptionally powerful man on the Isthmus.|$|E

5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{humanity}} {{would be able}} to create life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> that this creation would {{have a better chance of}} both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators. Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.|$|E
5|$|Soul Reaver 2 {{is set in}} Nosgoth, {{a fictional}} land with fantasy aspects. In the first game in the series, , the vampire Kain embarks on a journey to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth—nine supernatural edifices which are {{inextricably}} tied {{to the health of}} the land, but become corrupted. During his adventure, Moebius, a manipulative sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating the destruction of the vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After restoring eight of the Pillars, Kain discovers that he would need to sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.|$|E
5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government. Since the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme <b>would</b> <b>ensure</b> that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament. According to him, this would be beneficial to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans {{a chance to see}} what an opposition can or cannot do. When the first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme, between three and six NCMPs were allowed in Parliament. The Constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine NCMPs in Parliament.|$|E
