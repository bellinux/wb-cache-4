5|$|Ark Royal <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> into service, {{delivering}} {{aircraft to}} Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation Halberd in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting. The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who was losing {{as much as}} ⅓ of his supplies from Italy to submarines and bombers based there. Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U-boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, {{against the advice of}} Großadmiral Raeder.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{served as}} the {{flagship}} for the Jamestown Exposition in mid-1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary {{of the founding of}} the Jamestown colony. She later sailed with the Great White Fleet on a circumnavigation of the Earth to showcase the US Navy's growing fleet of blue-water-capable ships.

5|$|Debs {{attended}} public school, {{dropping out}} of high school at age 14. He took a job with the Vandalia Railroad cleaning grease from the trucks of freight engines for fifty cents a day. He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken locomotive fireman failed to report for work, Debs <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> into service as a night fireman. He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more than a dollar a night for the next three and half years.|$|E
5|$|Flick {{began his}} career in semi-professional {{baseball}} and played in minor league baseball for two years. He was noticed by George Stallings, {{the manager of the}} Phillies, who signed Flick as a reserve outfielder. Flick <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> into a starting role in 1898 when an injury forced another player to retire. He excelled as a starter. Flick jumped to the Athletics in 1902, but an court injunction prevented him from playing in Pennsylvania. He joined the Naps, where he continued to play for the remainder of his major league career, which was curtailed by a stomach ailment.|$|E
5|$|Henry II's biographer, the {{historian}} W. L. Warren, suggests that Hilary <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> {{to bring the}} case against Battle Abbey by his cathedral chapter, and that Hilary did not pursue the case vigorously. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting, sees {{the case against the}} abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career of support for the royal position against the papacy, and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.|$|E
5000|$|A related {{downshifting}} {{technique is}} called heel-and-toe, {{in which the}} brake and accelerator pedals <b>are</b> <b>pressed</b> simultaneously. Classically, the brake <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> with the ball of the right foot and the accelerator pedal {{is controlled by the}} right heel, while the clutch pedal <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> by the left foot. However, variants are possible, with the brake and accelerator pressed by sides of the right foot.|$|R

5|$|In September 1955, {{the sole}} {{remaining}} Pulqui II prototype <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> into {{action in the}} Revolución Libertadora, a coup d'état led by General Eduardo Lonardi against Perón. The exact details of its participation are unknown, but when rebel forces commanded by Lonardi captured Córdoba as their first conquest, together with the Meteor F 4s fighter-bombers stationed at the Córdoba Escuela De Aviación - SACE (Military Aviation School), the IAe 33 was enlisted in the struggle. After flying combat missions against Perónist stalwarts, it later appeared in a flyover during the victory parade at Córdoba celebrating {{the triumph of the}} coup over loyalist forces.|$|E
5|$|No Line on the Horizon was {{released}} in five physical formats, three of which—the digipak, magazine, and box formats—were limited editions. The standard jewel case release contained a 24-page booklet. The LP vinyl release <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> on two black discs and contained a 16-page booklet. The digipak release had a 36-page booklet and a poster, which was {{also included in the}} box release. A 60-page magazine was included in the magazine release. Linear was a downloadable feature in the digipak and magazine formats, and was a bonus DVD in the box release, which also contained a 64-page hardcover book.|$|E
5|$|Saien <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> {{immediately}} into Japanese service. During the Japanese {{invasion of}} Taiwan later in 1895, she was assigned together with six other ships to bombard the coastal defences of Takow (Kaohsiung). The fleet arrived {{off the coast}} on 12 October, warning foreign vessels that the attack would begin at 7am the following morning. The Japanese ships attacked on schedule, firing on the defenses until they stopped returning fire after half an hour. At 2pm, the ships closed {{the distance to the}} beach and began launching boats into the water with troops. Their forces had successfully captured the coastal fort by 2:35pm.|$|E
50|$|During normal typing on a {{conventional}} computer keyboard, only one key <b>is</b> usually <b>pressed</b> {{at any given}} time, then released before the next key <b>is</b> <b>pressed.</b> However, this <b>is</b> not always the case. When using modifier keys such as Shift or Control, the user intentionally holds the modifier key(s) while pressing and releasing another key. Rapid typists may also sometimes inadvertently press a key before releasing the previous one. Certain unusual forms of keyboarding require multiple keys to <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> or held down simultaneously; for example, Braille2000 keying requires {{as many as six}} keys to <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> at once analogous to the six dot keys of a Braille typewriter. Some computer games require keys (other than the usual modifier keys) to be held down while others <b>are</b> <b>pressed</b> and released.|$|R

5|$|The first 23 cab car conversions, which {{included}} full {{removal of the}} propulsion gear and roof hump, took place around 1988. Ten (9630–9639) were designated for West Coast routes including the San Diegan, six (9640–9645) for the Atlantic City Express, and seven (9646–9652) for Chicago-based regional services. Coach #809 <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> into cab car service with minimal modifications, making 24 active cab cars by 1990. Five more - #822 and 825–828 - soon followed. When the P40 locomotives were produced with 800-series numbering in the early 1990s, the later cab cars were renumbered 9709, 9822, and 9825–9828.|$|E
5|$|Turning to coaching, Cook {{took over}} as {{the manager of the}} Cleveland Barons in the International-American Hockey League (IAHL) in the 1937–38 season. He {{inherited}} a team that had struggled the season before and led it to a respectable season, winning 34 of 50 games played combined between the regular season and playoffs. Cook <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> into service as a player as a result of injuries. His team was able to dress only 10 of 17 players in the deciding game of the Barons' playoff series against the Syracuse Stars. Cook played a regular shift in the game, but the Barons lost, 3–2, in the fourth overtime period.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} since its {{original}} release, 30 Seconds to Mars was made available in Australia on April 7, 2007 on Virgin Records. EMI re-issued a limited edition of the album in Japan on December 2, 2009. To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the album, Thirty Seconds to Mars hosted an event called MarsX on August 27, 2012. It was broadcast worldwide through the online platform VyRT and included live playback and commentary of the record with the band, interactive discussion focused on the formation of Thirty Seconds to Mars, and exclusive acoustic performances. The album was also re-issued as a limited edition picture disc. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the long-playing vinyl, Universal Music re-issued a double LP of 30 Seconds to Mars on September 23, 2016. A re-release on red translucent vinyl <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> the following year in a limited edition for the 15th anniversary of the album.|$|E

5|$|Construction was financed {{through a}} loan of NOK218 million from Handelsbanken, which was secured on the revenue {{which would be}} {{generated}} {{from the sale of}} Hamar stadion and Fuglsetmyra. However, the bank was not willing to lend money secured on the basis of sales price of Hamar stadion being based on the re-regulation of the lot. The municipality <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> on time by the possibility of NFF denying Ham-Kam the right to play at Briskeby. Hamar Energi Holding AS (HEH), which owns Hamar Municipality's share of Eidsiva Energi, had large assets. Both HEH and BE1 had as chair Hans Kolstad, who proposed that HEH could issue a guarantee of NOK75 million for BG and BE1—which was issued in September 2007. This allowed construction to start, but the project was still under-financed by NOK50 million. HEH therefore issued another guarantee the same month, for NOK58.75 million. Because of delays in the regulation work, HEH issued another two guarantees, NOK60 million in March and NOK25 million in June 2008.|$|E
5|$|Enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1910, Middleton {{was first}} {{assigned}} to the 29th Infantry Regiment, where {{he worked as a}} clerk. Here he did not become an infantryman as he had hoped, but he <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> into service playing football, a sport strongly endorsed by the army. Following two years of enlisted service, Middleton was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was given the opportunity to compete for an officer's commission. Of the 300 individuals who were vying for a commission, 56 were selected, and four of them, including Middleton, would become general officers. As a new second lieutenant, Middleton was {{assigned to the}} 7th Infantry Regiment in Galveston, Texas, which was soon pressed into service, responding to events created by the Mexican Revolution. Middleton spent seven months doing occupation duty in the Mexican port city of Veracruz, and later was assigned to Douglas, Arizona, where his unit skirmished with some of Pancho Villa's fighters.|$|E
5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> in a colander to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E
