Once this leg was complete, it was extended to its terminus at Phoenixville. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Inch was complete, work began on the third phase of the project, the Little Big Inch.|$|E

5|$|Cooke {{began to}} improve the team {{significantly}} and was responsible for shifts in the Gophers' scheduling that foreshadowed other changes to come. The team never played a YMCA team after the 1903–04 season, and beginning in 1900, began to schedule large neighboring universities that would join Minnesota in Big Ten competition. This shift to playing similar competition helped the Gophers {{to become one of}} the premier programs in the nation. From the 1899–00 to 1903–04 seasons, the Gophers had a 59–6 record. The 1901–02 squad has been retroactively named the national champions by both the Helms Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll; the Premo-Porretta poll also names the 1902–03 Gophers as national champions. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Ten established basketball in 1905, the Gophers won the first two conference titles.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas Jayhawks {{football}} {{program is a}} college football team that represents the University of Kansas in the Big 12 Conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The team has had 36head coaches and one interim head coach since it started playing organized football in 1890 with the nickname Jayhawks. They played their first season without a head coach. Kansas joined the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1907. After several changes, the conference eventually became the Big Eight Conference. The Jayhawks became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Eight disbanded. The Jayhawks have played in 1,179games during their 120seasons.

Four coaches have won conference championships with the Jayhawks: A. R. Kennedy, Bill Hargiss, Sauer and Rodgers.|$|E

The team has had 31head coaches since it started playing organized football in 1890 with the nickname Tigers. Missouri joined the Western Interstate University Football Association in December 1891, later winning the conference championship {{three years in a}} row. The conference disbanded after the 1897 season and Missouri remained independent until joining the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1907. After several changes, the conference eventually became the Big Eight Conference. The Tigers became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Eight disbanded.

The match ended in a no contest <b>when</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Show marked his return to SmackDown! by interfering in the match, chokeslamming both Angle and Guerrero in the process. The following week, Big Show was given two contracts to choose from; one contract to face Guerrero and one contract to face Angle. Big Show signed the contract with Guerrero's name on it. After signing it, Angle and his associate Luther Reigns, threw Guerrero {{out of the ring}} and offered Big Show a handshake.

25|$|Lake {{fishing for}} pike {{from the shore}} is {{especially}} effective during spring, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> pike move into the shallows to spawn in weedy areas, and later many remain there to feed on other spawning coarse fish species to regain their condition after spawning. Smaller jack pike often remain in the shallows for their own protection, and for the small fish food available there. For the hot summer and during inactive phases, the larger female pike tend to retire to deeper water and/or places with better cover. This gives the boat angler good fishing {{during the summer and}} winter seasons. Trolling (towing a fairy or bait behind a moving boat) is a popular technique.|$|E
