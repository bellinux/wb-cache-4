On September21, the Hurricane Hunters observed a circulation, <b>which</b> <b>indicated</b> a tropical depression had formed {{east of the}} northern Leeward Islands. It moved to the west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Helene on September23. The next day Helene became a hurricane, aided by an anticyclone aloft.

As the hurricane approached the Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified as the eye became visible on radar, and Helene reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) {{on the morning of}} September27. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the northeast, and Helene came within 10mi (15km) of the coast of North Carolina. It slowly weakened, {{and at the same time}} its size expanded. On September29, Helene became extratropical as it was moving over Newfoundland. The remnants continued to the northeast, later turning to the southeast and dissipating on October4 just west of Great Britain.|$|E

He ordered his ships to be laid up; the confidential materials carried aboard were destroyed and their ammunition magazines were flooded.

During this process, the IV Scouting Group moved to Stettin.

The type of the research is descriptive qualitative research and this research uses documentation and observation methods to get the data. Then, the technique of analyzing data are identifying the words which include affixes, analyzing the words that are containing affixes, and drawing conclusion based on data analysis. The data are words consisting affixes taken from the articles on the magazine. The writer concern with three articles which are entitled: “New routes for the postman”, “Living with Risk”, “Indonesia Partnership Landscape” as object of the study. The research finding of the study shows that the types affixes and the data of this research consists of 310 English affixes include prefix “in-”which changes the meaning. Prefix “re-” which changes noun into verb, prefix “un-” which changes adjective into adverb, prefix “dis-” which changes noun into verb, prefix “pre-” <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> present tense, prefix “anti-“ which changes verb into noun.

5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, <b>which</b> <b>indicated</b> the {{long-term}} faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the class by providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E

These are the only two definite albertosaurine genera that have been described, although other undescribed species may exist. Appalachiosaurus was described as a basal tyrannosauroid just outside Tyrannosauridae, although American paleontologist Thomas Holtz published a phylogenetic analysis in 2004 <b>which</b> <b>indicated</b> it was an albertosaurine.

5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler <b>which</b> <b>indicated</b> another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Virginia Weddell hired {{architect}} William Lawrence Bottomley {{and purchased}} antique stone columns from the Spanish Duke of the Infantado to reconstruct an ancient Spanish loggia {{on the southwest}} elevation of the house.

Wall tiles were used <b>which</b> <b>indicated</b> use of gunpowder on the original property. Bottomley, however, was quite critical of his own work and believed his loggia was too symmetrical and lacking in the quality of picturesqueness and romance {{that the rest of the}} house displayed and proposed an octagonal stairway be added on the outside corner. However, his idea was rejected by the Weddells, and the loggia was completed without the staircase in 1946. Bottomley was paid $10,764 and received a ten percent commission for his drawings and construction.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research <b>which</b> <b>indicated</b> that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E
