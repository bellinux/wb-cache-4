In his next {{appearance}} vs. Yale, despite scoring only six points, he posted a career-high 13 rebounds. Teammate Stéphane Lasme added 10 boards. Lappas said, [...] "What {{else do you}} say about Anthony Anderson? He had thirteen rebounds in the game. Its great to see Anthony have six points in the game and win. We couldn't have one a game like this in a million years with Anthony Anderson only scoring six points.

500|$|... "A Change Is Gonna Come" [...] was {{the first}} episode not to feature Washington's character, Burke. Washington was officially fired from the series, {{following}} an on-set incident with Knight and Dempsey, which {{had been in the}} media attention since the commencement of the production for the third season. News reports surfaced that Washington had insulted co-star Knight with a homophobic slur. Following the exposure of the argument, Knight publicly disclosed his homosexuality, which led to Washington's issuing an apology statement, regarding his inappropriate use of words during the incident. The controversy later resurfaced when the cast appeared at the 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, which saw Washington ridiculing homosexuality during an interview, following the statement that denied the occurrence of an on-set incident. After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington publicly apologized at length for using the epithet in reference to Knight. An issue of People disclosed Washington's presence at executive counseling, which led to an undetermined hiatus of his contract. After [...] "Didn't <b>We</b> <b>Almost</b> Have It All?", the last episode Washington appeared in, was filmed, the network decided not to give Washington the possibility of a renewal. In a statement released by his publicist, Washington assesed, [...] "I'm mad as hell and I'm {{not going to take it}} anymore". In another report, Washington stated he was planning to spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, while working on an independent film. In a subsequent interview, Washington highlighted the unfairness in his being let go from the series, considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He also accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on the series. Following his firing, Washington began asserting that racism within the broadcasting media was a primary factor in his dismissal from the series, which drew a critical perspective from Rhimes. During his appearance on Larry King Live, Washington once again denied using a homophobic epithet in reference to Knight.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the court}} issued a {{unanimous}} opinion in Quirin, {{the road to}} the final decision was marked by disagreement. Justice Douglas wrote that it was unfortunate that the court agreed to take the case. He stated that [...] "while it was easy to agree on the original per curiam, <b>we</b> <b>almost</b> fell apart when it came to write the views." [...] Chief Justice Stone, for his part, was very concerned with the court's reputation, specifically because he did not want the court to be perceived as just standing by while six men were executed. [...] He pushed for a unanimous opinion. [...] Despite Stone's views, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote a concurring draft opinion, expressing his disagreement with portions of the Court's opinion. [...] Over time, his concurring draft got longer and longer and evolved into a typewritten memorandum. [...] This memorandum was written two years before his dissent in Korematsu v.

Much of it, including some casting decisions, suggest inspiration by The Godfather." [...] Leonard Maltin also gave the film four stars, calling it a [...] "sensitive, painful, evocative work". Vincent Canby of the New York Times called The Deer Hunter [...] "a big, awkward, crazily ambitious motion picture that comes as close to being a popular epic as any movie about this country since The Godfather. Its vision is that of an original, major new filmmaker."

[...] Roger Ebert, who had given the first film {{two and a half}} stars, gave Spider-Man 2 a perfect four out of four stars, calling it [...] "The best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with Superman (1978)", and praising the film for [...] "effortlessly [...] special effects and a human story, keeping its parallel plots alive and moving." [...] He later called it the fourth best film of 2004." [...] IGN's Richard George felt [...] "Sam Raimi and his writing team delivered an iconic, compelling version of Spider-Man's classic foe... <b>We</b> <b>almost</b> wish there was a way to retroactively add some of these elements to the original character."
