5|$|The {{gull-billed tern}} is an opportunist predator, taking {{a wide variety}} of prey from marine, {{freshwater}} and terrestrial habitats. Depending on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, lizards and amphibians. Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims. The greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and green sea turtle hatchlings, and follows trawlers for discards.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} 2015 to 2020, Avinor {{plans to build}} a new control tower and a new fire- and rescue station. The former is located too close to the runway while the latter is too small and out of date. There are also plans to expand the {{terminal}} building to allow the simultaneous handling of two large and two small aircraft. Finnmark County Municipality is considering establishing a fast ferry service between Kirkenes and Vadsø which would have a service time of 45 minutes. There is a possibility of marketing Kirkenes as an alternative airport for Murmansk as Kirkenes can offer cheaper flights to Oslo than <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> from Murmansk to Moscow.|$|E

Gags may be classified as over-the-mouth type, mouth stuffing type or mouth opening type.|$|E
25|$|Unlike DSLRs, most {{digital cameras}} lack {{the option to}} change the lens. Instead, most compact digital cameras are {{manufactured}} with a zoom lens that covers {{the most commonly used}} fields of view. Having fixed lenses, they are limited to the focal lengths they are manufactured with, except for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> from attachments. Manufacturers have attempted (with increasing success) to overcome this disadvantage by offering extreme ranges of focal length on models known as superzooms, some of which offer far longer focal lengths than readily available DSLR lenses.|$|E

25|$|With philology, archaeology, and art history, {{scholars}} seek {{understanding of}} the history and culture of a civilisation, through critical study of the extant literary and physical artefacts, in order to compose and establish a continual historic narrative of the Ancient World and its peoples. The task is difficult due to a dearth of physical evidence: for example, Sparta was a leading Greek city-state, yet little evidence of it survives to study, and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> comes from Athens, Sparta's principal rival; likewise, the Roman Empire destroyed most evidence (cultural artefacts) of earlier, conquered civilizations, {{such as that of}} the Etruscans.|$|E
25|$|On average, {{an adult}} killer whale {{in the wild}} may eat about three to four percent of their body weight daily, or as much as 227kg (500lb) of food for a six-ton male. Their diet in the wild depends on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>available,</b> and may include fish, walruses, seals, sea lions, penguins, squid, sea turtles, sharks and whales. According to SeaWorld, each of their adult orcas {{receives}} 140 to 240 pounds of food per day, primarily herring, capelin, salmon and mackerel. To maintain their alertness, the killer whales are fed at sporadic intervals throughout the day (as would happen in the wild) and feeding is often combined with training and shows. Each batch of fish is carefully tested to determine its nutritive composition, and each killer whale's weight, activity and health is carefully monitored to determine any special dietary requirements.|$|E
25|$|The {{adoption}} of high power fiber lasers as an industrial material processing tool has been ongoing {{for several years}} and is now expanding into other markets including the medical and scientific markets. One key enhancement enabling penetration into the scientific market has been the improvements in high finesse fiber amplifiers, which are now capable of delivering single frequency linewidths (<5nbsp&kHz) together with excellent beam quality and stable linearly polarized output. Systems meeting these specifications, have steadily progressed {{in the last few years}} from a few Watts of output power, initially to the 10s of Watts and now into the 100s of Watts power level. This power scaling has been achieved with developments in the fiber technology, such as the {{adoption of}} stimulated brillouin scattering (SBS) suppression/mitigation techniques within the fiber, along with improvements in the overall amplifier design. The latest generation of high finesse, high power fiber amplifiers now deliver power levels exceeding <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> from commercial solid-state single frequency sources and are opening up new scientific applications as a result of the higher power levels and stable optimized performance.|$|E

500|$|The cowpea {{has often}} been {{referred}} to as [...] "poor man's meat" [...] due to the high levels of protein found in the seeds and leaves. However, it does contain some anti-nutritional elements, notable phytic acid and protease inhibitors, which reduces the nutritional value of the crop. Although little research has been conducted on the nutritional value of the leaves and immature pods, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> suggests that the leaves have a similar nutrition value to black nightshade and sweet potato leaves, while the green pods have less anti-nutritional factors than the dried seeds.|$|E
500|$|Hiddleston is {{well known}} for his {{portrayal}} of Loki in the 2011 Marvel Studios film, Thor. He was invited to audition by Kenneth Branagh, the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on Ivanov and Wallander. Hiddleston said of Branagh, [...] "Ken has had a life-changing effect. He was able to say to the executives, 'Trust me on this, you can cast Tom and he will deliver'. It was massive and it's completely changed the course of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>available</b> to me to do. Ken gave me my break." [...] In the beginning, he originally auditioned for the part of Thor. [...] "I initially auditioned to play Thor. That was what I was being considered for, because I'm tall and blonde and classically trained, and that seemed to be the mold for what Thor was, he was to be a classical character. And it was in my auditions. I owe this entirely to Marvel and their open-mindedness, they saw something that they thought was interesting. They saw some temperament that they liked." [...] The casting director gave Hiddleston six weeks to bulk up, so he went on a strict diet and gained twenty pounds of muscle. In the end, Branagh decided he was more suitable as the antagonist and cast him as Loki.|$|E
