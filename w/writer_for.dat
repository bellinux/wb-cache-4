5|$|Drew Karpyshyn, who {{previously}} {{served as a}} senior <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> Knights of the Old Republic, was the lead <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> Mass Effect. Despite {{of the fact that}} each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behoved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas. One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.|$|E
