Energy consumption {{was the most important}} factor for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission</b> and decided by economic development and rising living standard. This paper analyzes the situation of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission</b> and the primary factors in China through empirical method. Energy consumption and economic development are chosen to be the crucial factors for the analysis on <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission</b> because these two factors will affect the quantity and structure of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission.</b> To control <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission,</b> in China, advanced energy technology play key role. At the same time, some economic factors, for instance, adjustment of economic structure, investment for waste gas control and policy for energy technology improvement, are necessary to control <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission...</b>|$|E
30|$|In addition, we {{estimate}} {{the determinants of}} aggregate productive inefficiency. We find that FDI and private medical expenditures contribute to the improvement of aggregate productive inefficiency in China. FDI negatively affects aggregate productive inefficiency but positively affects the inefficiencies of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission</b> and public health considerations. Private medical expenditures negatively affect aggregate productive inefficiency, <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission,</b> and infectious disease prevention. Furthermore, a stronger impact on productive inefficiency was produced by local governments in the eastern region of China than by the governments in the western region of China.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, we {{find that}} the {{productive}} potential is large, particularly with respect to waste gas emissions and cases of infectious diseases. We suggest that the government should focus on environmental protection and public health preservation. In particular, efforts to reduce <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission</b> and prevent infectious disease could greatly improve social welfare.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide methods to find the {{emission}} source and estimate the amount of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> in the electricity coal supply chain, establish the model of the environmental impact (burden) in the electricity coal supply chain, detect the critical factor which causes significant environmental impact, and then identify the key control direction and reduce amount of environmental pollution in the electricity coal supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: In this context, life cycle inventory and life cycle assessment of China’s electricity coal were established in three difference stages: coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning. Then the outcomes were analyzed with the aim to reduce <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> emissions’ environmental impact in the electricity coal supply chain from the perspective of sensitivity analysis. Findings: The results and conclusion are as follow: (1) In terms of total <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> in electricity coal supply chain, CO 2 is emitted in the greatest quantity, accounting for 98 - 99 wt% of the total <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions.</b> The vast majority of the CO 2, greater than 93 %, is emitted from the power plant when the coal is combusted. (2) Other than CO 2, the main <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> is CH 4, SO 2 and so on. CH 4 is mainly emitted from Coal Bed Methane (CBM), so the option is to consider capturing some of the CH 4 from underground mines for an alternative use. SO 2 is mainly emitted from power plant when the coal is combusted. (3) The environmental burden of coal burning subsystem is greatest, followed by the coal mining subsystem, and finally the coal transportation subsystem. Improving the coal-burning efficiency of coal-fired power plant in electricity coal supply chain is the most effective way to reduce the environmental impact of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions.</b> (4) Of the three subsystems examined (coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning), transportation requires the fewest resources and has the lowest <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions.</b> However, the energy consumption for this subsystem is significant (excluding the mine mouth case), and transportation distance is found to have a substantial effect on the oil consumption and non-coal energy consumption. (5) In electricity coal supply chain, the biggest environmental impact of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> is GWP, followed by EP, AP, POCP and ODP, and regional impact is greater than the global impact. Practical implications: The model and methodology established in this paper could be used for environmental impact assessment of <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> in electricity coal supply chain and sensitivity analysis in China, and it could supply reference and example for similar researches. The data information on life cycle inventory, impact assessment and sensitivity analysis could supply theory and data reference for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> control in electricity coal supply chain. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to study the environmental influence of electricity coal supply chain by employing a LCA approach from life cycle of electricity coa...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} congestion, which is mainly applied in economics, {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where inputs are overinvested. Many {{studies have focused on}} congestion measurement by means of data envelopment analysis (DEA). However, most of the previous investigations only considered the framework of desirable outputs. In fact, firms in the real world unavoidably generate undesirable outputs (such as pollutants or wastes) along with desirable outputs. Therefore, a new scheme is required for measuring congestion in the simultaneous presence of both desirable and undesirable outputs. This paper develops a nonradial efficiency measure for including undesirable outputs into the environmental performance. Based on the proposed model, a new definition and a new approach are presented to deal with congestion in the simultaneous presence of desirable and undesirable outputs. Then, this paper uses the presented method to study the pollutants (<b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission</b> and waste discharge) of 31 administrative regions of China. The finding indicates that 7 industries pay attention to the reduction of their pollutants accompanying improvement of their commercial targets. Consequently, they do not show congestion in any input...|$|E

With Landsat 5 TM image of the year 2007 as the data source, this paper first has an inversion of the land surface temperature of Chongqing city with mono-window algorithm; secondly it gives a partition of the planetary brightness temperature hierarchical, and thirdly it studies both the intensity of Chongqing urban heat-island effect and heat field analysis and the relationship between the urban land use type and {{the effect of}} heat island, thermal field level and profile analysis. The above analysis indicates that the urban island effect is notable and it is not well-distributed; the influences of different land-use types on the heat-island effect vary.

40|$|In this research, {{the burning}} {{efficiency}} {{as well as}} exhaust emission of a new water-in-oil emulsified fuel system was studied. This emulsified system contains two core processes, {{the first one is}} to mix 97 % water with 3 % emulsifier by volume, and get the milk-like emulsified liquid, while the second one is to compound the milk-like emulsified liquid with heavy oil then obtain the emulsified fuel. In order to overcome the used demulsification problem during in reserve or in transport, this system was designed as a made and use in-line type. From the results of a series burning tests, the fuel saving can be over 8 ~ 15 %. Also, from the comparison of decline for the heat value and total energy output of varies emulsified fuel, one can find that the water as the dispersed phase in the combustion process will leading a micro-explosion as well as the water gas effect, both can raise the combustion temperature and burning efficiency. By comparing the <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emission</b> of different types of emulsified fuel, one can know that, the CO 2 emission reduces approximately 14 %, and NOx emission reduces above 46 %, that means the reduction of the exhaust gas is truly effectively.

These by-product fuels include blast furnace gas (BFG) and coke oven gas (COG) which contain mixtures of H{sub 2 }, CO, CH{sub 4 } and trace amounts of some heavier hydrocarbons and the impurities NH{sub 3 } and HCN. These fuels are burned alone or in combination with natural gas to fire the coke ovens, blast furnace stoves utility boilers and metal working furnaces. The utilization of these by-product fuels reduces the <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> at the steel mill and reduces the requirements for outside fuel sources. However, as with primary fuel sources, the combustion of these by-product fuel blends does produce hazardous pollutants, in particular nitrogen oxides, and because these are atypical fuel blends of varying composition, the pollutant formation is not well understood.

In recent years, pyrolisis and gasification technologies have emerged, with the aim to increase energy output and to reduce environmental impact. While biomass pyrolisis and gasification are well known systems and technology of biomass gasifiers is sufficiently advanced, large scale MSW plants - characterized by high gasification efficiency and high energy recovery - are not so widespread. It must be considered also that MSW gasification can be cost competitive in comparison with combustion, besides the potential for better environmental performance.

From the point of view of the energy efficiency, the direct combustion of MSW seems to grant higher power productions if compared to syngas recovery. Only co-firing of syngas in large power plants or the use of combined cycle gas turbine might give better energy efficiency results, anyway the use of gas engine and gas turbine for syngas recovery could allow very good fuel utilization rates.
