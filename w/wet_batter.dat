50|$|Application: To apply minute {{quantities}} of an ingredient, spraying {{is used to}} disperse it first, instead of just pouring it. This hastens the dispersion on the whole surface of the product. For larger ratios of coating to substrate, mixing or dipping can be used. Multiple stages also can be used; breaded meats, for example, may have a dry application (predust) followed by a <b>wet</b> <b>batter</b> dip and then another dry crumb application.|$|E

50|$|A Wet grinder is a food {{preparation}} appliance used especially in Indian cuisine for grinding food grains {{to produce a}} paste or <b>batter.</b> <b>Wet</b> grinding is rare in western cuisine but common in Indian cuisine. Wet grinders are used to make pastes from grains and lentils and is used extensively in South Indian cuisine for preparation of popular dishes such as dosa, idly, vada, appam and paniyaram. It consists of a granite stones which rotate inside a metal drum {{with the help of}} an electric motor and the food grains get crushed between the stone and drum.|$|R
40|$|Three {{trials of}} 6 {{treatments}} (rice flour, <b>wet</b> <b>batter</b> baked; rice flour, dry batter baked; rice flour, <b>wet</b> <b>batter</b> fried; wheat flour, <b>wet</b> <b>batter</b> baked; wheat flour, dry batter baked; wheat flour, <b>wet</b> <b>batter</b> fried) were utilized {{to test the}} effects of flour type, batter type, and cooking method {{on the characteristics of}} chicken nuggets. Value was added to these chicken nuggets by utilizing rice flour in the production of gluten-free products as well as lipid reduction through baking. Added value is attributed to the production of a product that is highly acceptable to certain consumer clusters and has the potential to reach niche markets (wheat-free or low-fat chicken nuggets) that have not previously been targeted in the mainstream portion of the grocery store. Consumers were clustered into 6 population segments revealing that all 6 treatments were acceptable to some segment of the population. Baking instead of frying reduced fat calories by at least 67 %. This reveals the feasibility of using rice flour in the formulation of low-fat or wheat-free chicken nuggets without diminishing quality and the added value component of usability by people who either require a low-fat diet, have celiac disease, or both...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the effect honey as a <b>wet</b> <b>batter</b> on the breaded shrimp quality. The research was conducted from February 2014 until September 2014. The results showed that were analyzed using randomized complete block design (RCBD). Parameters observed were chemical analysis (moisture content), pH measurement, water activity (aw), analysis of microbiological (TPC) and sensory analysis. Chemical characteristics of breaded shrimp in this study with the average of water content between 67. 27 % - 80. 25 %, pH value was 6. 45 – 7. 98, the average value of water activity (aw) was 0. 73 – 0. 97. While the values of the sensory analysis was 3. 6 – 8. 6...|$|E
