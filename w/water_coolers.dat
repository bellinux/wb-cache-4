5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment.

2500|$|In April 1983, the National Park Service chose a new company, Golf Course Specialists, {{to manage}} Langston Golf Course. The company reopened the course by Memorial Day weekend. The company {{considered}} Langston the worst {{golf course in}} the entire D.C. metropolitan area when it took over. The clubhouse had chicken wire over the windows to prevent breakage, iron bars covered all windows and doors, and buildings and the course had been heavily vandalized. The greens were in very bad condition, and poor neighborhood children would sneak onto the course and steal balls in play {{so that they could}} sell them back to golfers. Over the next five years, numerous improvements were made to the course. To discourage kids from stealing golf balls, course manager Wallace [...] "Sarge" [...] McCombs (a former United States Army sergeant) hired many of the children to find lost balls in the traps and rough. The rough was groomed, greens resodded, security patrols increased to reduce daylight and after-hours crime, and a community outreach program implemented. Trash was cleared from the fairways and greens, <b>water</b> <b>coolers</b> were placed at each tee, portable toilets were put on the course at strategic spots, and clubhouse and course etiquette rigidly enforced. The number of golfers climbed from a low of 20,000 in 1981 to 33,000 in 1986 and a projected 40,000 in 1987. Gross revenues also rose significantly, from $70,000 in 1983 to a projected $150,000 in 1987.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficient}} cooling of servers in {{data center}} offers a unique challenge {{to reduce the}} worldwide energy consumption and liquid inventory of working fluid. Presently, single phase cooling techniques are widely used for CPU cooling in data centers. Such techniques are proving to be inefficient, as the heat flux generated in CPU cores is very high, limiting the clock speed of the processors. Also, single phase coolers require external pumping power adding cost to the system. The great potential of a thermosiphon system as a replacement of currently used cooling techniques is studied in the presented work. A thermosiphon loop using two-phase heat and mass transfer process uses latent heat of the working fluid. The latent heat is much more efficient than sensible heat improving the heat dissipation ability of the system. The thermosiphon system is a gravity driven loop thus reducing the power consumption {{and the cost of}} the system. However, the system performance is limited by Critical Heat Flux (CHF) and Heat Transfer Coefficients (HTC). An increase in CHF offers wide temperature operating range while the HTC defines the efficiency of the process. In the proposed design of the cooling solution, a manifold with a taper is employed over the heater surface to guide vapor away from the surface along the flow length. The incoming liquid flows over the heating surface unobstructed developing separate liquid-vapor pathways. Two taper angles, 3. 4 ᵒ and 6 ᵒ in the manifold are tested for the benchtop configuration of the thermosiphon loop. A heat transfer coefficient of 27. 3 kW/m 2 ᵒC and 33. 4 kW/m 2 ᵒC was achieved for 3. 4 ᵒ and 6 ᵒ taper angles respectively. The heat transfer performance was analyzed with HFE 7000 as the working fluid. The performance of the benchtop thermosiphon loop was evaluated for three liquid fill volumes resulting in three different liquid heads available in the thermosiphon loop. Based on the benchtop thermosiphon loop performance a new cooler was designed and built for CPU cooling in RIT’s data center. The performance of the new thermosiphon loop used in CPU cooling was compared with the air and <b>water</b> based <b>coolers</b> currently used in the data center. The maximum CPU temperature achieved for thermosiphon loop was 84. 4 ᵒC under the stress test. The maximum CPU temperatures for air based and <b>water</b> based <b>coolers</b> were 82. 6 ᵒC and 63. 4 ᵒC respectively under the stress test...|$|R
5|$|Shortly after peaking in intensity, Darby {{moved over}} <b>coolers</b> <b>waters</b> {{and began to}} deteriorate. The eye became less {{well-defined}} and the associated convection started weakening. Increasingly colder waters and growing wind shear continued to affect Darby, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm on July 30. The low-level center of circulation became exposed from the thunderstorm activity, and the storm quickly degenerated into a swirl of clouds, although it maintained tropical storm strength. On July 31, it weakened to a tropical depression. Darby soon crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, and it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on August 1. However, its remnants continued westward under the low-level trade winds, and dropped heavy rainfall on Hawaii several days after the cyclone dissipated.|$|R
40|$|Design {{of modern}} {{high-efficient}} systems {{is a key}} priority for the Energy Sector of Ukraine. The cooling technological streams of gas and oil refineries, including air <b>coolers,</b> <b>water</b> cooling and refrigeration systems for specific refrigerants are {{the objectives of the}} present study. Improvement of the refrigeration unit with refrigerant separation into fractions is mandatory in order to increase cooling capacity, lowering the boiling point of coolant and increasing the coefficient of target hydrocarbons extraction from the associated gas flow. In this paper it is shown that cooling temperature plays significant role in low-temperature condensation process. Two operation modes for refrigeration unit were proposed: permanent, in which the concentration of the refrigerant mixture does not change and dynamic, in which the concentration of refrigerant mixtures depends on the ambient temperature. Based on the analysis of exergy losses the optimal concentration of refrigerant mixtures propane/ethane for both modes of operation of the refrigeration unit has been determined. On the basis of the conducted pinch-analysis the modification of refrigeration unit with refrigerant separation into fractions was developed. Additional recuperative heat exchangers for utilization heat were added to the scheme. Several important measures to increase the mass flow rate of refrigerant through the second section of the refrigeration centrifugal compressor from 22. 5 to 25 kg/s without violating the agreed operational mode of the compressor sections were implemented...|$|R
