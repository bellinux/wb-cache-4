5|$|From July to October 1948 in Antananarivo, the French {{organized}} a large public {{trial of the}} uprising, charging 77 officials of the MDRM. The French authorities claimed that MDRM appeals for calm immediately prior to the outbreak of violence had been a diversion tactic to mask their involvement in organizing the rebellion, which the French alleged was secretly launched by way of an encoded MDRM telegram. Deputies Ravoahangy and Rabemananjara were arrested and imprisoned on 12 April 1947, followed two months later by Raseta (who was in Paris when the Uprising began), in violation {{of their right to}} diplomatic immunity. Debates about the Malagasy Uprising in the French National Assembly on 1 August 1947 concluded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to revoke this immunity for all three deputies, who were tortured in prison.|$|E

Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research.

Later in the first half, a shot by Emlyn Hughes from outside the penalty area hit the Leeds crossbar. The match was notorious for the fistfight between Bremner and Keegan, who were jointly {{dismissed}} by referee Bob Matthewson after sixty minutes' play. Keegan, who was angry <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> because he claimed provocation, took off his shirt as he left the field and threw it away. Bremner, several yards behind him, then did the same. Trevor Cherry headed home the Leeds equaliser in the 70th minute and the match finished 1–1.|$|E

This study fills this lacuna through an investigation of state compliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> Inter-American Court of Human Rights between 1989 and 2008. It delves into the {{questions of}} when, why, and to what extent states comply <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> of regional judicial mechanisms in the absence of enforcement. Studies of four countries—Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Honduras—are grounded in constructivist and rationalist theoretical approaches. This research demonstrates that normative commitment is necessary for compliance to occur, but states are often strategic in their specific compliance choices, as they consider capacity, the cost of different orders, and case publicity when deciding when to comply and which orders to fulfill. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{incorrect}} call {{led many}} baseball writers {{to call for}} {{the increased use of}} instant replay in baseball, which was used only to review disputed boundaries on home runs during the 2010 season. Many journalists also advocated for MLB commissioner Bud Selig to overturn Joyce's call and award a perfect game to Galarraga. On June 3, Selig announced that Major League Baseball would look at expanded replay and umpiring, but he did not specifically address Joyce's call. A baseball official familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> confirmed to The Associated Press that the call was not being reversed. For his efforts in this game, Galarraga was named the American League Player of the Week on June 7. Also, first base, a ball used in the game, and Galarraga's spikes were sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} Christmas Bowl, Hiruma is {{selected}} by the Ojo White Knights' Seijuro Shin {{to be one of}} Team Japan's two quarterbacks for the International Youth American Football tournament due to his knack for trick plays. Hiruma quickly settles in as the main strategist on the team. Even before this, Hiruma spies on Team USA to acquire information on the ace American players, who are considered by far the favorites to win the tournament. In typical fashion, Hiruma refuses to permit players on the team out of sympathy rather than merit, including his Devil Bats teammates, but does agree <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to hold a final tryout as a method of enlisting bench players. Two years later, Hiruma, now in college, is part of the college's American football team, Saikyouda, opposing some of his former teammates (students at other colleges) as they compete to play in the Rice Bowl—the game between the best college American football teams.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1992, Kosar's {{physical}} decline {{had long}} been apparent to Belichick, which left the coach with a difficult choice. Kosar was Cleveland's most popular athlete, a hometown boy who had forgone big money and a bigger profile to lead a struggling team back to the top. While he recognized {{it would be an}} unpopular decision, Belichick wanted to bench Kosar, and in 1992 the team picked up a potential replacement in Vinny Testaverde from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick named Kosar the starter before the 1993 season, but in the third game against the Raiders, Belichick pulled Kosar after he threw his third interception of the night. Taking over with Los Angeles ahead 13–0, Testaverde led two touchdown drives to win the game. Two weeks later, Belichick named Testaverde the starter. On the verge of tears after a loss to the Dolphins, Kosar said he was disappointed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> and felt he had done what he could with what was at his disposal.|$|E
5|$|Despite Australia's greater {{representation}} in London after 1923, Bruce's hope for collective imperial decision-making was dashed once {{more with the}} British decision to recognise the Soviet Union in 1924. This act dismayed the fervently anti-communist Bruce, who disagreed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> ideologically and {{on the grounds that}} once again the dominions had not been consulted. Ultimately, though, the differences between Britain's and her dominions' opinions on the matter were too great to be reconciled. Instead, Britain signed the General Treaty with the Soviet Union only on her own behalf, marking the first major split between Britain and Australia on a matter of foreign policy. Despite its applicability solely to European security arrangements, Bruce had criticised Britain's signing of the Locarno Treaties in 1925 without dominion consultation; though the eventual treaty was not binding on the dominions.|$|E

5|$|Development of The Lion King {{began in}} 1988 {{during a meeting}} between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney, and Peter Schneider while {{promoting}} Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas, which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to turn the film into a musical {{and was replaced by}} Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence.|$|E
5|$|In {{this very}} tense {{atmosphere}} {{it was decided}} that a plebiscite would be held in the area asking people which country this territory should join. Plebiscite commissioners arrived there at the end of January 1920, and after analysing the situation {{declared a state of emergency}} in the territory on 19 May 1920. The situation in the area remained very tense, with mutual intimidation, acts of terror, beatings and even killings. A plebiscite could not be held in this atmosphere. On 10 July both sides renounced the idea of a plebiscite and entrusted the Conference of Ambassadors <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> Eventually, on 28 July 1920, by a decision of the Spa Conference, Czechoslovakia received 58.1% of the area of Cieszyn Silesia, containing 67.9% of the population. It was this territory that became known from the Polish standpoint as Zaolzie – the Olza River marked the boundary between the Polish and Czechoslovak parts of the territory.|$|E

Although the remaining Phillies announcers were disappointed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision,</b> they all returned for the season. One replacement analyst was planned, and early candidates included Ricky Bottalico, Mitch Williams, John Kruk, Chris Coste, Jamie Moyer, Brad Lidge and Matt Stairs.

On February 11, Comcast announced that Moyer and Stairs would join Tom McCarthy and Gregg Murphy on the Phillies' TV broadcast team. The company later announced that Moyer and Stairs would each call over 100 games, including 30 games together with McCarthy.
