500|$|Multiplicity of self is {{introduced}} early on as a theme, {{to capture a}} [...] "more riotous and disorganised reality", {{and the use of}} the journal as the novel's literary form is explicitly pointed to as developing this theme: [...] "We keep a journal to entrap the collection of selves that forms us, the individual human being" [...] the narrator explains. In an article in The Guardian, Boyd confirmed [...] "this thesis that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> anthology, a composite of many selves" [...] is a theme of the book. While man's fundamental nature remains the same, he moves in and out of happiness, love and good health. Wisdom, as with age, is slowly acquired.|$|E
500|$|Following {{independence}} in 1921, {{there was no}} state encouragement to develop the mercantile marine. [...] "Our new leaders seemed to turn their backs upon the sea and {{to ignore the fact}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> island". Each year the fleet declined. In 1923, the merchant fleet consisted of 127 ships. This number dropped every year until 1939 when, at the start of World War II, the fleet numbered only 56 ships. Only 5% of imports were carried on Irish flagged vessels. There were several reasons for this decline: a consequence of the war of independence, a policy of self-sufficiency, the economic depression, the lack of investment and government neglect. Foreign ships, on which Ireland had hitherto depended, were withdrawn. [...] "In the period April 1941 and June 1942 only seven such ships visited the country".|$|E

500|$|After a {{game against}} Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in September 2010, manager Kenny Jackett said Millwall's {{hooligan}} problems are {{to a certain extent}} exaggerated by media sensationalism. [...] "I see it as unjust. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> easy club to criticise and in my time , the way we have been reported is unfair", he said. Other examples of this include archive footage of their hooligan element's past bad behaviour being shown, when disorder has occurred at other grounds, not involving them. During a game between Millwall and Huddersfield Town, The Observer reported that a Huddersfield Town fan had thrown a coin at a linesman, and that some Millwall fans had intervened, and handed the culprit over to police. The News of the World, however, bore the headline: [...] "Millwall Thugs Deck Linesman With Concrete". This has led to a siege mentality among supporters of the club, which gave rise to the Millwall fans' famous terrace chant, No one likes us, we don't care, being sung in defiant defence of themselves and their team. In April 2013, Millwall met Wigan Athletic in a semi-final of the FA Cup. Millwall lost the game 2–0. Towards the end of the match, violence broke out in part of the stand allocated to Millwall, with individuals fighting amongst themselves and then against police, resulting in 14 arrests, of which two were Wigan supporters. In January 2014, a Millwall fan ripped a linesman's flag after a corner was not given to his side during {{a game against}} Leicester City; Millwall lost 1–3.|$|E
500|$|She {{continued}} to be active in the independence cause and participated in the protests against the United States Navy's presence in Vieques. Lebrón appeared as a witness at the [...] "International Tribunal on Violations of Human Rights in Puerto Rico and Vieques" [...] held on November 17–21, 2000, {{on the island of}} Vieques. According to the local newspaper El Vocero, her audience applauded when Lebrón said {{at the end of her}} deposition [...] "I had the honor of leading the act against the U.S. Congress on March 1, 1954, when we demanded freedom for Puerto Rico and we told the world that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> invaded nation, occupied and abused by the United States of America. I feel very proud of having performed that day, of having answered the call of the motherland". On June 26, 2001, Lebrón was among a group of protesters that were arrested for trespassing in the restricted area in Vieques. On July 19, 2001, she was sentenced to 60 days of prison on the charge that she was trespassing on Navy property. Lebrón had already served 23 days in jail since her June arrest, leaving her to serve 37 additional days. Less than two years after Lebron's Vieques protest, on May 1, 2003, the U.S. Navy left Vieques and turned over its facilities to the government of Puerto Rico. Following this, she continued her participation in other pro independence activities. Lebrón was among the political leaders that opposed the Democratic Party's primary that took place on June 1, 2008. The group anticipated a low voter turnout in the event, while declaring that Puerto Rico [...] "deserves sovereignty". On June 10, 2008, Lebrón suffered a fracture in her hip and a wrist after accidentally falling in her house. She underwent corrective surgery at a San Juan hospital. A film inspired by Lebrón's life is currently in the works, with actress Eva Longoria being involved.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the Humane Society of Tacoma and Pierce County, in Tacoma, Washington, {{backed away}} from its no-kill commitment, {{acknowledging}} the difficulties encountered in trying to keep animals alive. In announcing their decision, the shelter president stated “that because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> open shelter that will accept every animal that comes to us, regardless of its medical or behavior problems, true ‘no-kill’ status {{will never be a}} reality.” [...] The shelter has now switched from no-kill to “Counting Down to Zero”, a coordinated effort to reduce euthanasia.|$|E

2500|$|J. Paul Austin, the {{chairman}} and CEO of Coca-Cola, and Mayor Ivan Allen summoned key Atlanta business leaders to the Commerce Club's eighteenth floor dining room, where Austin told them flatly, [...] "It is embarrassing for Coca-Cola to be located {{in a city that}} refuses to honor its Nobel Prize winner. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> international business. The Coca-Cola Co. does not need Atlanta. You all need to decide whether Atlanta needs the Coca-Cola Co." [...] Within two hours of the end of that meeting, every ticket to the dinner was sold.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a public}} {{statement}} following his retirement submission on March 11, 2007, Kiley said: [...] "I submitted my retirement because I {{think it is}} in the best interest of the Army.

2500|$|Although {{she feels}} {{as if she is}} the fulcrum, Agnes begins and ends the play on her musings of insanity. She wonders if she could just {{suddenly}} slip off into madness and what that would be like. She wonders what her husband would do if that happened. Would she be an embarrassment to him? Embarrassment is a very large issue with Agnes. She is easily embarrassed by her sister Claire, who Agnes believes has wasted her life and her potential. When Claire insists that she is not an alcoholic, Agnes states sarcastically, “that’s very nice.” Then she lists times that Claire has vomited, fallen down, and called from the club to have someone come and get her. She concludes this commentary with the words: “If we change for the worse with drink, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> alcoholic.” ...|$|E

So the situation isn't like the West portrays it, that there is an 'organization' with a specific name (such as 'al-Qa'idah') and so on. That particular name is very old. It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire... So this place was called 'The Base' , as in a training base, so this name grew and became. We aren't separated from this nation.

2500|$|Maayana Miskin of Arutz Sheva {{characterized}} the movement as [...] "a mass protest". Writing for The American Thinker, Ethel C. Fenig described the protest {{movement as a}} cause for freedom of speech. Westword commented positively on the protest idea, [...] "Sounds like an idea we'd like to frame." [...] The editor of Family Security Matters, Pam Meister, discussed the protest movement {{from the perspective of}} freedom of speech, and commented, [...] "I realize that in a free society, someone {{is always going to be}} doing or saying something that will offend somebody somewhere. I also realize that more free speech, not censorship, is the answer." [...] Andrew Mellon of Big Journalism wrote in favor of the protest movement, commenting, [...] "The bottom line is that the First Amendment guarantees free speech including criticism of all peoples. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> equal-opportunity offense country. To censor ourselves to avoid upsetting a certain group (in a cartoon no less) is un-American." [...] Mario Roy of La Presse discussed the incident, and noted, [...] "it is likely that institutions will apply more and more self-censorship.
