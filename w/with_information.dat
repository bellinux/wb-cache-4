5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of a}} sea chart, which can be updated <b>with</b> <b>information</b> on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} Murder on the Orient Express is Poirot, {{who serves as}} a hint system for the {{duration}} of the game. The player can access Poirot at any time during the game, and can receive hints to help them proceed. The game has two difficulty levels, and the player can determine which one they prefer to play at soon after the murder occurs. Poirot challenges the player, allowing them to choose to either readily accept help from him and allow him to guide the player through the game, or alternatively try to outsmart the famous sleuth by solving the mystery with obscure, and in some cases nonexistent hints. If the player has trouble once they have chosen the more difficult setting, Poirot will gradually become more forthcoming <b>with</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{a beauty}} contest framework, welfare can {{decrease}} <b>with</b> public <b>information</b> if {{the precision of}} private information is exogenous, whereas welfare necessarily increases <b>with</b> public <b>information</b> if the precision is endogenous with linear costs of information acquisition. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to reconcile these results by considering nonlinear costs of information acquisition. The main result of this paper is a necessary and sufficient condition for welfare to increase <b>with</b> public <b>information.</b> Using it, we show that costs of information acquisition are linear if and only if welfare necessarily increases <b>with</b> public <b>information.</b> Thus, welfare can decrease <b>with</b> public <b>information</b> for any strictly convex costs. This is because convex costs mitigate the so-called crowding-out effect of public information on private information, thereby making the social value of public <b>information</b> <b>with</b> endogenous precision closer to that with exogenous precision...|$|R

5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information.

Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children <b>with</b> <b>information</b> about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An optimal {{negotiation}} agent {{should have}} capability for maximizing its utility even for negotiation <b>with</b> incomplete <b>information</b> {{in which the}} agents do not know opponent’s private information such as reserve price (RP) and deadline. To support negotiation with incomplete negotiation, this work focuses on designing learning agents called Bayesian learning (BL) based negotiation agents (BLNA) adopting a time-dependent negotiation model. In BLNA, BL is used for estimating opponent’s RP and the corresponding deadline is computed using the estimated RP. BLNA also has the capability of maximizing its utility using estimated deadline information when its deadline is shorter {{than or equal to}} the estimated deadline. To evaluate the performance of BLNA, BLNA is compared to an agent <b>with</b> complete <b>information</b> and an agent <b>with</b> incomplete <b>information.</b> Empirical results showed that BLNA achieved: 1) always higher utility than the agent <b>with</b> incomplete <b>information</b> for all cases, 2) close to or slightly lower utility than the agent <b>with</b> complete <b>information</b> when its deadline is lower and equal to opponent’s deadline, and 3) lower utility than the agent <b>with</b> complete <b>information</b> when deadline is higher than opponent’s deadline.

5|$|From its inception, users {{would use}} the {{newsgroup}} to discuss {{the quality of the}} episode, as well as to talk about continuity errors and trivia.

The girls are taken onto a bus as Black speaks to their biological father, a preacher confined to a negative pressure ventilator (Morgan Woodward). The man reveals to Black that he attempted to create a caste of pure and innocent people who could repopulate society benevolently after the cataclysm. He contacted some of the girls to let them know he would die before the apocalyptic date, and they committed suicide shortly afterwards. That night, a power cut stops the man's ventilator, killing him.|$|E

40|$|Model {{checking}} of open pushdown systems (OPD) w. r. t. standard branching temporal logics (pushdown module checking or PMC) {{has been}} recently investigated in the literature, {{both in the}} context of environments with perfect and imperfect information about the system (in the last case, the environment has only a partial view of the system's control states and stack content). For standard CTL, PMC <b>with</b> imperfect <b>information</b> is known to be undecidable. If the stack content is assumed to be visible, then the problem is decidable and 2 EXPTIME-complete (matching the complexity of PMC <b>with</b> perfect <b>information</b> against CTL). The decidability status of PMC <b>with</b> imperfect <b>information</b> against CTL restricted to the case where the depth of the stack content is visible is open. In this paper, we show that with this restriction, PMC <b>with</b> imperfect <b>information</b> against CTL remains undecidable. On the other hand, we individuate an interesting subclass of OPDS with visible stack content depth such that PMC <b>with</b> imperfect <b>information</b> against the existential fragment of CTL is decidable and in 2 EXPTIME. Moreover, we show that the program complexity of PMC <b>with</b> imperfect <b>information</b> and visible stack content against CTL is 2 EXPTIME-complete (hence, exponentially harder than the program complexity of PMC <b>with</b> perfect <b>information,</b> which is known to be EXPTIME-complete) ...|$|R
