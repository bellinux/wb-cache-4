40|$|International audienceThe <b>varietal</b> <b>selection</b> of flax (Linum Usitatissimum L) {{has always}} focused on {{specific}} criteria fulfilling requirements of farmers and textile workers. Thus, the current development of composites using flax as reinforcement presents new challenges for flax breeders {{in terms of}} fiber quantities and quality. However, {{the impact of the}} <b>varietal</b> <b>selection</b> <b>on</b> the mechanical properties of resulting fibers is yet to be determined. In the present study, several architectural characteristics of flax stems are defined. Stem transverse sections from four varieties selected from the 1940 s to 2011 are compared. Anatomical changes over time are highlighted. The most important ones involve the gap between fiber bundles and the amount of fibers which can be improved with the selection (from 7. 8 % to 13. 4 % of the tissue area per section). This trend coincides with the increase in biomass production over time expected from the selection work. Moreover, this study demonstrates that flax fibers preserve their good mechanical performances in spite of the anatomical differences. Thus, through <b>varietal</b> <b>selection,</b> it is possible to increase the biomass yield while preserving the excellent specific mechanical properties of flax fibers. Finally, flax fibers can compete with glass fibers to reinforce composite materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Selecting varieties of crop that display low accumulation of these radionuclides {{has been suggested}} as an economically and socially acceptable remediation strategy for radiologically contaminated land. However, there is insufficient information available to assess the feasibility of this remediation approach. This paper presents a comprehensive literature-based evaluation of inter-varietal variation in accumulation of Cs and Sr in crop plants. Thirty-seven publications studying 27 plant species were identified as appropriate for these analyses. Inter-varietal variation was expressed at {{the ratio of the}} maximum to minimum observed concentrations for a given crop species and element and ranged from 1. 0 to 6. 3 and from 1. 0 to 4. 5 for Cs and Sr respectively. This variation suggests that exploitation of inter-varietal variation could be used in some crop species to reduce the transfer of these radionuclides to a similar extent to existing remediation strategies. Low-Sr accumulating varieties were also found to have lower concentrations of Ca, whereas low Cs-accumulating varieties were not shown to have low K accumulation. Concentrations of Cs and Sr in plants were not related, suggesting that finding varieties displaying low accumulation of both Sr and Cs may not be feasible. <b>Varietal</b> <b>selection</b> could be an effective remediation strategy, and could be used in combination with other existing methods, such as fertilisation and ploughing.
