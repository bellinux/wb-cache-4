50|$|Facility {{contractors}} introduced {{safety concerns}} on several occasions. In {{one of the}} more serious incidents, contractor personnel damaged hydraulic units, allowing hydraulic fluid to spray over reactor control cables. The same crew then performed welding operations to equipment located above the control cables. Hot slag fell onto the material used to contain the hydraulic fluid and ignited it, along with the fluid on the control cables. The fire involved the cables for five minutes, and 16 essential control cables were damaged. The contractor personnel then failed to inform plant personnel of the situation and the reactor was in operation for several hours in this condition. On another occasion, contractor personnel using improperly grounded <b>welding</b> <b>apparatuses</b> tripped neutron protection circuits, leading to a nuisance trip of the entire plant.|$|R

50|$|Induction welding {{is a form}} of welding {{that uses}} {{electromagnetic}} induction to heat the workpiece. The <b>welding</b> <b>apparatus</b> contains an induction coil that is energised with a radio-frequency electric current. This generates a high-frequency electromagnetic field that acts on either an electrically conductive or a ferromagnetic workpiece. In an electrically conductive workpiece, the main heating effect is resistive heating, which is due to induced currents called eddy currents. In a ferromagnetic workpiece, the heating is caused mainly by hysteresis, as the electromagnetic field repeatedly distorts the magnetic domains of the ferromagnetic material. In practice, most materials undergo a combination of these two effects.|$|E

In an electrically conductive workpiece, the main heating effect is resistive heating, which {{is due to}} induced currents called eddy currents. Induction welding of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic materials is a technology commonly used in for instance the aerospace industry.|$|E

40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{solid-state}} {{joining technique}} developed by The Welding Institute, UK. The tool employed in FSW {{consists of a}} spinning pin with a stepped shoulder. The pin is inserted into the seam line between two sheets or plates to be welded. As the pin rotates and traverses along the joint line, it heats the surrounding material, plasticizes it severely, and stirs it, thus creating a weld. Friction Stir Processing (FSP), which is a derivative of FSW, uses the stirring action of the pin to produce fine-grained material. Traditional estimates of the strain-rate during FSP have relied {{on the relationship between}} the measured grain-size and Zener-Hollomon parameter of the process. In this thesis a soft and ductile aluminum foil was embedded within a work-piece undergoing FSP to observe the deformation zone around the pin. The logarithmic thickness strain was experimentally measured by observing the change in thickness of the foil. Additionally the strain-rate was numerically evaluated from the FSP process parameters and the deformed foil geometry using finite-element analysis. In the same vein research was carried out to enhance shear-rate in FSP by devising a novel joining technique using multiple pins. Using a patented concept (U. S. Patent No. 7597237) a multi-pin Friction Driven Stitch <b>Welding</b> (FDSW) <b>apparatus</b> was designed and tested. In addition the joining efficacy of the FDSW apparatus was numerically estimated via finite element analysis. FSW has traditionally been employed in joining low melting-temperature metals e. g. aluminum and magnesium. In this thesis FSP was used in conjunction with laser-assisted Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) to repair and restore marine components which suffer degradation due to corrosion. Towards that end FSP of copper-nickel 70 - 30 and 4340 steel was explored. Repair was also attempted on a marine component consisting of a thin cylindrical shell. This particular part which is made out of 7475 aluminum doesn’t lend itself to deposition by DMD. Direct plug-based repair of this part by FSP was attempted. The challenges encountered and the means of circumventing them are described in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The linear {{friction}} welding (LFW) process - {{of the type}} required {{for the production of}} bladed discs {{for the next generation of}} civil aero-engines - is modelled using numerical and analytical methods. For model validation and testing, experimental work is carried out on the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy using pilot-scale <b>apparatus.</b> <b>Welds</b> were instrumented with thermocouples to deduce the heat transfer effects prevalent in the process. The sensitivity of the measured rates of upset to the critical process variables - amplitude, frequency and the applied pressure - is shown to be consistent with the predictions of the modelling. The flash produced is dependent upon the ratio of oscillation amplitude to applied load; when this is large, a rippled morphology is produced. An analytical model of the process is proposed, in which the rate of mechanical working is balanced against the enthalpy associated with flash formation; at steady state, the temperature is predicted to decrease exponentially with distance in the heat-affected zone (HAZ), and the temperature gradient in the HAZ to increase as the upset rate increases, consistent with observation. By consideration of the form of the analytical model and the processes occurring during LFW it is suggested that, for a given upset rate, the weld temperature decreases as the pressure increases. Analysis of the experimental data indicates that the efficiency of adiabatic heating is close to 100 %. © 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The tab openings are sized to accommodate welding wire and each extends to a side edge of the tab, both opening {{on the same side of}} the frame, whereby welding wire can be side-loaded onto the frame. On the side of the frame, opposite the roller a lock ring handle is attached tangentially and is rotatable about the attachment point and an axis perpendicular to the frame. The device is grasped in the hand normally used to hold the wire. A finger is placed through the loop ring and the frame positioned across the palm and lower fingers. The thumb is positioned atop the wire so it can be moved from the back of the frame across the roller, and towards the front. In doing so, the wire is advanced at a steady rate in axial alignment with the tab openings and roller.

40|$|An auto-adjusting {{pin tool}} for {{friction}} stir welding is presented wherein the pin tool automatically adjusts for welding materials of varying thicknesses, and the pin can be incrementally withdrawn from the workpieces thus eliminating any crater or keyhole in the <b>weld.</b> The inventive <b>apparatus</b> is comprised of a welding head housing a motor connected to a controller instrument package and an arbor supported by bearings. The arbor forms an interior cylinder and is encircled by a stationary slip ring though which are ported hydraulic passageways into the interior cylinder of the arbor such that a piston housed therein may be moved axially. Coupled to the piston is a pin tool which is treaded on its lower end and which is moveably seated in, and extending through, a shoulder housing having concave lower face. When welding, the rotating treaded end of the pin enters and stirs the workpieces while the lower face of the shoulder housing compacts the workpieces. As the welding head traverses the shoulder housing the controller senses any rising pressure on the lower face of the shoulder housing and withdraws the arbor to keep the pressure constant. At the same time, the piston moves towards the workpieces thus extending the pin further from the shoulder. This keeps the pin at a proper depth in the workpieces regardless of their thicknesses. As the weld terminates this same operation {{can be used to}} incrementally withdraw the pin during the final part of the traverse, thus eliminating any keyhole or crater that would otherwise be created...|$|R

40|$|Weld {{simulations}} {{have been}} conducted on a C 90 quenched tempered steel used in offshore riser systems, in order to investigate the possibility of introducing an effective solid state weld procedure. As a secondary objective, the microstructure of the HAZ of a TIG welding is to be evaluated. The C 90 is as steel of high hardenability and its base microstructure consists of tempered martensite with a Vickers hardness of 239 HV 10. The main focus in this work has been to sufficiently soften the weld as well as obtaining impact toughness properties within requirements, by implying a {{post weld heat treatment}} procedure. Hardness values cannot exceed 270 HV 10 and impact toughness energy must exhibit an average value above 40 J. Steel samples have been heated to a peak temperature of 1150 ˚C, followed by controlled cooling at 10 and 60 ˚C/s, prior to post weld heat treatment. Tempering at temperatures of 680 and 720 ˚C has been conducted on the post quenched structure for up to three hours and has been performed in an air circulating furnace and in a Smitweld Thermal Cycle apparatus. Low tempering times (up to 1200 s) have been performed in the Smitweld <b>apparatus.</b> <b>Weld</b> hardness and impact toughness requirements was met after three hours of post weld heat treatment at 720 ˚C in an air circulating furnace, producing a hardness value of 253 HV 10 and a Charpy-V energy of 66 J for the parallel quenched at 10 ˚C/s. After some tempering of the structure, the two cooling rates used did not affect hardness values significantly. Tempering at 680 ˚C did not soften the structure sufficiently to meet the criteria, with the lowest measured hardness of 315 HV 10 after three hours. The hardness of the intercrictial zone of the weld was reduced to 246 HV 10 after tempering for three hours at 720 ˚C. Tempering in the Smitweld apparatus softened the structure more efficiently than what was observed in the furnace, producing hardness values of 271 HV 10 after only twenty minutes of tempering at 720 ˚C. It has been suggested that due to substantially higher heating rates obtained by the Smitweld apparatus, low temperature tempering mechanisms may be inhibited or delayed, resulting in a post tempered structure consisting of coarse carbides with large inter particle spacing, contributing little to precipitation hardening. Heating rates obtained by Smitweld is in the same range as those obtainable by the SAG-FW procedure, and the two methods are therefore considered comparable. FMC Technologies uses a TIG weld procedure followed by a six hour post weld heat treatment to obtain satisfactory mechanical properties on the C 90 steel quality. It is suggested, that by applying a solid state weld procedure, the total tempering time can be reduced with at least 50 %...|$|R
40|$|Automakers are {{increasingly}} using aluminum for structural applications {{in order to}} reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel efficiency. However, aluminum bodied cars have largely been confined to lower-volume, niche markets {{due in part to the}} number of challenges associated with welding of aluminum in comparison with steel. Therefore, a need exists for new joining processes which can produce high-quality welds in thin aluminum sheet at high production rates and low cost. The recently invented double-sided arc welding (DSAW) process is one such joining process. It has been shown to be capable of producing high quality butt-joint configuration welds in thin aluminum sheet and thick steel plate. In DSAW, an arc is initiated across two torches that are mounted on either side of the workpiece, allowing it to be welded from both sides. The objective of this research was to determine the feasibility and merits of using the DSAW process to produce seam and spot welds in thin aluminum sheet in the lap-joint configuration. The double-sided arc <b>welding</b> (DSAW) <b>apparatus</b> used in the present study was powered by a single square wave alternating current variable polarity power supply to produce an arc across two liquid cooled, plasma arc welding torches. This equipment was used to produce a series of conduction-mode DSAW seam and spot welds in 1 mm thick and 1. 5 mm thick AA 5182 -O and AA 6111 sheet in the lap-joint configuration. Metallographic analysis was used to characterize the microstructure of the welds, while microhardness and tensile tests were used to characterize the mechanical properties. Since hydrogen is easily absorbed by molten aluminum, all weld specimens must be cleaned prior to welding in order to produce high quality, pore-free welds. Although previous studies had shown that the specimens could be sufficiently cleaned by degreasing and wire brushing them prior to welding, this cleaning procedure was not found to be adequate for the specimens used in this study and a more aggressive cleaning technique was required. A number of different specimen pre-cleaning techniques were examined, and a combination of degreasing, deoxidizing, and manual wire brushing was found to produce the least amount of porosity in bead-on-plate welds produced in 1. 5 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheet. Further reductions in porosity were accomplished by redesigning the shielding gas cup of the top Thermal Arc torch to promote more laminar gas flow and generate a more evenly distributed shielding gas plume. Using the redesigned shielding gas cup, a shielding gas flow rate of 10 lpm was found to provide good coverage of the weld pool and produce virtually pore-free welds. The feasibility of using the DSAW process to produce spot welds in 1 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheet in the lap-joint configuration was examined by producing a series of spot welds over a range of welding powers and weld times. Weld nuggets were produced using a welding current as low as 50 A with a cycle time of one second. However, all of the welds exhibited a pinhole at the centre of the nugget which penetrated through the entire thickness of the specimen, regardless of welding current and cycle time used. Solidification shrinkage porosity and crater cracking were also observed near the centerline of the welds. Hydrogen gas porosity and oxide tails were also observed in the welds. These defects were found to decrease the strength and quality of the spot welds made between 1 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheets in the lap-joint configuration. A series of welds were made to determine if the DSAW process could be used to produce seam welds in 1 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheet in the lap-joint configuration. Visually acceptable, crack-free welds were produced using welding powers ranging from 2. 0 kW to 5. 1 kW, at welding speeds between 10 mm/s and 70 mm/s. Welds produced within this range of welding conditions were found to possess excellent cathodic cleaning on both sides of the workpiece, a smooth weld bead, and a columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition. However, transverse cross-sections of the specimens revealed varying amounts of oxide entrainment in the weld metal which was seen most frequently as unbroken interface oxide sheets or tails at the fusion boundaries. Often times, small clusters of porosity were found to nucleate along the oxide tails. This suggested that there was insufficient fluid flow in the weld to disrupt the pre-existing oxide sheets at the interface between the sheets. Careful specimen pre-cleaning using a combination of degreasing, deoxidizing, and manual stainless steel wire brushing was found to reduce, but not eliminate the oxide tails. Microhardness testing revealed that the microhardness was relatively consistent across the weld metal, heat-affected zone (HAZ), and base metal. In a series of tensile-shear tests, all of the welded specimens were observed to fail in the weld metal, within 1 mm of the fusion boundary. Another series of seam welds were produced between 1 mm thick AA 6111 and 1 mm thick AA 5182 sheets in the lap-joint configuration to explore the nature and intensity of fluid flow in the molten weld pool responsible for breaking oxide tails. The difference in magnesium content between the two alloys produces a different microstructure and response to chemical etching, thereby revealing any effects of fluid motion in the weld pool. Relatively weak buoyancy driven fluid flow was observed when the AA 6111 sheet was placed on top of the AA 5182 sheet, and some minor stirring was seen between the two sheets. When the slightly less dense AA 5182 sheet was placed above the AA 6111 sheet, very little fluid flow was observed and the two alloys remained unmixed. Overall, the weld pool formed during DSAW was found to be very quiescent. This suggests that the normally strong Marangoni and Lorentz force induced flow seen in other arc welding processes does not occur in the double-sided arc weld pool. This leaves only a very weak buoyancy driven fluid flow which is incapable of disrupting the pre-existing oxide at the interface between the sheets immediately adjacent to the fusion zone boundary. Overall the DSAW process was found to be capable of producing visually acceptable lap-joint configuration seam welds in AA 5182 -O sheet over a wide range of welding speeds and welding powers, provided that the pre-existing oxide and any other surface contaminants were chemically removed prior to welding...|$|R
