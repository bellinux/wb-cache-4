500|$|During May 2006 Sebastian Faulks was {{approached}} by Ian Fleming Publications and asked to write a Bond book for Ian Fleming's centenary. Although he initially refused, he was persuaded after he re-read Fleming's novels and the company gave him an article by Fleming in 1962—How to Write a Thriller—which revealed that he wrote each Bond book in only six weeks. Faulks copied elements of Fleming's routine, joking that [...] "In his house in Jamaica, Ian Fleming used to write 1000 words in the morning, then go snorkelling, have a cocktail, lunch on the terrace, more diving, another 1000 words in the late afternoon, then more martinis and glamorous <b>women.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> house in London, I followed this routine exactly, apart from the cocktails, the lunch and the snorkelling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three {{decades after}} her Grammy, Reddy {{discussed}} the song's iconic status: [...] "I think it came along {{at the right}} time. I'd gotten involved in the Women's Movement, {{and there were a}} lot of songs on the radio about being weak and being dainty and all those sort of things. All the <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> family, they were strong women. They worked. They lived through the Depression and a world war, and they were just strong women. I certainly didn't see myself as being dainty," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|To {{celebrate}} the 20th {{anniversary of the}} band's formation, a new compilation titled [...] was released on 12 June and features a previously unheard demo from 1994, entitled She. Darren Hayes said of the recording; [...] "It's a long time ago, but my recollection is I was writing about the relationship that I have, and continue to have, with the <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. From my Sister to my Mother and all the friends and the wonderful female relationships in my life. I know I'm indebted to these incredibly strong women who loved me and taught {{me what it was}} like to be strong and succeed in a world where you sometimes feel underestimated." [...] The album also includes a bonus DVD of Australian and international music video releases. It accompanies a major re-release of their two studio albums with bonus tracks and live performances, the first time their catalogue has received such treatment.|$|E

60|$|<b>Women,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> observation, {{have little}} or no {{difference}} in them but as they are, or are not, distinguished by education. Tempers indeed may in some degree influence them, but the main distinguishing part is their breeding.|$|E
60|$|His arm trembled round me; {{his face}} flushed deep; his eyes devoured me. Some <b>women,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> place, {{might have been}} offended; others might have been flattered. As for me--I can trust the secret to these pages--I was frightened.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} a prettier young <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life," [...] said the husband. [...] "She's like a pictur in a shop-winder. It goes to one's 'eart to look at her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see me here," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "confined to my room; likely, perhaps, {{to be in}} this {{helpless}} condition for some time to come. How would you protect yourself against that <b>woman,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've seen a {{good many}} <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time," [...] {{continued}} {{the young man in}} a murmur, and more thoughtfully than hitherto, critically regarding her bent head at the same time; [...] "but I've never seen a woman so beautiful as you.

60|$|I did it, Sir, {{and then}} at the door I stood transfixed. I had seen many {{beautiful}} <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> day--great ladies of the Court, brilliant ladies of the Consulate, the Directorate and the Empire--but never in my life had I seen such an exquisite and resplendent apparition as the one which now sailed through the antechamber of my humble abode.|$|E
60|$|Well, she {{certainly}} was a curious one, was Morgan le Fay. I {{have seen a}} good many kinds of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time, but she laid over them all for variety. And how sharply characteristic of her this episode was. She had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph a procession; but being in doubt, {{it was just like}} her to try to do it with an axe.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! Phoebe, it is {{a miserable}} {{thing to have}} always lived at such a {{distance}} from them, that I should better {{know how to tell}} such tidings to any old <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> district than to my mother!' ...|$|R

'"I {{have been}} a great {{favourite}} among the <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time, Tom," [...] said the profligate old debauchee; [...] "hundreds of fine women have sat in my lap for hours together.

[...] The old gentleman was proceeding to recount some other exploits of his youth, when he was seized with such a violent fit of creaking that he was unable to proceed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am still}} too weak and weary, Eustace, {{to write to}} you at any length. But my mind is clear. I have formed my own opinion {{of you and your}} letter; and I know what I mean to do now you have left me. Some <b>women,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> situation, might think that you had {{forfeited}} all right to their confidence. I don't think that. So I write and tell you what is in my mind in the plainest and fewest words that I can use.|$|E
6000|$|... "In a way," [...] he admitted, [...] "this is disappointing. You are right. I {{have never}} felt the call of those other things. When I was a young man, I was {{frivolous}} simply when I felt inclined to turn from the big things of life for purposes of relaxation. When an alliance was suggested to me, I was content to accept it, but thank heavens I have been Oriental enough to keep <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life where they belong. I am disappointed in you, Ronnie." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Rook {{began to}} cry. [...] "I was a {{handsome}} <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time," [...] she murmured. [...] "You would say I was handsome still, if the clumsy fools about me had not spoiled my appearance. Oh, I do feel so weak! Where's my medicine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, that's a {{wonderful}} introduction {{to you and}} Helen," [...] he admitted. [...] "And by-the-by, that reminds me," [...] he went on, [...] "I never saw such a change in two <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, as in you and Helen. A few weeks ago you were fretting yourselves to death about Dick. Now you don't seem to mention him, you both of you look as though you hadn't {{a care in the}} world, and yet you say you haven't heard from him. Upon my word, this is getting to be a house of mysteries!" ...|$|E
60|$|These people pretended in a {{way that}} {{reminded}} me of the Three Great <b>Women</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mother's room, but they had not nearly so much social knowledge and did not do it nearly so well. Also, I remarked, they did it with an eye on Marion. They had wanted to thank me, they said, for the kindness to their daughter in the matter of the 'bus fare, and so accounted for anything unusual in their invitation. They posed as simple gentlefolk, a little hostile to the rush and gadding-about of London, preferring a secluded and unpretentious quiet.|$|E
6000|$|Blanche, near whom he sate as he {{told this}} story, and who adored les hommes desprit, burst out laughing, and called him such an odd, droll creature. But Pynsent, who began to be utterly disgusted with him, broke out in a loud voice, and said, [...] "I don't know, Mr. Wagg, what sort of ladies you are {{accustomed}} to meet in your own family, but by gad, {{as far as a}} first acquaintance can show, I never met two better-bred <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, and I hope, ma'am, you'll call upon 'em," [...] he added, addressing Lady Rockminster, who was seated at Sir Francis Clavering's right hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O lovely girl,' rejoined he, 'if I {{accomplish}} my purpose, so that I need {{no longer}} strive for it, I will keep my compact with you. When I have this <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power and have avenged my brothers, I {{will make you}} my solace.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, if I {{think of}} it to-morrow as I {{think of it}} to-night. I dare {{say it is a}} risk; but I must run risks. I know I am not prudent; but {{prudence}} won't help a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> position, with my end to gain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not one straw. I {{never heard}} such a {{proposition}} from a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life--never. And now, if you'll allow me, I'll wish you good-morning, ma'am. Good-morning to you." [...] And the marquis made a slight feint, {{as though to}} raise himself from his chair.|$|R
