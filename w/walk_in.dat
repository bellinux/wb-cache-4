However, {{less well known}} are the impacts different types of natural environments have on psychological and emotional well-being. This cross-sectional study investigated whether group <b>walks</b> <b>in</b> specific types of natural environments were associated with greater psychological and emotional well-being compared to group <b>walks</b> <b>in</b> urban environments. Individuals who frequently attended a walking group once {{a week or more}} (n = 708) were surveyed on mental well-being (Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale), depression (Major Depressive Inventory), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and emotional well-being (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule). Compared to group <b>walks</b> <b>in</b> urban environments, group <b>walks</b> <b>in</b> farmland were significantly associated with less perceived stress and negative affect, and greater mental well-being. Group <b>walks</b> <b>in</b> green corridors were significantly associated with less perceived stress and negative affect.

5|$|Because the {{conductors}} {{and engineers}} often {{knew where the}} locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled stops to disembark passengers to allow them a shorter <b>walk.</b> <b>In</b> the 1960s, the number of round trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit. NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg. For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line, it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{unfinished}} state, Catherine often {{visited the}} palace. She held banquets and festivities there and loved to <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the gardens. According to the French military leader Marshal Tavannes, {{it was in}} the Tuileries gardens that she planned the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, in which thousands of Huguenots were butchered in Paris. The gardens had been laid out before work on the palace halted. They included canals, fountains, and a grotto decorated with glazed animals by the potter Bernard Palissy. In 1573, Catherine hosted the famous entertainment at the Tuileries that is depicted on the Valois tapestries. This was a grand ball for the Polish envoys who had come to offer the crown of Poland to her son, the duke of Anjou, later Henry III of France. Henry IV later added to the Tuileries; but Louis XVI was to dismantle sections of the palace. The communards set fire to the remainder in 1871. Twelve years later, the ruins were demolished and then sold off.|$|E
