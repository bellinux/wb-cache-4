5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} {{organized}} at Monte Ne under {{the sponsorship of}} the Benton County Baptist Association {{as a result of}} a series of revival meetings conducted there. The Monte Ne Baptist Church is still active. For a time in the summer of 1946, the Rogers Intermediate Girl Scouts held a camp at the Hotel Frances (old Hotel Monte Ne). Although it was not as active as it once <b>was,</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> filling station and store in downtown Monte Ne continued to serve the local population.|$|E
5|$|Before the Mexican–American War, {{when this}} area was ceded to the United States, the main trade route through this part of Mexico <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Spanish Trail. This trail {{extended}} from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Los Angeles. The trail had multiple routes; however, the main route proceeded north towards Moab, Utah, {{one of the few}} places where the Colorado River can be crossed without having to traverse steep cliffs. The modern US491 roughly correlates with the main route of the Old Spanish Trail between Cortez, Colorado and its northern terminus.|$|E

In 1974, he was Visiting Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard; during the 1975–76 period, he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science, at Stanford University. In 1977, he became the Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, and {{subsequently}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities; and in 1979 was Visiting Professor of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University.|$|E

5|$|In Frankfort in 1825, Sharp was in {{the middle}} of a bitter {{political}} battle known as the Old Court-New Court controversy. He identified with the New Court, or Relief party, which promoted a legislative agenda favorable to debtors. In opposition <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Court, or Anti-Relief party, which worked to secure the rights of creditors to collect debts. Sharp had served as the state's attorney general under New Court governors John Adair, whose term lasted until August 1824, and Joseph Desha, who succeeded him in office. The New Court party's power was beginning to wane.|$|E
5|$|The {{first route}} through {{this portion of}} Utah <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Spanish Trail, a trade route between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Los Angeles, California. The trail was in common use before the Mexican-American War in 1848. Although the trail serves a {{different}} route than I-70, they were both intended to connect southern California with points further east. I-70 generally parallels {{the route of the}} Old Spanish Trail west of Crescent Junction. I-15 south of the junction with I-70 also generally parallels the trail.|$|E
5|$|The first statehouse, {{located in}} Corydon, Indiana, is still {{standing}} and is maintained as a state historic site. The second building <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Marion County courthouse which was demolished and replaced in the early 20th century. The third building was a structure modeled on the Parthenon, but was condemned in 1877 because of structural defects and razed so the current statehouse could be built on its location.|$|E

5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term.|$|E
5|$|Early {{urban renewal}} efforts in St. Louis coincided with efforts {{to plan a}} riverfront {{memorial}} to honor Thomas Jefferson, which would later include the famous Gateway Arch. Work {{began in the early}} 1930s on acquisition and demolition of the forty-block area where the memorial would stand; the only remnant of Laclede's street grid that was preserved was north of the Eads Bridge (in what is now known as Laclede's Landing). The only building in the area to remain <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Cathedral. Demolition continued until the outbreak of World War II, when the area began {{to be used as a}} parking lot. The project stalled until a design competition for the memorial was launched. In 1948, Finnish architect Eero Saarinen's design for an inverted and weighted catenary curve won the competition; however, groundbreaking did not occur until 1954. The Arch topped out in October 1965. A museum and visitors' center was completed underneath the structure, opening in 1976. In addition to attracting millions of visitors, the Arch ultimately spurred more than $500 million in downtown construction during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Mangnall was {{the first}} man to bring any major {{silverware}} to the club, winning the club's first ever Football League title in 1908. This was followed by the FA Cup the following season, and another league title in 1911. Despite this success, though, he left the club a year later to join local rivals Manchester City. Coincidentally, Mangnall's last match in charge of United <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Trafford derby of 7 September 1912. John Bentley took over as club secretary, but was replaced two years later by Jack Robson, who became the club's first full-time manager. He remained in the post for seven years, but resigned in December 1921 after succumbing to a bout of pneumonia.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, {{the state}} of New York began {{to take control of}} many private {{highways}} across the state {{under the terms of the}} new highway law developed in 1908. One of these highways <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> north–south stagecoach road from Albany to Canada. Most of the highway north of modern NY8 in Chester became the northern half of Route22, an unsigned legislative route, under the text of the highway law. In 1913, the New York State Legislature created Route22-b, a spur route connecting Route22 in Schroon to the then-village of Ticonderoga. On March1, 1921, Route22-b became part of Route48, a new route created as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative route system. The path of the former Albany–Canada stagecoach route was largely designated as US9 in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The most {{politically}} charged issue in Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire financial straits. Legislators sought to relieve {{some of the}} financial burden by passing a law of replevin which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court {{and replaced it with}} a new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as valid, and a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split along party lines, with Democrats generally favoring the New Court and Whigs favoring the Old Court.|$|E
5|$|Then, in 1957, {{the northernmost}} part of present SR57 {{was added to}} the state highway system as part of Route 240, which the {{legislature}} designated along the route planned for I-210. This became part of the proposed Temescal Freeway, later the Corona Freeway; a southerly extension of the Orange Freeway to Legislative Route 60 (SR 1) near Huntington Beach was added in 1959 as Route273. Also in 1959, the legislature created Route272, extending the line of the Orange Freeway north from the Pomona Freeway to the Temescal Freeway, completing the proposed freeway corridor that is now SR57. When the entire route, except Route240 which was still part of I-210, was redesignated SR57 in the 1964 renumbering, none of these proposed freeways had been built; the only constructed segment <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> surface road from Fullerton towards Pomona. The part of old Route19 east of Route272 became part of SR 60. As part of the same renumbering, Route180 on State College Boulevard became Route250, which was amended the next year to provide for its deletion once that portion of the SR57 freeway was completed (between I-5 and SR 91).|$|E
