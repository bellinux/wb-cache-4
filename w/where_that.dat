5|$|New York State Route187 (NY187) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} located entirely in Erie County, New York, in the United States. It serves as the {{southern}} end of the busy Transit Road in the town of Elma. Its southern terminus is at Quaker Road (U.S. Route20A or US20A) and its northern terminus at US20 <b>where</b> <b>that</b> highway becomes Transit Road. Unlike much of the rest of Transit, which is mostly designated as part of NY78, the NY187 portion is lightly trafficked, two-lane and largely undeveloped. NY187 was assigned in the early 1940s and was previously part of NY78.|$|E
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases <b>where</b> <b>that</b> object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions—during which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks), and assorted gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure—have been distinguished by volcanologists. These are often named after famous volcanoes <b>where</b> <b>that</b> {{type of behavior}} has been observed. Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption {{during a period of}} activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series.|$|E

5|$|The North-West Mounted Police set up control posts at {{the borders}} of the Yukon Territory or, <b>where</b> <b>that</b> was disputed, at easily {{controlled}} points such as the Chilkoot and White Passes. These units were armed with Maxim guns. Their tasks included enforcing the rules requiring that travellers bring a year's supply of food with them to be allowed into the Yukon Territory, checking for illegal weapons, preventing the entry of criminals and enforcing customs duties.|$|E
5|$|After direct American {{intervention}} in 1965, the increased presence of U.S. naval vessels in coastal waters Operation Market Time nullified the seaborne route. The alternative devised by Hanoi was ingenious. Following on the agreement between Sihanouk and the Chinese, an arrangement was also struck between the prince and the DRV government. In October military supplies were sailed directly from North Vietnam on communist-flagged (especially of the Eastern bloc) ships to the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville, <b>where</b> <b>that</b> nation's neutrality guaranteed their delivery. The supplies were unloaded and {{then transferred to}} trucks which transported them to the frontier zones that served as PAVN/NLF Base Areas. These Base Areas also served as sanctuaries for PAVN/NLF troops, who simply crossed the border from South Vietnam and then rested, reinforced, and refitted for their next campaign in safety. None of {{this could have been}} accomplished without the acquiescence of Sihanouk.|$|E
5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean <b>where</b> <b>that</b> refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E

5|$|In Elizabeth, Route 27 narrows to two {{lanes and}} becomes Rahway Avenue, {{crossing}} Route 439 {{and continuing to}} the northeast through residential and commercial areas. Route 27 splits into a one-way pair with northbound Route 27 following Rahway Avenue east and turning north onto Cherry Street and southbound Route 27 following Westfield Avenue west and turning south onto Chilton Avenue. The southbound direction of Route 27 intersects the eastern terminus of Route 28, <b>where</b> <b>that</b> route continues west on Westfield Avenue. Past the one-way pair, Route 27 resumes east on four-lane Westfield Avenue, turning north onto Broad Street. The route heads into a more urbanized setting and continues northeast onto Newark Avenue, intersecting the northern terminus of Route 439. Through Elizabeth, about 10,000 to 20,000 vehicles travel on Route 27 every day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the six-man tag team match became {{very popular in}} Mexico, to the point <b>where</b> <b>that</b> match format is the most {{prevalent}} format in Lucha Libre today. The Universal Wrestling Association created the UWA World Trios Championship in 1984 and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission created the Mexican National Trios Championship in 1985, making it only the second Trios championship in Mexico. Control of the championship was given to EMLL, the UWA's main rival at the time, with the commission retaining oversight and approval of the championship matches. In 1993 then champions Los Infernales ("The Infernal Ones"; MS-1, Pirata Morgan, and El Satánico) left EMLL to join AAA, taking the trios championship with them after approval by the commission. In the late 1990s the championship was not promoted {{on a regular basis}} by AAA and appeared inactive until the champions, Blue Panther, Fuerza Guerrera, and El Signo, joined CMLL in 2001 and lost the championship to a CMLL team. From that point forward the championship has been controlled by CMLL once more.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the North Koreans {{advanced}} {{immediately after}} taking Taejon. Four North Korean divisions split up {{and approached the}} UN lines along separate routes. The NK 15th Division {{was the first to}} move against the US 25th Infantry in the Battle of Sangju on July 20, where the division's US 24th Infantry would be quickly pushed back by the North Korean advance. In the meantime, the NK 3rd Division engaged the newly arrived US 1st Cavalry at the Battle of Yongdong on July 22, <b>where</b> <b>that</b> division would also perform poorly. The NK 6th Division moved further south, where it would confront the US 29th Infantry Regiment at the Hadong Ambush on July 27, effectively destroying one of the regiment's battalions. The US units were performing extremely poorly in their first engagements against North Korean units, as a combination of shortages of supplies and lack of experienced soldiers and officers plagued the UN forces {{at this stage of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, NY3 was rerouted near Malone to follow modern NY37 into the village, largely {{eliminating}} the overlap with US11. Additionally, NY3 was truncated to Jay on its eastern end. The former alignment to Plattsburgh {{became part of}} NY9W from Jay to Keeseville and US9 from Keeseville to Plattsburgh. A more substantial realignment of NY3 took place {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY3 now began concurrent with NY31A at then-NY18 (now NY104) in Niagara Falls. The routes proceeded eastward along modern NY31 to Sanborn, where NY31A turned north to follow what is now NY429 back to then-NY31. NY3 continued on current NY31 for another two miles to Shawnee, where it met its original alignment to North Tonawanda, which became part of NY425 in the renumbering. At this point, NY3 rejoined its previous alignment, overlapping NY425 up to Cambria–Wilson Road, <b>where</b> <b>that</b> route split off and continued to the north.|$|E
5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In {{a case study in}} the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two marbled newt species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} southern marbled newt <b>where</b> <b>that</b> species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E
5|$|SJS has {{roots in}} {{criminal}} trials during the Vietnam War era, but {{in modern times}} is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as {{to the effectiveness of}} the practice, though {{it is clear that the}} evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact <b>where</b> <b>that</b> evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} once called the golden honeyeater {{as it was}} {{considered}} to be a honeyeater (Meliphagidae). It was placed within the genus Ptilotis by French naturalist Émile Oustalet when he described the species in 1889; that genus is now considered defunct and is no longer used. It was subsequently moved into the genus Cleptornis, which had been provisionally established by Oustalet in case the species proved to be distinct. Behavioural and morphological characteristics led American ornithologist Harold Douglas Pratt, Jr., to suggest in 1987 that it was related to the white-eyes. Subsequent studies have supported the idea that this species was a white-eye. It is possibly most closely related to the Micronesian white-eyes of the genus Rukia, or the monotypic Bonin white-eye (Apalopteron), another species once placed with the honeyeaters and subsequently moved to the white-eyes. The golden white-eye has a long 10th primary feather (one of the flight feathers), unlike other white-eyes <b>where</b> <b>that</b> primary is reduced or absent, which has led to the alternative suggestion that it is basal (an early offshoot) among the white-eyes.|$|E
5|$|The {{spectrum}} {{of light that}} comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the {{spectrum of}} various chemical compounds found in experiments <b>where</b> <b>that</b> compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{design was}} a highly symbolic variety of sacred architecture. It was a greatly elaborated variant {{on the design of}} an Egyptian house, reflecting its role as the god's home. Moreover, the temple represented a piece of the divine realm on earth. The elevated, enclosed sanctuary was equated with the sacred hill where the world was created in Egyptian myth and with the burial chamber of a tomb, where the god's ba, or spirit, came to inhabit its cult image just as a human ba came to inhabit its mummy. This crucial place, the Egyptians believed, had to be insulated from the impure outside world. Therefore, as one moved toward the sanctuary the amount of outside light decreased, and restrictions on who could enter increased. Yet the temple could also represent the world itself. The processional way could therefore stand for the path of the sun traveling across the sky, and the sanctuary for the Duat where it was believed to set and to be reborn at night. The space outside the building was thus equated with the waters of chaos that lay outside the world, while the temple represented the order of the cosmos and the place <b>where</b> <b>that</b> order was continually renewed.|$|E
