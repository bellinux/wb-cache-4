500|$|The casting of {{the lead}} pair was leaked well before the {{intended}} official announcements. Gowariker cast Harman Baweja after watching the trailer of his debut film, the science fiction romance Love Story 2050 (2008). He asked Harman's father, Harry Baweja, to show him the film's rushes and was impressed with his performance, calling him the best person for the part. Following this, Priyanka Chopra, {{who had worked with}} Baweja in Love Story 2050, was cast to play all twelve of the potential brides, each related to one of the twelve zodiac signs.

500|$|According {{to his own}} account, he {{initially}} hid in a large bush, but decided this was too obvious, and so moved to a smaller one. A German patrol arrived, examined the original bush, and attacked it with bursts of automatic gunfire before leaving. [...] "Somebody was {{keeping an eye on}} me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I'd better get out of that bush..." [...] he later told Phillippa Berlyn. The area in which he had landed was predominantly anti-German, and largely under the control of pro-Allied Italian partisans; one of these saw Smith's descent and retrieved his parachute to stop the Germans from finding it. Smith hid for a while longer before emerging to greet a boy of about 12. The boy, Leo, knew no English; using sign language, he told Smith to sit and wait, and shortly returned with his elder brother, Lorenzo. Lorenzo proposed that Smith come to their home to eat, and Smith accepted. The boys' parents, peasant farmers named Zunino, took him in, but decided it was too risky to keep him at the house so soon after the crash, and hid him in a cave on the mountain. The next day, the Germans came to the Zuninos' house, looking for Smith. After about a week, the danger had subsided, and the Zuninos gave Smith a room in the house.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Kakha Kaladze's brother Levan, {{a medical}} student, was kidnapped in Georgia, with a ransom of $600,000 demanded. Georgia's {{president}} at the time, Eduard Shevardnadze, promised that [...] "everything {{is being done to}} locate him". Despite this assurance, the only time that Levan was ever seen was in a video where he was shown blindfolded and begging for help. Following the kidnapping, Kaladze threatened to take up Ukrainian citizenship, but reverted his decision, stating, [...] "There was a time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> about quitting the national side completely, but I couldn't do it out of respect for the Georgian people and the fans who come and give us such support." [...] Roughly four years later, on 6 May 2005, Georgian police officers found eight dead bodies in the Svaneti region and it was speculated that Levan was among the dead. On 21 February 2006, Levan was officially identified among the deceased, after tests from FBI experts. The local media claimed that the ransom was paid by Kaladze's family, although another source says that Kaladze's father attempted to meet the kidnappers, who fled as they believed he was followed by the police. Two men were sentenced to prison for the murder: David Asatiani for 25 years and Merab Amisulashvili for five years. On 14 July 2009, Kaladze's wife Anouki gave birth to their first-born son in Milan. The couple named their son Levan, in memory of Kaladze's brother.|$|E
