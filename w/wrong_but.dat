5|$|K.M. Landis {{was quite}} human and not infallible. If, for example, he did drag his feet at erasing baseball's color line, he was grievously <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> then so were many others of his post-Civil War generation.|$|E
5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E
5|$|Clay, though embittered {{by another}} of his many defeats for the presidency, was appeased by Tyler's {{withdrawal}} from the still-unresolved Senate race, which would permit the election of Rives, and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison/Tyler ticket. Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; he was embarrassed when he was proved <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress.|$|E

5|$|The extreme {{points of}} India include the {{coordinates}} that are further north, south, {{east or west}} than any other location in India; and the highest and the lowest altitudes in the country. The northern-most and eastern-most points claimed by India are both in territory disputed between India and China. With the exception of Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin), the southern-most location of mainland India, all other extreme locations are uninhabited.But some consider Indira point as the extreme tip {{but it is not}} <b>wrong</b> <b>but</b> is not correct too.|$|E
5|$|The {{first session}} began on May 22. On May 26, 97 delegates, {{including}} Montgomery, signed a resolution legitimizing its authority. Montgomery's views {{were those of}} a moderate Patriot. He believed that the British Government was <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> hoped for an honorable reconciliation. Gradually, the faction of the Congress that remained loyal to the King lost its influence, with some not participating on a regular basis. Montgomery was selected to serve in a site selection committee to decide the placement of military defensive positions in New York, and was also involved in organizing the provincial militia and securing its supplies.|$|E
5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or <b>wrong</b> <b>but</b> instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E
5000|$|... "Here, as in that case, the {{injunction}} operates, not to redress alleged private <b>wrongs,</b> <b>but</b> to suppress, {{on the basis}} of previous publications, distribution of literature 'of any kind' in a city of 18,000.|$|R
50|$|Many times a {{party that}} has been <b>wronged</b> <b>but</b> {{is not able to}} prove {{significant}} damages will sue for nominal damages. This is particularly common in cases involving alleged violations of constitutional rights, such as freedom of speech.|$|R
5000|$|... {{begins to}} reflect on the {{possible}} satisfactions of mass murder as a form of honourable suicide for the brooding and resentful man who 'will not put up with such cruel <b>wrongs,</b> <b>but</b> will be revenged on mankind and die like a hero.' Tim Radford ...|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy XII, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} released by Square Enix in 2006, {{revolves around the}} attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. The story is told {{through the eyes of}} Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate, and the cadre of other characters he encounters throughout the adventure. The visuals of the characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida, while their stories were created by Yasumi Matsuno. The characters were designed to look and behave unlike any that had existed in the Final Fantasy series. Their stories were written to create a script where neither side was truly right or <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> instead just had different opinions and interpretations of the events occurring in the game.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box that says he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to everything in the X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Homer only {{bought the}} ball {{so that he}} could use it himself, she is {{determined}} to learn how to bowl to spite him and heads to Barney's Bowl-a-Rama. Marge has difficulty until she meets a French bowling instructor named Jacques, who offers to give her lessons. Jacques proves to be a patient and charming instructor - the opposite of Homer in every way. When he asks about the name inscribed on her ball, she tells him that Homer is actually the ball's name, neglecting to mention that she is married. Homer is faintly aware that something is <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> is unsure what is happening. After passing several bowling lessons, Jacques and Marge agree to meet each other for brunch.|$|E

25|$|After {{about a year}} {{some trouble}} arose {{between them and the}} Indians, and I took the war path as a warrior, not as a chief. I had not been <b>wronged,</b> <b>but</b> some of my people had been, and I fought with my tribe; for the {{soldiers}} and not the Indians were at fault.|$|R
60|$|Thoroughly {{satisfied}} {{that he understood}} {{the character of the}} emigrants, by the short but comprehensive description conveyed in Paul's reply, the old man raised no further question concerning the readiness of Ishmael to revenge his <b>wrongs,</b> <b>but</b> rather followed the train of thought which was suggested to his experience, by the occasion.|$|R
5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E
5|$|Amira and Anthony's {{relationship}} continues {{and after}} having a small argument with Christian Clarke (John Partridge), Amira goes over to Anthony's house and the pair end up having sex for the first time. However, she later cries afterwards and appears to regret it. She tells him it felt <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> it is not his fault. She then decides to leave Walford without telling him. Anthony later learns that Amira has left after Syed tells him. When Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) takes a liking to Anthony, her father Derek forces Anthony to take her out. Anthony {{is not interested in}} Alice, but is scared of Derek so cannot refuse. They have a couple of dates, but they go badly. Several weeks later, Alice receives flowers and assumes they are from Anthony. Anthony is then forced to take her out again, as {{he does not want to}} upset her. However, he tries to put her off by behaving and dressing badly. Later, during a game of spin the bottle, Anthony and Alice kiss, and he then decides that he really does like her and invites her on a proper date. Alice decides she is ready to lose her virginity to Anthony, although he does not pressure her. Her brother Joey (David Witts) overhears and manipulates Anthony into playing poker with Derek. Anthony cannot resist due to his gambling addiction and ends up losing the emporium. Both Derek and Joey tell him to leave and Alice is left stood up. Joey tells her Derek drove Anthony away, so she rushes to the emporium to find Anthony, but is too late as he leaves Walford via the tube station.|$|E

60|$|The {{public is}} now of opinion that it {{involves}} loss of dignity to creative talent {{to try to}} right itself if <b>wronged,</b> <b>but</b> here we are without the requisite statistics. Creative talent may come off with all the dignity it went in with, and it may accomplish a very good work in demolishing criticism.|$|R

25|$|Hanley said he {{had done}} nothing <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> {{negotiated}} an out-of-court settlement that guaranteed him immunity from prosecution. In {{the second year of}} a five-year terms, Ed Hanley retired on July 31, 1998. He remained {{chairman of the board of}} trustees of the HERE Welfare/Pension Funds until 1999.|$|E
25|$|Statements made by Arthur Jensen, William Shockley, {{and other}} {{investigators}} {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s about race and IQ or social class and IQ rapidly passed into currency in policy discussions. Many of these statements were proved <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> they had already influenced some policymakers, and that influence {{is very difficult to}} recant.|$|E
25|$|During the 2014 crisis {{involving}} undocumented {{immigrant children}} from Central America crossing the border, O'Malley refused {{to open a}} facility in Westminster, Maryland, to house them. The White House criticized his decision as hypocritical given his prior comments that he thought deporting all these children was <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> he protested that his remarks had been mischaracterized.|$|E

After calming down, Arnesen says that Kirsten has been disappearing for long stretches of time and picking up strangers in bars.|$|R

25|$|Freeh says McKim later {{prepared}} {{an affidavit}} {{that would have}} recanted his allegations against the Colemans and Kazeminy {{in exchange for a}} financial settlement. He concluded that McKim had a clear motive to use false allegations as leverage to enrich himself. McKim still questioned the legitimacy of insurance payments and said he had done nothing <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> another of Kazeminy's attorneys said his client had not ruled out future litigation against McKim.|$|E
25|$|In {{the postwar}} period, a {{decision}} {{had to be}} made about whether or not to cancel the contracts for the as-yet 64 undelivered vessels, 22 of which were already on the slipways and work on the remainder having not yet begun. Both the USSB and Harriman himself anticipated a postwar shipbuilding boom, and so the decision was taken to complete the contracts. This decision {{would turn out to be}} woefully <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> the error was not yet apparent.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{characters}} of the Fourth Expedition—Parkhill, Captain Wilder, and Hathaway—re-appear in later stories. This is the first story that focuses on a central motif of The Martian Chronicles: the colonization of the Western frontier in the United States. Like Spender, Bradbury's message is that some types of colonization are right and others are wrong. Trying to recreate Earth is viewed as <b>wrong,</b> <b>but</b> an approach that respects the fallen civilization that is being replaced is right.|$|E
