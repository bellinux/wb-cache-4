5|$|An astute {{politician}} {{deeply involved}} <b>with</b> <b>power</b> issues in each state, Lincoln {{reached out to}} the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election.

On April 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth and died the next day.
