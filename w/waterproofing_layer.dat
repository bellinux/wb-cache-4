50|$|The {{threat of}} water seepage occurs around {{areas where the}} {{waterproofing}} layers have been penetrated. Vents and ducts emerging from the roof can cause specific problems due {{to the possibility of}} movement. Precast concrete slabs can have a deflection of 1/2 inch or more when the earth/soil is layered on top of them. If the vents or ducts are held rigidly in place during this deflection, the result is usually the failure of the <b>waterproofing</b> <b>layer.</b> To avoid this difficulty, vents can be placed on other sides of the building (besides the roof), or separate segments of pipes can be installed. A narrower pipe in the roof that fits snugly into a larger segment within the building can also be used. The threat of water seepage, condensation, and poor indoor air quality can all be overcome with proper waterproofing and ventilation.|$|E

It is thus necessary to monitor the implementation of <b>waterproofing</b> <b>layer</b> during the construction (or rehabilitation) of the work. Traditional methods of mechanical survey are more and more replaced by infrared thermography. Thermal contrasts due to the presence of water or air under impermeable layer are easily detectable with an infrared camera.

The purpose of modeling was to fix the limits of a numerical inversion in order to characterize the nature of the defect. The last stage was the validation of the method on a site test of the Laboratoire Régional des Ponts et Chaussées (LRPC) in Autun. Heat flux and temperatures are measured at the surface of the <b>waterproofing</b> <b>layer.</b> An inverse analysis based on a frequency analysis method then makes it possible to characterize the nature of the defect.

The main factors affecting shear strength are interface frictional resistance and adhesive stress from material of <b>waterproof</b> <b>layer.</b> Firstly, we simplify {{the whole system}} by considering the asphalt pavement as an elastic layer and the cement concrete deck a rigid base. And make a sensitivity analysis on interface contact state and the material modulus of <b>waterproof</b> <b>layer.</b> The maximum shear stress increases as interface contact state changes from continuous to smooth and as modulus of <b>waterproof</b> <b>layer</b> material decreases. Secondly, an interface shear experiment is conducted with the application of portable shear apparatus. With interface shear strength as evaluation indicator, shear strength of different interface treatments is arranged in descending order, i. e. cleaning up laitance and spreading aggregate between layers; only cleaning-up laitance; leaving the surface untreated. While the descending order for shear strength of different waterproof materials can be listed as follows: SBS modified asphalt, penetration grade of 70 asphalt. Therefore, based on the laboratory test results, {{it is recommended that}} before applying <b>waterproof</b> adhesive <b>layer,</b> laitance and dust on concrete deck surface should be cleaned up and keeping it dry.

40|$|Introduction: The commonest {{complication}} following hypospadias repair is {{occurrence of}} urethrocutaneous fistula. The smaller fistulas (2 mm) with good vascular surrounding skin require a local skin flap closure for avoiding overlapping suture lines. For the recurrent/larger fistulas with impaired local surrounding skin - incidence of recurrence is significantly reduced {{by providing a}} waterproofing interposition layer. Aims : To study the effect of size, location, number of fistulas and surrounding tissues in selecting the procedure and its outcome. To identify various factors involved in the recurrence and to formulate a management in the cases where recurrence has occurred. Patients and Methods: This study of 35 cases of urethrocutaneous fistula repair was done from July 2006 to May 2009 to achieve better results in fistula management following hypospadias surgery. Statistical analysis used: χ 2 test and Fisher′s exact test. Results : The overall success rate for fistula repair at first attempt was 89 % with success rates for simple closure, layered closure and closure with <b>waterproofing</b> <b>layer</b> being 77 %, 89 % and 100 %, respectively. The second attempt success rate at fistula repair for simple closure and closure with <b>waterproofing</b> <b>layer</b> were 33 % and 100 %, respectively. At third attempt the two recurrent fistulas were managed by simple closure with a waterproofing interposition layer with no recurrence. All the waterproofing procedures in this study had a success rate of 100 %. Conclusions: The treatment plan for a fistula must be individualized based on variables which {{has an effect on}} the outcome of repair and to an extent dictates the type of repair to be performed. The significantly improved success rates {{with the addition of a}} <b>waterproofing</b> <b>layer</b> suggests the use of this interposition layer should be done at the earliest available opportunity to prevent a reccurence rather than to reserve it for future options...|$|E

40|$|Inverted flat roofs {{were adopted}} {{as a common}} {{construction}} solution throughout the Modern Movement. They require greater protection of the <b>waterproofing</b> <b>layer</b> and sufficient thermal insulation. Depending on the climate conditions, a thicker or thinner thermal layer is installed and energy saving {{in keeping with the}} climatic conditions, regulations or national or regional energy policies is obtained. However, the common construction systems tend to be focused on minimising the construction costs of each project, using thermal insulation layers of extruded polystyrene, a modified bitumen <b>waterproofing</b> <b>layer</b> and a finishing layer of 5 cm of gravel. In the case of trafficable roofs, this layer is substituted with ceramic or hydraulic concrete paving. These solutions have given rise to an enormous reduction in the thermal mass of the roof layers located above the isolation layer and consequently, a lack of thermal inertia with which to cushion the effect of the thermal wave of the outdoor environment produced in the indoor climate of the building. Roofs flooded with water in climatologies which allow their application generate significant thermal inertia depending on the depth of the water. They reduce the amplitude of the thermal wave produced in the inside temperature of the buildings by the external thermal variations, generating a considerable increase in comfort and a reduction in energy consumption. This paper outlines the research carried out in the Alicante University Museum. The whole building and its flooded roof have been monitored over a full year cycle and data has been obtained regarding the dry interior temperatures of each layer of the walls, outdoor temperatures and solar radiation, relative humidities, etc. Through the use of simulation tools, comparative results of this roof with respect to inverted flat roofs have been obtained, such as the decrement factor and the heat wave...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{presents}} the results of the experimental studies of the acoustical flows in the porous or microcrumbling media. Concrete and brick walls being porous media absorb water due to capillary effect. The damp penetrates into the foundation if the <b>waterproofing</b> <b>layer</b> between the foundation and the wall is damaged, the damp comes up the wall due to the natural capillary effect. Just the same, if the protective covering of the concrete or brick wall is damaged, they begin to absorb the damp from the air, growing damp by and by and worsening their protective properties. There exist some ways to restore damaged waterproofing layers. One possible way is to impregnate walls or/and foundations by some special hydrophobic liquid using the ultrasound. Being then dried out, the elements of constructions become water-repellent, do not absorb damp any more and remain dry. The usage of the ultrasound makes the impregnation much more effective and fast, being {{at the same time the}} nondestructive method. The speed of the penetration depends on the porosity or microcrack factor.

40|$|International audiencePreen glands {{exist in}} almost every bird species and several non-exclusive {{functions}} have been proposed for this gland and the oils that it produces. One function generally admitted is that the oily secretions of the preen gland would provide a <b>waterproofing</b> <b>layer</b> when spread over feathers. Alternatively, several authors have proposed that plumage waterproofness is mostly due to the spatial micro-structure of feathers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine, by manipulating the access to the preen gland, the effect of the preen oil on the plumage waterproofness and condition. To explore this question, we carried out two independent experiments where we temporarily blocked access to the preen gland secretions with a removable mechanism in one group of captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), whilst a second group of birds had access to gland secretions. In a long-term experiment (3 months of treatment) and a short-term experiment (10 days), we measured plumage water retention and condition. After 3 months without access to preen glands, we found a significant decrease of plumage condition and an associated increase in plumage water retention. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between plumage condition and water retention ability. In contrast, after 10 days of treatment, no significant effect was found on plumage condition and water retention. Our study shows that preen oil acts to maintain plumage condition and suggests that feather microstructure is essential to maintain plumage waterproofness...|$|E
