The basic task of the thesis aims to discover whether the followers of Nazi and fascist values existed in Czechoslovakia in the eighties, what was {{the profile of the}} people involved, what was the main motive of inspiration in the neo-Nazi themes, whether these motives represented a symbolic protest against the establishment or carried a projection of a fascist / neo-Nazi social change, furthermore where this inspiration came from (whether the transfer of ideas from the west occurred). The thesis will therefore analyse the social profile of individuals and groups tending to neo-Nazism, their social origin, motivation for neo-Nazi activities and beliefs, and the relationship between governance structure and other social classes of the Czech and Slovak society.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this phenomenological study was to {{understand}} the lived experiences of African American female educators who are racially isolated. The grand tour question was: What are the experiences of African American female educators in racially isolated work settings? The following subquestions were explored: What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> as <b>the</b> challenges <b>you</b> experience when there is no other visible model who “looks like” you in the work environment? What survival skills do you identify with and rely on when you are isolated? What experiences with isolation must one have in order to gain full participation status? Data were collected through interviews, journals, classroom observations, focus group meetings, and other relevant documents. Data were analyzed using phenomenological procedures of horizonalization, elimination, verification of invariant constituents, and clustering of invariant constituents into themes. The informants were African American educators from the U. S. midwest. These educators taught in grades K– 12 and also higher education. ^ From this study five themes emerged: (1) Lens of Perspicacity —The data revealed that when African American women experienced racial isolation, they have an acute sense of perceiving how they must appear on the exterior while being aware of the protection they must seek on the interior. (2) Spiritual Grounding—The data revealed that while experiencing racial isolation one relies on prayer, meditation, and faith to stay grounded during the experience. (3) Veiled Racial Identity—The data revealed that while experiencing racial isolation the African American women are inclined to disguise their racial identity to fit in. (4) Traversing Reality—The data revealed that while experiencing racial isolation African American women travel through the realms of reality with their own destiny requiring beyond minimum expectations and added pressures to be better than others in the majority. (5) Posture of Guardedness—The data revealed that while African American women experience racial isolation they must always be on guard. It is necessary to maintain this intensity to be alert and on top of things. ^ Recommendations were made for implementing a collaborative venture with public schools, teacher education and community organizations to support the racially isolated educator and those in the future. Further research areas were identified. ...|$|R

40|$|Plots and {{plantations}} Cue: In Nigeria, government forest {{officers are}} responsible for most forest management. Local people are, however, given access to forests and forest products, and are also issued plots of land within forests reserves for cultivation of crops. Revenues are paid to the state forest departments for these activities. It is also common for state authorities to make forest land available to commercial companies for production of cash crops, such as palm oil and rubber. However, some of these policies have been criticised for causing {{the destruction of the}} natural forests. To find out how forest management could be improved, Tunde Fatunde spoke to Ebohon Clifford Afehodyon, assistant forest superintendent at the Nigerian Forestry Institute in Ibadan, who is responsible for co-ordinating forest guards and officers {{in the southern part of}} the country. He began by asking about the current level of involvement for local communities in forest management. IN:		?There is no community managed ? OUT:		? conservation of the ecosystem. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 13 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ebohon Clifford Afehodyon, with some suggestions for how forests could be better conserved in Nigeria. Transcript Afehodyon	There is no community managed forest reserve in the southern part of Nigeria. However, government provides forest officers for managing such forests. They work in collaboration with local communities, and the results in most cases are usually not too bad. Forest guards ensure that economic trees are not illegally taken away. The forest officers on the other hand, see to the day-to-day running of the forest, including collection of revenues. Fatunde	How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> from experience <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> attitude of local communities towards government supervision of forest reserves? Afehodyon	Local communities are well disposed towards government supervision, because of what they have at stake. The forest reserves are the source of their livelihood. It provides jobs for surrounding communities; it provides food, fuelwood, medicines, craft materials, and building materials. Fatunde	From your own experience, what kind of complaints are lodged by local communities on how these forest resources are being managed? Afehodyon	The communities complain about some aspects of the usage of the forests, especially the establishment of rubber and oil palm tree plantations, within the forest enclave. These cash crops prevent the local communities from obtaining other benefits from the forest, such as bushmeat, medicinal herbs, and firewood. Another source of complaint is the malaise of illegal tree fellers, because they perceive these activities as a threat to their livelihood. Fatunde	Faced with the growing destruction of forest reserves in the south western part of Nigeria, what kind of policies should be put in place by the government in order to conserve the ecosystem in these forest reserves? Afehodyon	First and foremost, the government should ensure that the present policy of giving out forest reserves to companies to establish cash crops should be discouraged, because they give rise to deforestation. Secondly, the present policy of allocating between 1. 2 and 2. 0 hectares of land per household, for farming purposes, should be reduced by about 50 %, so as to check deforestation within forest reserves. And thirdly, the efforts of the Nigerian Conservation Fund (NCF), should be encouraged and complemented by various state governments, and other NGOs that are concerned with conservation of the ecosystem. End of track. A forest superintendent from Nigeria explains how policy needs to change in order to reduce the amount of natural forest that is lost to cash crop plantations and agriculture...|$|R
