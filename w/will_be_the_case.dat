Another bundle is taken away across the nearest stream – a symbolic elimination of all the vermin that may be present in the house.

25|$|Those Protestants who {{do believe}} in the {{importance}} of a future rebuilt temple (viz., some dispensationalists) hold that the importance of the sacrificial system shifts to a Memorial of the Cross, given the text of Ezekiel Chapters 39 and following (in addition to Millennial references to the Temple in other Old Testament passages); since Ezekiel explains at length the construction and nature of the Millennial temple, in which Jews will once again hold the priesthood; some others hold that perhaps it was not completely eliminated with Jesus' sacrifice for sin, but is a ceremonial object lesson for confession and forgiveness (somewhat like water baptism and Communion are today); and that such animal sacrifices would still be appropriate for ritual cleansing and for acts of celebration and thanksgiving toward God. Some dispensationalists believe this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the Second Coming when Jesus reigns over earth from the city of New Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Mende {{is located}} on the , linking Lyon and Toulouse. The road comes from Balsièges to the west and Badaroux to the east. This axis can be reached easily. Haute-Loire and Ardèche are to the east, via Langogne and Aveyron is to the west via La Canourgue-Banassac, as well as the A75 autoroute. A road {{doubling}} project is underway in the department, bypassing Mende from the north. This doubling is however a long project (1993), having had several outlines and some opposition. The project was finally abandoned in October 2012 making Lozère a department without draft dual carriageways on RN 88. Indeed, its neighbours Aveyron and Tarn continue their projects of dual carriageways between Rodez and Toulouse with all expected to be commissioned in December 2015. The work of the Rodez - Séverac section should be completed by the end of 2019. The same <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for Haute-Loire, which continues its road access. However, the workarounds of Mende and Langogne are budgeted. These projects in adjacent departments will reach major cities nearby to Mende (Rodez, Albi, Toulouse, Le Puy and even Lyon). Finally, the economic impact or the absence of dual carriageways in Lozere must be assessed in the medium and long term.|$|E

2500|$|Systems {{following}} Hückel's rule, having 4n+2 π-electrons, are aromatic, but {{if there}} are 4n π-electrons along with characteristics 1–3 above, the molecule {{is said to be}} antiaromatic. [...] Antiaromatic systems are destabilized and sometimes adopt distorted structures to avoid planarity. [...] An atom in an aromatic system can have other electrons that {{are not part of the}} system, and are therefore ignored for the 4n+2 rule. [...] For example, in furan, the oxygen atom is sp2 hybridized. One lone pair (in the pz orbital) contributes to the π system and the other in the plane of the ring (in the non-bonding sp2 orbital and analogous to the C–H bond in the other positions) does not; consequently, there are 6 π-electrons in furan and it is aromatic. [...] Comparing the nitrogen heterocycles pyrrole and pyridine, each has a 6 π-electron system: the lone pair on the nitrogen atom is required to complete the aromatic sextet in the case of pyrrole while the lone pair of in pyridine is not required. [...] The difference can be seen in the basicity of the two systems, as pyridine can be easily protonated (its lone pair is available for reaction) whilst pyrrole does not react readily. [...] This can be seen in the pKa values of the respective conjugate acids [...] 8.25 for pyridine compared with 0.27 for pyrrole. [...] In the case of oxazole and isoxazole, the lone pairs contributed to the aromatic sextet come from the occupied pz orbital of oxygen atom rather than the nitrogen lone pairs in hybridized sp2 orbitals. [...] Electrostatic potential surfaces illustrate the difference in electronegativity of the heteroatom bearing an electron pair depending on whether or not it forms part of the aromatic system. [...] In the diagram below, the nitrogen atom in pyridine is markedly more electronegative than nitrogen atom in indole, as indicated by the red regions on the surfaces, because the pyridine nitrogen is free to act as a Lewis base whereas the indole nitrogen is not. [...] The surfaces also illustrate that heteroatoms influence the ability to form cation–pi interactions as cations will be attracted to the aromatic system much more strongly in indole and in benzene than <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in pyridine where a direct interaction with the lone pair is more favoured.|$|E
