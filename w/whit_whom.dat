50|$|After 1296, King Andrew III, who {{intended}} {{to establish an}} alliance among the local noblemen against the oligarchs - most notably Matthew Csák and the Kőszegis, started negotiations with Nicholas and Paul, among others. As a result, the Szécs brothers left the Kőszegi allegiance and joined Andrew's partisans. Tóth argued Nicholas was appointed ispán of Győr and Komárom Counties after that, thus it is possible he was elder than his brother Paul. He first appeared in sources in this regard since January 1297. Nicholas served as an ad-litem judge during a lawsuit {{in the case of}} Óbecse (today Bečej in Serbia) in June 1297, along with Emeric, Bishop of Várad, Master of the treasury Dominic Rátót, Stephen Ákos and Voivode Roland Borsa. As these all persons were members of the alliance which struggled against Matthew Csák, historian Krisztina Tóth argued initially Nicholas would have been that lord <b>whit</b> <b>whom</b> King Andrew intends to contract. However Nicholas died shortly afterwards, and his brother Paul became one of the five barons in 1298, who entered into a formal feudal alliance with their King against the oligarchs and the bishops' college.|$|E

40|$|This {{collection}} {{documents the}} daily lives of the psychiatrist Hugo Liepmann and his wife Agathe Liepmann née Bleichröder through their extensive personal correspondence, including Agatha's letters from her trips to Egypt. Details on events in the lives of their closest family members, including their parents and four children, are also included. The collection consists almost entirely of handwritten correspondence. Hugo Carl Liepmann was born 1863 in Berlin, the son of Louis Liepmann and Fanny, née Plaut. He studied chemistry as well as philosophy at the Universities of Freiburg and Leipzig, and in 1885 received his doctorate, based on his dissertation on the "Leukipp-Democrit Atoms. " He continued studying in Berlin before serving in the army in 1889 / 90 and then changing to studying medicine, with a concentration in psychiatry, studies that he completed in 1894. He found employment in 1895 at the psychiatric clinic at the University of Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) under the psychiatrist Carl Wernicke, moving on to Berlin in 1899, where he found a position at the Städtische Irrenanstalt zu Dalldorf (Municipal Asylum at Dalldorf, renamed in 1957 the Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik). In 1900 Hugo Liepmann discovered the disorder apraxia, a condition involving miscommunication between the nerves in the brain and the limbs. Throughout his career he lectured on these and other findings at the Psychiatric Society in Berlin, the University of Berlin and at Dalldorf, where he became head physician in 1906. In 1914 Hugo Liepmann accepted the post of director of the Städtische Irrenanstalt zu Lichtenberg /Herzberge (Municipal Asylum at Lichtenberg /Herzberge) in Berlin. Agathe Bleichröder was was born in 1871, the daughter of Julius and Adelheid Bleichröder. Julius Bleichröder was the younger brother of the influential banker Gerson von Bleichröder. Julius continued in the family business and eventually opened his own firm. In 1860 he married Adelheid Salomon, <b>whit</b> <b>whom</b> he had seven children, although two sons died early. Agathe Bleichröder enjoyed traveling, and first visited Italy in 1890. She would later travel to Egypt with her sister Gertrud (Trudchen) Arons. At the suggestion of her best friend, Annie Gossmann, Agathe joined the Ethical Society. Hugo Liepmann and Agathe Bleichröder met 1896, when they were vacationing in Baden-Baden. They married on March 21, 1897 and had four children: Kaethe (born 1898), Charlotte (later Bamberger, born 1899), Frieda Dorothee (later Zweigenthal, born 1900) and Hans (born 1902). They spent their first years in Breslau. In April 1899 the family moved to a house in Berlin; they also had an estate in Pankow, near Agathe's parents. In 1905 Agathe Liepmann became extremely ill from influenza and on doctor's orders spent the winter in Aswan, Egypt with her daughters and other relatives, joined later by Hugo. During and after World War I Agathe Liepmann excelled at various charitable positions in Berlin. digitizedDigital ImageHugo Liepmann died on May 5, 1925, Agathe Liepmann in 1933. Processe...|$|E

He went to the United States in 1907 and studied in Chicago, New York and San Francisco before returning around 1912 and settling at Randwick. On 18 March 1916 he married Elsie Beatrice <b>Whitting,</b> with <b>whom</b> he had three children. A Randwick councillor from 1922 to 1937, he was mayor from 1931 to 1932. Moverly also served on the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board (1927 - 56, vice-president 1933) and the State Housing Improvement Board (1937). In 1932 {{he was elected to}} the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the United Australia Party member for Randwick, serving until his defeat in 1941. Moverly died in Sydney in 1956.|$|R
40|$|Conscious {{awareness}} {{is a fascinating}} psychological function of the human mind. It describes a subjective first-person phenomenon (Damasio, 1998), that consists in both the cognitive processes {{of the self and}} its interactions with the external world. Therefore the construction of the self-awareness includes all the experiences re-lated to the body (James, 1980), in order to process and to represent the perceptual, motor, emotional and cognitive states as own bodily states. This function results to be impaired in several neuropsychological and neurologi-cal disorders (Flashman, 2002), causing interferences with the personal identity or the awareness about ourselves (Orfei, et al., 2007). These pathological conditions reveal insight to scientifically investigate the cognitive processes and the neuroanatomical networks involved in awareness of the bodily self (Fotopoulou, 2012). The self-awareness include both the 'sense of agency' as the feelings of the authorship and control of our actions and of the following changes on the external world and the 'sense of ownership' as the appreciation of the body as belonging to me (Gallagher, 2000) and they can be selectively or simultaneously impaired. The specific disorder of body agency is the Anosognosia for hemiplegia (Babinski, 1914), as the apparent unawareness of own sensorimotor deficits or the inability to acknowledge and appreciate the severity of the paralysis and other sensorimotor deficits following stroke (Cocchini, Beschin, Cameron, Fotopoulou, & Della Sala, 2009) Indeed the disturbances affecting the body ownership are the inability to recognize one's own body ('asomatognosia', Cutting, 1978) and the misattribution of ownership of own arm to another person ('somatoparaphrenia', Gerstmann, 1942). This thesis aims to investigate the possible influences of bodily aspects in self-awareness, by focusing on the specific role of actions. In Chapter 1 and 2, I introduced the disturbances of self-awareness of the Anosognosia for Hemipleia, and Somatoparaphrenia with neuropsychological and neuroanatomical accounts. Subsequently I wanted to highlight the importance of planning an action in these deficits in order to enhance the degree of motor awareness through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms. My main projects focused on the investigation {{of the role of the}} Action in Anosognosia for Hemiplegia. In details in Chapter 3, 4 and 5 my experiments based on evaluating the fluctuations of motor awareness in patients with Anosognosia for Hemiplegia during the request to execute an action. I investigated this issue in some different tasks: in the attempts to act, in third-perspective view and in automatic bodily activation by measuring skin conductance responses. In addition I modulated the affective resonance of these tasks by using dangerous stimuli, so that I could evaluate the influences of both bottom-up sensorimotor and top-down emotional and cognitive components in awareness' fluctuations. I also integrated brain lesion-analyses to understand the neural networks underneath. In Chapter 6, I integrated the thesis with a single-case study of a patient with Crossed Somatoparaphrenia. This rare disorder gave me the possibility to investi-gate some aspects related to the body image and the body schema. I studied this patient in different situations assessing: multisensory integration and spatial components of proprioception and third-perspective view, in order to evaluate both sensorial and higher-order possible effects relating to the body representation. In addition, I also enclosed two single-case studies. The first was a young patient with Balint's syndrome, which was evaluated in a cross-modal task, the second a man affected by Tactile Agnosia, <b>whit</b> <b>whom</b> I applied a rehabilitation program with transcranical direct-current stimulation. These studies are included as extra experiemental studies not belonging to the main PhD topic...|$|E
