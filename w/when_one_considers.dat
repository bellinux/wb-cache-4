Branden Ore finished the game with 116yards, leading all rushers on both teams. That total put him just eightyards short of his second-straight 1,000-yard season. Ore's total is even more impressive <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> {{that he had been}} suspended for the entire first quarter of the game, his place taken by backup rusher Kenny Lewis, Jr. Lewis finished the game with four carries for 22yards, and did not see much action after Ore entered the game {{at the beginning of the}} secondquarter.|$|E

25|$|In 19th-century {{machining}} practice, it was {{not uncommon}} to use plain water.

(HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon tool steels do not.) An improvement was soda water (sodium bicarbonate in water), which better inhibited the rusting of machine slides. These options are generally not used today because more effective alternatives are available.|$|E
25|$|If {{the action}} of the algebra is isometric, as would be the case for Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian {{manifolds}} endowed with a metric and the symmetry groups SO(N) and SO (P, Q), respectively, one can then contract upper and lower indices (with the metric tensor) to obtain more interesting structures. For the quadratic Casimir invariant, this is the Laplacian. Quartic Casimir operators allow one to square the stress–energy tensor, giving rise to the Yang-Mills action. The Coleman–Mandula theorem restricts the form that these can take, <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> ordinary Lie algebras. However, the Lie superalgebras are able to evade the premises of the Coleman–Mandula theorem, and can be used to mix together space and internal symmetries.|$|E
25|$|Historians James Rawls and Walton Bean {{have speculated}} that {{were it not for}} the {{discovery}} of gold in 1848, Oregon might have been granted statehood ahead of California, and therefore the first Pacific Railroad might have been built to that state, or at least been born to a more benevolent group of founding fathers. This speculation lacks support, however, <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> that a significant hide and tallow trade between California and the eastern seaports was already well-established, that the federal government had long planned for the acquisition of San Francisco Bay as a western port, and that suspicions regarding England's intentions towards potentially extending their holdings in the region southward into California would almost certainly have forced the government to embark on the same course of action.|$|E

25|$|In the Edo period, sports {{became a}} popular {{way to spend}} time. The only problem {{was that they were}} often {{accompanied}} by gambling. A notice to punish playing and betting on sumo without authorization was repeatedly posted to little effect. Kyūdō was encouraged by shoguns and daimyōs as a pastime, and contests as well as record making attempts were held. On April 26, 1686, a samurai named Wasa Daihachiro competing in the Tōshiya made an unsurpassed record of shooting 13,053 arrows and hitting the mark 8,133 times over a 24-hour period. This is even more remarkable <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> the shooting range for this attempt, a 120-meter-long corridor with a ceiling of only 2.2 meters. In the Olympic Games, archers shoot over a distance of only 70 meters. Martial arts like jujutsu were popular but schools avoided inter-school matches, leaving room only for intramural matches.|$|E
25|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{emergence of}} the Gacaca activities and the gradual support for Gacaca by the authorities was clearly motivated {{by the fact that}} the ordinary justice system was virtually non-existent after the genocide. The Gacaca had to do what it did before—relieve the pressure on the ordinary courts. These were now not working slowly, as they did before, but not working at all. Once they started to work, they were quickly overloaded with the cases of genocide suspects who were filling the prisons. This new form of justice was bold, but not unprecedented: This becomes evident <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> the emerging numbers of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRC) as, for example, that in South Africa. The slogan of the South African TRC “Revealing is Healing” and its argument that truth-telling serves as a “therapeutic function” underline this assumption. The TRC format was suggested to the Rwandan government, but ultimately they chose to pursue mass justice through Gacaca; a system where their country had roots and familiarity.|$|E
25|$|For {{the rest}} of the 1900s Tyldesley was, despite the {{emergence}} of Hobbs always in the forefront of English professional batting and seldom failed to be {{near the top of the}} batting averages, which he headed in the wet summer of 1910 with an average of 46. Though the 1905 Ashes series was his most successful with two centuries, from the following year Tyldesley gradually dropped out of the representative scene, playing his last Test in 1909. However, in 1906 against that year County Champions, Kent, Tyldesley made his highest score of 295 not out and would certainly have made a triple hundred had he not ran out of partners. With Reggie Spooner rarely available owing to business calls between 1907 and 1910, and Archie MacLaren declining, Lancashire were much too dependent upon Tyldesley to make a respectable score and he played superbly especially <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> the fire in Old Trafford pitches in fine weather at that time.|$|E

Instead of ending the threat of nuclear weapons, Excalibur appeared to end the threat of SDI.

25|$|The {{fact that}} UG plays an {{essential}} role in normal child language acquisition is evident from species differences: for example, children and household pets may be exposed to quite similar linguistic input, but by the age of three years, the child's ability to comprehend multi-word utterances vastly outstrips that of the dog or cat. This evidence is all the more impressive <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> that most children do not receive reliable correction for grammatical errors. Indeed, even children who for medical reasons cannot produce speech, and therefore have no possibility of producing an error in the first place, have been found to master both the lexicon and the grammar of their community's language perfectly. The fact that children succeed at language acquisition even when their linguistic input is severely impoverished, as it is when no corrective feedback is available, is known as the argument from the poverty of the stimulus, and is another important source of empirical support for a central role of UG in child language acquisition.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} psychology's fractionation, {{according}} to the ToK, {{is that there has}} been no meta-theoretical frame that allows scholars to agree on the basic questions that need to be addressed. As such, the different schools of thought in psychology are like the blind men who each grab a part of the elephant and proclaim they have discovered its true nature. With its novel depiction of evolving dimensions of complexity, the ToK allows scholars finally to see the elephant. In his 2003 Review of General Psychology paper, Henriques used the ToK System with the attempt to clarify and align the views of B.F. Skinner and Sigmund Freud. These luminaries were chosen because <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> their influence and historical opposition, it can readily be argued that they represent two schools of thought that are the most difficult to integrate. Henriques used the meta-perspective offered by the ToK to argue how one can retain the key insights from each school of thought, identify errors and points of confusion, and integrate the insights into a coherent whole.|$|E
25|$|Refineries {{examine whether}} {{it makes sense}} {{economically}} to install alkylation units. Alkylation units are complex, with substantial economy of scale. SAAU and HFAU have comparable capital investment costs. It {{is not surprising that}} the two processes are competitive on a capital cost basis, <b>when</b> <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> the basic process differences. The SAAU has a more expensive reactor section and requires refrigeration. However, equal costs are realized in the HF unit by the need for feed driers, product treating, regeneration equipment and more exotic metallurgy. In addition, most refiners will require a dedicated cooling system for an HF unit, to remove the risk of site-wide corrosion in the case of an HF leak. It should be noted that these capital cost estimates do not account for the additional safety and mitigation equipment now required in HF units. Due to the possible hazardous aerosol formation when the HF catalyst is released as a superheated liquid, expensive mitigation systems are now required in many locations throughout the world where HF is used as an alkylation catalyst.|$|E
