5|$|Most {{treatments}} used in HHT {{have been}} described in adults, and the experience in treating children is more limited. Women with HHT <b>who</b> <b>get</b> pregnant are at {{an increased risk of}} complications, and are observed closely, although the absolute risk is still low (1%).|$|E
5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} <b>who</b> <b>get</b> pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E
5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers <b>who</b> <b>get</b> {{a chance to play}} at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.|$|E
5000|$|When {{individuals}} {{find themselves}} participating in inequitable relationships, they become distressed. The more inequitable the relationship, the more distress individuals feel. According to equity theory, both the person <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> [...] "too much" [...] {{and the person}} <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> [...] "too little" [...] feel distressed. The person <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> too much may feel guilt or shame. The person <b>who</b> <b>gets</b> too little may feel angry or humiliated.|$|R

50|$|He <b>Who</b> <b>Gets</b> Slapped is a 1924 American silent drama film {{starring}} Lon Chaney, Norma Shearer, and John Gilbert, {{and directed}} by Victor Sjöström. The film {{is based on the}} Russian play Тот, кто получает пощёчины ("He <b>Who</b> <b>Gets</b> Slapped", transliterated as Tot, kto polučájet poščóčiny) by playwright Leonid Andreyev, which was published in 1914 and in English, as He <b>Who</b> <b>Gets</b> Slapped, in 1922. The Russian original was made into a Russian movie in 1916.|$|R
5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those <b>who</b> <b>get</b> very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E
5|$|Tightrope (1984) had Eastwood {{starring}} opposite Geneviève Bujold in {{a provocative}} thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the Dirty Harry films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism. Tightrope {{was a critical}} and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat (1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about a private eye and his partner <b>who</b> <b>get</b> mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop.|$|E
5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} <b>who</b> <b>get</b> in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E

5|$|Keith {{meets with}} Principal Clemmons and finds Veronica in the closet. Veronica talks to Mr. Wu {{about one of}} his students, Peter, who had {{feelings}} for Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Wu is not gay. That night, Veronica has a dream about Peter, who “asks” her why he would even {{want to go to}} a baseball stadium. Veronica talks to Beaver, who was pushed into a wall by Cervando, a PCHer who died in the bus crash. Keith solves a case for Principal Clemmons about students <b>who</b> <b>get</b> diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder from the same doctor for better grades. Angie wins the experiment competition, and we learn that Angie was one of the students who was diagnosed with GAD for money. Principal Clemmons revokes exceptions for GAD students. Veronica has a dream about Cervando, who says that the perpetrator was probably in the vicinity of the bus crash. Veronica learns that the “I am God” image is actually an album cover. Keith tells Veronica that the perpetrator was probably targeting Dick and Beaver. Veronica has another, more frightening dream.|$|E
5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those <b>who</b> <b>get</b> moksha (salvation) also escape from the clutches of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that {{people will want to}} take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out that the purpose of the computer was not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, <b>who</b> <b>get</b> fired again.|$|E

5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children <b>who</b> <b>get</b> stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E
