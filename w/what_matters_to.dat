Following the events of the previous year, Wallace spoke of a desire to focus on his [...] "peace of mind".

[...] Before speaking, Pausch received a long standing ovation from a large crowd of over 400 colleagues and students.

500|$|Before {{the first}} of the song's two {{instrumental}} breaks, Harrison states that this world is [...] "Such a long way from home" [...] – home being [...] "spiritual understanding", according to Inglis. This repeated line is viewed as significant by Tillery and by Christian theologian Dale Allison, on the basis of whether Harrison intended the final word to be [...] "home" [...] or the sacred Sanskrit term [...] "Om". Tillery writes: [...] "Where does he find himself? 'Such a long way from home' ... but in his autobiography, he renders it, 'Such a long way from OM' – confessing his inner turmoil at having strayed from his faith." [...] Allison identifies Extra Texture as being unique among Harrison's post-Beatles solo albums due to its complete avoidance of [...] "positive theological statements", mirroring the [...] "emptiness" [...] of Harrison's apparently faithless existence in 1975, and he interprets this particular lyric as the singer [...] "expressing his remoteness from both God and his ideals". While noting that the ancient Hindu text Bhagavad Gita [...] "identifies the sound 'OM' with Brahman and promises that chanting it with attention on one's deathbed will lead one to 'the highest goal'", Allison writes of its possible inclusion in the context of [...] "World of Stone": [...] "All pontifical pronouncements have ceased. George has come to doubt <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> him most." ...|$|E
500|$|The use of Viking {{themes and}} imagery in hard rock and heavy metal music predates {{the advent of}} Viking metal. For instance, the lyrics to Led Zeppelin's [...] "Immigrant Song" [...] (1970) and [...] "No Quarter" [...] (1973) feature allusions to Viking voyages, violence, and exploration. The Swedish band Heavy Load often wrote Viking-themed songs, such as the 1978 song [...] "Son of the Northern Light", and Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic claims that the 1983 song [...] "Stronger than Evil" [...] {{establishes}} a case for Heavy Load as the first Viking metal group. Swedish neoclassical metal guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen sometimes featured themes of hyper-masculinity, heroic warriors, and Vikings; for example, on his 1985 album Marching Out. The German band Grave Digger and American band Manowar, both of which formed in 1980, drew upon Norse myth as envisioned in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Faithful Breath – which wore fur and horned helmet costumes – and TNT also experimented with Viking themes. Manowar adopted Viking imagery much more heavily than other bands, and {{became known as the}} [...] "champions of the furry loincloth"; they met with ridicule even within the metal community, but attracted a cult following. Unlike the later Viking metal bands, Manowar did not bother with the historicity of popular Viking image, and did not in any way identify with the Vikings, religiously or racially. Trafford and Pluskowski explain that [...] "the Manowar version of the Vikings owes as much to Conan the Barbarian as it does to history, saga, or Edda: <b>What</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> Manowar is untamed masculinity, and the Vikings are for them merely the archetypal barbarian males." ...|$|E

50|$|Unamuno's theatre is schematic; he did {{away with}} {{artifice}} and focused only on the conflicts and passions that affect the characters. This austerity was influenced by classical Greek theatre. <b>What</b> <b>mattered</b> <b>to</b> him was {{the presentation of the}} drama going on inside of the characters, because he understood the novel as a way of gaining knowledge about life.|$|R
2500|$|Randall Wallace, {{who wrote}} the screenplay, has {{acknowledged}} Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film. In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, [...] "Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> me, that it spoke to my heart." [...] Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film that are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), there are large parts that are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella).|$|E
2500|$|Microsoft {{considered}} several {{names for}} its new operating system. In the end, Microsoft chose Windows Vista as confirmed on July 22, 2005, believing {{it to be a}} [...] "wonderful intersection of what the product really does, what Windows stands for, and what resonates with customers, and their needs." [...] Group Project Manager Greg Sullivan told Paul Thurrott—"You want the PC to adapt to you and help you cut through the clutter to focus on what’s important to you. That's what Windows Vista is all about: [...] "bringing clarity to your world." [...] (a reference to the three marketing points of Vista—Clear, Connected, Confident), so you can focus on <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> you." [...] Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin also liked the name, saying that [...] "Vista" [...] creates the right imagery for the new product capabilities and inspires the imagination with all the possibilities of what can be done with Windows—making people’s passions come alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song's initial {{concept was}} based on a lyric draft Jackson had written and discovered, which she thought would be {{suitable}} for the film's theme. Jackson stated [...] "it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say." [...] Following its release, Jackson stated [...] "I really liked that song a lot," [...] adding it was [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "a good summer song." [...] Jackson felt unsure of how the song would fare, but was pleased with its success. An unmastered version leaked and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans. Several radio stations created their own edits until the official version was released, prompting producer Jimmy Jam to exclaim [...] "That's wonderful, because it means radio is excited about it." [...] The song's success was likened to Jackson's return to a more positive and upbeat style in comparison to the bleak aura of The Velvet Rope, saying [...] "In the history of Janet, the records that are the happy records, that make people smile, have always traditionally been the more successful records, going back as far to songs like 'When I Think of You' to 'Doesn't Really Matter.'" ...|$|E

Surely you must have found with your own family that it's impossible to discuss <b>what</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> you most because you're all herded together, because you're in a conspiracy, because the position is false--" [...] Her reasoning suspended itself a little inconclusively, for the subject was complex, and she found herself in ignorance whether Denham had a family or not.
