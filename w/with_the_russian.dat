5|$|Another {{conflicting}} issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Empire. Darejan {{had been}} skeptical of Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, {{especially after the}} Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians {{to their own devices}} {{in the face of a}} disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795. The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia.|$|E
5|$|At his death, {{the role}} of the emperor as a patron of Eastern Orthodoxy was claimed by Ivan III, Grand duke of Muscovy. He had married Andreas' sister, Sophia Paleologue, whose grandson, Ivan IV, would become the first Tsar of Russia (tsar, or czar, meaning caesar, is a term {{traditionally}} applied by Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that Moscow was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople. The idea of the Russian Empire as the successive Third Rome was kept alive until its demise <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Revolution.|$|E

5|$|During 1916, Romania entered World War I as an Entente country, in {{alliance}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Empire against Austria-Hungary and {{the other}} Central Powers. After a while, Romania began investigating the fate and loyalties of Austria-Hungarian Romanians who were held in Russian POW camps. Estimates for that period place {{the total population of}} Bukovinan and Transylvanian Romanians in such facilities, throughout Russia, at 120,000 or 130,000. Meanwhile, in Romania itself there were several thousand Romanian refugees from Austria-Hungary who immediately signed up for service in the Romanian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|In 1600 Lew Sapieha led a Commonwealth {{mission to}} Moscow {{to propose a}} union <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> state, {{patterned}} after the Polish–Lithuanian Union, with the boyars granted rights comparable {{with those of the}} Commonwealth's nobility. A decision on a single monarch was to be postponed until the death of the current king or tsar. Boris Godunov, at that time also engaged in negotiations with Charles of Sweden, wasn't interested in that close a relationship and only a twenty-year truce was agreed upon in 1602.|$|E

5|$|In 1600, as Russia was {{entering}} {{a period of}} instability, the Commonwealth proposed a union <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> state. This failed move was followed by many other similarly unsuccessful, often adventurous attempts, some involving military invasions, other dynastic and diplomatic manipulations and scheming. While {{the differences between the}} two societies and empires proved in the end too formidable to overcome, the Polish–Lithuanian state ended up in 1619, after the Truce of Deulino, with the greatest ever expansion of its territory. At the same time it was weakened by the huge military effort made.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, {{the process}} to distill {{kerosene}} from petroleum was invented by Abraham Gesner. The demand for the petroleum as a fuel for lighting around the world quickly grew.

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th and early 18th centuries, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth {{had been reduced}} from {{the status of a}} major European power to that of a Russian {{protectorate}} (or vassal or satellite state), <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> tsar effectively choosing Polish–Lithuanian monarchs during the free elections and deciding the outcome of much of Poland's internal politics, for example during the Repnin Sejm, named after the Russian ambassador who unofficially presided over the proceedings.|$|E

5|$|P.E. Svinhufvud's Senate {{proposed}} Finland's {{declaration of}} independence, which the Parliament adopted on 6 December 1917.

The establishment of an independent state was not a foregone conclusion for the small Finnish nation; recognition by Russia and the European powers was essential. Svinhufvud accepted, {{that he had to}} negotiate with Lenin for Russian recognition. The socialists, reluctant to talks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> leadership in July 1917, sent two delegations to Petrograd to ask Lenin to approve Finnish sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|Partitions of Poland {{at the end}} of the 18th century {{brought an}} end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The Tu-142 was designed by the Tupolev design bureau, and manufactured by the Kuibyshev Aviation and Taganrog Machinery Plants from 1968 to 1994. Formerly operated by the Soviet Navy and Ukrainian Air Force, the Tu-142 currently serves <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Navy.|$|E
5|$|The term Żydokomuna {{originated}} in connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Bolshevik Revolution and targeted Jewish communists during the Polish-Soviet War.

The visibility of Jews in both the Soviet leadership and in the Polish Communist Party further heightened such fears. In some circles, Żydokomuna {{came to be seen}} as a prominent antisemitic stereotype expressing political paranoia.|$|E

50|$|Mr. Curtis was {{instrumental}} in improving U.S.-Russian relations during his tenure at the DOE.

25|$|An anti-Russian uproar {{broke out}} when Russian customs officials, 3 Cossacks and a Russian courier invited local Uyghur prostitutes {{to a party}} in January 1902 in Kashgar.

5|$|At {{the time}} of Aqil's escape, the Ottomans were engaged in the Crimean War <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Empire, which left a {{domestic}} security void in its provinces due to {{the large number of}} provincial troops deployed to Crimea. To restore security in the Galilee, Aqil was reassigned to his powerful post in the region in 1855. On his return to Palestine, Aqil's Hanadi tribesmen abandoned their conscription orders to serve with the Ottoman Army in the Crimean War and instead returned to Aqil's service. Aqil was once again charged with protecting the routes of rural Palestine and occasionally Transjordan. He was once commissioned to collect taxes from Karak.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria's {{relations}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Federation {{are currently}} {{on a good}} or fair level. Both countries have had centuries-long interactions, sharing a common heritage. The Cyrillic alphabet originated during 9th century and it was created by Clement and Naum, who were the students of Cyril and Methodius, which later accepted the Orthodox Slavic countries as their standard letter. Relations between Russia and Bulgaria have dated {{back as far as}} the 19th century. Both nations had the tradition of calling monarchs tsars, a Slavic word for caesar or emperor. The Russian Empire was the first country to recognize Bulgaria, and greatly helped Bulgaria in its war of independence from Ottoman Empire in 1908. During the Cold War, Bulgaria became an ally of the Soviet Union as a satellite state. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations between Bulgaria and Russia still share many different opinions, such as the two World Wars when Bulgaria both joined German side against Russia, and the problem over the history.|$|E
5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day.

The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army moved away from the battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
