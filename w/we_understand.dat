5|$|As <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> the {{situation}} here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative {{powers of the}} Crown {{in the hands of}} the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, but it would not be proper for her to intervene in person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.|$|E
5|$|During Queen Victoria's widowhood, Edward {{pioneered the}} idea of royal public {{appearances}} as <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> them today—for example, opening the Thames Embankment in 1871, the Mersey Tunnel in 1886, and Tower Bridge in 1894—but his mother did not allow Edward {{an active role in}} the running of the country until 1898. He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals. He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the Schleswig-Holstein Question in 1864 (she was pro-German) and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet Giuseppe Garibaldi. Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone sent him papers secretly. From 1886, Foreign Secretary Lord Rosebery sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some Cabinet papers were opened to him.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} custom of Europe {{in the late}} {{classical}} and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women. But the date and circumstances of {{the foundation of the}} church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century that he should be commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following the example of the Life of St David written at Llanbadarn about 1090. That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such lives. They are not biographies as <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> them today. Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint’s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.|$|E

5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Rink - A game of Hockey will {{be played}} at the Victoria Skating Rink this evening, between two nines chose from among the members. Good fun may be expected, {{as some of the}} players are reputed to be {{exceedingly}} expert at the game. Some fears have been expressed on the part of intending spectators that accidents were likely to occur through the ball flying about in too lively a manner, to the imminent danger of lookers on, but <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> that the game {{will be played}} with a flat circular piece of wood, thus preventing all danger of its leaving the surface of the ice. Subscribers will be admitted on presentation of their tickets.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the exact}} date Saint Padarn founded {{the church is}} uncertain, it seems clear however that Llanbadarn Fawr was an early sixth-century foundation, a Celtic clas church. The church {{may have been the}} seat of an abbot or bishop during the years {{immediately}} following Saint Padarn, who was traditionally said to be its first bishop (as a clas church, it was not a cathedral as <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> the term today, but closer to a collegiate church), nor did it necessarily possess any substantial buildings. It was one of the leading clasau of early Christian Wales, and the one we know most about, partly because of the significant role it played as a literary centre.|$|E

5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns {{that a small}} number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. We also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It {{is important to note that}} these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible.

25|$|The reason Spinoza {{thinks the}} {{parallelism}} follows from this axiom {{is that since}} the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, and this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, {{there is only one}} substance, so whenever <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> some chain of ideas of things, <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes understood under different attributes.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{complicated}} nature of rationalist thinking, {{the nature of}} philosophy, and the understanding that humans are aware of knowledge available only {{through the use of}} rational thought, many of the great philosophers from antiquity laid down the foundation for rationalism though they themselves weren't rationalists as <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> the concept today.|$|E
25|$|In {{those days}} the kings were warlords rather than kings as <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> that title today, {{and what was}} to become Sweden, Norway and Denmark in a modern sense, were a number of petty kingdoms whose borders changed {{constantly}} as the kings killed each other, and had the local assemblies accept them as kings. The politics of these early kingdoms are retold in Beowulf (see e.g. the semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars) and the Norse sagas.|$|E

25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. <b>We</b> <b>understand</b> that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this {{even if we do}} not understand the physics involved.|$|E
25|$|While we {{know about}} the types of {{cytokine}} patterns helper T cells tend to produce, <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> less about how the patterns themselves are decided. Various evidence suggests that the type of APC presenting the antigen to the T cell has a major influence on its profile. Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, but our understanding is nowhere near complete.|$|E
