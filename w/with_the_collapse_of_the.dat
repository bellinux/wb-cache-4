A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E

5|$|The Italian {{artist and}} critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) first {{used the term}} rinascita {{retrospectively}} in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define {{what he described as}} a break with the barbarities of gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw antique art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Croatia is {{a unitary}} state using a {{parliamentary}} system of governance. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruling communist party in SFR Yugoslavia, Croatia organized its first multi-party elections and adopted its present constitution in 1990. It declared independence on 8 October 1991 {{which led to}} the break-up of Yugoslavia and countries international recognition by the United Nations in 1992. Under its 1990 constitution, Croatia operated a semi-presidential system until 2000 when it switched to a parliamentary system. Government powers in Croatia are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers.|$|E

5|$|A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was {{formerly}} Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction {{was driven by}} an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and {{those parts of the}} forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sugar industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{predominantly}} populated by humans, Spira features {{a variety of}} races. The people of Spira mainly reside in small towns and villages and cities like Bevelle and Luca. The Al Bhed is a unique ethnic group which {{plays an important role}} in the storyline and world of the games with distinctive green eyes with spiral-shaped pupils. The culture and conflicts of the Al Bhed permeate the games. The main characters Rikku, is Al Bhed, and Yuna is part Al Bhed on her mother's side; and assistance in gained through a cast of supporting Al Bhed character's, prevalent in Final Fantasy X-2. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teachings of Yevon and the wider acceptance of machina at the end of Final Fantasy X, prejudice against the Al Bhed seems to have eased significantly by the time of Final Fantasy X-2, though it is still present.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the {{subsequent}} agricultural depression, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tonbridge Bank in 1812, Woodgate was declared bankrupt in 1816. In that year, Woodgate offered Somerhill for sale to the Duke of Wellington, who declined to buy it as the foxhunting was not good enough for his liking. Somerhill was bought from the descendants of William Woodgate in November 1819 by James Alexander, MP. By 1830, Somerhill had been substantially repaired, and new landscaping was undertaken. In 1832, Anthony Salvin was engaged to make improvements to the house, but retaining its original style. During the severe winter of 1835-36, skating was possible on the lake at Somerhill for four weeks.|$|E

5|$|In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to {{capitalist}} reformers between 1989 and 1991 {{and many}} Western observers expected {{the same in}} Cuba. Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with Manuel Noriega's right-wing government in Panama – despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega – but it was overthrown in a U.S. invasion in December 1989. In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas, were defeated by the U.S.-funded National Opposition Union in an election. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet bloc, the U.S. secured a majority vote for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. Cuba asserted {{that this was a}} manifestation of U.S. hegemony, and refused to allow an investigative delegation to enter the country.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Byzantine {{right and}} centre had been {{engaging}} in skirmishes with the Normans opposite them. However, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman right, the knights {{were in danger}} of being outflanked. At this point, the Varangians (mainly Anglo-Saxons who had left England after the Norman Conquest) joined in the pursuit of the Norman right. With their massive battle axes, the Varangians attacked the Norman knights, who were driven away after their horses panicked. The Varangians soon became separated from the main force and exhausted so they were in no position to resist an assault. Guiscard sent a strong force of spearmen and crossbowmen against the Varangian flank and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The few remaining Varangians fled into the church of the Archangel Michael. The Normans immediately set the church on fire, and all Varangians perished in the blaze.|$|E
5|$|Operation Dragoon {{also had}} {{political}} implications. Two {{days after the}} landing, the Germans proceeded to dismantle the Vichy France government. Members of the Sicherheitsdienst stormed French government institutions and moved the Vichy French officials, including Philippe Pétain, to Belfort in Eastern France. Later, they were moved to Sigmaringen in Germany, where they acted as a Vichy French government in exile. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vichy French government, troops of the FFI took over and resumed control of the French political institutions. Antony Beevor comments that The landings {{in the south of}} France prompted a rapid German withdrawal and thus reduced the damage and suffering done to France.|$|E

Working with a borrowed tent, Laliberté then had to contend with difficulties with the European performers.

5|$|Production {{slowed down}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and {{economic}} stagnation {{in the independent}} Republic of Georgia. In 1995, bottling of Borjomi was restarted by the Georgian Glass and Mineral Waters Company (GG), which increased the production forty-fold. According to the company, 80% of Borjomi produced that year was exported abroad—more than half of this amount to Russia. Despite counterfeit drinks being produced under the Borjomi label {{as a result of}} rising piracy during the 1990s, Borjomi water was able to reclaim its reputation by 2000 in a distinctive packaging campaign. The piracy also slowed down due to the 1998 Russian financial crisis.|$|E

The election of Republican William O'Connell Bradley in 1895 began the only period of true two-party competition for the governorship; from Bradley's election through 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor of Kentucky. Since 1931, only four Republicans have served as governor of Kentucky; current governor Matt Bevin, whose term began in 2015, is the most recent.|$|E

5|$|Grant's {{second term}} saw renewed {{economic}} turmoil. In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a New York brokerage house, collapsed after {{it failed to}} sell all of the bonds issued by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway. The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for {{advice on how to}} resolve the crisis, which became known as the Panic of 1873. Grant believed that, as <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. He instructed the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|In March 1814, {{following}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First French Empire, Ferdinand VII {{was restored}} to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, {{since most of the}} political and legal changes made {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic—the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes—had been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from conservatives in the general population and the hierarchy of the Spanish Catholic Church; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain.|$|E
