40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{summarizes}} {{current research}} on the management of opioid withdrawal and considers {{the selection of the}} approach in different situations. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent publication of three controlled trials makes firm conclusions about the relative effectiveness of newer approaches (antagonist-induced <b>withdrawal</b> <b>under</b> anaesthesia or with minimal sedation; buprenorphine) to the management of opioid withdrawal possible. SUMMARY: Antagonist-induced <b>withdrawal</b> <b>under</b> anaesthesia should not be pursued as it has an increased risk of life-threatening adverse events and has no additional benefits relative to antagonist-induced <b>withdrawal</b> <b>under</b> minimal sedation. Antagonist-induced withdrawal with minimal sedation is feasible and may be suitable for those who intend to enter antagonist-maintenance treatment with a clear commitment to abstinence and good support. Buprenorphine is suitable for quick withdrawal, supports transition to naltrexone maintenance treatment, is safe and effective in outpatient settings and can be extended into maintenance treatment if the detoxification attempt is unsuccessful. Adrenergic agonists (clonidine and lofexidine) remain an effective option {{for those who do not}} want to use an opioid and do not intend to transfer to naltrexone maintenance treatment, with lofexidine being preferable for outpatient settings. Through appropriate choice of approach, detoxification can be a gateway to multiple, long-term treatment options...|$|R

40|$|To save layout {{area for}} {{electrostatic}} discharge (ESD) protection {{design in the}} SOC era, test chip with large size NMOS devices placed <b>under</b> <b>bond</b> pads has been fabricated in 0. 35 -µm one-poly-four-metal (1 P 4 M) 3. 3 V CMOS process for verification. The bond pads had been drawn with different layout patterns on the inter-layer metals to investigate the effect of bonding stress on the active devices under the pads. Threshold voltage, off-state drain current, and gate leakage current of these devices <b>under</b> <b>bond</b> pads have been measured. After assembled in wire bond package, the measurement results show {{that there are only}} little variations between devices <b>under</b> <b>bond</b> pads and devices beside bond pads.
