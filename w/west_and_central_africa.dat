5000|$|Okoubaka is a genus of tall {{forest tree}} native to <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> {{tropical}} <b>Africa.</b> It {{consists of two}} species, plus a third species or variety. Its name is from the Anyin language meaning a tree with allelopathic properties, or a tree that causes the death of surrounding vegetation. The tree was once common throughout West <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> parts of <b>Central</b> <b>Africa,</b> with O. aubrevillei being the primary West African species, and O. michelsonii found in <b>Central</b> <b>Africa.</b>|$|R
25|$|France's {{main goal}} was to stimulate the {{production}} of exports. Coffee, cocoa, and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast. Ivory Coast stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of settlers; elsewhere in <b>West</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Africa,</b> the French and British were largely bureaucrats. As a result, French citizens owned one-third of the cocoa, coffee, and banana plantations and adopted the local forced-labor system.|$|E
25|$|The Puerto Rican musical {{genres of}} bomba and plena are of West African and Caribbean origin, respectively; they are danced to during parties and West African-derived festivals.

25|$|The {{chimpanzee}} {{fossil record}} {{has long been}} absent and {{thought to have been}} due to the preservation bias in relation to their environment. However, in 2005, chimpanzee fossils were discovered and described by Sally McBrearty and colleagues. Existing chimpanzee populations in <b>West</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Africa</b> are separate from the major human fossil sites in East Africa; however, chimpanzee fossils have been reported from Kenya, indicating that both humans and members of the Pan clade were present in the East African Rift Valley during the Middle Pleistocene.|$|E
50|$|Dessalines {{was born}} in Cormier, a {{plantation}} near Grande Riviere du Nord, as a slave. Dessalines was a slave on a plantation in the Plaine-du-Nord in Cormiers (now known as Cormier), {{near the town of}} Grande-Rivière-du-Nord, where he was born as Jean-Jacques Duclos, the name of his father, who adopted it from his owner.

50|$|The rockfowl are {{distributed}} in <b>west</b> <b>and</b> western <b>Central</b> <b>Africa,</b> in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana (white-necked rockfowl), Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo <b>and</b> the <b>Central</b> African Republic (grey-necked rockfowl). The rockfowl live in lowland rainforest {{at up to}} 800 m, in rocky and hilly terrain {{on the slopes of}} hills and mountains. These birds require forest litter for foraging, a large enough area to contain army-ant swarms (Dorylinae), and rocks, cliffs or caves for nesting sites.|$|R
40|$|Monkeypox {{virus is}} a {{zoonotic}} orthopoxvirus (OPX) of <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> sub-Saharan <b>Africa.</b> We conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey in Likouala region, Republic of Congo to assess exposure to OPX. Whole blood was collected using Nobuto blood filter strips (NBFS). Titers of IgM and IgG to OPX were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Demographic and clinical characteristics {{were compared with}} serostatus using the chi-square test or Fisher 9 ̆ 2 s exact test. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate factors for independent association with serostatus. A total of 994 specimens were analyzed; the overall seroprevalence for OPX IgM was 1. 7...|$|R
25|$|Fossils of Pan {{species were}} not {{described}} until 2005. Existing chimpanzee populations in <b>West</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Africa</b> do not overlap {{with the major}} human fossil sites in East Africa. However, Pan fossils have now been reported from Kenya. This would indicate that both humans {{and members of the}} Pan clade were present in the East African Rift Valley during the Middle Pleistocene. According to A. Zihlman, bonobo body proportions closely resemble those of Australopithecus, leading evolutionary biologist Jeremy Griffith to suggest that bonobos may be a living example of our distant human ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Daily {{commercial}} traffic peaked in this year, {{with one or}} two daily arrivals. The busiest and most frequent connection was to Accra, with four airlines providing at least one flight per day on the route, which for a time made it the third-busiest connection from Accra and one of the top 15 route pairs in <b>West</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Africa,</b> although service on the route has diminished in 2012 with the end of Air Mali's unsuccessful Bamako-Monrovia-Accra service and the demise of Air Nigeria, which for several years had flown from Lagos to Monrovia via Accra five times per week.|$|E
25|$|From {{its early}} origins in slave communities, {{through the end}} of the 20th century, African-American art has made a vital {{contribution}} to the art of the United States. During the period between the 17th century and the early 19th century, art took the form of small drums, quilts, wrought-iron figures, and ceramic vessels in the southern United States. These artifacts have similarities with comparable crafts in <b>West</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Africa.</b> In contrast, African-American artisans like the New England–based engraver Scipio Moorhead and the Baltimore portrait painter Joshua Johnson created art that was conceived in a thoroughly western European fashion.|$|E

5000|$|Strophanthus preussii, Preuss' strophanthus, is an {{evergreen}} liana up to 12 m long or a shrub up to 5 m tall, with a {{stem diameter}} up to 2.5 cm. Its fragrant flowers feature a white to orange corolla, red-striped or spotted on the inside. Corollas have very long tails. Vernacular {{names for the}} plant include [...] "spider tresses" [...] and [...] "poison arrow vine". Habitats are forested areas from sea level to 1400 m altitude. Traditional medicinal uses of S. preussii include treatment of gonorrhoea and healing of sores. The plant has also been used as arrow poison. Strophanthus preussii is native to countries of <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> tropical <b>Africa.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Strophanthus sarmentosus grows {{as either}} a {{deciduous}} shrub or as a liana up to 40 m long, with a stem diameter up to 15 cm. Its fragrant flowers feature a white to purple corolla, red or purple-streaked on the inside. Vernacular names for the plant include [...] "spider tresses" [...] and [...] "poison arrow vine". Habitats are forested areas from sea level to 1400 m altitude. The numerous local medicinal uses of S. sarmentosus include treatment of joint pain, head lice, eye conditions and venereal disease. The plant has also been used as arrow poison. Strophanthus sarmentosus is native from <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>central</b> tropical <b>Africa</b> to Uganda and Angola.|$|R
25|$|The Sahel {{has long}} {{experienced}} {{a series of}} historic droughts, dating back to at least the 17th century. The Sahel region is a climate zone sandwiched between the African Savannah grasslands {{to the south and}} the Sahara desert to the north, across <b>West</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Africa.</b> While the frequency of drought in the region is thought to have increased {{from the end of the}} 19th century, three long droughts have had dramatic environmental and societal effects upon the Sahel nations. Famine followed severe droughts in the 1910s, the 1940s, and the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, although a partial recovery occurred from 1975-80. The most recent drought occurred in 2012.|$|E
25|$|African-American {{culture is}} {{primarily}} rooted in <b>West</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Africa,</b> {{and the majority}} of African-Americans have ancestry among the Yoruba people. Understanding its identity within the culture of the United States it is, in the anthropological sense, conscious of its origins as largely a blend of West and Central African cultures. Although slavery greatly restricted the ability of African-Americans to practice their original cultural traditions, many practices, values and beliefs survived, and over time have modified and/or blended with European cultures and other cultures such as that of Native Americans. African-American identity was established during the slavery period, producing a dynamic culture that has had and continues to have a profound impact on American culture as a whole, {{as well as that of}} the broader world.|$|E
25|$|Suramin {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Oskar Dressel and Richard Kothe in 1916 for Bayer. It {{was introduced in}} 1920 to treat {{the first stage of}} the disease. By 1922, Suramin was generally combined with tryparsamide (another pentavalent organoarsenic drug), the first drug to enter the nervous system and be useful in the treatment of the second stage of the gambiense form. Tryparsamide was announced in the Journal of Experimental Medicine in 1919 and tested in the Belgian Congo by Louise Pearce of the Rockefeller Institute in 1920. It was used during the grand epidemic in <b>West</b> <b>and</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Africa</b> on millions of people and was the mainstay of therapy until the 1960s. American medical missionary Arthur Lewis Piper was active in using tryparsamide to treat sleeping sickness in the Belgian Congo in 1925.|$|E
