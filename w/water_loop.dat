25|$|The cooling units {{could only}} {{work in a}} vacuum. Water from a tank in the {{backpack}} flowed out through tiny pores in a metal sublimator plate where it quickly vaporized into space. The loss of the heat of vaporization froze the remaining water, forming a layer of ice {{on the outside of}} the plate that also sublimated into space (turning from a solid directly into a gas). A separate <b>water</b> <b>loop</b> flowed through the LCG (Liquid Cooling Garment) worn by the astronaut, carrying his metabolic waste heat through the sublimator plate where it was cooled and returned to the LCG. Twelve pounds (5.4kg) of feedwater gave about eight hours of cooling; because of its bulk, it was often the limiting consumable on the length of an EVA.|$|E
2500|$|Cooling towers {{are also}} used in HVAC systems that have {{multiple}} water source heat pumps that share a common piping <b>water</b> <b>loop.</b> In this type of system, the water circulating inside the <b>water</b> <b>loop</b> removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the cooling mode, then the externally mounted cooling tower is used to remove heat from the <b>water</b> <b>loop</b> and reject it to the atmosphere. [...] By contrast, when the heat pumps are working in heating mode, the condensers draw heat {{out of the loop}} water and reject it into the space to be heated. [...] When the <b>water</b> <b>loop</b> is being used primarily to supply heat to the building, the cooling tower is normally shut down (and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage), and heat is supplied by other means, usually from separate boilers.|$|E

The exchanger keeps the cooling tower water separate from the coolant flowing through the cooling coils. The chiller water is thus pre-cooled.

Results: This software is able to solve the network with following specifications: (1) it doesn’t haveany limitation in view point of the number of <b>water</b> network <b>loops,</b> (2) the looped networks consistingsome sources, and (3) the networks containing pumps for increasing potential energy. Conclusion: Some networks with different characteristics such as the number of loops formingnetwork, network with some sources and the networks containing pumps were analyzed by thissoftware with hardy - cross methods and same results were obtained that these results are the evidencefor proper work of this software.
