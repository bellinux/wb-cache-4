40|$|Ticks are {{protected}} against ants by release of an allomonal defense secretion {{from the large}} wax glands (or type 2 glands) that line their bodies. To explore how the large wax glands operate, before and after microscopic observations of these glands (nonsecreted versus secreted test groups), mass determinations were made for Rhipicephalus sanguineus that had been exhausted of secretion by repeated leg pinching to simulate attack by a predator. Prior to secretion, the glandular organ is fully intact histologically and matches the sensillum sagittiforme, a key taxonomic structure described in the 1940 s. The large <b>wax</b> <b>gland</b> is innervated and responds to pressure stimulation as a proprioceptor that stimulates the secretory response. Histological observations after secretion has occurred show that the entire glandular contents and associated cells are jettisoned out of the gland like a syringe. The glandular cellular components are subsequently rebuilt by underlying hypodermal cells {{within a few days}} so that secretion can take place again. Presumably, the active allomonal ingredients (hydrocarbons) are released when these derived epidermal cells reach and burst onto the cuticular surface. Our conclusion is that the large wax glands are holocrine and feature intermittent regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bee propolis, {{a mixture}} of the {{secretion}} from bee tongue gland and <b>wax</b> <b>gland,</b> was collected from the tree bud and barked by bees. The components were rich in terpenes, phenolics, and flavonoids, and had anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotection abilities. However, the potential anti-oxidative stress of propolis was not well documented. This study aimed to study the protective effect of propolis on high-incident nonfatal diseases, such as stroke and cerebral infarction caused by ischemia. Objective: Oxidative stress caused by acute stroke results in inflammation and injury followed by cell damage and apoptosis. Clarification of the anti-oxidative stress effect of propolis may contribute to stroke prevention and damage reduction. Design: Propolis was separated and purified into 70 % ethanol and dichloromethane extracts systematically. The fraction three (Fr. 3) of dichloromethane was further separated into pinocembrin, pinobanksin, pinobanksin- 3 -acetate, chrysin, and galangin by chromatography. Compounds extracted from propolis were tested for cell-protection effects in an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) N 2 a cell model. MTT assay, oxidative stress markers measurement, flow cytometry, and QPCR were used to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis. Results: All compounds, especially pinocembrin and galangin, enhanced cell viability in OGD-treated N 2 a cells. In addition, anti-oxidative enzymes were elevated and cellular Ca 2 + was reduced. They also had extreme anti-apoptosis effects by up-regulating the expression of Bcl- 2 mRNA and down-regulating caspase- 3 and Bax expression. Taken together, propolis had anti-oxidative effects on stress and protected cells from damage. Conclusion: The anti-oxidative effect of propolis {{can be applied to}} daily food supplements and may benefit stroke patients...|$|E
40|$|Bees need wax as {{construction}} material for their combs. They produce {{it in their}} <b>wax</b> <b>glands,</b> which are fully developed in 12 to 18 days old workers. In older bees the <b>wax</b> <b>glands</b> diminish their activity. However in emergency situations wax-synthesis can be reactivated. Greatest quantities of wax are produced during the growth phase of bee colonies, under moderate climate conditions during April to June. A bibliography on the synthesis of beeswax is given in the monograph of Hepburn 12. The main raw materials for wax formation are carbohydrates, i. e. the honey sugars fructose, glucose and sucrose 45. The ratio of sugar to wax can vary from 3 to 30 : 1, a ratio of around 20 : 1 being typical for central Europe 45. The stronger the colony, the smaller the ratio, the more economical the wax production for the colony. One Langstroth frame, containing only 100 g of wax can hold 2 - 4 kg of honey. Wax production and comb construction activity in the bee colony are determined by following factors: • Nectar flow: the greater the flow, the more combs are needed for storage. • Brood rearing (egg laying) : the more eggs are layed, the more comb cells are needed. • The presence of a queen: only colonies with a queen build combs. • Temperature: temperatures higher than 15 ° C favour comb building activity • The presence of pollen as a protein sourc...|$|R

40|$|If a {{honeybee}} (Apis mellifera) colony {{loses its}} queen, worker bees develop their ovaries and produce male offspring [1]. Kin selection theory {{predicts that the}} degree of altruism in queenless colonies should be reduced because the relatedness of workers to a hivemate's offspring is less in queenless colonies than it is to the daughters of the queen in queenright colonies [2 - 4]. To explore this hypothesis, we examined the behavior and physiology of queenless egg-laying workers. Queenless bees engaged in both personal reproduction and the social foraging and defense tasks that benefited their colony. Laying workers also had larger brood-food-producing and <b>wax</b> <b>glands,</b> showing metabolic investments in both colony maintenance and personal reproduction. Whereas in queenright colonies there is a very clear age-based pattern of division of labor between workers, in queenless colonies the degree of individual specialization was much reduced. Queenless colonies functioned as a collective of reproductive and behaviorally generalist bees that cooperatively maintained and defended their nest. This social structure is similar to that observed in a number of primitively social bee species [5]. Laying workers therefore show a mix of selfish personal reproduction and altruistic cooperative behavior, and the queenless state reveals previously unrecognized plasticity in honeybee social organization. 5 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The Phylloxeran {{species are}} very small to minute insects. Besides, {{there is a high}} {{polymorphism}} in the Phylloxeridae family making it really hard sometimes to identify its members. Also, they can pretty easily be confused to related insects such as Adelgids and true Aphids. The most important features used to tell them apart from their relatives and from other insects are the wings’ venation, the ovipositor and some characteristics of their antennae.Phylloxerans have a three-segmented antenna in all forms (both adults and immature). The Wings held flat over the body at rest and the Cu1 and Cu2 of the front wings are stalked at the base. The flagellum always ends in a sensorium (or rhinaria) and adult females can have one or two additional sensorial on the flagellum. Egg laying females and males have vestigial mouthparts and are wingless. Concerning the immature, the nymphs resemble adults but never have the secondary sensorium. Also the immature of the sexuales have a unique non-feeding pupiform larva.You can distinguish Phylloxerans from Adelgids {{by the fact that they}} have a vulva instead of a sclerotized ovipositor and usually lack the <b>wax</b> <b>glands</b> or plates found in Adelgids.

40|$|Body {{condition}} {{can affect}} coloration of traits used in sexual selection and parent [...] offspring communication by inducing rapid internal changes in pigment concentration or aggregation, thickness of collagen arrays, or blood flux. The recent "makeup hypothesis" proposes an alternative honesty-reinforcing mechanism, with behaviorally mediated deposition of substances on body surfaces ("cosmetics") generating covariation between body condition and coloration. In birds, the uropygial <b>gland</b> <b>wax</b> is actively spread on feathers using {{the bill and}} changes in its deposition rate may cause rapid changes in bill and plumage coloration. Using tawny owl nestlings, we tested 3 predictions of the makeup hypothesis, namely that 1) quantity of preen wax deposited accounts for variation in bill coloration, 2) an immune stimulation (induced by injection of a lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) impairs uropygial <b>gland</b> <b>wax</b> production, and 3) different intensities of immune stimulations (strong vs. weak stimulations induced by injections of either LPS or phytohemagglutinin [PHA], respectively) and high versus low food availabilities result in different bill colorations. We found that 1) preen wax reduced bill brightness, 2) a challenge with LPS impaired uropygial gland development, and 3) nestlings challenged with LPS had a brighter bill than PHA-injected nestlings, whereas diet manipulation had no significant effect. Altogether, {{these results suggest that}} a strong immune challenge may decrease preen wax deposition rate on the bill of nestling birds, at least by impairing <b>gland</b> <b>wax</b> production, which causes a change in bill coloration. Our study therefore highlights that cosmetic colors might signal short-term variation in immunological status. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

Having found a location on a suitable tree, the crawler forces its tubular stylet into the bark and starts to feed. At this stage, it moults and becomes a second-stage, legless nymph, and will remain sedentary for the rest of its life. It secretes <b>wax</b> from <b>glands</b> and is soon covered in a protective coating of wool-like material. After overwintering it completes a second moult in the spring to become a mature female.|$|R

Its aerial parts in flowering stage {{are used by}} local people against influenza virus due to its antimicrobial effect. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the morphology, anatomy and histology of the vegetative and reproductive organs of the H. telephioides, which are used in popular medicine, thereby, contributing to the pharmacognostic evaluation of the species. The species was studied morphologically in detail. New morphological features were described for them, such as the dimension of leaf, sepal and fruit, size of filament, anther and pistil, and diameter of the ovary. In addition, some deviating features were found in relation to previous published descriptions for the species, such as plant height and petal length. The anatomy of plant parts such as stem, leaf, sepal, petal, filament and pistil, were studied using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Stem has incipient secondary growth. The leaf is amphistomatic and the mesophyll is equifacial. Stomata are anomocytic and sunken. In micromorphological studies, it is determined that the leaf is coated by a thick cuticle and above epicuticular <b>wax.</b> Schizogenous <b>glands</b> were found in all vegetative and reproductive organs. The structural features herein found can assist the diagnosis of H. telephioides...|$|R

The true function of these glands {{has yet to be}} determined, but there are several theories, including antioxidant effects, antibacterial effects, and transport of pheromones. Sebaceous glands produce lipids that are involved in the pathogenesis {{of one of the most}} prevalent diseases of adolescence, acne. Although the majority of lipids produced by the sebaceous gland are also produced in other areas of the body, there are two that are characteristic of the sebaceous <b>gland,</b> <b>wax</b> esters and squalene. This review seeks to present an update on the physiology of the sebaceous glands, with particular emphasis on the production of sebaceous lipids. —Smith, K. R. and D. M. Thiboutot.
