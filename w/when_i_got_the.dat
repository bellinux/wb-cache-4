At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E

[...] "Friends Forever" [...] is {{a parody of}} 1950s-style musical numbers in general, and [...] "We Go Together" [...] from Grease in particular. However, {{this was not the}} original plan. According to Fordham, [...] "I was really shocked <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> demo back, because I had never envisioned a '50s number. I did mention 'We Go Together,' just as an example of I wanted a cheesy, fun, happy ending kind of a thing." ...|$|E

According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> camera out, it made me feel better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. We were so nervous being together. I'm really shy, and when I had the camera in my hand, it made me feel more outspoken." ...|$|E
500|$|Tibbets {{was interviewed}} {{extensively}} by Mike Harden of the Columbus Dispatch, and profiles {{appeared in the}} newspaper on anniversaries of the first dropping of an atomic bomb.

500|$|Smith {{died of a}} liver {{haemorrhage}} in June 1955, {{at the age of}} fifty, leaving £2000 in his will. The Smiths {{had rented}} their two first-floor bedrooms to students for extra income since 1947, while the Smiths slept in the former dining room; on the ground floor, {{at the back of the}} house. Some of the students who lodged there included John Cavill (from September 1949 until June 1950). Cavill played piano, but as the house had none he bought a guitar; admitting he knew almost nothing about chords: [...] "My father had a violin and I had learned to play pizzicato on it, so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> guitar I played tunes on the strings, and John [...] did the same". Michael Fishwick also lodged there (from October 1951 until December 1958), as did Keith Capron (September 1956 to July 1959). Both Capron and Cavill were studying veterinary science at the University of Liverpool, with Fishwick studying biochemistry.|$|E

500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E

On September 21, 2013, Pusha T released snippets {{for the standard}} edition tracks. On September 27, 2013, Pusha T released the music video for the intro track [...] "King Push". On October 2, 2013, {{after a few days}} of being credited as a co-producer of [...] "King Push", Joaquin Phoenix denied having assist in producing the song. He said, [...] "While it was widely reported that Pusha T used my beat and that I produced his song, I can't take any credit. A friend's son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye's camp." [...] On October 3, 2013, during an interview with Rap-Up, Pusha T revealed that it was actually the son of Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich who produced the song, saying [...] "Joaquin Phoenix gave the beat to 'Ye, so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> beat from 'Ye, it was, Yo, Joaquin gave me this beat. So me, I'm just like, OK, I know Joaquin's into music and you know the whole thing, so I'm like, Oh, damn. I believe it is the son of Lars Ulrich from Metallica. I hope I'm not wrong this time. It was mistaken because it came from Joaquin." [...] On October 1, 2013, the album was released for free streaming via MySpace.|$|E
2500|$|However, in June 2003, it was {{confirmed}} that Lisa would {{once again be}} returning to the serial.

2500|$|In 2006, Savage {{participated in}} the UK edition of The X Factor and {{advanced}} to the final 24 while attending the aforementioned music school.

2500|$|Commenting to Digital Spy {{about her}} return, Lawrence said: [...] "I've {{not been in}} the show for 11 years and it's not like I've ever thought [...] "I'll never go back", you just think that your chance to go back has gone. It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{about two}} {{minutes left in the}} half, the Dolphins finally managed to get a good drive going on their next possession. Marino {{completed}} seven out of nine passes, the last one being a 30-yard pass to tight end Joe Rose, to reach the 49ers' 12-yard line. However, San Francisco's defense tightened up on the next three plays, forcing two incompletions and a completed pass for no gain, and Miami was forced to settle for von Schamann's second field goal of the game to cut their deficit to 28–13 with 12 seconds left in the half. Then Miami caught a break as the 49ers botched the ensuing kickoff. San Francisco lineman Guy McIntyre received von Schamann's short kick and was about to down the ball, but then changed his mind at the last second and decided to return it. This {{turned out to be a}} big mistake; McIntyre fumbled while being leveled by rookie Joe Carter, and Jim Jensen recovered the ball for Miami at the 49ers' 12-yard line. After that, von Schamann kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half, cutting the score to 28–16. [...] "I can laugh about the play now, but it wasn't funny at the time," [...] McIntyre said after the game. [...] "My first instinct <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> ball was to fall down. Then I heard everyone yelling, 'Get up! Get up!' So I got up, and here comes someone sneaking underneath me, and he hit the ball." ...|$|E
