40|$|Soil denitrifying enzyme {{activity}} (DEA) is often assessed after cold storage. Previous studies using the short-term acetylene inhibition method have not considered conditioning time (post-cold storage <b>warming-up</b> <b>time</b> prior to soil analysis) {{as a factor}} influencing results. We observed fluctuations in DEA following cold storage, suggesting a need to consider conditioning time when planning and interpreting results...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Non-Destructive Testing, model {{selection}} {{is a common}} problem, e. g, {{to determine the number}} of defects present in the inspectedworkpiece. Statistical model selection requires to approximate the marginal likelihood also called model evidence. Its numericalapproximation is usually computationally expensive. Nested Sampling (NS) offers a good compromise between estimation accuracyand computational cost. But it requires to evaluate the forward model many times. Here, we first propose a general frameworkwhere data-fitting surrogate models are used to accelerate the computation. Then, improvements benefiting from surrogate modelingare introduced into the traditional NS algorithm to further reduce the computational cost. These improvements include the use ofa sparse grid surrogate model to deal with the “curse-of-dimensionality“ in large dimensional problems and of the pre-estimatedposterior space to save <b>warming-up</b> <b>time.</b> Based on eddy-current simulations, we show that this improved model selection approachhas high model selection ability and can jointly perform model selection and parameter inversion...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To test {{short-term}} and long-term elastomeric infusion pumps for applicability in hospital practice and for ambulant patients at home. DESIGN AND METHODS: Four short-term elastomeric infusion pumps (Accufuser C 1000 M, Easypump ST 100 - 1, Infusor Intermate SV- 100, Surefuser Plus 100 ml) and four long-term pumps (Accufuser C 0100 L, Easypump LT 270 - 24, Infusor Folfusor LV- 10, Surefuser Plus 18102 - 01) {{were included in}} the study. Each was exploratively tested for accuracy and uniformity of the flow rate and sensitivity to external factors (temperature, fluid viscosity, height difference between pump and patient connection, filling degree), residual volume, evaporation upon storage, <b>warming-up</b> <b>time</b> and sterility. RESULTS: Flow rate of short-term pumps was less constant than of long-term pumps and displayed more deviations. For most pumps tested, the flow rate decreased in time. Flow rate increased at temperatures higher than the calibration temperature and decreased at lower temperatures. Higher fluid viscosity reduced flow rate. Differences in height between pump and patient connection up to 10 cm slightly influenced flow rate. Filling degree less than the nominal value reduced flow rate. Evaporation upon storage in the refrigerator was limited. Warming up from refrigerator to room temperature maximally required six hours. Sterility was maintained upon four weeks storage at 35 °C. CONCLUSION: Flow rate of elastomeric infusion pumps was not constant and was significantly influenced by external factors. There was little difference in outcome between the pumps tested. Other factors (beyond the scope of this study), such as ease to prepare, patient-friendliness and price are also important determinants for making a choice. Principally because of the limited accuracy of the flow rate, we consider elastomeric infusion pumps less suitable for administration of cytostatic agents and pain treatment than for antibiotics...|$|E
