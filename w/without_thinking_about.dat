25|$|During most dreams, {{the person}} dreaming is {{not aware that}} they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or {{eccentric}} the dream is. The reason for this {{may be that the}} prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> what might happen, since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.|$|E

500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Illinois were written, recorded, engineered, and {{produced}} by Stevens, {{with most of the}} material being recorded at The Buddy Project studio in Astoria, Queens, and in Stevens' Brooklyn apartment. As with his previous albums, Stevens recorded in various locations, with additional piano recorded in St. Paul's Church in Brooklyn; strings and vocals performed in collaborators' apartments; electronic organ recorded in the New Jerusalem Recreational Room in Clarksboro, New Jersey; and vibraphone played at Carroll Music Studios in New York City. Stevens mostly created the album without collaboration, focusing on the writing, performance, and technical creation of the album by himself: [...] "I was pretty nearsighted in the construction of Illinois. I {{spent a lot of time}} alone, a few months in isolation working on my own and in the studio. I let things germinate and cultivate independently, <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> an audience or a live show at all." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} {{the promotion of}} his previous studio album El Rock de Mi Pueblo (2004), Vives ended his music contract with EMI Latin and took a hiatus, for concentrating on supporting local artists as a producer and songwriter. He then met Juanita Santos, the president of Rafael Pombo Foundation, who asked them to present {{a proposal for a}} musical that uses the most iconic poems and fables created by Pombo. Motivated by this, they began to study many books about Pombo and his works. The creation of Pombo Musical began as a studio project in house between old friends, Carlos Ivan Medina, Carlos Huertas and Ernesto [...] "Teto" [...] Ocampo. He stated: [...] "Before we worked musically on some of Rafael Pombo's works, <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> making a record, but because somebody had done a melody of Rin Rin". Together with Medina, Vives made a melody for [...] "Modelo Alfabético". On July 24, 2008, Vives released [...] "El Modelo Alfabético", a song based on a poem by Pombo, with influences of cumbia and rock as the album's lead single.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade. [...] It was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello and was mixed by Brendan O'Brien. When asked about the song {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "It was the most uptempo, radio-friendly song. We all decided it was the right choice to release it as the first single." [...] He went on to describe his expectations when writing songs, saying, [...] "My ultimate goal in writing songs is to connect with people. In the lyrics, you don't tell the whole picture: You give a road to start on that people can relate to. We're honest, nice guys and I hope that comes across in everything we do." [...] After being asked how he wrote the song in an interview with Launch, Wade explained, [...] "I wrote that song <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> what was gonna happen to it and then it just kinda took over from there." [...] He also said in the interview that he wrote [...] "Hanging by a Moment" [...] in about five minutes.|$|E
500|$|... "Hanging by a Moment" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{alternative}} band Lifehouse. It was {{the first}} single released from their debut studio album, No Name Face (2000). The track was written by lead singer Jason Wade, {{who said that he}} wrote the song in about five minutes <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> what would happen to it. It was produced by American record producer Ron Aniello and was mixed by Brendan O'Brien. Musically, [...] "Hanging by a Moment" [...] is a post-grunge song that contains influences of alternative rock. The song was first released in the United States on August 16, 2000 by DreamWorks Records. It peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and is the band's most successful single to date on the chart. Despite not peaking at number one, it was the number one single of 2001, becoming only the third (and currently last) single to top the year-end charts despite never spending a week {{at the top of the}} weekly charts and followed [...] "Breathe" [...] from the previous year in completing this feat, marking the second consecutive year this feat had been accomplished despite it not happening for 35 years prior to 2000.|$|E

500|$|Sukumar {{then began}} working on the script of Jagadam (2007), a crime film {{starring}} Ram Pothineni and Isha Sahni. Unlike Arya, Jagadam focused more on violence and {{in an interview with}} South Scope, Sukumar called the film an [...] "act of bravado", adding that he [...] "made it with an innocent passion", <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the audience's response. Jagadam received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure. While Sify called the film a [...] "not so much a plot-driven film" [...] albeit praising the work of its technical crew, Rediff called it a [...] "good effort". He then wrote and directed Arya 2 (2009), which was promoted as the namesake sequel of his debut Arya. It featured Allu Arjun, Kajal Aggarwal, and Navdeep in the lead roles and narrated the story of Arya, a psychotic orphan whose love for his friend Ajay and his colleague Geetha is never reciprocated. Sify called it Sukumar's [...] "another celluloid misadventure" [...] after Jagadam and stated that he [...] "fails both as a writer and director as his plotline is confusing and his hero's characterization is negative". However, Arya 2 became one of the few successful Telugu films of the year, and was praised for its style quotient and music. Sukumar received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director– Telugu at the 57th Filmfare Awards South ceremony, but lost it to S. S. Rajamouli for Magadheera. Rajamouli stated that he regards Sukumar as the best of the lot after watching Arya 2, which was Sukumar's [...] "most precious and sweetest thing I have heard about myself".|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{the second}} element created for the game, following the graphics created by Jensen. The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have, but aware of how these elements would {{be presented to the}} player in the released version. Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly. Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine, became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles. Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to [...] " [...] you guessing all the way through". Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game. Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in [...] that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial-and-error and eventually come out with the solution <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> why the solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself. Carlsen designed Limbo puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a switch panel, an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal—to use the chain to cross the electrified floor—is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine the right combination of moves and timing to complete it safely. They often had to strip away elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out. The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters, several would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.|$|E

2500|$|Voice actress Jennifer Hale {{called on}} the gaming {{community}} to improve the self-policing of its small and vicious fringe, and said race and gender barriers persist in the industry. Developer Peter Molyneux considered that the Internet's instant accessibility of social media allows for people to express of-the-moment opinions <b>without</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> their consequences, leading to a [...] "whole Pandora's Box" [...] of {{both good and bad}} issues that society must consider in terms of freedom of speech.
