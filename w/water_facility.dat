The Value Chain model is then used to identify linkages and competitive scopes that exist within the larger <b>water</b> <b>facilities</b> industry. Through the analyses conducted with the two models, sources of competitive advantage or key success factors are identified and critical ones are recommended for implementation...|$|R
