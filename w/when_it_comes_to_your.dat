5000|$|... • Ijara {{financing}} is a redeemable {{lease contract}} {{based on the}} Islamic principle of Ijara wa Iqtina, (lease to own). The process is simple: You identify a property and an independent Trust acquires it on your behalf and leases it back to you. You make monthly payments to the Trust that comprise of a Rent portion and an Acquisition payment. At {{the end of the}} contract term, the Trust transfers the house ownership to your name. You now own the property free and clear. The minimum down payment for Ijara contracts is typically 30%. Your payment on-account represents your beneficial rights in the property. Your monthly payments include rent and further payments on-account, thereby increasing your beneficial rights. You can acquire full title to the property when the sum of your payments on-account equals the original purchase price. The original purchase price is the goal toward which you are always working; we do not adjust it {{over the life of the}} lease. This eliminates gharar (doubtful practices), or any uncertainty <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> financial arrangement.|$|E

The app will help its users to try and enjoy a healthier lifestyle by attempting to improve their diet, social life and fitness. All these subjects are attributed to mental health problems which the app will try and address. The apps primary features include a chatroom feature that allows the user to create chatrooms about the different topics revolving around mental and interact with other users about their personal experiences. A mindfulness feature has been implemented in the app in order to help users in times of stress. Mindfulness has been proven to help people in terms of mental health.

40|$|You are who {{you play}} you are - {{especially}} <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> age and your motivations. People say age {{is only a}} number, but it's a number we can guess pretty accurately from how someone plays video games. We find that younger people are favored by speed, while older people are favored by wisdom. There is even a sweet spot where it all comes together around 20 years of age. At least, as far as game performance goes among 13, 000 players of a shooter game like Battlefield 3. When we look at gaming motivation, the picture becomes more intricate. We found that motivations show through in game behavior as well. Specifically, we developed a 13 -factor model that measures gaming motivation across achievement-, social-, and immersion-related drives. It is shown that these motivations line up with game preference, age, gender, and personality, {{in a sample of}} 3000 players of World of Warcraft (multiplayer fantasy game), League of Legends (multiplayer arena fighting game), and Battlefield (multiplayer shooter game) players. A lot of intuitions were confirmed: Males show more competition motivation than females, while females show more drive for customization (making aesthetic choices); All 13 gaming motivations decrease with age; People who are more sociable in real life are also more interested in socializing in video games; Shooter players are more excitement, competition, and team work driven; MMORPG players prefer story, customization, and socializing. So, what can data like this tell us? It all comes down to figuring out the potential of video games as the next profiling tools. Video game behavior is simply human behavior in a digital realm. Tracking and analyzing that behavior is the digital equivalent of a psychologist doing a personalized observational study on you. The difference is that video game worlds limit your behavior: You get a fixed set of options to choose from, and that's it. With time, that set of actions is going to get bigger and bigger. Video games will offer a space where we can act in more complicated and expressive ways. And with each step along that road, we will get closer and closer to revealing our identities through our game play behavior. This research {{was one of the first}} explorations down that road...|$|E
40|$|Our {{society has}} faced monumental changes and {{therefore}} our working {{life has changed}} as well. We {{are now in the}} twentieth first century and still our labor market is gender-segregated. Today networking {{is an important part of}} working life and one cannot emphasize enough the importance of having good connections in your network. Networking is now seen as an important tool <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> career. In the past networking has been the men’s arena and it has almost been seen as a male institution. Women networks have now emerged and one can see more and more women engaging together. But how does it really appear in real life? In our survey we have been interviewing 6 women leaders all engaging in several professional networks. We have asked them how they use their networks, both their women-only networks and the gender-mixed. But above all we have been interested in knowing how the women support each other and whether the women are helping each other career wise. Our theoretical framework has it is focus in gender research but we have also been helped by leader management literature. Our wish is to give a comprehensive understanding. The social structures will follow through the paper. Our hope is that networking can help lift women so that we can get a more equal gender balance among leaders on the Swedish labor market. In our analysis and discussion we have been able to identify that networking in general is of great importance to the interviewed women in our survey. Gender-mixed and women-only networks are complementary. It is noticeable that women use them in different ways. The women-only networks have a tendency of relational characteristics and are used as a support function. The gender-mixed networks are seen upon as more rational and are used in a more business like way. But one can also see that the women consider the male and gender-mixed networks as easier to be a part of. And based on the results we have also identified that the gender system has a big impact on the women’s relations between each other. As mentioned before networking in general is an important tool career wise. And the results show that the women agree with that. At the same time they stress that the women-only network are without power. Which means, that if you want to climb in your career you will have to join the male or gender mixed networks because they are the once with the power...|$|E
