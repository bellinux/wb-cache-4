Looking back years later, Nelson branded the album [...] "depressing", while Grimmit said [...] "the end quality wasn't as good as it could have been, but I think the songs are certainly there". The band undertook a month-long UK tour in May 2004, played their first mainland Europe gig in July in Russia and rounded out the year with a pair of gigs in December, debuting new songs Revenge and Backstage. A further new song, Diamond In The Rough, was debuted live at Junktion 7 in Nottingham on 22 January 2005. King Adora's final live performance took place at Birmingham Academy on 29 May 2005 (on a multi-band bill featuring New Model Army, Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster, Turbonegro and Future Ex-Wife), debuting new song Can't Stay Away. Rumours spread of a third album, a live DVD release (a Birmingham Academy 2 performance from 2004 had been filmed professionally) and the band discussed changing their name and reforming.

40|$|National Research FoundationStroke {{correspondence}} {{construction is}} {{a precondition for}} generating inbetween frames from a set of key frames. In our case, each stroke in a key frame is a vector represented as a Disk B-Spline Curve (DBSC) which is a flexible and compact vector format. However, {{it is not easy}} to construct correspondences between multiple DBSC strokes effectively because of the following points: (1) with the use of shape descriptors, the dimensionality of the feature space is high; (2) the number of strokes in different key frames is usually large and different from each other and (3) the length of corresponding strokes can be very different. The first point makes matching difficult. The other two points imply many to many and part to whole correspondences between strokes. To solve these problems, this paper presents a DBSC stroke correspondence construction approach, which introduces a manifold learning technique to the matching process. Moreover, in order to handle the mapping between unequal numbers of strokes with different lengths, a stroke reconstruction algorithm is developed to convert the many to many and part to <b>whole</b> <b>stroke</b> correspondences to one to one compound stroke correspondence...|$|E

Deep pumping with small-diameter pump only reduces the liquid pressure load in upstroke, so only maximum polished rod load is decreased. The reduction effect depends {{on the size of}} the pump used. When a D 56  mm pump is replaced by a D 38  mm pump, the maximum polished rod load is decreased by about 11 %. Fiberglass sucker rod can greatly reduce the polished rod load in <b>whole</b> <b>stroke</b> by around 50 %. The reduction effect depends on the proportion of fiberglass sucker rod in a composite rod string.

We excluded patients with emergent, trauma-related, transplantation, cardiac, or neurological operations. Major hemorrhage was defined as bleeding necessitating transfusion of 4 U of {{packed red blood cells}} or <b>whole</b> blood. <b>Stroke</b> was defined as focal brain dysfunction lasting 24 hours from a vascular cause.

Patients: A total of 44 chronic stroke patients, recruited in Belgium and Benin, respectively European high-income and African low-income countries. Methods: This longitudinal, single-cohort, observational study with 1 intervention period and 4 time-points of assessments (2 baseline, 1 post-intervention and 1 follow-up) was structured in 3 periods: pre-intervention period (1 month), intervention period (3 months) and follow-up period (3 month). Intervention {{consisted of a}} 3 times/week groupbased brisk walking programme. Primary outcome measures were ACTIVLIM-Stroke questionnaire and the 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT). Secondary outcome measures were the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Results: All outcome measures were stable during the preintervention period (p ≥ 0. 16). They all improved significantly after intervention (p ≤ 0. 01), except the HADS (p = 0. 058). However, during the follow-up period, SIAS (p = 0. 002) and BBS (p = 0. 001) decreased, while ACTIVLIM-Stroke, 6 MWT and HADS showed no significant change (p ≥ 0. 13).

Association analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PDE 4 D gene in an Icelandic stroke cohort demonstrated genetic association between six SNPs in the 5 ′ region of PDE 4 D and ischaemic stroke. The present study aimed to test whether the same six SNPs in PDE 4 D were also associated with stroke in a large stroke cohort from northern Germany (stroke patients with acute completed ischaemic stroke: n =  1181; population based controls: n =  1569).

40|$|Determining the {{efficiency}} of a swimming stroke is difficult because different “efficiencies” can be computed based on the partitioning of mechanical power output (Ẇ) into its useful and nonuseful components, as well as because of the difficulties in measuring the forces that a swimmer can exert in water. In this paper, overall efficiency (ηO = ẆTOT/Ė, where ẆTOT is total mechanical power output, and Ė is overall metabolic power input) was calculated in 10 swimmers {{by means of a}} laboratory-based whole-body swimming ergometer, whereas propelling efficiency (ηP = ẆD/ẆTOT, where ẆD is the power to overcome drag) was estimated based on these values and on values of drag efficiency (ηD = ẆD/Ė) : ηP = ηD/ηO. The values of ηD reported in the literature range from 0. 03 to 0. 09 (based on data for passive and active drag, respectively). ηO was 0. 28 ± 0. 01, and ηP was estimated to range from ∼ 0. 10 (ηD = 0. 03) to 0. 35 (ηD = 0. 09). Even if there are obvious limitations to exact simulation of the <b>whole</b> swimming <b>stroke</b> within the laboratory, these calculations suggest that the data reported in the literature for ηO are probably underestimated, because not all components of ẆTOT can be measured accurately in this environment.

40|$|We {{examined}} the preferred mode of arm coordination in 14 elite male front-crawl swimmers. Each swimmer performed eight successive swim trials in which target velocity increased from the swimmer’s usual 3000 -m velocity to his maximal velocity. Actual swim velocity, stroke rate, stroke length {{and the different}} arm stroke phases were then calculated from video analysis. Arm coordination was quantified by an index of coordination based on the lag time between the propulsive phases of each arm. The index expressed the three coordination modes in the front crawl: opposition, catch-up and superposition. First, {{in line with the}} dynamic approach to movement coordination, the index of coordination could be considered as an order parameter that qualitatively captured arm coordination. Second, two coordination modes were observed: a catch-up pattern (index of coordination= 78. 43 %) consisting of a lag time between the propulsive phases of each arm, and a relative opposition pattern (index of coordination = 0. 89 %) in which the propulsive phase of one arm ended when the propulsive phase of the other arm began. An abrupt change in the coordination pattern occurred at the critical velocity of 1. 8 m s 71, which corresponded to the 100 -m pace: the swimmers switched from catch-up to relative opposition. This change in coordination resulted in a reorganization of the arm phases: the duration of the entry and catch phase decreased, while the duration of the pull and push phases increased in relation to the <b>whole</b> <b>stroke.</b> Third, these changes were coupled to increased stroke rate and decreased stroke length, indicating tha...|$|E

This study aims to investigate (1) whether stroke patients without aphasia exhibit impairments in cohesion and coherence in connected speech, and (2) the role of attention and executive functions {{in the production of}} connected speech. Eighteen stroke patients (8 right hemisphere stroke [RHS]; 6 left [LHS]) and 21 healthy controls completed two self-generated narrative tasks to elicit connected speech. A multi-level analysis of within and between-sentence processing ability was conducted. Cohesion and coherence impairments were found in the stroke group, particularly RHS patients, relative to controls. In the <b>whole</b> <b>stroke</b> group, better performance on the Hayling Test of executive function, which taps verbal initiation/suppression, was related to fewer propositional repetitions and global coherence errors. Better performance on attention tasks was related to fewer propositional repetitions, and decreased global coherence errors. In the RHS group, aspects of cohesive and coherent speech were associated with better performance on attention tasks. Better Hayling Test scores were related to more cohesive and coherent speech in RHS patients, and more coherent speech in LHS patients. Thus, we documented connected speech deficits in a heterogeneous stroke group without prominent aphasia.

Four phases of the arm stroke and three phases of the leg kick as well as phases of simultaneous arm and leg propulsion and recovery were identified from video of swimmers ’ motions below the surface. The duration of each phase was expressed as a proportion of the <b>whole</b> <b>stroke</b> cycle. Three measures of the arm-leg coordination, percent simultaneous arm-leg recovery time (%SRT), percent arm lag time (%ALT) and percent simultaneous arm-leg propulsion time (%SPT) were calculated. Mean mid-pool swimming hip velocity (V), stroke rate (SR) and stroke length (SL) were also calculated. In addition, the intra-cycle hip velocity of the swimmers was obtained by cinematographic analysis. The SR decreased and SL increased significantly as the event distance increased. For the arm-leg coordination the %ALT, %SPT and %SRT indicated significant differences between event, gender and performance level. In particular, for increasing event distance and for the higher performing swimmer the lower the %SPT and the higher the %SRT. In addition, the range of the intra-cycle hip velocity fluctuation in the lower performing group was greater than the higher performing group. The non-propulsive phase seems to be a key factor for better performance; the breaststroke swimmers must avoid rapid deceleration during the non-propulsive phase by adopting a low resistance posture and stroking technique...|$|E

Thus, the objective of our study was to investigate the impact of rt-PA treatment on post-stroke cir-culating BDNF levels in humans and in animals. Serum BDNF levels and t-PA/plasmin activity were measured at hospital admission and at up to 90 days in stroke patients receiv-ing (n = 24) or not (n = 14) rt-PA perfusion. We investigated the relationships between serum BDNF with concurrent t-PA/plasmin activity, neurological outcomes and cardiovas-cular scores at admission. In parallel, serum BDNF levels and t-PA/plasmin activity were assessed before and after (1, 4 and 24 h) the induction of ischemic stroke in rats.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{presence of}} cold work material on cylinder liners {{due to the}} introduction of the diamond honing is undesirable as it seats the oil-bearing honing grooves. The most of it is a smeared metal inside the deep honing grooves (blechmantel) that may break and act as abrasive wear particles increasing the bore wear. An attempt has been made to estimate the extent of removal of blechmantel for different wear regimes present at the middle and top region (near the top dead centre) of the liner surface using the least worn bottom region as a reference for comparison. A number of truck grey iron cylinder liners were axially sectioned after varying periods of engine running under similar conditions of load, engine speed and lubrication. 3 D surface measurements were taken at the three regions and a range of standard parameters was extracted. Combining the profile and image analysis, an algorithm was developed to identify and quantify the blechmantel. The algorithm has successfully identified/quantified the blechmantel and can be used for automatic surface quality and process control. It was found that the amount of the blechmantel in the middle section was approximately the same (though slightly lower) as that in the bottom section, while there was a considerable dislocation and removal of blechmantel in the top section and thereby it represents one of the possible causes for wear. Axial wear scratches of different size and distribution were observed not only through the <b>whole</b> <b>stroke</b> area, but also in the bottom region. All engines and liners performed well throughout the tests, and the observed quantities of blechmantel and axial scratches are acceptable for the time being...|$|E
40|$|Stroke is {{the third}} {{leading cause of death}} after {{coronary}} heart disease and cancer. The clinical burden of stroke now exceeds that of coronary heart disease. 1 Especially in the aging population stroke is a major disease. By the year 2020 the incidence of stroke in the Netherlands is expected to have increased to 2. 5 per 1000 and the prevalence to 8. 7 per 1000 for the <b>whole</b> population. 2 <b>Stroke</b> is also {{the most common cause of}} disabilities in adults. Therefore not only the disease impact but also the healthcare impact of stroke is substantial. 3 Stroke is defined as the clinical syndrome of rapid onset of focal or global cerebral deficit with a presumed vascular cause. Different pathological mechanisms can be responsible for a stroke: cerebral ischemia (≈ 80 %), primary intracerebral hemorrhage (≈ 15 %), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (≈ 5 %). Ischemic stroke is confined to an area of the brain perfused by a specific artery and lasts longer than 24 hours or has led to death. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms usually lasting less than 24 hours, and without evidence of acute infarction...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the change in gene expression between two time points following stroke and to identify biomarkers of stroke recovery through gene expression profiling and pathway analysis. Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 34 ischemic stroke patients (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging) ≥ 18 years of age, within 24 hr of symptom onset and 24 – 48 hr later, and from healthy controls. The Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) was used to determine 30 -day recovery. Total RNA was extracted from whole blood in Paxgene RNA tubes, amplified, and hybri-dized to Illumina HumanRef- 8 v 2 bead chips. Gene expression was compared in a univariate manner between stroke patients at both time points and good versus bad outcome using t-test in GeneSpring. Inflation of Type 1 error was corrected by false discovery rate (FDR), and Ingenuity Systems Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed. A secondary validation cohort was recruited from a local hospital. Results: Three genes were significantly downregulated over time (LY 96, IL 8, and SDPR; FDR corrected p <. 05). This finding was confirmed in a validation cohort of stroke patients (n 8). IPA revealed cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA 4) signaling was the most significant pathway present in the peripheral <b>whole</b> blood of <b>stroke</b> patients 24 – 48 hr after onset. When controlling for age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, high baseline expression of TLR 2 and TLR 4 significantly predicted worse scores on the MRS. Conclusion: CTLA 4 signaling is a novel pathway for the study of stroke-induced immune suppression. Markers of immune dysfunction early after stroke may prove useful fo...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{recombinant}} form {{of tissue}} plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only curative treatment for ischemic stroke. Recently, t-PA {{has been linked to}} the metabolism of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a major neurotrophin involved in post-stroke neuroplasticity. Thus, the objective of our study was to investigate the impact of rt-PA treatment on post-stroke circulating BDNF levels in humans and in animals. Serum BDNF levels and t-PA/plasmin activity were measured at hospital admission and at up to 90 days in stroke patients receiving (n = 24) or not (n = 14) rt-PA perfusion. We investigated the relationships between serum BDNF with concurrent t-PA/plasmin activity, neurological outcomes and cardiovascular scores at admission. In parallel, serum BDNF levels and t-PA/plasmin activity were assessed before and after (1, 4 and 24 h) the induction of ischemic stroke in rats. Our study revealed higher serum BDNF levels and better neurological outcome in rt-PA-treated than non-treated patients. However, serum BDNF levels did not predict stroke outcome when the <b>whole</b> cohort of <b>stroke</b> patients was analyzed. By contrast, serum BDNF levels when measured at admission and at day 90 correlated with cardiovascular scores, and those at day 1 correlated with serum t-PA/plasmin activity in the whole cohort of patients whereas no association could be found in the rt-PA-treated group. In rats devoid of cardiovascular risk, no difference in post-stroke serum BDNF levels was detected between rt-PA- and vehicle-treated animals and no correlation was found between serum BDNF levels and t-PA/plasmin activity. Overall, the data suggest that serum BDNF levels may not be useful as a prognostic biomarker of stroke outcome and that endothelial dysfunction could be a confounding factor when serum BDNF levels after stroke are used to reflect of brain BDNF levels...|$|R
40|$|Sleep {{disorders}} are commonly encountered in stroke patients, mainly as sleep disordered breathing, disorders of sleep-wake cycles and disorders of sleep architecture. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the disorder of sleep architecture in stroke patients, regardless of sleep apnea, which has a well recognised impact on sleep architecture. In the literature there is no study of sleep architecture in stroke, excluding the presence of sleep apnea (defined by AHI> 5). Also, we investigated the association of sleep architecture disturbances with the patients’ characteristics and the parameters of stroke (type, location, severity and clinical outcome). We studied 58 acute stroke patients. The control group comprised of 16 age and gender matched in-patients. All patients had a polysomnographic sleep study, to determine the sleep architecture and the presence of sleep apnea. Stroke topography was assessed with the aid of CT or MRI. Stroke severity was assessed with the NIHSS and stroke outcome with the Barthel Index. We found that stroke patients, without sleep apnea, had reduced total sleep time and sleep maintenance efficiency, reduced stage II and slow wave sleep, and increased wakefulness during sleep and sleep latency, compared to the control group. The <b>whole</b> group of <b>stroke</b> patients had reduced stage REM sleep, compared to controls. This difference is more likely due to the presence of sleep apnea. Stroke patients with sleep apnea had reduced stage REM sleep, compared to controls and stroke patients without sleep apnea. Comparing sleep architecture between different stroke topographies, we found that cerebellar strokes had higher percentage of REM sleep, which was shown for the first time in the present study. Stroke severity had a negative correlation with the percentage of stages I and REM. We found that stroke patients with poor outcome had reduced latency to REM sleep. This finding, which was shown for the first time in the present study, has possible implications for prognosis and treatment of these patients. The study of respiratory function showed that 58. 6 % of stroke patients suffered from sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), (AHI> 5). The majority of the apneas/hypopneas (76 %) were obstructive. The presence and the severity of SAS had a positive correlation with stroke severity and poor functional outcome. In summary, the present study demonstrated the disruption of normal sleep architecture and the high frequency of SAS in stroke patients. The disruption of sleep architecture is independent of SAS, and it is associated with the topography, severity and outcome of stroke. Sleep study is a useful tool in the investigation of stroke patients, in order to identify and treat these disorders. Further studies are needed, in order to elucidate the relation of sleep disturbances and stroke, with possible impact on the management of these patients. ...|$|R
