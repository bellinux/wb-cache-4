25|$|During {{wintering}} months {{thousands of}} waders and migratory ducks fill the marsh, which becomes a paradise for bird watchers. Osprey, greater flamingo, northern pintail duck, northern shoveller, garganey teal, black-tailed godwit, pied avocet, common sandpiper, <b>wood</b> <b>sandpiper</b> and marsh sandpiper, whiskered tern, rosy starling, yellow wagtail, little stint, grey-headed lapwing, glossy ibis and black-headed ibis, ruff and greenshank all visit the Pallikaranai marsh.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{that may}} {{be found on the}} sand dunes near the town include: leymus, heather, crowberry, sea hollies, and marsh gentians. <b>Wood</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and cranes are typical birds in the Klitmøller area. Two large lakes, Vester Vandet and Nors, lie east of Klitmøller, from the west the town is bordered by the North Sea.|$|R
50|$|The mires - {{that cover}} {{more than half}} of the park's area - are {{inhabited}} by black grouses, common cranes, whooper swans, <b>wood</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and northern willow grouses. The old-growth forests house hole nesters such as Eurasian pygmy owls, Ural owls, three-toed woodpeckers, red-breasted flycatchers and the Siberian flying squirrel. The emblem species and the most common species in the park is the pine marten.|$|R
50|$|Adult <b>wood</b> <b>sandpipers</b> moult {{all their}} primary {{feathers}} between August and December, whilst immature birds moult varying number of outer primaries between December and April, {{much closer to}} their departure from Africa. Immatures are also much more flexible than adults in the timing and rate of their moult and refueling. Adults and immatures which accumulate fuel loads of c.50% of their lean body mass can potentially cross distances of 2397-4490 km in one non-stop flight.|$|R
25|$|These {{areas of}} water are {{inhabited}} by Eurasian beaver, which had disappeared {{some years ago}} due to intensive hunting, but which have now recovered their original population. Besides this, it is mostly a richness of birds that distinguishes the park's wetlands. It constitutes the southernmost extent in Sweden of the nesting area of many species, such as the greater scaup, the oldsquaw, the common scoter, and also a focus of important populations of red-necked phalarope, ruff, common greenshank and <b>wood</b> <b>sandpiper.</b> One also finds sometimes the Eurasian curlew, which is considered an endangered species.|$|E
25|$|Birds of {{the delta}} are both winter {{visitors}} and passage migrants including great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), {{a wide variety of}} Anatidae, Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), about thirty species of migratory shorebirds, the whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybrida), the Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia), and the brown-headed gull (Larus brunnicephalus), which is very common. One of the most numerous wintering shorebird is the lesser sand plover (Charadrius mongolus), which occurs in flocks of many thousands along the outer coast {{of the delta}}. The <b>wood</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Tringa glareola) and red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) are also abundant.|$|E
500|$|In some cases, Yarrell's correspondents and {{reference}} books {{enable him to}} add an account of a bird's distribution around the world. For the ringed plover, for example, Sven Nilsson speaks for Sweden and the Baltic coast; Mr Hewitson for Norway; Carl Linnaeus for Lapland; a Mr Scoresby for Iceland and Greenland; the zoologist Thomas Pennant for Russia and Siberia; the archaeologist Charles Fellows for Asia Minor , and Coenraad Jacob Temminck for Japan. In {{the case of the}} <b>wood</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> Dr. Calvert sent a specimen from Malta; Selby and Dr. Andrew Smith, specimens from South Africa; others from India; Gould [...] "mentions having seen skins" [...] from [...] "Chili and the Islands of the Pacific". Yarrell also describes his own observations, in this case with the words [...] "It [...] is far from being numerous in the localities where I met with it... Although I met with the young in a downy state, and partially feathered, I only obtained one nest with eggs." ...|$|E
50|$|Lillsjön {{used to be}} {{connected}} to other lakes in the area through narrow straits. Through a project sponsored by the World Wide Fund for Nature, water was pumped into the small basin reinforced by new embankments. Reed was also burnt away, and the former lake thus transformed into a shore meadow attracting many birds, starting with northern lapwings in March, followed by common snipes later in spring. In autumn, many birds rest here on their way south, such as <b>wood</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> common redshanks, greenshanks, and ruffs.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the birds}} {{commonly}} found in this region are openbill storks, black-capped kingfishers, black-headed ibis, water hens, coots, pheasant-tailed jacanas, pariah kites, brahminy kite, marsh harriers, swamp partridges, red junglefowl, spotted doves, common mynahs, jungle crows, jungle babblers, cotton teals, herring gulls, Caspian terns, gray herons, common snipes, <b>wood</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> green pigeons, rose ringed parakeets, paradise-flycatchers, cormorants, grey-headed fish eagles, white-bellied sea eagles, seagulls, common kingfishers, peregrine falcons, woodpeckers, whimbrels, black-tailed godwits, little stints, eastern knots, curlews, golden plovers, northern pintails, white-eyed pochards and whistling teals.|$|R
25|$|The canal {{continues}} broadly northwards {{to reach}} Ebridge lock and mill, passing the former dyke to the hamlet of Meeting House Hill on its western bank. Although {{there was no}} public access to this stretch in 2014, there are plans for a footpath between the two locks to be created. Above Ebridge lock, the mill pond has been dredged and the banks cleared, to create a large expanse of open water. Wildlife has benefitted, with sightings of water voles, otters, reed warblers, dragonflies, kingfishers, <b>wood</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and a marsh harrier being recorded. A canalside footpath provides access to the water.|$|R
2500|$|The name [...] "Peper Harow" [...] is {{very unusual}} and comes from Old English Pipers Hear(g) perhaps meaning, {{approximately}} [...] "The pagan stone altar of the pipers"; however, hearg {{can also be}} haeg meaning more prosaically hedged enclosure (of the pipers), or even hay meadow. Pipers might mean musicians, or sandpipers (the green sandpiper and <b>wood</b> <b>sandpiper</b> are migrants to marsh and swampy ground – as this is).|$|E
2500|$|Thousands of waders can be {{seen here}} during winter. Some of the winter {{migrants}} seen here are common tern, little tern, whiskered tern, gull-billed tern, great crested tern, Sandwich tern, white-winged black tern, Caspian tern, brown headed/black headed/Pallas gulls, Kentish/lesser sand/Pacific golden/grey plovers, common sandpiper, <b>wood</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> curlew sandpiper, Terek sandpiper, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, osprey, little stint, Temminck's stint, dunlin, black-tailed godwit, common redshank, greenshank, painted stork, openbill stork and grey heron.|$|E

5000|$|The {{seasonal}} wetlands on {{the floodplain}} regularly support {{large numbers of}} waterbirds. Numerically important duck species include hardhead, grey teal and plumed whistling duck. The lagoons are also an important site for shorebirds: several thousand little curlews and Oriental pratincoles, and hundreds of <b>wood</b> <b>sandpipers</b> have been counted. The Parry Lagoons {{are probably the most}} important site in Australia for both <b>wood</b> and marsh <b>sandpipers.</b> When local rainfall is high the lagoons and other seasonal wetlands are major breeding areas for waterbirds in the Kimberley, with up to 77 species recorded in habitats associated with Parry Creek. The grasslands are the only place in Western Australia where zitting cisticolas occur naturally. [...] The mangroves contain 12 of the 13 species of terrestrial bird restricted to such habitat, or to rainforest, in Western Australia, including the black butcherbird. About 200 bird species have been recorded from the site.|$|R
40|$|Separation {{of animals}} and humans using a {{protective}} set-back distance (Minimum Ap-proaching Distance) is a popular tool for conservation managers to promote wildlife-hu-man coexistence. In several cases, Minimum Approaching Distance is based on how ani-mals respond to an approaching human, using Flight Initiation Distance or Alert Distance. Alert Distance, when animals first show increased vigilance to an approaching human, is considered the best basis for Minimum Approaching Distance because animals have time to adapt their response. Alert Distance is frequently difficult or impossible to measure in practice, however, especially in breeding birds. Using a study of breeding Wood Sandpip-ers Tringa glareola, in which Alert Distance could not be measured directly, we tested three possible solutions to this dilemma. Alarm Call Distance {{did not appear to}} provide a useful substitute for Alert Distance because sandpipers probably alarm called after they had first detected a human. Published predictions of Alert Distance using body mass also failed to provide realistic estimates of disturbance distances in <b>Wood</b> <b>Sandpipers.</b> The “fixed-slope rule”, which predicts that Alert Distance is about double Flight Initiation Distance, was not supported by relationships between Alarm Call Distance and Flight Ini-tiation Distance, but was supported by a relationship between an estimated Alert Distance surrogate and Flight Initiation Distance. This suggests that this rule may have general util-ity in predicting Alert Distance when only the more readily measured Flight Initiation Distance metric is known. AMinimum Approaching Distance (protective buffer zone) of 160 m is recommended for breeding <b>Wood</b> <b>Sandpipers.</b> 1...|$|R
25|$|The {{forest is}} also rich in bird life, with 286 species {{including}} the endemic brown-winged kingfishers (Pelargopsis amauroptera) and the globally threatened lesser adjutants (Leptoptilos javanicus) and masked finfoots (Heliopais personata) and {{birds of prey}} such as the ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), white-bellied sea eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster) and grey-headed fish eagles (Ichthyophaga ichthyaetus).
