5|$|A major {{corrective}} opportunity {{this year}} involved the rerelease {{of one of}} the earliest malicious biographies of Mrs. Eddy, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science by Georgine Milmine. Dating from the yellow journalism period, this book was published in an attempt to discredit her. The current publisher, after much correspondence <b>with</b> <b>our</b> office, instead issued a statement accurately characterizing its bias. The book has received almost no attention in the public, proving if Truth isn't spoken, nothing is said.|$|E
5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught <b>with</b> <b>our</b> pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We looked at it as a chance to catch up <b>with</b> <b>our</b> obscenity quota.|$|E

We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E
