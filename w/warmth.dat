5|$|Sanjay Dutt as Girish. Simple and {{straightforward}} character who plays Lalita's moral support with <b>warmth</b> and compassion.|$|E
5|$|Sunlight has {{influenced}} building design {{since the beginning}} of architectural history. Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the Greeks and Chinese, who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and <b>warmth.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Dolphin, {{in conjunction with}} previous Typhoon Noul, shifted the broader weather pattern to bring record <b>warmth</b> to Alaska, making the temperatures warmer than that of Washington, D.C..|$|E
5|$|A cold-blooded reptile, {{the painted}} turtle regulates its {{temperature}} through its environment, notably by basking. All ages bask for <b>warmth,</b> often alongside {{other species of}} turtle. Sometimes more than 50individuals are seen on one log together. Turtles bask {{on a variety of}} objects, often logs, but have even been seen basking on top of common loons that were covering eggs.|$|E
5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} hatching, the chicks form a crèche, huddling {{together}} for <b>warmth</b> and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically {{to feed their}} chicks. A crèche may comprise up to several thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal <b>warmth.</b> It {{would be foolish to}} claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by <b>warmth</b> and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Puccini visited London {{to discuss}} {{plans for the}} {{following}} year's Covent Garden premiere of Il trittico. This took place on 18 June 1920; King George V and Queen Mary were present, and called Puccini to their box to give him their congratulations. With Toscanini not considered, Puccini hoped that Sir Thomas Beecham would conduct the premiere, but he declined and Gaetano Bavagnoli conducted. Once again, only Gianni Schicchi was received with real <b>warmth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seed {{multiplication}} may be {{used for}} the development of new cultivars or to increase the yield of native species. Seeds are generally sown in early summer in seedbeds, and then transplanted to larger containers. They require <b>warmth</b> frequent watering, and should not be given a dormant period. Seeds do not breed true. Plants obtained from seeds take about six years to bloom.|$|E
5|$|The Galloway is {{naturally}} hornless, {{and instead of}} horns has a bone knob {{at the top of}} its skull called the poll. This breed's shaggy coat has both a thick, woolly undercoat for <b>warmth</b> and stiffer guard hairs that help shed water, making them well adapted to harsher climates.|$|E
5|$|The high-mass air well design {{attempts}} to cool a large mass of masonry with cool nighttime air entering the structure due to breezes or natural convection. In the day, the <b>warmth</b> {{of the sun}} results in increased atmospheric humidity. When moist daytime air enters the air well, it condenses on the presumably cool masonry. None of the high-mass collectors performed well, Knapen's aerial well being a particularly conspicuous example.|$|E
5|$|The red ground {{resulted}} in a <b>warmth</b> of tone that {{was picked up by}} the sensitive panchromatic film. Over that was applied liquid greasepaint, and then finally a colorless translucent talcum. Seiderman created the effect of skin pores on Kane's face by stippling the surface with a negative cast he made from an orange peel.|$|E
5|$|Warm air : Exposition {{of seeds}} to warm air (50 to 70°C, {{depending}} duration) kills B. rufimanus developing into the seeds {{at the same}} time it lowers water content. However, <b>warmth</b> can decrease germination rates of the seeds and degrade the visual aspect and the protein content of the seeds, which would be problematic for the seed market.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} to dig her nest, the female sometimes exhibits a mysterious preliminary behavior. She presses her throat {{against the ground}} of different potential sites, perhaps sensing moisture, <b>warmth,</b> texture, or smell, although her exact motivation is unknown. She may further temporize by excavating several false nests as the wood turtles also do.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} strong low {{pressure}} systems formed across the southern Great Plains on February 4, contributing to record <b>warmth</b> on February 4 and 5 {{in the southern}} Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley. High temperatures across many areas reached the 70s°F (21–26°C), and in Alabama temperatures reached the low 80s°F (27°C) with dew points in the middle 60s° (17–20°C). Dewpoints in the mid 60s°F were recorded {{as far north as}} Memphis. A strong cold front trailing the low pressure area approached the region from the west.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for <b>warmth</b> or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|Bessell {{noted that}} Thorpe, {{for all his}} gregariousness and <b>warmth,</b> {{appeared}} to have no female friends and lacked any interest in girls. The former Liberal MP Frank Owen confided to Bessell his suspicions that Thorpe was a homosexual; other West Country Liberals had formed the same opinion. Aware that exposure as a homosexual would end Thorpe's career, Bessell became his self-appointed protector, even to the extent, he later said, of falsely claiming to be bisexual, {{as a means of}} acquiring his friend's confidence.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was born}} on 13 October 1926 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He was one of six {{children}} born to Julia Lindsey Brown, a schoolteacher, and John Brown, a grocery warehouse worker. He had four brothers, Marvin, William, Fletcher, and Lura, {{as well as an}} older sister known as Johnny. Brown's ancestry was African American, Chicksaw, and Choctaw. The family lived in a house without central heating or indoor plumbing so they relied on a fireplace for <b>warmth.</b> As a child, Jesse's brother William fell into this fireplace and was severely burned.|$|E
5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, <b>warmth,</b> redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Creek's steady flow, <b>warmth,</b> deep pools, {{and small}} waterfalls attract {{visitors}} who wade, swim, float, kayak, and snorkel in its waters. Four named hiking paths intersect the Fossil Creek corridor: the Flume–Irving, Fossil Springs, Mail, and Deadman Mesa trails. The U.S. Forest Service allows dispersed camping {{in some parts}} of the area but has made other parts, such as riparian zones, off-limits to overnight stays. Other activities in the area include wildlife viewing, photography, fishing, and visits to the remains of the Childs-Irving infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the tunnel}} fell into disuse. It became popular with {{homeless}} people and drug users. A police report from around 1950 stated that squatters used the edifice for <b>warmth</b> and shelter from elements, {{as well as}} a hideout and a meeting place. The Yugoslav Government's lack of transparency regarding the tunnel led to the rise of a number of urban legends, including the purported existence of walled-off corridors leading towards the Croatian Parliament palace on St. Mark's Square (in the centre of Gornji Grad), and towards Zagreb Observatory (the northernmost point of the neighbourhood) and on to Gupčeva Zvijezda.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but {{the illness}} recurred the {{following}} year, {{and she became}} an invalid. John Macdonald took his wife to Savannah, Georgia, in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air and <b>warmth</b> would cure her ailments. Although John Macdonald was {{able to return to}} Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years. He visited her again in New York at the end of 1846, and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant. In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{lies in the}} Lower Severn/Avon plain affording it {{a degree}} of shelter caused {{by virtue of its}} {{nestling}} in between the Cotswold hills to the east, the Welsh Hills and Mountains to the west, and Birmingham plateau to the north. Although as with all the British Isles it has a maritime climate, the local topography means summer <b>warmth</b> can become emphasised by a slight foehn effect off the surrounding hills. The record maximum stands at 35.8c(96.4f) set in August 1990. Typically 17.3 days of the year will reach 25.1c(77.2f) or higher and the annual warmest day should reach 29.8c(85.6f) according to the 1971–00 observing period.|$|E
5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using ligatures, applying alkaline solutions, providing <b>warmth,</b> and sucking the venom out. In modern first aid, incising, sucking, applying bandages and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor noticed that a severely ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective. As of 2011, administration of magnesium sulphate was reported to have had some benefit though evidence of effectiveness is weak.|$|E
5|$|On a Good Friday evening, Ivan Velikopolsky, a 22-year-old sacristan's son and {{clerical}} student, walks {{home and}} imagines that the bitter wind, cold, and darkness he experiences were also felt throughout history: by Rurik, Ivan the Terrible, and Peter the Great. Along his path, he meets Vasilisa and Lukerya, {{a mother and}} her daughter who have both been widowed. As he joins them around their fire, Ivan remarks that the <b>warmth</b> they feel must also have been felt by Saint Peter. Suddenly, he asks if the widows have been reading the Twelve Passion Gospels to which Vasilisa replies that they have.|$|E
5|$|Populations are dense in {{the higher}} {{mountain}} regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their presence is known on King Island, located north-west from Tasmania. The ant prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open eucalypt woodlands; the climate provides the ant with isolation and <b>warmth.</b> This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, dry dirt and grass to build nests. One study found suburbs with voluminous vegetation cover such as Mount Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations, while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point, do not.|$|E
5|$|Sujoy Ghosh {{approached}} {{novelist and}} script writer Advaita Kala {{with the idea}} for the film. Kala took inspiration from her experience in Kolkata, where she had moved in 1999, akin to the protagonist in the film. She reported that despite facing a language barrier and the chaos and poverty of the metropolis, she was charmed by the <b>warmth</b> of the people, which was reflected in the film. Kala started writing in 2009 and finished the 185-page script by February 2010. Her research included reading the books Open Secrets: India's Intelligence Unveiled by Maloy Krishna Dhar and India's External Intelligence: Secrets of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) by V. K. Singh.|$|E
5|$|The male {{chooses the}} nest site, and uses {{it for his}} {{courtship}} display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows {{up and down in}} front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for <b>warmth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thermal mass is any {{material}} {{that can be}} used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain <b>warmth</b> as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|This {{multi-storied}} ruin, {{the best-known}} cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde, {{is located in}} the largest alcove {{in the center of the}} Great Mesa. It was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater <b>warmth</b> from the sun in the winter. Dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar. Many of the rooms were brightly painted. Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people, but was likely an important part of a larger community of sixty nearby pueblos, which housed a combined six hundred or more people. With 23 kivas and 150 rooms, Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.|$|E
5|$|Traditional hunters {{used all}} parts of the walrus. The meat, often preserved, is an {{important}} winter nutrition source; the flippers are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring; tusks and bone were historically used for tools, as well as material for handicrafts; the oil was rendered for <b>warmth</b> and light; the tough hide made rope and house and boat coverings; and the intestines and gut linings made waterproof parkas. While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies, walrus meat remains an important part of local diets, and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form.|$|E
5|$|Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex {{style of}} {{sheepskin}} boot. In many other countries, however, UGG boots are a well-known brand of footwear owned by Deckers. The boots {{are made of}} twin-faced sheepskin with fleece {{on the inside and}} with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. The boots originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as utilitarian footwear worn for <b>warmth</b> and comfort. UGG boots emerged as a fashion trend in the United States in the late 1990s and as a world-wide trend in the late 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Weisman uses New York City as a {{model to}} outline how an unmaintained urban area would deconstruct. He {{explains}} that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway corridors, and soils under roads would erode and cave in. From interviews {{with members of the}} Wildlife Conservation Society and the New York Botanical Gardens Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food and <b>warmth,</b> rats and cockroaches would die off.|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the <b>warmth</b> of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess <b>warmth</b> and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E
5|$|Wildfire {{intensity}} increases during daytime hours. For example, burn {{rates of}} smoldering logs {{are up to}} five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground {{during the day and}} causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime <b>warmth.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Farmer's {{reputation}} grew, he {{expanded from}} bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as George Russell and Teddy Charles. He {{went on to}} join Gerry Mulligan's quartet and, with Benny Golson, to co-found the Jazztet. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist's instrument in jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders. His playing {{is known for its}} individuality – most noticeably, its lyricism, <b>warmth</b> of tone and sensitivity.|$|E
