He told biographer Michael Azerrad, [...] "Anytime I think about it, it makes me sadder than anything I can think of." [...] Azerrad asserted in his biography [...] that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love. Charles Cross wrote in his Kurt Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric [...] "I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black", the frontman [...] "sang in <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'". After a performance of the song by singer Lana Del Rey in 2012, Courtney Love asserted on Twitter that the song is about her vagina. The tweets were deleted shortly after.

500|$|Critical {{response}} in the United States proved to be less favourable. In a review published in Virginia in January 1983, Edward Jones of The Free-Lance Star offered praise for the [...] "novel touch" [...] of casting a would-be-mother as the principal villain, commenting, [...] "In <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a new low, even for extraterrestrial-horror films, all the men end up punching this pregnant woman in the stomach. What a time to have twins!" [...] Nevertheless, Inseminoid is discarded as [...] "no more than a mix of everything-you've-ever-seen-in-a-horror-movie-and-didn't-particularly-want-to-see-again." [...] In a November 1983 edition of the Floridian newspaper Boca Raton News, Skip Sheffield branded the film [...] "horrible" [...] and [...] "cheapo", suggesting that his readers [...] "Imagine Alien without the fantastic sets, convincing special effects and literate dialogue, {{and you have a}} picture of Horror Planet."

500|$|Commentators {{noted that}} the ending was {{genuinely}} unsettling and dark. Rachel Aroesti, writing for theguardian.com, described the episode as moving [...] "from a twee period piece to <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most depraved half-hour of television ever to grace the festive schedules". For many critics, the final twist was praiseworthy; it was characterised variously as the episode's [...] "secret weapon", [...] "very fitting", [...] "suitably macabre", and [...] "fantastically nasty". For Hughes, it [...] "was a lovely sting in the tale, and one of which Dahl would almost certainly have approved". Two reviews in The Times, however—one unsigned, and one by Matt Rudd—were more critical. The unsigned review advised viewers to switch off before the end, as [...] "the fabulous styling gives way to a gratuitously nasty conclusion, a bad misjudgment from such a talented writing team". For Rudd, the shocking ending served no purpose; critical of [...] "shocking {{for the sake of}} shocking", he argued that the episode's [...] "half-hour of self-satisfied 1970s pastiche followed by a frenzied knife attack is very unpleasant indeed". In i, an unsigned review of [...] "The Bill"—the second episode of the third series—suggested that viewers may have been put off the programme by the [...] "rather nasty final couple of minutes" [...] of [...] "The Devil of Christmas".|$|E
