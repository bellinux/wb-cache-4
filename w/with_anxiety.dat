5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making has been associated <b>with</b> <b>anxiety.</b> fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and {{that it may be}} part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} whether the self-report {{version of the}} Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-SR) could accurately identify individuals <b>with</b> social <b>anxiety</b> disorder and individuals with the generalized subtype of social anxiety disorder. Furthermore, the study sought to determine the optimal cutoffs for the LSAS-SR for identifying patients <b>with</b> social <b>anxiety</b> disorder and its generalized subtype. Methods: Two hundred and ninety-one patients <b>with</b> clinician-assessed social <b>anxiety</b> disorder (240 <b>with</b> generalized social <b>anxiety</b> disorder) and 53 control participants who were free from current Axis- 1 disorders completed the LSAS-SR. Results: Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses revealed that the LSAS-SR performed well in identifying participants <b>with</b> social <b>anxiety</b> disorder and generalized social <b>anxiety</b> disorder. Consistent <b>with</b> Mennin et al. ’s [2002 : J Anxiety Disord 16 : 661 – 673] research on the clinician-administered version of the LSAS, cutoffs of 30 and 60 on the LSAS-SR provided the best balance of sensitivity and specificity for classifying participants <b>with</b> social <b>anxiety</b> and generalized social anxiety disorder, respectively. Conclusions: The LSAS-SR may be an accurate and cost-effective way to identify and subtype patients <b>with</b> social <b>anxiety</b> disorder, which could help increase {{the percentage of people}} who receive appropriate treatment for this debilitating disorder.

5|$|In 2012 spring training, Huff {{competed with}} Brandon Belt and Brett Pill for the Giants' first base job. Belt won the job, and Huff {{opened the season}} as the Giants' left fielder. He had two hits and three RBI on April 13, {{including}} a two-run home run against Joel Hanrahan in a 50 victory over Pittsburgh. On April 21, because the Giants {{did not have any}} infielders available, Huff was positioned at second base {{for the first time in}} his career in the ninth inning of a tied game against the Mets. He failed to cover second base in a potential double play situation, and the Mets went on to win the first game of the doubleheader 54. After the game, on April 25, Huff was placed on the 15-day disabled list <b>with</b> <b>anxiety</b> issues.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients <b>with</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{anxiogenic}} and panicogenic {{effects of}} peripheral {{administration of the}} cholecystokinin-B receptor agonist pentagastrin and placebo were evaluated in patients <b>with</b> generalized <b>anxiety</b> disorder and normal comparison subjects. Method: Seven patients <b>with</b> generalized <b>anxiety</b> disorder and seven age- and sex-matched normal subjects received an intravenous bolus of placebo and pentagastrin. Results: Panic attacks occurred in five patients <b>with</b> generalized <b>anxiety</b> disorder (71 %) and in one normal subject (14 %). Patients <b>with</b> generalized <b>anxiety</b> disorder {{were more likely to}} report more nonpanic anxiety than were normal subjects. Conclusions: Patients <b>with</b> generalized <b>anxiety</b> disorder appear to exhibit greater subjective sensitivity to pentagastrin than do normal subjects. (Am J Psychiatry 1997; 154 : 700 – 702) C holecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK- 4) is a neuro-transmitter that has high affinity for the chole-cystokinin-B (CCK-B) receptors in the central nervous system and may play a role in the modulation of anxiety in animals and humans (1).

25|$|Many people <b>with</b> <b>anxiety</b> {{disorders}} {{benefit from}} joining a self-help or support group (telephone conference-call support groups or online support groups being of particular help for completely housebound individuals). Sharing problems and achievements with others, {{as well as}} sharing various self-help tools, are common activities in these groups. In particular, stress management techniques and various kinds of meditation practices and visualization techniques can help people <b>with</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorders calm themselves and may enhance the effects of therapy, as can service to others, which can distract from the self-absorption that tends to go <b>with</b> <b>anxiety</b> problems. Also, preliminary evidence suggests aerobic exercise may have a calming effect. Since caffeine, certain illicit drugs, and even some over-the-counter cold medications can aggravate the symptoms of anxiety disorders, they should be avoided.|$|E

40|$|Background: Appropriate {{management}} of anxiety disorders {{in primary care}} requires clinical assessment and monitoring {{of the severity of}} the anxiety. This study focuses on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) as a severity indicator for anxiety in primary care patients <b>with</b> different <b>anxiety</b> disorders (social phobia, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia or generalized anxiety disorder), depressive disorders or no disorder (controls). Methods. Participants were 1601 primary care patients participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Regression analyses were used to compare the mean BAI scores of the different diagnostic groups and to correct for age and gender. Results: Patients <b>with</b> any <b>anxiety</b> disorder had a significantly higher mean score than the controls. A significantly higher score was found for patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia compared to patients with agoraphobia only or social phobia only. BAI scores in patients <b>with</b> an <b>anxiety</b> disorder <b>with</b> a co-morbid <b>anxiety</b> disorder and in patients <b>with</b> an <b>anxiety</b> disorder <b>with</b> a co-morbid depressive disorder were significantly higher than BAI scores in patients <b>with</b> an <b>anxiety</b> disorder alone or patients with a depressive disorder alone. Depressed and anxious patients did not differ significantly in their mean scores. Conclusions: The results suggest that the BAI may be used as a severity indicator of anxiety in primary care patients <b>with</b> different <b>anxiety</b> disorders.
