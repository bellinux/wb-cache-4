A review of research-based surfing literature is undertaken to provide a summary of information available to assist in coastal management decision making around surfing breaks. The different categories of research-based surfing literature are identified as artificial surfing reef (ASR) design, ASR monitoring, ASR construction, ASR sediment dynamics, biomechanics, coastal management, economics and tourism, industry, numerical and physical modeling, surfers and waves, sociology, and physical processes. The majority of this research has been undertaken in the last decade, making it a relatively young research area. As a background for nonsurfing coastal researchers and managers, the characteristics of surfing waves and surfing breaks are described, referring to relevant literature. Wave height, peel angle, breaking intensity, and section length are identified as essential parameters to describe surfing waves. Existing surfer skill and maneuver categorization schemes are presented to show the relationship between surfers and surfing waves. The geomorphic categories of surfing breaks are identified as headland or point breaks, beach breaks, river or estuary entrance bars, reef breaks, and ledge breaks. The literature discusses the various scale bathymetric components that create these surfing breaks.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{traditional}} since {{the work of}} Ludwik Silberstein in 1914 to use the ring of biquaternions to represent the Lorentz group. For the spacetime conformal group, it is sufficient to consider homographies on the projective line over that ring. Elements of the spacetime conformal group have been called spherical <b>wave</b> <b>transformations</b> by Bateman.

They correspond to the conformal group of [...] "transformations by reciprocal radii" [...] in relation to the framework of Lie sphere geometry, which were already known in the 19th century. Time is used as fourth dimension as in Minkowski space, so spherical <b>wave</b> <b>transformations</b> are connected to the Lorentz transformation of special relativity, {{and it turns out that}} the spacetime conformal group includes the Lorentz group and the Poincaré group as subgroups. However, only the Lorentz/Poincaré groups represent symmetries of all laws of nature including mechanics, whereas the conformal group is related to certain areas such as electrodynamics. In addition, it can be shown that the conformal group of the plane (corresponding to the Möbius group of the extended complex plane) is isomorphic to the Lorentz group.|$|R

30|$|However, {{when the}} premise that the {{intensity}} of uneven light remains approximately unchanged in local sub-regions cannot be satisfied, the local membership by the <b>wave</b> <b>transformation</b> should be modified. That is, when the variation of the light intensity in a pure background is so large that it is bigger than the threshold α in Eq. (13), a false sub-region composed by a peak and a trough must be extracted, thus easily leading to misclassification. This is because in a sub-region, the pixels close to the peak correspond to the object, and the pixels close to the trough correspond to the background according to <b>Wave</b> <b>transformation</b> for computing the local characteristics of an image. Therefore, the pixels in the pure background will be classified into two classes, i.e., the object and the background, by the segmentation of the <b>wave</b> <b>transformation</b> matrix, which actually leads to the misclassification of some pixels to object.|$|E

Prior to developing the structure, laboratory investigations on models (typifying porous submerged breakwater structures) that could provide experimental information of the influence of porosity on non-breaking <b>wave</b> <b>transformations</b> have been undertaken. A series of tests to study the effect of porosity of submerged breakwater model structures on the process of non-breaking <b>wave</b> <b>transformations</b> have been carried out. A hollow framework-shaped test model was used. Three models each with three different porosities ranging from 0. 40 to 0. 80 were constructed. From laboratory tests, results obtained have been analysed to check the performance of the models to attenuate waves. Test results have indicated that the transmission coefficient, KT increased with increasing model porosity. The wave reflection coefficient, KR of the model tested ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 31. Energy loss of the primary waves was found to be highest when the parameter kd was equal to 1. 9 and lowest when the porosity of the model was found to be large...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 56 - 58. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Laboratory measurements of free surface elevation and undertow velocity were made in front of a model revetment on a plane slope in shallow water to study the effects of the revetment on the <b>wave</b> <b>transformation</b> and undertow and to test the predictive capabilities of numerical <b>wave</b> <b>transformation</b> and undertow models. Irregular waves were generated from the TMA spectral form. Free surface oscillations were measured with wire resistance wave gages, and velocities were measured by acoustic Doppler velocimeter. The free surface and undertow measurements were compared to a previous study without a revetment to determine the effect of the structure on incident waves and undertow. Comparisons showed that for the case of a structure with 45 % reflection, the <b>wave</b> <b>transformation</b> in the inner surf zone was unaffected and the undertow was slightly reduced. The reduction in undertow was found to exhibit some proportionality to the square of the reflection coefficient. The present and previous studies were compared to existing <b>wave</b> <b>transformation</b> and undertow models. Comparisons showed that the models performed as well for the case of 45 % wave reflection as they did for the case of little wave reflection.

The proposed two-way coupling algorithm can describe both the generation of wave-induced current and the current-induced <b>wave</b> <b>transformation,</b> which is more physically reasonable than the one-way approaches.

30|$|A <b>wave</b> <b>transformation</b> model, {{which is}} {{introduced}} by Wei et al., is a prospective idea for uneven lighting image segmentation [36]. They consider an image surface as a three-dimensional terrain that {{is composed of}} mountains and valleys, corresponding to peaks and troughs, respectively, and partition the sub-regions with the local peaks and troughs in multi-directions. Then, a <b>wave</b> <b>transformation</b> is performed on the grayscale waves in the local sub-region, and a matrix of multi-dimensional vectors is obtained. Lastly, the vectors are compressed to one dimension using the principal component analysis (PCA) method, and an Otsu global method is employed to find an optimal wave threshold for segmenting the matrix. This algorithm does not require image partitioning and can yield good segmentation results for uneven light images. However, there are two serious drawbacks of the method. First, it is very sensitive to noise since {{it does not take}} into consideration the spatial information in the <b>wave</b> <b>transformation.</b> Second, when the variation of light intensity in the background is too large, it may lead to misclassification of some pixels.|$|E

The connection involves a one step computational delay when the virtual environment is not known prior to starting the interaction.
