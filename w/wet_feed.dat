Since L. monocytogenes carriage by pigs at the herd level could be a primary source for carcass contamination, control measures should be designed to reduce the L. monocytogenes load at the pre-harvest stage. For this purpose, an exploratory analytical survey {{was carried out in}} 2000 - 2001 in 93 French farrow-to-finish pig farms concerning L. monocytogenes contamination in pigs before they left for the slaughterhouse. On each farm, the L. monocytogenes status of a batch of contemporary fattening pigs housed in the same room was assessed on faecal material samples taken by means of gauze swabs wiped on the perianal region of the pigs. Fourteen percent of the batches studied had at least one contaminated sample and were therefore classified as L. monocytogenes contaminated batches. Two logistic regression models were used to assess the association between managerial and hygiene practices and the risk of L. monocytogenes contamination of the batch {{at the end of the}} finishing period on the whole data set ($n = 93 $) and in the <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> farms only (n = 57). <b>Wet</b> <b>feeding</b> during the fattening period was identified as a risk factor for L. monocytogenes contamination.

The trial used 360 steer calves (initial BW = 288 ± 11 kg) housed in 36 pens for 166 d in an incomplete 4 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Pens of steers were assigned to treatments according to a completely randomized design (four replicates per treatment combination). Treatments were <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed</b> (0, 20, 30, or 40 % of dietary DM) and CP (13. 0, 13. 7, or 14. 4 % of dietary DM) via supplemental urea as DIP. The 0 % <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed</b> treatment included only the 13. 7 % CP diet, and the 40 % <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed</b> treatment included only the 13. 7 and 14. 4 % CP diets. Final dietary DIP concentration was 9. 0 % for 0 % wet corn gluten feed; 8. 7, 9. 5, and 10. 2 % for 20 % wet corn gluten feed; 9. 0, 9. 7, and 10. 3 % DIP for 30 % wet corn gluten feed; and 10. 0 and 10. 6 % for 40 % <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed.</b> Hot carcass weight, ADG, DMI, and G:F responded quadratically (P ≤ 0. 05) to <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed.</b> The 20, 30, and 40 % <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed</b> treatments increased ADG by 7, 6, and 3 % and increased DMI by 4, 5, and 5 %, respectively, relative to the 0 % <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed</b> treatment.

Hot carcass weight, ADG, and G:F increased linearly (P ≤ 0. 05) in response to increased DIP. Nonlinear analysis for DIP over the combined 20 and 30 % <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed</b> treatments indicated a DIP requirement of 9. 6 % of DM for ADG and 9. 2 % of DM for G:F, corresponding to 14. 6 and 14. 3 % CP for 20 % <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed</b> and 14. 8 and 14. 5 % CP for 30 % <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed,</b> respectively.

40|$|Hierarchical SAPO- 34 was {{produced}} using the dry gel conversion method, where an amorphous, mesoporous silicoaluminophosphate {{was subjected to}} steam treatment {{with the presence of}} organic template. This resulted in a crystalline, microporous SAPO- 34 structure, with mesopores present within crystalline particles.

Several techniques were employed {{in order to determine the}} presence of mesopores, including thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC), N 2 -physisorption (BET) and coke deposition with subsequent microanalysis, as well as analysis by the formerly mentioned techniques. The material was found to be of moderate mesoporosity with mesopores in sizes around 6 nm. The micropore diameter inherent to the SAPO- 34 structure is 0. 38 nm. Copper was ion-exchanged into the conventional and hierarchical SAPO- 34, and an incorporated CuSAPO- 34 was also synthesized for means of comparison.

However, the wet form of distillers grains deteriorates (i. e., undergoes dry matter loss-DML) rapidly during storage which affects overall management and utilization.

And yet, data on wet distillers grains DML is highly limited. This study investigated the effect of 0. 1 % w/w CakeGuardTM preservative (propionic acid-based) and temperature (10 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C) on modified wet distillers grains with solubles (MWDGS) DML under aerobic conditions during storage for 21 days. There was significant difference in DML with preservative treatment at 20 °C and 30 °C. Effect of temperature treatment was significant.

The fluid dynamics aspects and its influence on dryer performance were analyzed. The results obtained show that the concurrent dryer residence time and hold-up were lower than the ones of the counter-current dryer. The drying rate of the two dryer’s configurations was very similar, but the counter-current configuration removes a larger quantity of water from the particles of fertilizers...|$|E
40|$|Incorporating silage {{into large}} scale feeding systems {{is often a}} matter of reallocating resources, rather than {{introducing}} totally new resources, and it is consistently more difficult to show a profit from reallocating resources than from introducing new ones. It is therefore imperative {{that the purpose of}} incorporating silage be clear. These purposes are defined as, drought feeding, production increases, an aid to pasture or crop management, utilisation of excess growth, balancing nutrients in the diet, and the storage of <b>wet</b> <b>feed</b> products. A general financial model is proposed for assessing the financial benefits of incorporating silage. It is concluded that silage is most likely to be profitable when used to increase productivity or balance nutrient content of the diet. Special purpose crops such as maize and legumes will normally be used in these roles, and their use in the feeding program will be integrated with other demands on modern production systems, such as quality assurance and sustainability. Use of ensiled forages in large scale animal production systems...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} 6 yr, {{extensive}} {{research has been}} conducted at KSU to evaluate feeding systems and various types of wet and dry feeders. Comparisons have been made between timed-feeding and ad libitum feeding systems using dry or wet feeders. Timed-feeding did not improve pig performance (ADG, F/G) when compared with ad libitum dry <b>feeding.</b> <b>Wet</b> <b>feeding</b> in most of the trials resulted in approximately 5 % improvement in both average daily gain and feed efficiency. Feeding hogs with an oval or rectangular dry feeder resulted in similar pig performance. A 11 feeders were easily adjusted to reduce feed wastage to a minimum...|$|R
40|$|Dairy Research, 2008 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2008 A novel diet {{formulation}} strategy incorporating <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed</b> at 47 % of diet dry matter was evaluated in late-lactation cows. Diets were formulated for similar protein and energy concentrations with dramatic differences in forage sources. Milk fat and protein concentrations increased with the high <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed</b> inclusion rate, and this diet tended to increase milk fat yield. The preliminary work indicates that very low cost rations incorporating <b>wet</b> corn gluten <b>feed</b> may be formulated to maintain milk production, at least in late-lactation cows...|$|R
40|$|Limiting daily {{feed intake}} {{during the last}} half of the growing-finishing period is a {{possible}} way to improve carcass characteristics of market pigs. A review of limited feeding trials conducted here and elsewhere leads to these conclusions regarding limited feeding: 1. 	It reduces growth rate 2. 	Reduces excess backfat but its effect on meaty hogs is questionable 3. 	Requires 10 to 30 days extra feeding 4. 	Requires feeding in small groups 5. 	May or may not improve feed efficiency 6. 	May produce a softer carcass The study reported below compared limited feeding with full feed, and dry <b>feeding</b> with <b>wet</b> <b>feeding...</b>|$|R
