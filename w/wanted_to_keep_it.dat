25|$|Meanwhile, Chatsworth Farm did {{not achieve}} {{the success that}} Joan had envisaged, and was not turning a profit. A trainer had worked there until 1967, but he left {{because he did not}} get on with Robinson, and by 1969 Robinson was {{considering}} selling the place. Joan <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> running, however, and persuaded Diane Settegast, a friend from Dallas, to take on the temporary role of trainer.|$|E
25|$|During the Cold War, the Karelian-born Finnish {{politician}} Johannes Virolainen {{lobbied for}} the return of Karelia. President Urho Kekkonen also tried to reacquire the territory, especially when the Soviet Union returned the peninsula of Porkkala to Finland in 1956. There was, however, no significant public controversy about the case, because Kekkonen <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> quiet. The last time Kekkonen tried to raise it was in 1972, but he had no success, and public discussion died out in the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|At the prom, Adrianna {{goes into}} labor. She {{gives birth to}} a {{daughter}} whom she gives up for adoption. It is also revealed that Brenda has adopted a child from China. Ethan begins to realize his feelings for Silver, {{which leads to a}} confrontation with Dixon and a kiss with Silver. At Naomi and Jen's (her sister) after-prom party, Liam sleeps with Jen. He is mad that Naomi told Jen about his past: he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> a secret. However, he was not aware that Jen was Naomi's sister, and upon finding out is horrified. Naomi finds out about it but thinks that Annie was with Liam, not Jen. This culminates in a major fight between Annie and Naomi where Annie is shunned by her peers, runs away, gets in her car drunk and accidentally runs over a man. This is a suspenseful way to end the season and definitely brings plot twist seeing that Annie is not sure whether or not this man survived.|$|E
25|$|The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) {{authorized}} Conrail {{to abandon}} {{part of this}} line, which it called the Meadville Line, between Corry and Meadville in August 1994, effective {{at the end of}} the month. The on-line municipalities of Corry, Union City, Cambridge Springs, Saegertown, and Meadville filed an offer of financial assistance that month to purchase the line for its net liquidation value of $2.9 million, and the abandonment authority was rescinded. Through the newly created Northwest Pennsylvania Rail Authority they acquired the property on October 31, 1995, after some delay, for operation by the Oil Creek and Titusville Lines (OCTL), and operations began soon after. But the courts ruled in August 1996 that the ICC had no authority to force the sale, since they had authorized abandonment again in April 1995, and so the line was to pass back to Conrail, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> from falling into the hands of a competitor. In the midst of talks between Conrail and the two companies that were buying its assets, CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway, the authority reached an agreement with Conrail in June 1997, allowing it to keep the line.|$|E
500|$|Mackenzie King wanted Macdonald {{to stand}} for a vacant seat in Kingston, Ontario. It was a {{traditional}} Conservative riding that had been represented by Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister. In 1935 however, the riding had switched to the Liberals and King <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "I told Mr. King that I did not know Kingston at all, nor its problems, nor its people", Macdonald wrote later. When the Conservatives agreed not to run a candidate against him however, Macdonald {{had no choice but}} {{to stand for}} office in Kingston. He won the seat by acclamation on August 12, 1940.|$|E

The $100,000 replica was kept at Hasselhoff's home; he has said, [...] "It freaked me {{out because it}} was so lifelike, with teeth, when you touch it [...] feels like real skin. It's soft, like your skin." [...] At the {{completion}} of filming, Hasselhoff said, [...] "That's ridiculously awesome. What are you gonna do with it?" [...] Asked by the crew if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it,</b> he answered, [...] "Uh, yeah. Okay." [...] Hasselhoff filmed in cold water, where he was pulled by a sled nine yards across the sea; he described the experience as [...] "cold but [...] lot of fun." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Faith Won't Fail" [...] was {{inspired}} by faith always sufficing in Bible situations and chapters; and Hudson commented on [...] "Search Me": [...] "I was struggling {{with the fact that}} I would have the huge responsibility of how others would be affected through what I was doing or saying on stage. I don't want to put on some kind of front that everything is good when it's not. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> real, but still give people hope." [...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E
500|$|For Deadpool's scarred appearance, Miller {{wanted him}} to appear [...] "fucking horrible" [...] to justify his anger in the film, while makeup {{designer}} Bill Corso had some leeway because in the comics [...] "he’s everything from a rotten corpse to {{a guy with a}} couple of lines on his face". Corso acknowledged the script's description of the character as disfigured but also {{wanted him to}} be [...] "still kind of charming and iconic". He wanted to avoid comparisons to Freddy Krueger, and looked to Sin City for inspiration. The final makeup required nine silicone prosthetics to cover Reynolds' head, which took several hours to apply. For the scene where the character is naked, it took six hours to apply the full-body makeup to Reynolds. Corso described the makeup {{for the rest of the}} film's characters as [...] "pretty simple. Tim <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> really grounded." ...|$|E

500|$|Cote de Pablo relayed {{that there}} had been a dispute between the {{director}}, Terrence O'Hara, and the actors during filming about how the scene should be choreographed. Both sides thought that it needed to be very intimate, but the director thought that the moment should be drawn out more while de Pablo and Michael Weatherly <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> brief. Furthermore, the latter two believed that simply looking at each other would be sufficient to convey the message to the audience. Eventually, de Pablo approached O'Hara and said, [...] "Listen, if there was any more time of staring into each other's eyes, it would be like, cut to a hotel room." [...] In an interview, she explained that she and Weatherly played the characters as being at a more vulnerable level than is typical for the show. She likened Tony to a [...] "man Teddy Bear" [...] in the episode; in the Tony-Ziva dynamic, he is normally portrayed as being the more juvenile of the two while Ziva is more mature and worldly. In [...] "Berlin", their roles are largely reversed as more of [...] "the little girl in Ziva" [...] is shown and as Tony takes charge of the situation while they are dancing. De Pablo said that she found this reversal in their interactions to be an interesting change.|$|E
500|$|Academic {{papers at}} ISMB were {{traditionally}} {{presented in a}} single track. Presentations at ISMB 1994 were split further into three themed days, focusing on protein secondary structure prediction, sequence analysis and AI techniques and biochemical applications, respectively. As attendance at ISMB increased, the single track approach became increasingly unsustainable and two parallel tracks were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2004. Further expansion meant that, by ISMB 2012, over 200 talks were presented in nine parallel tracks including multiple proceedings tracks, a highlights track and a technology track. The introduction of parallel tracks to ISMB was controversial. Christopher Rawlings (head of Computational and Systems Biology at Rothamsted Research and organiser of ISMB 1995) has said: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> more strongly in the AI intelligent systems model and have a meeting where everybody would go to everything. But it just grew too big. We just couldn’t." [...] As the number of submitted proceedings papers has increased, the acceptance rate has decreased dramatically, from 75% in 1994 to 13% in 2012. ISMB proceedings from 1993-2000 were published by AAAI Press. Since ISMB 2001, proceedings have been published in the journal Bioinformatics. The number of posters presented at ISMB has also increased dramatically. 25 posters were presented at ISMB 1994; at recent ISMB meetings, 500-1,000 posters have been presented in multiple poster sessions.|$|E
500|$|Sixty {{tracks of}} the {{original}} Final Fantasy X soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu, Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were rearranged. Hamauzu and Nakano took charge {{of most of the}} revised music, with Tsutomu Narita and Ryo Yamazaki also making select arrangements. The soundtrack for Final Fantasy X-2 by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi was carried over from the original PlayStation 2 version. For the credits of the HD remaster, scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote the audio drama Final Fantasy X: Will as an appendix taking place two years after X-2. Nojima and Nomura felt {{that it was a good}} opportunity to expand upon the universe of X. They opted for the audio drama format as the team did not want to create a solid visual impression, instead intending to leave it up to interpretation. The team wanted the audio drama to be the [...] "direct opposite" [...] to the upbeat feel and happy ending of X-2. This wish for a more melancholy atmosphere resulted in them bringing Sin, the main antagonistic force in X, back into the story, as the team <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> involved in a similar fashion to Sephiroth, the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. The drama's open ending was also intentional, as Kitase [...] "wanted to leave something up to the player's imagination." ...|$|E

500|$|Timberlake {{described}} [...] "SexyBack" [...] as [...] "an experiment gone {{right from}} the sort of synthesizer influence to the distorted vocals", adding that it was [...] "one of the songs that the more you listen to it its just hook after hook after hook. Its {{just one of those}} 'flow off the top of your head' tracks, in terms of melody. We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> loose and not too rehearsed, it's one of those very experimental records though." [...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. [...] "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R singer. That's the approach." [...] The day before recording, Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie's [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and the Rapture's [...] "House of Jealous Lovers". Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs' [...] "raw energy". Timberlake said that he modeled himself on Bowie and Prince, and described the song as Bowie and David Byrne [...] "covering" [...] James Brown's 1970 song [...] "Sex Machine". Timberlake said that the song [...] "doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk" [...] and that he was happy with the description [...] "club funk". He was [...] "keen for a new musical direction" [...] following the release of his first album, Justified. [...] "I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All this sounds like shit, what do I want to hear?'. That's really all I did. Everything's [...] got so repetitive, everything sounds the same. I had to create something unique otherwise there's no point putting it out." ...|$|E
500|$|Aware of {{what does}} {{and does not}} work in {{television}} animation, Schooley and McCorkle knew that Kim needed to be a physically attractive character. Kim's appearance evolved dramatically {{over the course of}} three months. The character was originally designed to look like [...] "a pretty standard-looking athletic blonde", which was gradually changed in favor of a more distinctive appearance. At one point, Kim's design was based on that of video game character Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. However, the Disney Channel eventually determined that Lara [...] "is ... not a very real character." [...] Finally, the creators decided to give Kim a more realistic appearance akin to that of a 14-year-old girl as opposed to a bombshell, concluding, [...] "She has a nice, very appealing design, but we just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> out of that realm of video game heroine." [...] The creators admitted that Kim would have been their [...] "dream girl" [...] in high school, joking, [...] "She would have been way out of our class though." [...] Director Chris Baily wanted Kim to be designed with [...] "graphic sensibilities" [...] {{similar to those of the}} show's backgrounds, creating a 3D character [...] "whose feet can be planted on the ground and communicate a sense of space." [...] For example, when the character is dressed in all-black, Kim was drawn without a white outline so that she virtually disappears when she moves in front of a black background, yet her [...] "simple design" [...] and flesh allows audiences to [...] "fill in where her body is" [...] naturally. The show's female characters are the only characters drawn with lips, only the upper of which is visible. Describing Kim as [...] "a mostly graphic heroine", Animation: A World History: Volume III: Contemporary Times author Giannalberto Bendazzi agreed that the character's [...] "limited animation" [...] was intentional. In the fourth season, the character's signature crop top and cargo pants are replaced by a T-shirt and pants because the former outfit was damaged during a fight with Shego. Some viewers noted that Kim's face appeared to be [...] "rounder" [...] than it had been drawn in previous seasons. Kim was animated by Rough Draft Korea.|$|E
2500|$|Labor {{policy was}} a {{contentious}} issue. U.S. Steel was non-union, and experienced steel producers, led by Schwab, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> {{that way with}} the use of aggressive tactics to identify and root out pro-union [...] "troublemakers." [...] The lawyers and bankers who had organized the merger—notably Morgan and CEO Elbert Gary—were more concerned with long-range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble. The bankers' views generally prevailed, and the result was a [...] "paternalistic" [...] labor policy. (U.S. Steel was eventually unionized in the late 1930s.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{my first}} {{conversation}} on the telephone with Jay Z he explained his concept of On the Run. He said: 'We're not {{trying to do this}} literally, it's not that we're Bonnie and Clyde. We're on the run from everything. On the run from becoming a cliché. On the run from doing the same thing again.' Everything he mentioned was a level of consciousness he has for staying alive as an entertainer and as a human being. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> more abstract because for him it was very abstract. How do you stay new, not just to your audience but also yourself? ...|$|E
2500|$|Part {{of the set}} for Seabiscuit was set in Tijuana {{during the}} Prohibition era, Oppewall and her staff {{consulting}} vintage postcards {{in order to create}} the set; she said this part of the film was especially difficult to research because, [...] "A Tijuana Historical Society didn't exactly exist back then." [...] She also built a replica of the ranch owned by Charles S. Howard, the owner of the racehorse Seabiscuit, out of fir planks. Actor Jeff Bridges, who played Howard, was so impressed with the set that he made an unsuccessful attempt to buy it and have it shipped to his property in Montana, despite Oppewall's assurances that it was just a set and was not built to last. In a similar episode, the owners of the Santa Anita racetrack were so impressed with her design for a tote board that they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Atlus {{wanted to}} capture a wider {{audience}} with this game. For this they went through a light novel approach while writing its story and hired character designer Suzuhito Yasuda. Although {{they wanted to make}} Devil Survivor different from previous Megami Tensei games, the team still wanted to make sure it belonged to the series. They considered the series famous for its dark storytelling and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> intact. In order to make the game accessible to followers of the series, they decided to focus more on the demons' development rather than the strategy combat. During development of the game, the staff got positive feedback from the players in that the game still felt like a role-playing game. They found the Nintendo DS to be suitable for Devil Survivor due to its dual screen which would fit simulation games. Their saying when starting development was [...] "Let's breathe new life into the series and really shake things up." ...|$|E
