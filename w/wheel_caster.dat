In addition, by introducing disturbance observers, the vehicle was given enhanced mobility and safety characteristics.

50|$|The {{pivot points}} of the {{steering}} are angled such that a line drawn through them intersects the road surface slightly ahead of the contact patch of the tyre on the pavement. The purpose {{of this is to}} provide a degree of self-centring for the steering — the <b>wheel</b> <b>casters</b> around in order to trail behind the axis of steering. This makes a car easier to drive and improves its directional stability (reducing its tendency to wander). Excessive caster angle will make the steering heavier and less responsive, although in racing large caster angles are used for improving camber gain in cornering. Caster angles over 7 degrees with radial tyres are common. Power steering is usually necessary to overcome the jacking effect from the high caster angle.|$|R

40|$|In most wheeled mobile robots, {{at least}} one wheel is the {{auxiliary}} <b>wheel</b> aka <b>caster.</b> It must move smoothly without causing the robot to be interrupted {{if they are to}} truly do their job. Looking at it practically, however, they don’t work sometimes. That is, the wheels frequently slid or slip when they were dragged, even though they were designed to roll without sliding or slipping. In order to free from this problem, one of the solutions is getting rid of it. Then, the total number of wheels attached on the robot changes, moreover, the mechanical characteristic of the robot having only two driving <b>wheels</b> without <b>caster</b> will be altered to that the robot is supposed to move and balance its body with only two driving wheels. Therefore, for this inverted pendulum type robot, it is necessary to investigate whether it is valid proposal or not and what mechanical characteristics it has. For doing this, dynamics of this kind of robot was governed to provide lots of information that will be helpful for design and control. And experiments with various motions were carried out to show its practical validity...|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{recorded history}} of a wheelchair was inscribed in stone on a Chinese Sarcophagus in the 6th century A.D. [...] There have been many variations on the basic design since then but standard features always included rear <b>wheels,</b> front <b>caster</b> <b>wheels,</b> footrests, side frames and seating features. Until recently wheelchairs were designed for relatively smooth surfaces and paved streets and were not designed for rugged environments. Thirty years ago, Ralf Hotchkiss, an engineer with paraplegia and a frequent traveler to developing countries, saw {{the need for a}} high quality and rugged chair that could withstand conditions in rough terrain. He began a thirty year process of collaborative design using locally available parts with a cost low enough to be affordable to disabled persons in developing regions. For many years, Ralf and a team would travel to small machine shops in developing countries to teach the technical skills necessary for local production of the RoughRider model. Several of these shops are developing to scale in parts of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet Union.|$|R
