This culminates in him impersonating Durant himself, causing confusion among the mobster and his henchmen. When Westlake and Julie have a date at the carnival, an altercation causes Westlake to lose his temper and inadvertently reveals to Julie that there is indeed something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> She follows him as he flees (his 99 minutes were up,) and when she discovers his discarded mask, she calls to Peyton that she still loves him regardless. Julie tells Strack she can no longer see him, and after discovering the Bellasarious Memorandum on his desk {{while he was on}} the phone, confirms he was collaborating with Durant the entire time. She reveals Westlake is still alive, but Strack tells her as long as he has the memorandum, no charges can be filed. When Julie leaves, Durant enters and is told to capture Julie and kill Westlake.|$|E

The episode was also the first time Mr. Garrison was portrayed as an anti-semite and racist, particularly when he asks Mayor McDaniels if she can get rid of all the Mexicans in South Park. Parker said this decision was made because, [...] "Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> mentally.

[...] Portrayer Sela Ward has described her character as a window into House's vulnerability and his heart. House simply describes Stacy as [...] "very convincing", as Mark thinks there is nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> but House says that if Stacy says that Mark is ill, he is ill. Many critics noted that Stacy's presence affected House's behaviour, Diane Kristine of Blog Critics stated that, with Stacy, House was [...] "almost nice". While Stacy has told House on several occasions that she loves Mark, she is still very much in love with House and was willing to have an affair with him; however, she admits that she finds House selfish and that [...] "with Mark, there's room for [...] ".|$|E
500|$|While in Germany, Sutcliffe began {{experiencing}} severe {{headaches and}} acute sensitivity to light, and Kirchherr stated {{that some of}} the headaches left him temporarily blind. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, but they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. They suggested he go back to Britain and have himself checked into a hospital with better facilities, but Sutcliffe was told there was nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> so he returned to Hamburg. While living at the Kirchherrs' house his condition got worse, and after collapsing again on 10 April 1962, he was taken to hospital by Kirchherr (who rode with him in the ambulance), but he died before the ambulance reached the hospital. The cause of death was revealed to have been a cerebral haemorrhage, specifically, a ruptured aneurysm resulting in [...] "cerebral paralysis due to bleeding into the right ventricle of the brain." ...|$|E

Stacy believes Mark is ill, and wants House to treat him. However, Mark does not believe anything is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> {{as well as the}} members of House's diagnostic team, who cannot seem to find any medical problems. After various failed attempts to diagnose Mark, House tests Marks urine for porphobilinogen; the test turns out positive, and Mark is diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). He is therefore required to have [...] "close monitoring" [...] at the hospital for a while. Stacy makes a deal with Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) to become the hospital's lawyer during Mark's stay at the hospital. During Stacy's time as the hospital's lawyer, she and House grow closer together. In [...] "Need to Know", they end up spending the night together. However, when Stacy prepares to leave Mark for House, House rejects her, stating that he cannot make her happy, because he cannot change. Stacy quits her job and returns to Short Hills, New Jersey, with Mark. She later appears in the series finale, [...] "Everybody Dies", first as one of House's hallucinations and then at House's funeral.|$|E

5000|$|Many of the gags {{involved}} Foghorn and a canine nemesis (formally {{known as}} The Barnyard Dawg within Warner today, though on early model sheets {{his name is}} given as George P. Dog) engaging in one-upmanship {{through a series of}} pranks. Unlike other Looney Tunes rivalries—with the notable exception of the Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner series—Foghorn is often the initial aggressor out of self-amusement and subsequently on the 'losing' end of gags (although the dog sometimes initiates). However it ends, the formula for how it begins is usually the same. Foghorn, humming [...] "Camptown Races" [...] to himself and carrying a wooden fencepost, sneaks up on Dawg while he is sleeping. Foghorn then pulls the Dawg up by his hindquarters and uses the fencepost to give him a thorough spanking. Dawg, now angry, chases after Foghorn barking angrily but can only go as far as the rope he is tied to can stretch. Thus, when the rope becomes taut and he cannot move, he is either yanked back or stopped. In the latter case, he keeps barking at Foghorn who tells him, [...] "Ah, shaddap!" [...] and does something to Dawg to force him to stop. This gag was passed down to the Leghorns' grandson in Feather Bluster, where Foghorn was puzzled as to why the kid was behaving that way and the Dog was all too happy to remind him: [...] "Ain't nothin' <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>'im,</b> Foggy, 'cept that he takes after you." ...|$|R

500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming here. I have to ask what's <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|Francis {{expresses a}} resentment {{of all forms}} of authority, {{particularly}} during the end of the frame story, when he feels he has been institutionalized because of the madness of the authorities, not because there is anything <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Francis can be seen, at least within the main narrative, as a symbol of reason and enlightenment triumphing over the irrational tyrant and unmasking the absurdity of social authority. But Kracauer contended the frame story undermines that premise. He argues if not for the frame story, the tale of Francis's efforts against Dr. Caligari would have been a praiseworthy example of independence and rebellion against authority. However, with the addition of the frame story, which places the veracity of Francis's claims into question, Kracauer argues the film glorifies authority and turns a reactionary story into an authoritarian film: [...] "The result of these modifications was to falsify the action and to ultimately reduce it to the ravings of a madman." [...] Kracauer believed these changes were not necessarily intentional, but rather an [...] "instinctive submission to the necessities of the screen" [...] because commercial films had to [...] "answer to mass desires". Fritz Lang disagreed with Kracaucer's argument, and instead believes the frame story makes the film's revolutionary inclinations more convincing, not less. David Robinson said, as time passed, filmgoers have been less inclined to interpret the film as a vindication of authority because modern audiences have grown more skeptical of authority in general, and are more inclined to believe Francis's story and interpret the asylum director as wrongly committing Francis to silence him.|$|E
500|$|With less {{control on}} his changeup, Hoffman {{struggled}} in 2010. In April, Hoffman pitched nine innings and allowed 13earned runs and six home runs—surpassing his totals in both categories {{from all of}} the previous season—and he blew four of his seven save opportunities. Historically though, Hoffman had blown 20 of 84 save attempts in April for his career, a 76.1 percent success rate, while converting 90.6 percent the rest of the season. On May 1, Hoffman earned his first save at Petco Park as a visitor, as the Brewers beat the Padres 2–1. After saving just five of his first 10 chances with an ERA over 12.00 in mid-May, Hoffman's struggles prompted Brewers manager Ken Macha to remove him as closer and move him into middle relief to work on his mechanics. Hoffman insisted that there was nothing physically <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> and he served as a mentor for his replacement, John Axford. Stuck at 596 career saves before his demotion, Hoffman eventually returned to a setup role, and occasionally pitched in save situations. On September 7, 2010, he recorded his 600th save, and he was carried off the field by his teammates. [...] "To {{be a part of it}} was great because of how much admiration we all have for Trevor", said teammate Craig Counsell. Hoffman finished the season win a 2–7 win–loss record, 10 saves in 15 chances, and a 5.89 ERA in 50 appearances, but he allowed just nine earned runs in his final 33 appearances dating back to June 3. He and the Brewers parted ways on November 2 when the club declined to exercise a $7 million mutual option on his contract.|$|E

It was a dreadful film, and everything was <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> it; principally <b>him</b> Welles." [...] He also said that his biggest mistake was failing to direct the film version of the musical Oliver!. Its composer Lionel Bart had assured Gilbert that nobody else would do the film, but Gilbert was also contractually committed to Paramount to make a film (that he has since refused to name), which caused him to withdraw from the project.|$|R

2500|$|Nathaniel Hawthorne {{was born}} on July 4, 1804, in Salem, Massachusetts; his birthplace is {{preserved}} {{and open to the}} public.

He was a Puritan and {{was the first of the}} family to emigrate from England, settling in Dorchester, Massachusetts before moving to Salem. There he became an important member of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and held many political positions, including magistrate and judge, becoming infamous for his harsh sentencing. William's son and the author's great-great-grandfather John Hathorne was one of the judges who oversaw the Salem witch trials. Hawthorne probably added the [...] "w" [...] to his surname in his early twenties, shortly after graduating from college, in an effort to dissociate himself from his notorious forebears. Hawthorne's father Nathaniel Hathorne, Sr. was a sea captain who died in 1808 of yellow fever in Suriname; he had been a member of the East India Marine Society. After his death, his widow moved with young Nathaniel and two daughters to live with relatives named the Mannings in Salem, where they lived for 10 years. Young Hawthorne was hit on the leg while playing [...] "bat and ball" [...] on November 10, 1813, and he became lame and bedridden for a year, though several physicians could find nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

By December 1943 Papen was faced with the dilemma about how to best act on Bazna's information without triggering British suspicions that there was a spy in their embassy in Ankara. Unknown to Bazna, the Germans paid <b>him</b> <b>with</b> counterfeit British pounds (which ended Bazna's dreams of getting rich, causing him to die in poverty). Papen noted that Bazna that was an extremely greedy and stupid man with no moral values whatsoever, and there was nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> paying <b>him</b> <b>with</b> counterfeit pounds. Bazna sold Papen a summary of the results of Tehran conference, which Papen in turn provided selective quotes from to Inönü together with the misleading statement that Britain and the United States had just assigned Turkey to the Soviet sphere of influence after the war, which strained Turkish relations with the Allies.|$|R
