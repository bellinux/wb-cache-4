5|$|Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who was {{building}} a reputation for signing unwanted foreign veterans such as N'Gotty, Djorkaeff and Iván Campo, predicted that a win <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> sign more players in the summer. However, he thought that success would also lead his 13 players who {{would be out of}} contract, to demand more money for a renewal.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{was born}} into a middle-class African-American family on January 17, 1899, in Richmond, Virginia. His father was a butcher at a German American owned meat shop, and his mother was a schoolteacher. As a result of his {{frequent}} contact with the meat shop's owner, Harris learned German and became a fluent speaker of the language. Harris' mastery of the language <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> later in life, when he examined the writings of German economists and social reformers like Karl Marx.|$|E

5|$|Khalid {{utilized}} {{his better}} understanding of terrain in every possible way to gain strategic superiority over his enemies. During his Persian campaigns, he initially never entered deep into Persian territory and always kept the Arabian desert at his rear, allowing his forces to retreat there {{in case of a}} defeat. It was only after all the strong Persian and Persian-allied forces were routed that he penetrated deep into Euphrates region and captured the regional capital of Iraq, Al-Hira. Again, at Yarmouk, the terrain <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> in executing his grand strategy of annihilating the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 2010, Hughes {{was named}} the Yankees' fifth starter. Throughout the season, the Yankees {{occasionally}} had Hughes skip starts to limit his innings, in hopes that this <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> stay healthy. On April 21, Hughes carried a no-hitter into the eighth inning against the Athletics before allowing a leadoff single to Eric Chavez; he faced two more hitters prior to being relieved, having struck out 10 batters.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} his marriage, Gebhard {{invested}} his brother Karl with the duties of Statthalter (governor) and charged him with the rule of Bonn. He and Agnes then traveled to Zweibrücken and, from there, to the territory of Dillingen, near Solms-Braunfels, where the Count, a staunch supporter, <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> to raise funds and troops to hold the territory; Adolf, Count von Neuenahr returned to the Electorate to prepare for its defense.|$|E

5|$|After he {{was passed}} over by Johnny Behan for the {{position}} of undersheriff, Wyatt thought he might beat him in the next Cochise County election in late 1882. He thought catching the murderers of Bud Philpot and Peter Roerig <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> win the sheriff's office. Wyatt later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the Wells, Fargo & Co. reward money and more to Ike Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Wyatt, Ike was initially interested, but the plan was foiled when the three suspects—Leonard, Head and Crane—were killed in unrelated incidents.|$|E
5|$|De Ferran was {{confident}} {{that he could be}} competitive and achieve a good result without having to worry about the championship. Da Matta felt his team had learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> in California where he wanted to win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and hoped he would clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana and hoped that he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{had been}} a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one of the nation’s premier summer {{vacation}} spots until World War I. In early September, {{it was decided to}} bring him to Elberon, a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> recover. When they heard that the president was being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly {{to the door of the}} oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.|$|E

5|$|Ingels {{was born}} in Copenhagen in 1974 to an {{engineer}} father and a dentist mother. Hoping to become a cartoonist, he began to study architecture in 1993 at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts as he thought it <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> to improve his drawing skills. Only {{after he had been}} studying for a couple of years, did he really take an interest in architecture. He continued his studies at the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura in Barcelona, and returned to Copenhagen to receive his diploma in 1999. As a third-year student in Barcelona, he set up his first practice and won his first competition.|$|E
5|$|When the Buccaneers {{selected}} University of Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde first {{overall in}} the 1987 NFL Draft, starting quarterback Steve Young became expendable. He {{was traded to the}} 49ers on April 24, 1987. The 49ers were concerned about the health of Joe Montana, and were preparing for the possibility that he might not recover from back surgery. The Buccaneers received 2nd and 4th round draft picks in the trade, picks 50 and 106 overall, which they used to draft University of Miami linebacker Winston Moss and Arizona State wide receiver Bruce Hill. They also received an unspecified amount of cash in the deal. Young would spend the final 13 years of his career with the 49ers, a stint which <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> secure a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} {{out from his}} prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming {{to a halt in}} a maze of an underground cavern. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.|$|E

5|$|Damned to the Netherealm {{after her}} death, Mileena swears fealty to its ruler Shinnok. During {{the events of}} Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena so her skills as a vicious fighter <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically {{granting}} her {{the ability to read}} Kitana's thoughts. Shinnok sees {{this as an opportunity to}} covertly monitor the events unfolding in Earthrealm and so he allows her to return to life. After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherealm. In Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but allows her sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana's palace and demands the power over Edenia be shared with her. Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena and locks her away in a dungeon.|$|E
5|$|Finucane's {{start at}} No. 452 was unimpressive. On 3 May 1941 {{while on a}} {{recognition}} flight with his new commanding officer, Squadron Leader Roy Dutton, Finucane got too close and his propeller sliced through Dutton's tailplane. Finucane radioed Dutton immediately. Dutton attempted to abandon the aircraft but was too low and crash-landed, cracking several ribs but surviving. Finucane excused himself from error asserting that his Spitfire {{was the only one}} with a metal propeller—the others being elder Mark I's with wooden mounts—which gave him extra speed. In tight formation, this had caused the collision. Despite the incident, he was gazetted on 13 May and given temporary command of the squadron while Dutton was injured. While at 452 Finucane became a popular commander and encouraged a more relaxed atmosphere, which he believed <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> get more out of the Australian pilots. He was now in command of 23 pilots, 16 fighters and 130 ground crew.|$|E
5|$|M sends Bond to {{investigate}} Carver after he releases news {{articles about the}} crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it. Bond travels to Hamburg and seduces Carver's wife, Paris, who is also Bond's ex-girlfriend, to get information that <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> enter Carver's newspaper headquarters. He also knocks out three of Stamper's men and cuts Carver off the air while he is giving a speech during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network. After Bond steals back the GPS encoder, Carver orders Paris and Bond killed. Paris is murdered by Carver's personal assassin Dr. Kaufman, but Bond kills Kaufman and escapes, protecting the encoder. Bond learns that the encoder had been tampered with, {{and goes to the}} South China Sea {{to investigate}} the wreck (which was actually in Vietnamese waters). He and Wai Lin, a Chinese agent on the same case, explore the sunken ship and discover one of its cruise missiles missing, but are captured by Stamper and taken to the CMGN tower in Saigon. They soon escape and decide to collaborate on the investigation.|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{the song}} was not {{intended}} to be a single, but it was rush-released due to three stations playing it. Stevens felt that is release <b>would</b> <b>help</b> re-establish <b>him</b> as a novelty artist after several unsuccessful albums mostly composed of serious material.|$|R

5|$|The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in 1885 when he {{was living}} in Bournemouth, on England's south coast. In January 1886 the novella was {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Longmans, Green & Co. and by Charles Scribner's Sons in the United States, where it was frequently pirated {{because of the lack of}} copyright protection in the U.S. for works originally published in the UK. In early 1887, actor Richard Mansfield read Stevenson's novella and immediately got the idea to adapt it for the stage. Mansfield was looking for material that <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> achieve a reputation as a serious actor in the U.S., where he lived, and in England, where he had spent most of his childhood. He had played dual roles as a father and son in a New York production of the operetta Rip Van Winkle, and saw another acting opportunity in playing Jekyll and Hyde.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{followed}} Roman Candles {{with a third}} short film, Eat Your Makeup (1968), {{in which}} Divine once more wore drag, this time to portray a fictionalized version of Jackie Kennedy, the widow of recently assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy. In the film, she turns to kidnapping models and forcing them to eat their own makeup. Divine kept his involvement with Waters and these early underground films a secret from his conservative parents, believing {{that they would not}} understand them or the reason for his involvement in such controversial and bad-taste films; they would not find out about them for many years. Divine's parents had bought him his own beauty shop in Towson, hoping that the financial responsibility <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> to settle down in life and stop spending so extravagantly. While agreeing to work there, he refused to be involved in owning and managing the establishment, leaving that to his mother. Not long after, in the summer of 1968, he moved out of his parental home, renting his own apartment.|$|E
5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. Martin {{said he was in}} the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E

6000|$|With {{the view}} I already took of the case, the bare fact {{stated in the}} words that I have underlined, {{revealed}} Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite's motive for submission as plainly {{as if he had}} acknowledged it himself. He needed a large sum of money; and he needed it by a given time. Rachel's income, which <b>would</b> have <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> to anything else, <b>would</b> not <b>help</b> <b>him</b> here; and Rachel had accordingly released herself, without encountering a moment's serious opposition on his part. If I am told that this is a mere speculation, I ask, in my turn, what other theory will account for his giving up a marriage which would have maintained him in splendour {{for the rest of his}} life? ...|$|R
