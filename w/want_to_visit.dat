25|$|As Chang'an {{was often}} hot during the summer, Emperor Taizong often invited Emperor Gaozu {{to go with}} him to Jiucheng Palace (九成宮, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), to avoid the heat during the summer. However, as Sui's Emperor Wen had died there (which was named Renshou Palace (仁壽宮) during Sui Dynasty), Emperor Gaozu did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Jiucheng Palace. Rather, in 634, Emperor Taizong began to {{construct}} another summer palace, Daming Palace (大明宮), to serve as Emperor Gaozu's summer palace, but Emperor Gaozu fell ill before it was completed, and he never visited Daming Palace. He died in spring 635.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, news analysts, lawyers, {{current and}} former {{government}} officials of the Thai justice system, such as Seripisut Temiyavet, came out to state that the DSI was not handling {{the investigation of the}} temple with proper legal procedure. It was questioned why the DSI would not let the abbot acknowledge the charges at the temple, which many considered legitimate under criminal law. The DSI replied that they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the abbot at the temple at this stage, because the temple was crowded with people, who could force the DSI to commit itself to additional conditions. A spokesperson of the temple also questioned why the DSI did not pursue lawsuits that were still running against Paiboon and Phra Suwit. Was the DSI biased because they received orders from someone not disclosed? The DSI had seen its independence questioned before, even by leading people within the department itself. In short, the temple's practitioners and spokespeople felt the charges were politically motivated, and had no confidence in the justice system under the junta. Moreover, they felt that if the former abbot would turn himself in, this would set a precedent for more baseless persecutions of other monks.|$|E

By this time however, {{the building was}} in great disrepair; among other things, there was water damage, a collapsed wall and no structurally sound roof. The new owners planned to have summer tours for $8 in the following year, but their ultimate goal was turning the Dumas into a bed and breakfast. [...] "It needs to be around.

2500|$|Both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace had {{suggested}} that the evolutionary basis for how the odd relationship between the sphinx moth and A.sesquipedale evolved over time could be understood by considering one orchid with a long spur and another with a short spur. [...] If a moth goes to fertilize a flower with a short spur its proboscis would easily reach {{all the way to}} the bottom of the spur and it would get the nectar. [...] However, since the proboscis of the moth is longer than the spur of the flower, the head of the moth would not touch the flower obtaining the pollinarium and so the flower would not be fertilized. The orchid with the longer spur on the other hand would be able to be fertilized since the entire length of the proboscis fits within the spur and thus allowing the head of the moth to touch the flower and become connected to the pollinarium. [...] As a result, over time plants with longer spurs would be more likely to reproduce and so become more prevalent in the population. [...] In this way A.sesquipedale has evolved to have a very long spur. [...] The moth too would evolve to have a longer and longer proboscis in the following way. If a moth goes to fertilize an A.sesquipedale flower and the spur is longer than its proboscis then it will not be able to reach all of the nectar. As such, moths with too short of a proboscis would not be able to get as much food as those moths with a longer proboscis who could reach all of the nectar. [...] Due to this arrangement moths with longer proboscis would become more physically fit to reproduce due to their ability to get more nectar and so such moths would become more prevalent in the population. This can result in a seesawing effect by which both organisms produce a mechanism that leads the other to increase the others spur and proboscis. There are however certain properties that no doubt prevent this mechanism from continuing indefinitely. For example, the risk such a long proboscis poses to a moth could be a factor that would prevent the spur of A.sesquipedale from becoming indefinitely long. [...] If moths with proboscises that were too cumbersomely long substantially risked their lives due to being easier prey, then such moths could only afford to evolve a proboscis to a certain length. [...] This would in turn restrict the length of the orchid's spur, since moths would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> flowers whose spurs were too long since they would not be able to reach the nectar.|$|E
