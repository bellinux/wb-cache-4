Revising the security treaty was {{understood to be}} the first step towards his ultimate goal of abolishing Article 9. Besides his desire for a more independent foreign policy, Kishi wanted to establish close economic relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> of South-East Asia to create a Japanese economic sphere of influence, which might one day become a political sphere of influence as well. Finally, Kishi wanted the Allies to free all of the Class B and Class C war criminals still in serving their prison sentences, arguing that for Japan to play its role in the Cold War as a Western ally required forgetting about Japan's war crimes in the past.|$|E
25|$|The main {{belief of}} The Nation of Islam and its {{followers}} {{is that there}} is no god but Allah. Their most important worship is praying five times a day. The official beliefs as stated by the Nation of Islam have been outlined in books, documents, and articles published by the organization as well as speeches by Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, Louis Farrakhan, and other ministers. Many of Elijah Muhammad's teachings may be found in Message to the Blackman in America and The True History of Jesus as Taught by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad (Chicago: Coalition for the Remembrance of Elijah, 1992). Many of MalcolmX's teachings of NOI theology are in his The End of White World Supremacy, while a later more critical discussion of those beliefs can be found in The Autobiography of Malcolm X, co-written with Alex Haley. It is important to note that near the end of Malcolm X's life, Malcolm, along with Elijah Muhammad's son, Wallace Muhammad, broke away from major parts of Elijah Muhammad's theology. This was spurred originally by immoral actions by Elijah Muhammad, which were in-congruent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nations</b> own teaching, but then mainly from Malcolm's experience at the Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca. Malcolm, following Wallace's footsteps, along with many other followers entered traditional Islam (Autobiography of Malcolm X). They rejected that Fard Muhammad was God incarnate, as God cannot be in human form, and that Elijah Muhammad was a prophet sent by God, as the Prophet Muhammad from 570 CE to 632 CE is the last prophet for humankind, according to Islam - Qur'an Verse 40, Surah Al-Ahzab (chapter 33).|$|E

500|$|In 1963, {{with the}} number of {{parliamentary}} seats increased to 31, another election saw a repeat of the 1961 votes. Due to the layout of the constituencies, which were gerrymandered by the ZNP, the ASP, led by Abeid Amani Karume, won 54 {{percent of the popular vote}} but only 13 seats, while the ZNP/ZPPP won the rest and set about strengthening its hold on power. The Umma Party, formed that year by disaffected radical Arab socialist supporters of the ZNP, was banned, and all policemen of African mainland origin were dismissed. This removed a large portion of the only security force on the island, and created an angry group of paramilitary-trained men with knowledge of police buildings, equipment and procedures. Furthermore, the new Arab-dominated government made it clear that in foreign policy, the Sultanate of Zanzibar would be seeking close links with the Arab world, especially Egypt and had no interest in forging relationships <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> on the African mainland as the black majority wished. Slavery had been abolished in Zanzibar in 1897, but much of the Arab elite who dominated the island's politics made little effort to hide their racist views of the black majority as their inferiors, a people fit only for slavery. In Parliament, the Minister of Finance Juma Aley responded to questions from Karume by insultingly saying he need not answer questions from a mere [...] "boatman". Aley further explained in another speech in Parliament that if Arabs were over-represented in the Cabinet, it was not because of racism, but rather it was only because the mental abilities of blacks were so abysmally low and the mental abilities of Arabs like himself were so high, a remark that enraged the black majority. [...] Memories of Arab slave-trading in the past (some of the older blacks had been slaves in their youth) together with a distinctly patronizing view of the Arab elite towards the black majority in the present meant that much of the black population of Zanzibar [...] had a ferocious hatred of the Arabs, viewing the new Arab-dominated government as illegitimate. The government did not help broaden its appeal to the black majority by drastically cutting spending in schools in areas with high concentrations of blacks. The government's budget with its draconian spending cuts in schools in black areas was widely seen as a sign that the Arab-dominated government was planning to lock the blacks in a permanent second-class status.|$|E

There are currently a number of mercenary themes available: Llaelese Resistance, the Kingmaker's Army, Hammer Strike, the Irregulars, and Operating Theatre. While a few of the Iron Kingdoms' nations produce warjacks for mercenaries (specifically the nations of Ord, Rhul, and [...] Llael), many mercenaries make do with scavenging surplus military warjacks, building their own custom warjacks, or converting laborjacks into machines of war, refitting them until they are capable of doing battle on par <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> of the Iron Kingdoms.
