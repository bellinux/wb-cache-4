5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope {{has been}} used to provide convincing {{observational}} evidence of this stellar mass-sorting process in globular clusters. Heavier stars slow down and crowd at the cluster's core, while lighter stars pick up speed and tend to spend more time at the cluster's periphery. The globular star cluster 47 Tucanae, which is made up of about 1 million stars, is one of the densest globular clusters in the Southern Hemisphere. This cluster was subjected to an intensive photographic survey, which allowed astronomers to track the motion of its stars. Precise velocities <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>for</b> nearly 15,000 stars in this cluster.|$|E

25|$|In one {{analysis}} of 36 court cases involving {{sexual abuse of}} children within rituals, only one quarter resulted in convictions and the convictions {{had little to do}} with ritual sex abuse. In a 1994 survey of more than 11,000 psychiatric and police workers throughout the US, conducted for the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, researchers investigated approximately 12,000 accusations of group cult sexual abuse based on satanic ritual. The survey found no substantiated reports of well-organized satanic rings of people who sexually abuse children, but did find incidents in which the ritualistic aspects were secondary to the abuse and were used to intimidate victims. Victor reviewed 21 court cases alleging SRA between 1983 and 1987 in which no prosecutions <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>for</b> ritual abuse.|$|E
25|$|During 1932, {{there were}} {{significant}} problems of morale and discipline due to subversion within the 2nd Air Regiment near Sarajevo. Steady progress continued {{to be made in}} developing the air force, but several weaknesses were evident, including; lack of first-class aircraft, dependence on foreign sources for the bulk of aviation construction material, inadequate repair and maintenance facilities, the slow development of the home-grown aircraft industry, and the negative influence exerted by senior army officers with no aviation experience or knowledge. It was acknowledged that the air force had no difficulty in attracting high quality recruits, and the Sarajevo incident aside, that morale and discipline were high within the air arm. Two additional squadrons were added to each of the six air regiments during 1932. As a result, the number of aircraft in service increased to approximately 430, with a reserve of 300. The state factory at Kraljevo produced about 150 Breguet 19 aircraft during the year, with forty Potez 25s also being delivered from the Ikarus factory. Six bombers <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>for</b> evaluation during the year; two each from Junkers, Dornier and Fokker.|$|E

25|$|Robert George Mallaby Carter (born 11 July 1937), {{known as}} Bob, {{is a former}} English cricketer who played {{first-class}} and List A cricket for Worcestershire. He was capped by the county in 1965, and was awarded a benefit season in 1973, which raised about £7,000. All but two of his 523 first-class wickets came for Worcestershire; the others <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>for</b> MCC in the very last game of his career. Carter’s batting was generally extremely poor, as evidenced by his career batting average of under five in both forms of the game, although he did play one significant – if ultimately fruitless – innings. In the 1963 Gillette Cup final against Sussex at Lord's, {{he came to the}} wicket with Worcestershire 133/9, needing 35 runs to win. In fading light, he and wicket-keeper Roy Booth added 21 before Carter was run out to end the match. Carter also played in a critical close finish the following season against Nottinghamshire, where he and Flavell managed to get home by a single wicket and virtually seal the county’s first Championship title.|$|E

That means active, alive, vibrant and high energy—it requires us to be just as active on stage as in the crowd. The audience is every bit as much a set piece as they are a room of spectators, so we had to include them as part of Gaga's same party not just watching the spectacle from afar. Cue wise, that's almost like programming two shows at once: Both had to behave as one cohesive element." ...|$|E
