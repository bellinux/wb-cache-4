5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E
5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{relatively}} long-lived hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season that affected countries from Central America to the United Kingdom. Lili formed on October14 from a tropical wave, which emerged from the coast of west Africa on October4. After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm status on October16 and then to hurricane status on October17. The next day, Lili struck Cuba and moved across the central portion of the island, the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Kate in 1985. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas. For almost an entire week, Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed. About two <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October27, which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain.|$|E

25|$|Despite her tough policies, the {{popularity}} of Benazir Bhutto waned after her husband became allegedly involved in the controversial death of Murtaza Bhutto. Many public figures and officials suspected even Benazir Bhutto's involvement in the murder, although there were no proves. In 1996, seven <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> this incident, Benazir Bhutto's government was dismissed by her own hand-picked president on charges of Murtaza Bhutto's death.|$|E
25|$|Fox, however, was out {{of contact}} in Italy as the crisis broke; he had {{resolved}} not to read any newspapers while he was abroad, except the racing reports. Three <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> before he returned to Britain on 25 November 1788 {{and then he was}} taken seriously ill (partly due to the stress of his rapid journey across Europe) and would not recover entirely until December 1789. He again absented himself to Bath from 27 January to 21 February 1789.|$|E
25|$|Six <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> before Keane scored {{again but}} it was a crucial {{equaliser}} against Arsenal, giving Liverpool a 1–1 away draw against their league rivals. In the following Premier League match against Bolton, Keane scored two more league goals to seal a 3–0 win for Liverpool. During the January transfer window, Tottenham Hotspur made an approach for the striker and Liverpool accepted the offer, allowing the Irishman to return to his former club for a fee of £12 million, £7 million less than liverpool had paid for him.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} said that twelve years elapsed between {{the second and third}} acts of Siegfried, but this is an exaggeration. While it is true that eleven years and twenty-nine <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> between the {{completion}} of the developed draft of Act II {{and the beginning of the}} preliminary draft of Act III, Wagner devoted more than a year of this so-called hiatus to the composition of Siegfried, completing the fair copy of Act I, drawing up both the full score and fair copy of Act II, and making sketches for Act III.|$|E
25|$|On March 6, Chiefs {{general manager}} Carl Peterson {{announced}} that quarterback Trent Green {{was asked to}} restructure his contract to remain with the team. Green was also granted permission to explore options of a trade to another team. The February contract agreement with Damon Huard, {{who would have been}} an unrestricted free agent, was the first public indication that Green’s job was in danger. The first team to have contacted the Chiefs' front office was the Miami Dolphins, but Miami constantly disagreed in negotiations. The Dolphins offered a seventh round draft pick to the Chiefs, but the Chiefs declined, instead seeking a second round pick in exchange for Green. The Detroit Lions, and Cleveland Browns were also interested in Green, who are both looking for a veteran quarterback. Green had told the Chiefs that Miami was his preference being that he previously worked under both head coach Cam Cameron and quarterbacks coach Terry Shea. On draft day, the Chiefs and Dolphins could not reach a deal to trade Green. The Chiefs changed their request to a fourth-round pick while the Dolphins offered a sixth round pick. As <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> with some believing that Green would remain with the Chiefs, Green's agent reiterated that Green would not return to play for Kansas City.|$|E

500|$|The {{last two}} {{handcart}} companies of 1856 departed late from England. The ship Thornton, carrying the emigrants {{who became the}} Willie Company, did not leave England until May 4. The leader of the Latter-day Saints on the Thornton was James G. Willie. [...] Another three <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> before the Horizon, carrying the emigrants who formed the Martin Company, departed.

500|$|There was no {{agreement}} (or settlement) between South Africa and SWAPO, so {{an order to}} move was never issued. The Official History noted, [...] "as the <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> the unit {{found it difficult to}} continue training because all its vehicles, equipment and plant were either in boxes or in a state ready for transhipment". The notice to move reverted to 30 days in June and pushed out to 42 days in September 1979, when the unit was formally released from standby. The notice to move was increased to 60 days in March 1982, and 75 days in November 1986. In July 1987, all remaining specific readiness requirements were removed.|$|E
500|$|In May, the 13th MEU {{moved into}} Tharthar, a [...] {{area that was}} AQI's last Anbar refuge. Their goal was to cut off insurgent travel between Anbar and Salahuddin Provinces into Baghdad and to uncover weapons caches. Resistance was light and many insurgents fled. The insurgents laid over 400 mines to slow the Marines down. In one operation, Marines found 18 tons of {{homemade}} explosives and [...] of ammonium nitrate fertilizer. They uncovered several mass graves, containing a total of over 100 victims left behind by AQI. Tharthar was cleared by August. Operation Alljah {{was one of the}} last significant Anbar offensives.

500|$|As the <b>weeks</b> <b>passed,</b> Heywood calmly {{occupied}} {{himself by}} resuming his {{studies of the}} Tahitian language. Meanwhile the family—Nessy in particular—busied itself on his behalf, and another plea was made to the Earl of Chatham, in heart-rending terms. Shortly afterwards came the first indication that a royal pardon was in the offing, and on 26 October, on Hector's quarterdeck, this was formally read to Heywood and Morrison by Captain Montagu. Heywood responded with a short statement that ended: [...] "I receive with gratitude my Sovereign's mercy, for which my future life will be faithfully devoted to his service." [...] According to a Dutch newspaper which reported the case, his contrition {{was accompanied by a}} [...] "flood of tears". William Muspratt, the only other of the accused to employ legal counsel, was reprieved on a legal technicality and pardoned in February 1793.|$|E
500|$|When {{she failed}} {{to return to her}} lodgings at Edward Lyon's house, her {{employer}} twice went looking for her at her mother's home. [...] Mrs Canning sent her other three children to Moorfields to search for her, while James Lord went to the Colleys, who told him that they had left Elizabeth at about 9:30pm near Aldgate church in Houndsditch. [...] The next morning Mrs Canning also travelled to the Colleys' house, but to no avail, as Elizabeth was still missing. [...] Neighbours were asked if they knew of her whereabouts, and <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> as Mrs Canning searched the neighbourhood for her daughter, while her relatives scoured the city. [...] An advertisement was placed in the newspapers, prayers were read aloud in churches and meeting houses, but other than a report of a [...] "woman's shriek" [...] from a hackney coach on 1January, no clues were found as to Elizabeth's disappearance.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard became Parsons' [...] "magical partner" [...] for a sex magic ritual {{involving}} {{that was}} intended to summon an incarnation of a goddess. Although they got on well as fellow occultists, tensions {{between the two men}} were apparent in more domestic settings. Hubbard and Northrup made no secret of their relationship; another lodger at Parsons' house described how he saw Hubbard [...] "living off Parsons' largesse and making out with his girlfriend right in front of him. Sometimes when {{the two of them were}} sitting at the table together, the hostility was almost tangible." [...] Despite the tensions between them, Hubbard, Northrup and Parsons agreed at the start of 1946 that they would go into business together, buying yachts on the East Coast and sailing them to California to sell at a profit. They set up a business partnership on January 15, 1946 under the name of [...] "Allied Enterprises", with Parsons putting up $20,000 of capital, Hubbard adding $1,200 and Northrup contributing nothing. Hubbard and Northrup left for Florida towards the end of April, taking with him $10,000 drawn from the Allied Enterprises account to fund the purchase of the partnership's first yacht. <b>Weeks</b> <b>passed</b> without word from Hubbard.

500|$|Supplies {{were now}} running low. Hurley and Macklin were {{sent back to}} Ocean Camp to recover food {{that had been left}} there to lighten the {{sledging}} teams’ burden. On 2 February 1916 Shackleton sent a larger party back, to recover the third lifeboat. Food shortages became acute as the <b>weeks</b> <b>passed,</b> and seal meat, which had added variety to their diet, now became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations. In January, all but two teams of the dogs (whose overall numbers had been depleted by mishaps and illness in the preceding months) were shot on Shackleton’s orders, because the dogs' requirements for seal meat were excessive. The final two teams were shot on 2 April, by which time their meat was a welcome addition to the rations. Meanwhile, the rate of drift became erratic; after being held at around 67° for several weeks, at the end of January there was a series of rapid north-eastward movements which, by 17 March, brought Patience Camp to the latitude of Paulet Island, but [...] to its east. [...] "It might have been six hundred for all the chance we had of reaching it across the broken sea-ice", Shackleton recorded.|$|E
500|$|The Allied fleet sailed {{north to}} Cape Artemisium once {{it became known}} that the Persian army was {{advancing}} along the coast past Mount Olympus, probably around late July or the beginning of August. The Allies took up station at Artemisium, most likely beaching their ships at the headland, from which they could quickly launch them as needed. The Allies sent three ships to Skiathos as scouts to provide warning of {{the approach of the}} Persian fleet but [...] two <b>weeks</b> <b>passed</b> without sight. Finally, ten Sidonian triremes arrived off Skiathos, and the main Allied fleet was informed by a fire-beacon lit on the island. However, the Allied patrol ships themselves were caught unaware and two were captured, whilst one ran aground. According to Herodotus, in the ensuing confusion, unsure whether or not the beacon heralded the arrival of the whole Persian fleet, as a precaution the whole Allied fleet launched into the straits of Artemisium. Once {{it became clear that the}} Persian fleet was not going to arrive that day, they decided to sail to Chalcis, halfway down on the western coast of Euboea, leaving men on the heights of Euboea to warn of the actual arrival of the Persian ships.|$|E
500|$|On 14 September 1718, Rogers {{received}} word that Vane was at Green Turtle Cay near Abaco, about [...] north of Nassau. Some of the pardoned pirates on New Providence took boats to join Vane, and Rogers {{decided to send}} two ex-pirate captains, Benjamin Hornigold and John Cockram, with a crew to gather intelligence, and, if possible, to bring Vane to battle. As the <b>weeks</b> <b>passed,</b> and hopes of their return dimmed, Rogers declared martial law and set all inhabitants to work on rebuilding the island's fortifications. Finally, the former pirates returned. They had failed to find an opportunity to kill Vane or bring him to battle, but had captured one ship {{and a number of}} pirate captives. Captain Hornigold was then sent to recapture the ships and crews who had gone pirate en route to Havana. He returned with ten prisoners, including captain John Auger, and three corpses. [...] On 9 December 1718, Rogers brought the ten men captured by Hornigold to trial. Nine were convicted, and Rogers had eight hanged three days later, reprieving the ninth on hearing he was of good family. One of the condemned, Thomas Morris, quipped as he climbed the gallows, [...] "We have a good governor, but a harsh one." [...] The executions so cowed the populace that when, shortly after Christmas, several residents plotted to overthrow Rogers and restore the island to piracy, the conspirators attracted little support. Rogers had them flogged, then released as harmless.|$|E
