25|$|This {{is a large}} {{topic of}} study. It refers to any {{productive}} extraction and includes juicing {{of fruits and vegetables}} and <b>wringing</b> (desirable fluids) out of cloths, as the juice or water inside the fruit is considered 'desirable' for these purposes, while the pulp of the fruit would be the 'undesirable.' As such, squeezing (S'chita) is forbidden unless certain rules are applied. The <b>wringing</b> of undesirable water out of cloths may come under the law of Melabain (Scouring/Laundering). One could view this activity as extraction, while Borer (separation) is more akin to purification.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} portion {{above the}} base has three bands featuring sculptures of various deities, surasundaris (female figures) such as apsaras, and mythical creatures. The surasandaris are shown performing various day-to-day activities, such as applying sindoor (vermilion powder) to their foreheads and kohl to their eyes, <b>wringing</b> their hair after bathing, playing flute, plucking thorn from their feet, dancing, admiring {{themselves in a}} mirror, dressing or simply posing provocatively. Their hairstyles, patterned garments, ornaments and expressive faces are noticeable in these sculptures.|$|E

Wilson drew praise when {{he succeeded in}} <b>wringing</b> from Germany a pledge to constrain their U-boat warfare {{to the rules of}} cruiser warfare. This was a clear departure from existing practices—a diplomatic concession from which Germany could only more brazenly withdraw, and regrettably did.|$|E

25|$|Ben-Matityahu had Yodfat's limited {{supply of}} water rationed before the siege began. The Romans had heard of this and began to use their {{artillery}} to target efforts to draw water, hoping to exacerbate an already difficult situation and bring a swift end to the siege. The Jews confounded these expectations by <b>wringing</b> out their clothes over the battlements until the walls were running with water, leading the Romans to believe they had some hidden {{supply of water}}. According to Josephus, this had the double effect of strengthening Roman resolve to take the city by force and the defenders' resolve to fight, hoping to die by the sword rather than thirst or starvation.|$|E
25|$|A {{vertebra}} {{can also}} be {{described in terms of}} the shape of the ends of the centrum. Centra with flat ends are acoelous, like those in mammals. These flat ends of the centra are especially good at supporting and distributing compressive forces. Amphicoelous vertebra have centra with both ends concave. This shape is common in fish, where most motion is limited. Amphicoelous centra often are integrated with a full notochord. Procoelous vertebrae are anteriorly concave and posteriorly convex. They are found in frogs and modern reptiles. Opisthocoelous vertebrae are the opposite, possessing anterior convexity and posterior concavity. They are found in salamanders, and in some non-avian dinosaurs. Heterocoelous vertebrae have saddle-shaped articular surfaces. This type of configuration is seen in turtles that retract their necks, and birds, because it permits extensive lateral and vertical flexion motion without stretching the nerve cord too extensively or <b>wringing</b> it about its long axis.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, {{pitches and}} resins were used {{commonly}} as medicines. Pliny mentions {{a variety of}} tar-like substances being used as medicine, including cedria and pissinum. Cedria was the pitch and resin of the cedar tree, being equivalent to the oil of tar and pyroligneous acid which {{are used in the}} first stage of distilling creosote. He recommends cedria to ease the pain in a toothache, as an injection in the ear in case of hardness of hearing, to kill parasitic worms, as a preventative for impregnation, as a treatment for phthiriasis and porrigo, as an antidote for the poison of the sea hare, as a liniment for elephantiasis, and as an ointment to treat ulcers both on the skin and in the lungs. He further speaks of cedria being used as the embalming agent for preparing mummies. Pissinum was a tar water that was made by boiling cedria, spreading wool fleeces over the vessels to catch the steam, and then <b>wringing</b> them out.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, Górecki {{approached}} the Polish folklorist Adolf Dygacz {{in search of}} traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work. Dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in the [...] Silesia region in south-western Poland. Górecki {{was impressed by the}} melody [...] "Where has he gone, my dear young son?" [...] (Kajże się podzioł mój synocek miły?), which describes a mother's mourning for a son lost in war, and probably dates from the Silesian Uprisings of 1919–21. Górecki had heard a version of the song in the 1960s and had not been impressed by the arrangement, but the words and the melody of Dygacz's new version made a lasting impression on him. He said [...] "for me, it is a wonderfully poetic text. I do not know if a 'professional' poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse, simple words. It is not sorrow, despair or resignation, or the <b>wringing</b> of hands: it is just the great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son." ...|$|E
500|$|Zinta next {{starred in}} Samir Karnik's Heroes (2008), a road movie about two final-year film {{students}} who, {{as a part}} of their assignment, travel a thousand miles across North India to deliver three un-posted letters written by army personnel who lost their lives during the 1999 Kargil war to their families. The story unfolds the journey of these students in three chapters and follows how they meet and are inspired by the families of the soldiers. Zinta is featured in the first chapter as Salman Khan's war widow, Kuljeet Kaur, a woman who becomes the sole breadwinner of the family and single-handedly raises her son. In preparation for the role, Zinta attended Anupam Kher's acting school, [...] "Actor Prepares" [...] to learn the dialect and mannerisms of a Punjabi woman. The film was released to a mixed critical reaction, but her performance received rave reviews; Anand Singh of Hindustan Times wrote, [...] "Karnik is merely interested in <b>wringing</b> tears the old-fashioned way, and not in starting a debate. He succeeds—mainly because Preity Zinta brings to a role a gravitas and dignity that is seen on the faces of ordinary women—this may be her coming of age as an actress." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few moments}} after {{beginning}} the display, and while still ascending, the balloon {{was seen to}} be in flames. Some reports say that the balloon momentarily disappeared behind a cloud and that when it reappeared it was on fire—whatever the circumstances, the gas in the balloon was burning. Blanchard began to descend rapidly, but the balloon, caught in the wind, continued to move off from the pleasure gardens even as it went down. Some spectators thought these events {{were part of the}} show and applauded and shouted their approval. The balloon had not risen very high and, although the escaping gas was burning, the gas within the balloon maintained sufficient lift for a while to prevent the craft plummeting directly to the ground. By rapidly shedding ballast Blanchard was able to slow the descent. Most reports say she appeared to be calm during the descent, but she was said to be <b>wringing</b> her hands in despair as the craft approached the ground. Rumours later circulated that she had gripped the chair of her craft so tightly that [...] "several arteries had snapt through the effort." ...|$|E

500|$|While Leigh made Streetcar in 1951, Olivier {{joined her}} in Hollywood to film Carrie, {{based on the}} {{controversial}} novel Sister Carrie; although the film was plagued by troubles, Olivier received warm reviews and a BAFTA nomination. Olivier began to notice a change in Leigh's behaviour, and he later recounted that [...] "I would find Vivien sitting {{on the corner of}} the bed, <b>wringing</b> her hands and sobbing, in a state of grave distress; I would naturally try desperately to give her some comfort, but for some time she would be inconsolable." [...] After a holiday with Coward in Jamaica, she seemed to have recovered, but Olivier later recorded, [...] "I am sure that... must have taken some pains to tell me what was wrong with my wife; that her disease was called manic depression and what that meant—a possibly permanent cyclical to-and-fro between the depths of depression and wild, uncontrollable mania. He also recounted the years of problems he had experienced because of Leigh's illness, writing, [...] "throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness—an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble." ...|$|E
500|$|Forbes {{spoke about}} the commendable ticket pricing ensued by Live Nation for the tour. Jesse Lawrence from the {{magazine}} noticed how the ticket prices were lowered {{to an average of}} $68 in Gaga's primary markets and ensuing fast sell-outs, compared to those of her contemporaries, like Miley Cyrus' Bangerz Tour which had an average ticket price at $86. Conversely, the average price was raised to as high as $269 in Gaga's secondary markets, although with fewer tickets available than Cyrus' tour. This again ensued that the revenue was earned with profit. Lawrence concluded by saying that [...] "Lady Gaga's pricing, seems to be taking a longer-term view and is focused on providing access to as many of her fans as possible as opposed to <b>wringing</b> out every last dollar on the current tour." [...] In April 2014, Lawrence reported that following Gaga's performance at Roseland Ballroom, the tour ticket prices in the secondary markets went up by 5.3%, with major increases being visible at Philips Arena in Atlanta. Tickets at Madison Square Garden rose up to $338.81, which was 42.6% higher than the average price. Other locations where ticket prices saw an increase were MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, TD Garden Arena in Boston and United Center in Chicago. A higher price was set for the first of two nights at Staples Center in Los Angeles, resulting in one of the costliest tickets in the show. The pricing was leveled off for the second night and they gradually decreased with the tour's progress. This was evident in the tour date switch up between May 12 and 15 at Washington and Philadelphia, respectively, where the ticket prices fell by 29.5%.|$|E
500|$|The {{morning of}} July 3 {{revealed}} the full {{scale of the}} Union defenses, as enemy artillery opened fire {{at a distance of}} 500 yards with a [...] "terrific and galling fire", followed by a ferocious assault on Steuart's position. The result was a [...] "terrible slaughter" [...] of the Third Brigade, which fought for many hours without relief, exhausting their ammunition, but successfully holding their position. Then, late on the morning of July 3, Johnson ordered a bayonet charge against the well-fortified enemy lines, [...] "confident of their ability to sweep him away and take the whole Union line in reverse". Steuart was appalled, and was strongly critical of the attack, but direct orders could not be disobeyed, and Steuart gave the order to [...] "Left face" [...] and [...] "file right", sending his men into heavy enfilading fire. Steuart's Third Brigade advanced against the Union breastworks and attempted several times to wrest control of Culp's Hill, {{a vital part of the}} Union Army defensive line. The result was a [...] "slaughterpen", as the Second Maryland and the Third North Carolina regiments courageously charged a well-defended position strongly held by three brigades, a few reaching within twenty paces of the enemy lines. So severe were the casualties among his men that Steuart is said to have broken down and wept, <b>wringing</b> his hands and crying [...] "my poor boys". Overall, the failed attack on Culp's Hill cost Johnson's division almost 2,000 men, of which 700 were accounted for by Steuart's brigade alone—far more than any other brigade in the division. At Hagerstown, on the 8th July, out of a pre-battle strength of 2,200, just 1,200 men reported for duty. The casualty rate among the Second Maryland and Third North Carolina was between one half and two-thirds, in the space of just ten hours.|$|E

500|$|Lou Lumenick, of the New York Post {{strongly}} criticized {{both the}} film and Jackson's performances. Lumenick's criticism of Jackson's performances was he felt Jackson moves [...] "stiffly and lethargically" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "clear" [...] that Jackson was lip-synching while performing [...] "Thriller." [...] He felt Jackson's performance of [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] looked [...] "incongruous, to say the least" [...] and that [...] "the hokey environmental visuals accompanying 'Earth Song' are even worse," [...] and cited [...] "Beat It" [...] as being the movie's [...] "only half-decent number." [...] Lumenick said that he was certain that a [...] "perfectionist" [...] like Jackson would not want to have been remembered by a [...] "shoddy piece of exploitation." [...] David Edwards, of Daily Mirror, stated that while he felt that the film is a [...] "success" [...] he overall disliked the film, having felt that [...] "as an exercise in <b>wringing</b> every last penny from Jackson's legacy" [...] the film [...] "most certainly isn't it" [...] a tribute. Alex Fletcher, of Digital Spy described the film as having been an [...] "essential viewing" [...] and praised the film for showing [...] "the real Michael Jackson" [...] — which consisted of [...] "difficult, odd, kind, obsessive and funny." [...] He cited Jackson's best performances as [...] "Thriller" [...] and [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and the [...] "worst material" [...] as [...] "Earth Song." [...] However, Fletcher did feel that, while based on the rehearsal footage, Jackson [...] "falls short of his groundbreaking Dangerous and Bad world tours," [...] he noted that Jackson's age and thinness was mostly likely a factor in his performances and described Jackson as having more [...] "star quality and charisma than a million Simon Cowell factory-line production pop singers." ...|$|E
