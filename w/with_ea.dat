5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown was {{developed}} by Guildford-based video game studio Criterion Games. The studio suffered several setbacks during {{the sequence of events}} that led up to the creation of Burnout 3, including the cancellation of a project, a failed pitch, and a fall out with the game's eventual publisher Electronic Arts (EA). In 2002, Criterion was around 130 people divided into two development teams. One team was working on Burnout 2: Point of Impact, a follow up to Burnout, set to be published by Acclaim Entertainment. The other team had completed the development of the extreme sports game AirBlade for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony had intentions of continuing to collaborate with Criterion on a sequel to AirBlade, however the AirBlade team turned down the offer. Instead, Criterion began talks <b>with</b> <b>EA,</b> who had a proposal for Criterion to create a remake of the 1988 skateboarding video game Skate or Die!. Criterion were keen to work <b>with</b> <b>EA</b> and started development on the project. Following Burnout 2s release, Criterion prepared a pitch to EA Canada about working on a second game with the publisher. Criterion's proposed title was Need For Speed: Split Second, a stunt racing game within EA's Need for Speed series. Meanwhile, the Skate of Die! remake project was thrown into disarray when EA requested changes to the game's design and the creative direction of project shifted away from Criterion's vision. With development staff becoming unhappy and stressed about the project, the studio decided to contact EA and cancel the game. EA was displeased with their decision and {{the relationship between the two}} companies soured, leading to dissolution of the proposed Need for Speed game.|$|E
5|$|While Criterion {{had their}} own audio team to create {{original}} music, working <b>with</b> <b>EA</b> gave {{them the opportunity to}} include licensed music in Burnout 3. EA launched an initiative called EA TRAX in 2002 with the intent of including licensed tracks in all their games. Burnout 3s soundtrack featured over forty songs, delivered in a radio station format presented by DJ Stryker from alternative rock station KROQ-FM. Options were added to modify which songs during a race or on the menu screen and the Xbox version supports custom soundtracks.|$|E
5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Criterion Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with Criterion and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested Criterion make Burnout 3 with them. Originally, the studio was waiting until the next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. Criterion accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that Criterion had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on Burnout 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the game than its predecessors. By January 2004, Criterion had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for Burnout 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, Seek and Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like See You in Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not an appealing choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start in their relationship <b>with</b> <b>EA,</b> Criterion admitted to benefiting from the publisher's experience throughout the course of Burnout 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing and polishing the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired Criterion along with the Burnout intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for Burnout 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying Criterion.|$|E

25|$|Episodic ataxia (EA) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder characterized by sporadic bouts of ataxia (severe discoordination) {{with or without}} myokymia (continuous muscle movement). There are seven types recognised but the majority are due to two recognized entities. Ataxia can be provoked by stress, startle, or heavy exertion such as exercise. Symptoms can first appear in infancy. There are at least 6 loci for EA, of which 4 are known genes. Some patients <b>with</b> <b>EA</b> also have migraine or progressive cerebellar degenerative disorders, symptomatic of either familial hemiplegic migraine or spinocerebellar ataxia. Some patients respond to acetazolamide though others do not.|$|E
40|$|Enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) Escherichia coli {{isolated}} from cattle were studied by DNA colony hybridization to subtype their intimin-encoding (<b>eae)</b> gene <b>with</b> probes {{derived from the}} variable parts of the eae alpha gene of the human EPEC strain E 2348 / 69, the eae gamma gene of the human O 157 :H 7 EHEC strain ATCC 43888, and the eae beta gene of the bovine O 26 :H- EHEC strain 193, whose eae gene was first cloned and sequenced during this work. The EPEC and EHEC had been {{isolated from}} diarrhoeic calves (143 EPEC and 48 EHEC) and from healthy animals at the slaughterhouse (10 EPEC and 34 EHEC). The 191 bovine EPEC and EHEC isolated from diseased calves were positive <b>with</b> the <b>Eae</b> beta probe (55 and 27 % respectively) and <b>with</b> the <b>Eae</b> gamma probe (9 and 73 % respectively), whereas 52 EPEC (36 %) were negative <b>with</b> the <b>Eae</b> alpha, Eae beta, and Eae gamma probes. The results were different for the 44 bovine EPEC and EHEC isolated from healthy cattle at slaughterhouses: most tested positive <b>with</b> the <b>Eae</b> gamma probe (80 and 82 % respectively) and the remaining (20 and 18 % respectively) <b>with</b> the <b>Eae</b> beta probe. Nine O 26 human EHEC tested positive <b>with</b> the <b>Eae</b> beta probe and seven O 111 <b>with</b> the <b>Eae</b> gamma probe. The bovine and human EPEC and EHEC belonging to these two serogroups gave identical results: the 18 bovine and human O 26 isolates tested positive <b>with</b> the <b>Eae</b> beta probe, whereas the 13 O 111 isolates were positive <b>with</b> the <b>Eae</b> gamma probe. In contrast, the isolates belonging to other serogroups (O 5, O 15, O 18, O 20, and O 118) gave more variable results. The eae beta and eae gamma, but not the eae alpha, variants were thus distributed amongst bovine EPEC and EHEC. The eae beta variant {{seemed to be more}} frequently associated with the presence of clinical signs in calves, but one third of EPEC from diarrhoeic calves carried an eae gene variant other than the alpha, beta, or gamma variants. In addition, the use of these gene probes did not enable differentiation between bovine and human EHEC belonging to the same O serogroup. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Treaing {{constrained}} problems <b>with</b> <b>EAs</b> {{is a big}} challange to the field. Whether {{one considers}} constrained optmization problems or constraint satisfaction problems, {{the presence of a}} fitness function (penalty function) reflecting consraint violation is essential. The definition of such a penalty function has a great impact on the GA performance, and it is therefore very important to chose it properly. In this paper we show that ad hoc setting of penalties for constraint violations can be circumvented by using self-adaptivity. We illustrate the matter on a discrete CSP, the Zebra problem, and show that the penalties learned by the GA are to a big extent independent from the applied genetic operators {{as well as from the}} initial constraint weights. 1.

40|$|The Eae 2 locus on mouse {{chromosome}} 15 {{controls the}} development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE); however, {{in this study we}} show that it also controls collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). To find the smallest disease-controlling locus/loci within Eae 2, we have studied development of CIA in 676 mice from a partially advanced intercross. Eae 2 congenic mice were bred with mice congenic for the Eae 3 /Cia 5 locus on chromosome 3, previously shown to interact <b>with</b> <b>Eae</b> 2. To create a large number of genetic recombinations within the congenic fragments, the offspring were intercrossed, and the eight subsequent generations were analyzed for CIA. We found that Eae 2 consists of four Cia subloci (Cia 26, Cia 30, Cia 31, and Cia 32), of which two interacted with each other, conferring severe CIA. Genes within the other two loci independently interacted <b>with</b> genes in <b>Eae</b> 3 /Cia 5. Investigation of the CD 4 /CD 8 T cell ratio in mice from the partially advanced intercross shows that this trait is linked to one of the Eae 2 subloci through interactions <b>with</b> <b>Eae</b> 3 /Cia 5.

The cult of Ea extended throughout Babylonia and Assyria. We find temples and shrines erected in his honour, e.g. at Nippur, Girsu, Ur, Babylon, Sippar, and Nineveh, and the numerous epithets given to him, as well as the various forms under which the god appears, alike bear witness to the popularity which he enjoyed from the earliest to the latest period of Babylonian-Assyrian history.
