5|$|The family Pachycephalidae {{includes}} the <b>whistlers,</b> shrike-thrushes, shrike-tits, pitohuis and crested bellbird.|$|E
5|$|The <b>whistlers</b> and shrikethrushes are a {{large group}} of stocky passerines found in Australia and {{surrounding}} regions. Primarily insectivorous, larger species may also eat small vertebrates such as frogs or nestling birds. Most have drab plumage, the golden whistler a notable exception, and several are accomplished songsters. Three species are found in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} {{in favour of}} the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent Müllerian mimicry {{in some of the}} various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, <b>whistlers</b> and Australo-Papuan bellbirds. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared aposematic signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal is reinforced by the species' strong sour odor. There is also evidence that some other birds in New Guinea have evolved Batesian mimicry, where a non-toxic species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An example of this is the non-toxic juvenile greater melampitta, which has plumage similar to the hooded pitohui.|$|E

5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} {{was placed in}} the genus Pitohui with five other species, and the genus was thought to reside within the Australasian {{whistler}} family (Pachycephalidae). A 2008 examination of the genus, however, found it to be polyphyletic (meaning that the genus contained unrelated species), with some purported members of the genus not actually falling within the <b>whistlers.</b> The hooded pitohui and the closely related variable pitohui were both found {{to be related to the}} Old World orioles (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the hooded pitohui and variable pitohui were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the figbirds they formed a well defined basal clade within the family. As the variable pitohui was the type species for the genus Pitohui, the hooded pitohui was retained in that genus and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.|$|E
25|$|Birds that {{frequent}} this habitat include Golden <b>whistlers</b> (Pachycephala pectoralis), yellow-tailed black cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus funereus), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), eastern whipbirds (Psophodes olivaceus), New Holland honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris), rufous <b>whistlers</b> (Pachycephala rufiventris), willie wagtails (Rhipidura leucophrys), superb fairywrens (Malurus cyaneus), crimson rosellas/mountain lowry (Platycercus elegans), yellow-rumped thornbills (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa) and white-browed scrubwrens (Sericornis frontalis).|$|E

25|$|In 1839, the Whistlers' {{fortunes}} improved considerably when George Whistler {{received the}} appointment {{that would make}} his fortune and fame - that of chief engineer for the Boston & Albany Railroad. Thus, {{the family moved to}} Springfield, Massachusetts, then one of the United States' most prosperous cities, where they constructed a mansion in a posh district. (The Whistler Mansion, as it came to be known, stood at the corner of Chestnut and Edwards Streets in Springfield, where currently the Wood Museum of History stands.) The <b>Whistlers</b> lived in Springfield until they left the United States in late 1842.|$|E
25|$|The family Corvidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Over the years, much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives. What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world. Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse, but often Australasian groups. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida, based on DNA–DNA hybridization. The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs, birds of paradise, whipbirds, quail-thrushes, <b>whistlers,</b> monarch flycatchers and drongos, shrikes, vireos, and vangas, but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial. The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea, together with their closest relatives (the birds of paradise, Australian mud-nesters, and shrikes). They are also the core group of the Corvida, which includes the related groups, such as Old World orioles and vireos.|$|E
25|$|The true {{evolutionary}} affinities of the sittellas {{have long}} been clouded by their close resemblance to the Northern Hemisphere nuthatches. As late as 1967 the sittellas were retained in that family by some authorities, although doubts about that placement had been voiced in the previous decades. Both their climbing technique and overall morphology are extremely similar; however they differ both in their sociality and their nesting behaviour, as sittellas create nests on branches whereas nuthatches nest in cavities in trees. In addition {{the specifics of the}} morphology of the leg differed, with sittellas having leg muscles more {{similar to those of the}} honeyeaters. Their placement was then moved to various families, including the Old World babblers (an infamous wastebin taxon), the true treecreepers (Certhiidae, which range across the Holarctic and Africa) and the Australian treecreepers (Climacteridae). Their relationship with the Australian radiation of passerines was suggested by S.A. Parker on the basis of egg colour, nest structure and nestling plumage, and their position in this radiation was vindicated by Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA–DNA hybridization studies. These researchers placed the sittellas in a monotypic tribe within the superfamily Corvidae. Today they are afforded their own family in a clade close to the berrypeckers and longbills (Melanocharitidae) and the <b>whistlers</b> (Pachycephalidae).|$|E

500|$|The {{interactions}} and phenomena summarized in {{the subjects of}} radiative transfer and physical optics can result in shifts in the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation. In such cases, the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being by a transformation between reference frames. Such shifts can be from such physical phenomena as coherence effects or the scattering of electromagnetic radiation whether from charged elementary particles, from particulates, or from fluctuations of the index of refraction in a dielectric medium as occurs in the radio phenomenon of radio <b>whistlers.</b> While such phenomena are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "redshifts" [...] and [...] "blueshifts", in astrophysics light-matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as [...] "reddening" [...] rather than [...] "redshifting" [...] which, as a term, is normally reserved for the effects discussed above.|$|E
2500|$|Whistled {{languages}} use whistling {{to emulate}} speech and facilitate communication. A whistled {{language is a}} system of whistled communication which allows fluent <b>whistlers</b> to transmit and comprehend a potentially unlimited number of messages over long distances. Whistled languages are different in this respect from the restricted codes sometimes used by herders or animal trainers to transmit simple messages or instructions. [...] Generally, whistled languages emulate the tones or vowel formants of a natural spoken language, as well as aspects of its intonation and prosody, so that trained listeners who speak that language can understand the encoded message.|$|E
2500|$|Silbo on {{the island}} of La Gomera in the Canary Islands, based on Spanish, is one of the best-studied whistled languages. [...] The number of {{distinctive}} sounds or phonemes in this language is a matter of disagreement, varying according to the researcher from two to five vowels and four to nine consonants. [...] This variation may reflect differences in speakers' abilities {{as well as in the}} methods used to elicit contrasts. The work of Meyer [...] clarifies this debate by providing the first statistical analyses of production for various <b>whistlers</b> as well as psycholinguistic tests of vowel identification.|$|E
