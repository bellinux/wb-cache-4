5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Chinese kinship {{relations}} {{during the}} Han {{were influenced by}} Confucian mores and involved both immediate nuclear family and extended family members. The Chinese family was patrilineal, since a father's sons did not consider a mother's kin {{to be part of}} their clan; instead, they were considered 'outside relatives'. The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) law that any family with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes. This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period (220–265 CE). The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members, which was unlike the large extended families under one household in later dynasties. It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally, yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), a son who moved away and lived separately from his living parents would be considered a criminal. Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other's families. However, a household with three generations living under its roof <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> rare. This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty (265–420), when having three or more generations under one roof was commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> wealthy.|$|E

25|$|During this era, {{primarily}} Black {{churches were}} an important place for social organizing.

25|$|By the 1950s Banff's {{raw sewage}} {{began to be}} {{discharged}} into the Bow River. Because of the self-purification powers of the cold, braided water, however, the Bow <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> effective as a natural sewage-treatment facility.

25|$|The Portuguese Renaissance {{refers to}} the {{cultural}} and artistic movement in Portugal during the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. Though the movement coincided with the Spanish and Italian Renaissances, the Portuguese Renaissance was largely separate from other European Renaissances and instead <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> important in opening Europe to the unknown and bringing a more worldly view to those European Renaissances, as {{at the time the}} Portuguese Empire spanned the globe.|$|E

25|$|Toulouse wasn't easy prey though. The city <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> {{large and}} {{fortified}} for a medieval city. Not {{to mention the}} least, Raymond V was married to Louis VII's sister therefore attacking Toulouse would have endangered the policy of peace with the King of France. The County of Toulouse had also many heavily fortified areas like Carcassonne and its five sons: Queribus, Aguila, Termes, Peyrepertuse and Puylaurens and many more castles and fortified cities.|$|E
25|$|Lady Dasselrond also trained {{him to use}} {{the magic}} gemstones, being the only elf to possess a stone and have any {{knowledge}} with using them. No creature, man, or elf used the magic gemstones besides the Abellican Monks, who believed them to be holy stones from heaven. Aydrian's mother, Pony, <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> powerful with the gemstones, performing feats no other human alive could and only a handful in history would be capable of.|$|E

25|$|After dwindling ratings again, {{the show}} made its craziest decision. All {{the victims are}} brought back alive on the {{tropical}} Island of Melaswen (New Salem spelled backwards). The fired actors (James Reynolds, Suzanne Rogers, Matthew Ashford, Alexis Thorpe, Josh Taylor, Peggy McCay, Frances Reid, Thaao Penghlis and Deidre Hall) all returned to their original roles. There was also another twist, the killer wasn't Marlena. Stefano DiMera's nephew, Andre (posing as Tony DiMera) had kidnapped them and made Marlena think she was killing off her friends and family. The storyline <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> controversial, and garnered the soap a lot of press.|$|E
25|$|The site of Khorsabad was {{excavated}} 1928–1935 by American archaeologists {{from the}} Oriental Institute in Chicago. Work {{in the first}} season was led by Edward Chiera and concentrated on the palace area. A colossal bull estimated to weigh 40tons was uncovered outside the throne room. It was found split into three large fragments. The torso alone weighed about 20tons. This was shipped to Chicago. The preparation and shipment of the bull back to the Oriental Institute <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> arduous. The remaining seasons were led by Gordon Loud and Hamilton Darby. Their work examined {{one of the city}} gates, continued work at the palace, and excavated extensively at the palace's temple complex. Since Dur-Sharrukin was a single-period site that was evacuated in an orderly manner after the death of Sargon II, few individual objects were found. The primary discoveries from Khorsabad shed light on Assyrian art and architecture.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Meropis {{is neither a}} utopia nor a {{political}} allegory; it is a parody of Plato's Atlantis, {{in a similar vein}} to the True History which parodied Homer's Odyssey. Theopompos somewhat overstates many of Plato's aspects of the Atlantis myth. While it is an Egyptian priest who is telling Solon the story of Atlantis according to Plato's Timaeus, it is an Ipotane (a mythical half-man half-horse creature) who is telling the Meropis story to king Midas according to Theopompus Philippica. Although Atlantis <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> big by Plato's account, Theopompus describes Meropis as even bigger, to make it completely absurd. Also, while the invading Atlanteans were beaten by Athens due to its perfect society, the Méropes (Μέροπες)—attacking with an army of ten million soldiers—attempt to conquer Hyperborea, but return in disgrace after realizing that the Hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth and not worth looting.|$|E

25|$|The Type 1945 {{destroyer}} {{was designed}} in 1945, {{based upon the}} design of the Type 1936D and E destroyers, the plans for which were later accidentally destroyed by fire. Despite the fact that the chance of any project which started after 1942 actually reaching fruition <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> low, the Konstruktionsamt (Construction Department) continued to draft ship designs {{until the end of the}} war, on 8 May 1945, with the Type 1945 destroyer being the last of these designs to be created. They were designed to be able to defend against submarines, light naval forces, and aircraft, particularly torpedo bombers. Their design differed greatly from previous ones in that it utilized steam turbines, rather than diesel engines. Overall, their design gave them 12% higher engine performance despite having lighter machinery, and a more powerful main armament with a shorter hull. The project never made it past the drawing board, and no ship of the class was ever ordered or laid down.|$|E
25|$|June 2015 <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> hot {{and humid}} in Karachi, being 1.8°C warmer than an average June in the metropolis. Between 18 June and 23 June 2015, a severe {{heatwave}} struck the city; during these days, the maximum temperature remained {{in the range of}} 40°C to 45°C whereas the minimum temperature was between 30°C and 33°C. Due to humidity levels ranging between 40–50%, coupled with high temperature, the heat indices recorded in the city were above 50°C during these days. The highest temperature during this heatwave was 45°C (reached first time since 8 June 2000, when the temperature had soared to 45.5°C), recorded on 20 June 2015, while the minimum temperature on this day was 31°C. On 21 June 2015, the highest temperature was 43°C whereas the minimum was 33°C. The abnormal heat and humidity, coupled with government apathy towards the masses, claimed the lives of 1234 people in Karachi in one week.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s {{after graduating from}} Columbia University {{with a degree in}} history, Kellerman was hired as an analyst on ESPN's boxing series Friday Night Fights where he met future radio partner Brian Kenny. In November 2002 he was given his own show and, {{influenced}} by Pardon the Interruption, became the architect and original host of ESPN's Around the Horn. While the show <b>was</b> <b>incredibly</b> popular, Kellerman and ESPN could not reach an agreement for him to remain with the network, and Kellerman left the network in early 2004 to host a new show called I, Max on Fox Sports Net. He would discuss sports news with Michael Holley, former Around the Horn panelist, and Bill Wolff. Max took time off from the show after his brother's death (see below). He later returned, but despite his show garnering the network's highest ratings for a period of time, it was canceled by Fox. The last I, Max show aired on February 18, 2005. Max also was the co-host of Spike TV's 2006 series, King of Vegas.|$|E
