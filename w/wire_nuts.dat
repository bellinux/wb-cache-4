50|$|A {{terminal}} is {{a simple}} type of electrical connector that connects two or more wires to a single connection point. <b>Wire</b> <b>nuts</b> are another type of single point connector.|$|E
50|$|Twist-on {{connectors}} {{are also}} known as <b>wire</b> <b>nuts,</b> wire connectors, cone connectors, or thimble connectors. One trade name for such connectors, Marrette, {{is derived from the}} name of their inventor (see History).|$|E
50|$|Ideal {{was founded}} in 1916 by J. Walter Becker as the Ideal Commutator Dresser Company in Chicago, Illinois, {{manufacturing}} commutator dresser stones. In 1924, Becker relocated the company to its current location in Sycamore, Illinois. By 1949, it had become the United States' leading producer of <b>wire</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|E
50|$|All {{work is done}} {{according}} to a carefully sequenced schedule that incorporates the various trades involved, such as pipe-fitters, millwrights, mechanics, laborers, etc., and the necessary equipment (cranes, mobile equipment, air compressors, welding machines, scaffolding, etc.) and all supplies (spare parts, steel, pipe, <b>wiring,</b> <b>nuts</b> and bolts) and provisions for power in case power will also be off {{as part of the}} outage. Often one or more outside contractors perform some of the work, especially if new equipment is installed.|$|R
50|$|This {{common and}} simple splice {{is not very}} strong mechanically. It can be made {{stronger}} by coating it with solder, {{or it can be}} twisted and then held in place by the internal metal spring or threads of a twist-on wire connector, also called a <b>wire</b> <b>nut.</b> Because it is not very strong, the splice is not meant to connect wires that will be pulled or stressed. Rather, it is intended for wires that are protected inside an enclosure or junction box.|$|R
5000|$|Billet steels are {{rolled in}} Wire Rod Mill to {{fabricate}} wire rods which {{are commonly used}} for piano <b>wires,</b> bolts and <b>nuts,</b> steel cords, springs, and other applications.|$|R
50|$|Before {{point-to-point}} connection, electrical assemblies used screws or <b>wire</b> <b>nuts</b> to hold {{wires to}} an insulating wooden or ceramic board. The resulting devices were prone to fail from corroded contacts, or mechanical loosening of the connections. Early premium marine radios, especially from Marconi, sometimes used welded copper in the bus-bar circuits, {{but this was}} expensive.|$|E
50|$|However, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) {{currently}} only recommends two {{alternatives for}} a permanent repair using the pig-tailing method. The more extensively tested method uses special crimp-on connectors called COPALUM connectors. As of April 2011, the CPSC has also recognized miniature lug-type connectors called AlumiConn connectors. The CPSC considers the use of pigtails with <b>wire</b> <b>nuts</b> a temporary repair, and even as a temporary repair recommends special installation procedures, and notes that there can still be hazards with attempting the repairs.|$|E
50|$|Solid {{aluminum}} conductors {{were originally}} {{made in the}} 1960s from a utility grade aluminum alloy that had undesirable properties for a building wire, and were used with wiring devices intended for copper conductors. These practices were found to cause defective connections and potential fire hazards. In the early-1970s new aluminum wire made from one of several special alloys was introduced, and all devices — breakers, switches, receptacles, splice connectors, <b>wire</b> <b>nuts,</b> etc. — were specially designed for the purpose. These newer aluminum wires and special designs address problems with junctions between dissimilar metals, oxidation on metal surfaces and mechanical effects that occur as different metals expand at different rates with increases in temperature.|$|E

50|$|Metropolitan Stores {{were usually}} {{free-standing}} or located in strip malls or {{shopping malls and}} ranged in size between 20000 to 40000 sq ft. The stores carried household items (batteries, locks, screwdrivers, hammers, saws, wrenches, pliers, <b>wire</b> cutters, <b>nuts,</b> bolts, screws, shovels, pitchforks, hand spades, spades, rakes, watering hoses, sprinklers), sundries, seasonal products, clothing and footwear (men, women, children, infants), food and snacks, jewellery, stationery, crockery, beauty products, furniture, toys (namely dolls, doll clothing including dresses, sleep ware and accessories, model cars, miniature pick-up trucks, container trucks, wheels, rigs and doll play bags), vinyl records, electronics, creative products like needlecrafts, fabrics and Phentex yarn.|$|R
50|$|Sinclair's Micro Kit was formalised in an {{exercise}} book dated 19 June 1958 {{three weeks before}} his A-levels. Sinclair drew a radio circuit, Model Mark I, with a components list: cost per set 9/11 (49½p), plus coloured <b>wire</b> and solder, <b>nuts</b> and bolts, plus celluloid chassis (drilled) for nine shillings (45p). Also in the book are advertisement rates for Radio Constructor (9d (3¾p)/word, minimum 6/- (30p)) and Practical Wireless (5/6 (27½p) per line or part line).|$|R
50|$|When an oil {{metering}} unit was installed on a cabin pressurisation blower, locking wire {{was used to}} ensure the five securing nuts did not rotate and become loose. In the wreckage of number 2 cabin blower accident investigators found none of the nuts and no locking wire. The investigators believed that when the blower was last overhauled the oil {{metering unit}} may have been re-attached without locking <b>wire</b> securing the <b>nuts.</b> The blower was overhauled and then installed on VH-RMI in April 1966.|$|R
40|$|A {{fastening}} device is provided {{which is a}} variation on the conventional nut and bolt. The bolt has a longitudinal axis and threading helically affixed thereon along the longitudinal axis. A nut having a bore extending therethrough is provided. The bore of the nut has a greater diameter than the diameter of the bolt so the bolt can extend through the bore. An array of wire bristles are affixed within the bore so as to form a brush. The wire bristles extend inwardly from the bore and are constructed and arranged of the correct size, length and stiffness to guide the bolt within the bore and to restrain the bolt within the bore as required. A variety of applications of the <b>wire</b> brush <b>nut</b> are disclosed, including a bolt capture device and a test rig apparatus...|$|R

50|$|When {{the zero}} fret {{is viewed as}} an {{extension}} of the fingerboard by adding one more fret <b>wire</b> before the <b>nut,</b> then the luthier would fit a fret wire of identical dimensions. This will decrease the string action at the lower fret positions. To avoid this effect, luthiers often use a thicker fret wire at the zero fret position. While the straight and level zero fret improves the tuning accuracy along the lower frets (from fret 1 to 3 mainly) the elevated fret keeps the string action higher and helps to avoid string buzz.|$|R
5000|$|In rock climbing, a nut (or chock or chockstone) is a metal wedge {{threaded}} on a {{wire and}} is used for protection by wedging it into {{a crack in the}} rock. Quickdraws are clipped to the <b>nut</b> <b>wire</b> by the ascending climber and the rope threads through the quickdraw. Nuts {{come in a variety of}} sizes and styles, and several different brands are made by competing manufacturers. Most nuts are made of aluminum. Larger nuts may be threaded on Dyneema cord instead of wire, but this has become unusual.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is the construction of a reliable numerical model of the standard Ilizarov fixator that will permit a detailed parametric investigation of various factors influencing the effectiveness of the technique. Mechanical tests of a standard Ilizarov frame were performed under axial and torsional loads. To eliminate the pretension loss due to <b>wire</b> slippage metal <b>nuts</b> with M 1. 8 thread were manufactured. A numerical analysis followed based on the Finite Element Method. The model constructed simulated accurately all the geometrical details of the experimental model, the load application mode (axial and torsional) and the mechanical characteristics of the materials used to assemble the frame. Comparison of the predictions of the model with the respective experimental data yields excellent agreement for the case of tension and rather satisfactory one for torsion...|$|R
40|$|In the {{traditional}} {{music of the}} Shona in Zimbabwe we often encounter a musical instrument called mbira. Throughout the country, it occurs in various forms. Generally speaking, {{it is a small}} instrument which consists of number of flat and flared metal strips (lamellae) fastened to a wooden board with a rod secured behind the board with a <b>wire</b> or <b>nuts</b> and bolts. It is held in two hands and played by plucking the reeds by thumbs and index fingers. The present study primarily aims to introduce the Shona musical tradition and the instrument mbira in both organological and anthropological points of view. In my description, I particularly concentrate on the type mbira dzaVadzimu, which {{plays an important role in}} the Shona religious ceremonies. The analytical part of my thesis deals chiefly with the rhythmic-harmonic structure of mbira pieces.

Most dismissed {{the film as}} [...] "slapstick".Taran Adarsh of IndiaFM rated the film as 1.5 stars out of 5, and said, [...] "Director Kunal Vijaykar tries hard to keep you entertained, but the writing is just not captivating. Sure, you do laugh at a few jokes/situations, {{but there are times}} when the jokes aren’t too funny and also tend to get repetitive." [...] Anupama Chopra of NDTV gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, and stated, [...] "Vijaykar and his actors are straining too hard to make you laugh at jokes that are simply too flimsy for film. It’s exhausting more than entertaining. See it if you must." [...] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times Of India gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, and said, [...] "Neither fruity nor nutty, this film ends up as a total squish. After an unfruitful watch, you feel completely let down." [...] Kaveri Bamzai of India Today Group gave the film 1 star out of 5, and said, [...] "Unfortunately, the writers seem to have exhausted themselves thinking of the funny names and the interesting premise. There is nothing beyond it, except for two senseless item songs, one each for Irani and Mirza to stretch their legs." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, and stated, [...] "Despite juvenile jokes like peeing on open electric <b>wires,</b> Fruit & <b>Nut</b> is mercifully not the sort of vulgar comedy we’ve got used to seeing at the cinemas these days." ...|$|R
