50|$|A goal of agile {{software}} development {{is to focus}} more on producing working software and less on documentation. This is in contrast to <b>waterfall</b> <b>models</b> where the process is often highly controlled and minor changes to the system require significant revision of supporting documentation. However, this does not justify completely doing without any analysis or design at all. Failure to pay attention to design can cause a team to proceed rapidly at first but then to have significant rework required as they attempt to scale up the system. One of the key features of agile {{software development}} is that it is iterative. When done correctly design emerges as the system is developed and commonalities and opportunities for re-use are discovered.|$|R

50|$|The <b>waterfall</b> {{development}} <b>model</b> {{originates in}} the manufacturing and construction industries: highly structured physical environments in which after-the-fact changes are prohibitively costly, if not impossible.

30|$|In the seventies, Royce (1970) {{published}} an article which is considered {{as the basis for}} the waterfall-model. In his article Royce describes his personal views of managing large software developments and what is“necessary to transform a risky development process into one that will provide the desired product” ((Royce 1970), p. 335). His approach aims at reaching the condition of working software delivered on-time and within costs (Royce 1970). Royce proposes to use the <b>waterfall</b> <b>model’s</b> phases with an iterative relationship between successive phases. The process benefits by scoping down the development process to manageable limits (Royce 1970). He furthermore suggests using prototypes to get an early simulation of the final product. In addition, he presents first reflections about iterative development, feedback and adaption (Larman and Basili 2003; Royce 1970).|$|R
50|$|The <b>waterfall</b> <b>model</b> {{provides}} a structured approach; the model itself progresses linearly through discrete, easily understandable and explainable phases {{and thus is}} easy to understand; it also provides easily identifiable milestones in the development process.

50|$|The {{alternative}} to <b>waterfall</b> <b>models</b> are iterative models. This distinction was popularized by Barry Boehm {{in a very}} influential paper on his Spiral Model for iterative software development. With iterative models {{it is possible to}} do work in various stages of the model in parallel. So for example it is possible—and not seen as a source of error—to work on analysis, design, and even code all on the same day and to have issues from one stage impact issues from another. The emphasis on iterative models is that software development is a knowledge-intensive process and that things like analysis can't really be completely understood without understanding design issues, that coding issues can affect design, that testing can yield information about how the code or even the design should be modified, etc.|$|R
