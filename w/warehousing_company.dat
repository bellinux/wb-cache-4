2500|$|In a July 2013 article, David Kocieniewski, a {{journalist}} with The New York Times accused Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms of [...] "capitalizing on loosened federal regulations" [...] to manipulate [...] "a variety of commodities markets", particularly aluminum, citing [...] "financial records, regulatory documents {{and interviews with}} {{people involved in the}} activities." [...] After Goldman Sachs purchased aluminum <b>warehousing</b> <b>company</b> Metro International in 2010, the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans, home siding and other products—went from an average of 6 weeks to more than 16 months, [...] "according to industry records." [...] "Aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at Metro International after Goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since 2010." [...] The price increase has cost [...] "American consumers more than $5 billion" [...] from 2010 to 2013 according to former industry executives, analysts and consultants. The cause of this was alleged to be Goldman's ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of 27 Metro International warehouses Goldman owns in Detroit, Michigan. To avoid hoarding and price manipulation, the London Metal Exchange requires that [...] "at least 3,000 tons of that metal must be moved out each day". Goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories, but [...] "from one warehouse to another"—according to the Times.|$|E

Motivated by manufacturing and other logistics operations, {{in this paper we}} argue on the potential application of product intelligence in warehouse operations as an approach that can help <b>warehouse</b> <b>companies</b> address these issues. We discuss the opportunities of such an approach using a real example of a third-party-logistics <b>warehouse</b> <b>company</b> and we present the benefits it can bring in their warehouse management systems...|$|R
