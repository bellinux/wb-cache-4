Arguably Jackson's most angry, raw, emotional album, the new {{tracks on}} HIStory revealed a musician worn and torn {{by years of}} superstardom, now reportedly reacting against people who tried to bring him down. This reaction is <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> say ultimately stunted his previous skill at creating cutting edge musical trends, with Jon Pareles of The New York Times writing that [...] "It {{has been a long}} time since Michael Jackson was simply a performer. He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony". Some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a [...] "greatest hits" [...] collection, with Q magazine saying [...] "from the new songs' point of view, it's like taking your dad with you into a fight." [...] Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described [...] "This Time Around", [...] "Money" [...] and [...] "D.S." [...] as [...] "superb slices of organic funk that will fuel many of the summer's busiest dance floors".|$|E

500|$|Although {{several people}} {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} Mike Jeffrey had set Hendrix up {{in an effort to}} control him and create dependency, Shapiro and Glebbeek dispute this theory based on Jeffrey's severe risk of significant financial shortfall had Hendrix been convicted. Jeffrey's assistant, Trixie Sullivan, speculated that the drugs had been planted by a fan who became disgruntled after Hendrix refused his sexual advance. Both Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding later wrote in their autobiographies that the entire Hendrix entourage had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated that they believed the incident had been set up and that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag. According to author Ritchie Unterberger, although Hendrix [...] "took his fair share of drugs", the commonly accepted view is that he did not use heroin regularly and was not an addict; his drug use was typical of his peers, but not excessive. Mitchell wrote: [...] "Contrary to <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> have said, Jimi was never a junkie– that is he was never addicted to any drug, particularly heroin, which he tried once or twice but didn't like." ...|$|E

For a decade, <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> criticized as the former government's controversial and endless handing out of massive aid to North Korea, {{in the name of the}} [...] "National Coexistence, Independence," [...] failed to effectuate change in the North.

2500|$|Mather {{illustrates}} how the Goodwins' eldest {{child had been}} tempted by the devil and stolen linen from the washerwoman Goody Glover. Glover was characterized as a disagreeable old woman and described by her husband as a witch; {{this may have been}} why she was accused of casting spells on the Goodwin children. After the event, four out of six Goodwin children began to have strange fits, or <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> referred to as [...] "the disease of astonishment." [...] The manifestations attributed to the disease quickly became associated with witchcraft. Symptoms included neck and back pains, tongues being drawn from their throats, and loud random outcries; other symptoms included having no control over their bodies such as becoming limber, flapping their arms like birds, or trying to harm others as well as themselves. These symptoms would fuel the craze of 1692.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} many studies {{highlighting}} the development of language in twins compared to single-born children. These studies have converged {{on the notion that}} there is a greater rate of delay in language development in twins compared to their single-born counterparts. [...] The reasons for this phenomenon are still in question; however, cryptophasia was thought to be the major cause. [...] Idioglossia is defined as a private language that is usually invented by young children, specifically twins. Another term to describe <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> call [...] "twin talk" [...] is cryptophasia where a language is developed by twins that only they can understand. [...] The increased focused communication between two twins may isolate them from the social environment surrounding them. [...] Idioglossia {{has been found to be}} a rare occurrence and the attention of scientists has shifted away from this idea. [...] However, there are researchers and scientists that say cryptophasia or idioglossia is not a rare phenomenon. Current research is looking into the impacts of a richer social environment for these twins to stimulate their development of language.|$|E
