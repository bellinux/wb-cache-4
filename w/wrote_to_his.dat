5|$|Cantor {{retired in}} 1913, {{living in poverty}} and {{suffering}} from malnourishment during World War I. The public celebration of his 70th birthday was canceled because of the war. In June 1917, he entered a sanatorium {{for the last time}} and continually <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife asking to be allowed to go home. Georg Cantor had a fatal heart attack on January 6, 1918, in the sanatorium where he had spent {{the last year of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|He {{was thankful}} to be posted to the No. 1 School of Aerial Fighting at Ayr in Scotland, where he flew the {{excellent}} performing Sopwith Snipe. It was in Scotland {{that he learned}} {{of the death of}} his brother, apparently shot down by the German ace Hans Wolff on 19 March. He <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother's commanding officer, Sholto Douglas asking for any news but understanding the Major's attention was now fixed on the German Spring Offensive. His death depressed McCudden greatly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the battle, a state of {{confusion}} spread through the French troops. Governor de Vaudreuil, who later <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> government and put the full blame for the French rout on the deceased Montcalm, decided to abandon Quebec and the Beauport shore, ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually join up with Bougainville, leaving the garrison in Quebec under the command of Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay.|$|E

5|$|That fall, the fourteen-year-old Tatiana {{experienced}} {{her first}} brush with violence when she witnessed {{the assassination of}} the government minister Pyotr Stolypin during a performance at the Kiev Opera House. Tatiana and her older sister Olga had followed their father back to his opera box and witnessed the shooting. Her father later <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother, Dowager Empress Maria, on 10 September 1911, that the event had upset both girls. Tatiana sobbed and both of them had trouble sleeping that night.|$|E
5|$|That the {{practice}} of sewing murderers of their parents in sacks and throwing them in the water was still an active type of punishment at Cicero's time, {{at least on the}} provincial level, is made clear within a preserved letter Marcus <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own brother Quintus, who as governor in Asia Minor in the 50s BCE had, in fact, meted out that precise punishment to two locals in Smyrna, as Marcus observes.|$|E
5|$|The Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707, {{in which a}} fleet commanded by Sir Cloudesley Shovell foundered, highlighted mismanagement at the Admiralty, for which George was nominally responsible. Pressure grew to replace Admiral Churchill with someone more dynamic. By October 1708, five powerful politicians, known as the Whig Junto—Lords Somers, Halifax, Orford, Wharton and Sunderland—were clamouring {{for the removal of}} both Prince George and Churchill. Marlborough <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother telling him to resign, but Churchill refused, protected by Prince George.|$|E

5|$|A letter Hess <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife dated 4 November 1940 {{shows that}} in spite of not {{receiving}} a reply from Hamilton, he intended to proceed with his plan. He began training on the Messerschmitt Bf 110, a two-seater twin-engine aircraft, in October 1940 under instructor Wilhelm Stör, the chief test pilot at Messerschmitt. He continued to practice, including logging many cross-country flights, and found a specific aircraft that handled well—a Bf 110E-1/N—which was from then on held in reserve for his personal use. He asked for a radio compass, modifications to the oxygen delivery system, and large long-range fuel tanks to be installed on this plane, and these requests were granted by March 1941.|$|E
5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> fiance that they had not had butter in a week.|$|E
5|$|Amir's {{mother died}} in 1931, and his father the year after, meaning that his {{education}} {{could no longer be}} funded. After his AMS studies concluded, he wanted to continue to study at a law school in Batavia. As such, he <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother, Jakfar, who arranged for the remainder of his studies to be paid for by the Sultan. In 1932 Amir was able to return to Batavia and begin his legal studies, taking up a part-time job as a teacher. At first, his relationship with Sundari was continued through letters, though she soon continued her studies in Lembang, a city much closer than Surakarta; this allowed the two to meet furtively– when Sundari's parents had discovered their relationship, Amir and Sundari had been forbidden from meeting.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{left for}} the Eighth Crusade, led by Louis of France, in 1270, but Henry became {{increasingly}} ill; concerns about a fresh rebellion grew {{and the next year}} the King <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son asking him to return to England, but Edward did not turn back. Henry recovered slightly and announced his renewed intention to join the crusades himself, but he never regained his full health and on the evening of 16 November 1272, Henry died in Westminster, probably with Eleanor in attendance. He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, he <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan stuck to the plan and signed an oath {{that he had come}} with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E
5|$|Pinafore {{opened on}} 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique, before an {{enthusiastic}} audience, with Sullivan conducting. Soon, however, the piece suffered from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a heat wave {{that made the}} Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable. The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves {{in the summer of}} 1878 were short and transient. By mid-August, Sullivan <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother that cooler weather had arrived, which was good for the show. In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera's viability and posted closing notices. Carte publicised the piece by presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous Crystal Palace.|$|E

5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E
5|$|The nine-year-old Edward <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{father and}} {{stepmother}} on 10 January 1547 from Hertford thanking them {{for his new}} year's gift of their portraits from life. By 28 January 1547, Henry VIII was dead. Those close to the throne, led by Edward Seymour and William Paget, agreed to delay {{the announcement of the}} king's death until arrangements had been made for a smooth succession. Seymour and Sir Anthony Browne, the Master of the Horse, rode to collect Edward from Hertford and brought him to Enfield, where Lady Elizabeth was living. He and Elizabeth were then told of the death of their father and heard a reading of the will.|$|E
5|$|This {{was to be}} {{the last}} {{military}} engagement of Nansouty's long career. On 8 March, {{on the eve of the}} Battle of Laon, Nansouty was at Chavignon, nine kilometres from Laon, where the Emperor was also present and, although the circumstances of Nansouty's departure are unclear, it is certain that he left this village, and his command, that very day. Two days later, Napoleon <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> War Minister to inform him that General Nansouty's health did not allow him to exercise his military duties and that he was authorised to take sick leave in Paris. General Belliard had taken interim command of the Guard cavalry during the battle of Laon, with General Sébastiani subsequently given permanent command.|$|E
