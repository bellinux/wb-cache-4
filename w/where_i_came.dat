The film was about an average, popular Chinese-American {{teenager}} whose life is {{turned upside down}} by a visit from a young Chinese monk (Shin Koyamada). The monk claims she is the reincarnation of a powerful female warrior and {{the only person who}} can prevent an ancient evil spirit from destroying the world. In a second story line, Wendy and most of her family struggle with keeping their culture and heritage. Song felt she could relate to the message since she knew little about her own people before making the film. She said, [...] "I really identified with Wendy because I don't want to not know <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> from". To promote the film, she posed for the cover of Seventeen, Teen People, Teen, Seventeen Malaysia, and several other magazines, and traveled to Malaysia, Singapore, and Costa Rica. A Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior sequel, starring Song and Koyamada, was announced in the end of 2007.|$|E

Lithgow told an interviewer, [...] "I have had roles <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> very close to going over the top. In [...] I almost went over the top several times. But this role is completely over the top. It makes the role in Twilight Zone seem like a model of restraint. I do it in a wild, red fright wig and rotten false teeth with a thick Italian accent. It's wild." [...] For Lizardo's accent, Lithgow spent time with an Italian tailor at MGM and recorded his voice. He changed his walk to that of an [...] "old crab, and because my alien metabolism is supposed to be messed up". Lithgow said of his character, [...] "playing Lizardo felt like playing the madman in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari".|$|E

2500|$|In 1940, Lomax and {{his close}} friend Nicholas Ray {{went on to}} write and produce a fifteen-minute program, Back <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> <b>Came</b> From, which aired {{three nights a week}} on CBS and {{featured}} folk tales, proverbs, prose, and sermons, as well as songs, organized thematically. Its racially integrated cast included Burl Ives, Lead Belly, Josh White, Sonny Terry, and Brownie McGhee. In February 1941, Lomax spoke and gave a demonstration of his program along with talks by Nelson A. Rockefeller from the Pan American Union, {{and the president of the}} American Museum of Natural History, at a global conference in Mexico of a thousand broadcasters CBS had sponsored to launch its worldwide programming initiative. Mrs. Roosevelt invited Lomax to Hyde Park. But despite its success and high visibility, Back Where I Come From never picked up a commercial sponsor. The show ran for only twenty-one weeks before it was suddenly canceled in February, 1941. On hearing the news Woody Guthrie wrote Lomax from California, [...] "Too honest again, I suppose? Maybe not purty enough. O well, this country's a getting to where it can't hear its own voice. Someday the deal will change." [...] Lomax himself wrote that in all his work he had tried to capture [...] "the seemingly incoherent diversity of American folk song as an expression of its democratic, inter-racial, international character, as a function of its inchoate and turbulent many-sided development.|$|E

Although Lewis' first performance in the semi-final weeks, [...] "Somewhere Only We Know", was pure singing and inspired judges to make comments about his contemporary vibe, his signature performance on the show was probably [...] "You Give Love a Bad Name" [...] by Bon Jovi. Lewis incorporated a substantial beatboxing component, making the song sound significantly different from its original version. Jon Bon Jovi, the lead singer of the band who also coached the contestants that week, noted that Lewis' rendition was [...] "rolling the dice". All three judges acknowledged the huge risk of Lewis' arrangement, but also praised him for his originality including beatboxing. Randy Jackson {{believed that it was}} the most original performance ever on the show. Cowell even predicted that 50% of the audience [...] "would absolutely hate it" [...] but another half would love it.

JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E
