5|$|Most {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell.|$|E

25|$|In Biblical Hebrew, {{relative}} clauses {{were headed}} {{with the word}} asher, which could be either a relative pronoun or a relativizer. In later times, asher became interchangeable with the prefix she- (which is also used as a conjunction, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> English that), and in Modern Hebrew, this use of she- is much more common than asher, except in some formal, archaic, or poetic writing.

25|$|Recognition {{memory is}} {{sometimes}} {{divided into two}} functions by neuroscientists: familiarity and recollection. A strong sense of familiarity can occur without any recollection, for example in cases of deja vu. The temporal lobe, in particular the perirhinal cortex, responds differently to stimuli which feel novel than to things which feel familiar. Firing rates in the perirhinal cortex are connected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> familiarity in humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar. Specifically, stimulation at 30–40Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one; {{but it did not}} lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty. Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones — they examined both equally. Thus, other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity, but the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source.|$|E

Michael Toscano of Curator found that Miyazaki [...] "fears Japanese children are dimmed by a culture of overconsumption, overprotection, utilitarian education, careerism, techno-industrialism, and a secularism that is swallowing Japan’s native animism". Schellhase wrote that several of Miyazaki's works feature themes of love and romance, but felt that {{emphasis is placed on}} [...] "the way lonely and vulnerable individuals are integrated into relationships of mutual reliance and responsibility, which generally benefit everyone around them". He also found that many of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films present an idealized image of families, whereas others are dysfunctional. He felt that the non-biological family in Howl's Moving Castle (consisting of Howl, Sophie, Markl, the Witch of the Waste, and Heen) gives a message of hope: that those cast out by society can [...] "find a healthy place to belong".|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{and musical}} tone of protest songs varied with the {{circumstances}} {{they were written}} and composed in. The lyrics of [...] "Bring Him Back Home", for example mention Mandela [...] "walking {{hand in hand with}} Winnie Mandela," [...] then his wife. The melody used in the song is upbeat and anthem-like. It employs a series of trumpet riffs by Masekela, supported by grand series of chords. Music review website AllMusic describes the melody as [...] "filled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> camaraderie and celebration that are referred to in the lyrics. The vocal choir during the joyous chorus is extremely moving and life affirming". In contrast, the lyrics of [...] "Soweto Blues" [...] refer to the children's protests and the resulting massacre in the Soweto uprising. A review stated that the song had [...] "searingly righteous lyrics" [...] that [...] "cut to the bone." [...] Musically, the song has a background of mbaqanga guitar, bass, and multi-grooved percussion. Makeba uses this as a platform for vocals that are half-sung and half-spoken, similar to blues music.|$|E
500|$|Albrecht Altdorfer is {{regarded}} as one of the founders of Western landscape art. He was a painter, etcher, architect, and engraver, and the leader of the Danube school of German art. As evidenced by such paintings as Saint George and the Dragon (1510) and [...] (1531), much of Altdorfer's work is characterised by an attachment to sprawling landscapes that dwarf the figures within them; The Battle of Alexander at Issus epitomises this facet of his style. With reference to St George and the Dragon in particular, art historian Mark W. Roskill comments that [...] "The accessory material of landscape [...] is played with and ornamentally elaborated so that it reverberates <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a sequestered and inhospitable environment". Inspired by his travels around the Austrian Alps and the Danube River, Altdorfer painted a number of landscapes that contain no figures at all, including [...] (c. 1516) and [...] (c. 1522–25). These were the first [...] "pure" [...] landscapes since antiquity. Most of Altdorfer's landscapes were made with a vertical format, in contrast with the modern conception of the genre. The horizontal landscape was an innovation of Altdorfer's Flemish contemporary Joachim Patinir and his followers.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea that}} a certain power could be {{transferred}} {{from one to another}} was known before the arising of Buddhism. In religious texts such as the Mahābhārata, it is described that devas can transfer certain powers (...) [...] A similar belief existed with regard to the energy gained by performing austerities (...) [...] Apart from these transfers of power, a second origin is found in Brahamanical ancestor worship. In the period preceding the arising of Buddhism, it was believed that after a person's death he had to be transformed from a wandering preta to reach the blissful world of the pitṛs. This was done through the complex Śrāddha ceremonies, which would secure the destiny of the deceased as a pitṛ. In Buddhism, however, ancestor worship was discontinued, as it was believed that the dead would not reach heavenly bliss through rituals or worship, but only through the law of karma. Nevertheless, the practice of transfer of merit arose by using the ethical and psychological principles of karma and merit, and connect these <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> responsibility towards one's parents. This sense of responsibility was typical for pre-Buddhist practices of ancestor worship. As for the veneration of dead ancestors, this was replaced by veneration of the Sangha.|$|E
500|$|Skyfall {{received}} [...] "generally positive {{reviews from}} critics and fans", {{according to the}} GlobalPost. Rotten Tomatoes sampled 349 reviewers and judged 93% of the reviews to be positive, while the film scored 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 49 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". A number of critics, including Kate Muir, reviewing for The Times, Philip French, writing in The Observer, IGN's Daniel Krupa and the reviewers for the Irish Independent and the Daily Record, all asked whether Skyfall was the best Bond film produced. The Daily Telegraphs film reviewer, Robbie Collin, considered Skyfall to be [...] "often dazzling, always audacious", with excellent action sequences in a film that contained humour and emotion. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter thought that Skyfall was [...] "dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor", going {{on to say that}} it was a film that had [...] "some weight and complexity to it". Variety Peter DeBruge suggested that the film's greatest strength lay in its willingness to put as much focus on characterisation as it did action set-pieces, allowing the two to co-exist rather than compete for the audience's attention, while Manohla Dargis, reviewing for The New York Times, considered Skyfall to be [...] "a superior follow-up to Casino Royale" [...] which is [...] "opulent rather than outlandish and insistently, progressively low-key". Kim Newman, reviewing the film for Empire, concluded, [...] "Skyfall is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fun that hasn't always been evident lately". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, describing it as [...] "a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon". Reviewing for the New Statesman, Ryan Gilbey saw that [...] "nostalgia permeates the movie", going on to say that [...] "sometimes the old ways are the best".|$|E
