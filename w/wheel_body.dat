5000|$|Managers in {{the railway}} {{organisation}} had experienced these severe vibrations {{on a trip}} and asked to have the problem solved. In response engineers decided that to solve the problem, the suspension of ICE cars could be improved {{with the use of}} a rubber damping ring between the rail-contacting steel tyre and the steel <b>wheel</b> <b>body.</b> A similar design had been employed successfully in trams (known as resilient wheels), at significantly lower speeds. This new wheel, dubbed a [...] "wheel-tyre" [...] design, consisted of a <b>wheel</b> <b>body</b> surrounded by a 20 mm thick rubber damper and then a relatively thin metal tyre. The new design was not tested at high speed before it was made operational, but was successful at resolving the issue of vibration at cruising speeds.|$|E
50|$|The cold {{pressing}} {{method is to}} first press the working layer (containing diamonds) and the transitive layer (not containing diamonds) of the diamond segments to their forms directly on the grinding <b>wheel's</b> <b>body,</b> and let the segments connect with the <b>wheel's</b> <b>body</b> via teeth, slots or other manners. Then, put the grinding wheels into sintering furnaces to sinter without press.|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{results are}} {{presented}} on the manufacturing and application of CVD diamond grinding wheels for grinding of optical glass, cermet and alumina. Since bonded diamond grinding wheels are restricted concerning very fine grain sizes a new grinding layer technology is under development. A polycrystalline diamond layer with a high adhesion strength to the <b>wheel</b> <b>body</b> is deposited by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The sharp edges of the crystallites act as cutting edges for grinding. Crystallite protrusions of a few microns down to below one micron can be achieved easily with this technique. It was shown that by using CVD-diamond coated grinding wheels a high material removal rate and a high ground surface quality with surface roughness in the nanometer range can be achieved. The CVDdiamond layers have higher wear resistance compared to conventional metal and resin bonded diamond wheels. Moreover, it was demonstrated {{for the first time}} that a resharpening of worn CVD diamond layers is possible...|$|E
40|$|The {{tuco-tuco}} Ctenomys aff. knighti is a subterranean rodent which inhabits a {{semi-arid area}} in Northwestern Argentina. Although {{they live in}} underground burrows where environmental cycles are attenuated, they display robust, 24 h locomotor activity rhythms that are synchronized by light/dark cycles, both in laboratory and field conditions. The underground environment also poses energetic challenges (e. g. high-energy demands of digging, hypoxia, high humidity, low food availability) that have motivated thermoregulation studies in several subterranean rodent species. By using chronobiological protocols, the present work aims to contribute towards these studies by exploring day-night variations of thermoregulatory functions in tuco-tucos, starting with body temperature and its temporal relationship to locomotor activity. Animals showed daily, 24 h body temperature rhythms that persisted even in constant darkness and temperature, synchronizing to a daily light/dark cycle, with highest values occurring during darkness hours. The range of oscillation of body temperature was slightly lower than those reported for similar-sized and dark-active rodents. Most rhythmic parameters, such as period and phase, did not change upon removal of the running <b>wheel.</b> <b>Body</b> temperature and locomotor activity rhythms were robustly associated in time. The former persisted even after removal of the acute effects of intense activity on body temperature by a statistical method. Finally, regression gradients between body temperature and activity {{were higher in the}} beginning of the night, suggesting day-night variation in thermal conductance and hea...|$|E

30|$|With the {{development}} of intelligent transport systems (ITSs), Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) techniques are booming rapidly in recent years. IoV enables information sharing and gathering on vehicles, roads, and their surrounds. Building highly efficient and intelligent vehicles {{is very important for}} automobile industry [1, 2]. Vehicle sensing systems, which are important research topics in IoV, have attracted high attentions of many research institutions worldwide [3, 4]. Vehicles are equipped with hundreds of intelligent sensing devices, such as GPS-based sensors, video cameras, and other physical and chemical sensors, which are distributed over their chassis, powertrain, body, wheel areas, and so on [5]. Some sensors are independent, while others communicate with each other through wired or wireless networks, such as controller area network (CAN), Bluetooth, ZigBee, LowPan, etc. These sensing devices form a complex heterogeneous network inside the vehicle. They are capable of collecting, processing, storing, and transferring information from one node to another, and they perform a lot of tasks, including monitoring temperature, pressure, humidity, vehicular motion state, noise levels, and so on. Generally, new and pertinent information will be obtained by collecting and processing the raw sensor data. For example, three parameters including motion attitude, dynamic load, and braking performance can be obtained by utilizing data from acceleration sensors, temperature sensors, pressure sensors, and GPS-based sensors, which are embedded in the vehicle <b>wheel,</b> <b>body,</b> and suspension mechanism [6, 7]. In these cases, the collecting and processing tasks which request resources (e.g. communication resource, storage resource, etc.) must wait until they acquire all the requested resources. If the requested resources are held by other tasks, deadlocks may happen in the system, which will greatly influence the system reliability and real-time performance. Therefore, the deadlock problems must be taken into consideration in the design and development phases of vehicle sensing systems.|$|E
