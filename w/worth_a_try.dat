40|$|Conventional {{drill and}} blast {{tunnelling}} consists of mainly seven elements which together makes a cycle. This cycle includes drilling and blasting which are crucial factors in tunnelling projects, as these {{have a major}} influence on how the project will progress. After blasting there can be occurrences of under-break with so called bootholes in it and a re-blast is needed. This is expensive and time-consuming, and is therefore indefensible due to causing extra costs as well as a delay in the completion of the whole project. A solution for this problem is needed to avoid blasting second times. Due to laws regulating the allowed fracture zone in tunnel-blasting, contour blasting is performed. The reason behind why bootlegs emerges after blasting is still unknown and depends on many varied factors, such as geology, blast pattern and the volume of explosives used. Different tests are done while blasting, thereafter the results are evaluated and documented. Each test was tried three times to get as a most reliable result as possible. Among others the amount of explosives ranged, double detonators in poor rock sections and a new drill plan was made. The main theory behind this project was that the problem with bootlegs mainly depended om poor geological situations in the rock. None of the test however have been successful enough to solve the problem and after almost every blast there where bootholes in the remaining rock. Recommendations for further testing are using a less amount of explosives as this was a successful method in Björkdalsgruvan in northern Sweden. Another thing <b>worth</b> giving <b>a</b> <b>try</b> is to remove the “helping-row” because it seems like it is breaking the contour-row and not doing any difference...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of autologous blood pleurodesis in the management of persistent air leak in spontaneous pneumothorax. Patients and methods: A number of 15 patients (10 male and 5 female) were included in this prospective study between March 2005 and December 2009. The duration of the air leak exceeded 7 days in all patients. The application of blood pleurodesis was used as the last preoperative conservative method of treatment in 12 patients. One patient refused surgery and two were ineligible for operation due to their comorbidities. A blood sample of 50 ml was obtained from the patient's femoral vein and immediately introduced into the chest tube. Results: A success rate of 27 % was observed having the air leak sealed in 4 patients in less than 24 hours. Conclusion: Despite our disappointingly poor outcome, the authors believe that the procedure's safety, convenience and low cost establish it as <b>a</b> <b>worth</b> <b>trying</b> method of conservative treatment for patients with the aforementioned pathology for whom no other alternative than surgery would be a choice...|$|R

With a hint of an early Black Eyed Peas tone to some of their songs, this album offers its listeners a variety of solid beats, catchy lyrics, and an overall good feeling. The background beat of 'Headphones' holds a similar style of tune to No Doubt's [...] "Hey Baby" [...] - so if you’re a fan of the lovely Gwen Stefani, this is definitely <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> 'Lick Ya Down' rivals Rihanna for the radio-friendly sounds heard on her recent album, but that said, Cover Drive still have their own unique style, and this song is equally catchy, {{just like the rest of}} this album. With their front girl, Amanda being labeled the new Bajan Queen of the music scene, Rihanna is definitely going to have a little competition on her hands in the charts. 'Wrongside' is another standout tune and has a vibe similar to Shaggy’s 'It Wasn't Me' with the backing rhythm. While a lot of these songs do have a catchy beat, and could be considered similar, it’s safe to say there is still a lot of variety amongst the songs - from calmer, slow songs to upbeat songs that make you want to dance. Cover Drive are definitely some way from their pop peak on this, their first album, but there’s no doubt that this is going to set the bar high. It’ll be interesting to see what song they release next because they certainly have a good set to choose from." ...|$|E
5000|$|January 1942 came, however, and {{the trial}} did not take place. This was partly because of more momentous events. The United States had entered the war in December, the same month that the German armies had {{suffered}} a major setback on the Eastern Front before battling the Soviets near Moscow. In February the Riom Trial of Léon Blum and other French politicians was due to begin [...] - [...] Goebbels did not want two show trials at once. It was partly also because of further legal difficulties. It was feared that Grynszpan would challenge the legality of his deportation from France, which the Justice Ministry officials felt had been [...] "irregular". Most disturbing of all, however, was the revelation that Grynszpan would claim that he had shot vom Rath because he had had homosexual relations with him. This was communicated to Grimm, Diewerge, and other officials by Roland Freisler, later {{the head of the}} People's Court, but at this time State Secretary of the Justice Ministry, on 22 January. Apparently Grynszpan, having rejected the idea of using this line of defence when Moro-Giafferi had thought of it in 1938, had decided that it was <b>worth</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> He had told one of his Gestapo interrogators, Dr. Heinrich Jagusch, that he intended using this defence as long ago as mid-1941, but the Justice Ministry had not informed Goebbels, who was furious. He wrote in his diary: Grynszpan has invented the insolent argument that he had a homosexual relationship with... vom Rath. That is, of course, a shameless lie; however it is thought out very cleverly and would, if brought out {{in the course of a}} public trial, certainly become the main argument of enemy propaganda. [...] The Justice Ministry reacted to this claim by indicting Grynszpan under Paragraph 175, an act that infuriated Goebbels who argued that this additional indictment implied there was something to the claim of a homosexual relationship between Grynszpan and Rath.|$|E

It may be that he was right in supposing that the army, which had first found its power in the time of Ismail, would go from bad to worse.
