2500|$|The waste {{hierarchy}} {{refers to the}} [...] "3 Rs" [...] reduce, reuse and recycle, which classify waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of <b>waste</b> <b>minimisation.</b> The {{waste hierarchy}} remains the cornerstone of most <b>waste</b> <b>minimisation</b> strategies. The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste; see: resource recovery. The waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is for policy to take action first and prevent the generation of waste. The next step or preferred action {{is to reduce the}} generation of waste i.e. by re-use. The next is recycling which would include composting. Following this step is material recovery and waste-to-energy. Energy can be recovered from processes i.e. landfill and combustion, at this level of the hierarchy. The final action is disposal, in landfills or through incineration without energy recovery. This last step is the final resort for waste which has not been prevented, diverted or recovered. The waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management. The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.|$|E

This hierarchy sets out clearly the priorities for sustainable resource use and wastes management: {{it ought to be}} the guiding principle of private and public policy, with the emphasis placed strongly on reducing the amount of raw material used. The House of Commons Environment, Transport & Regional Affairs Committee has noted a pressing need to promote <b>wastes</b> <b>minimisation</b> within industrial and commercial sectors and has recommended the introduction of penalties and incentives to encourage industrial <b>wastes</b> <b>minimisation.</b> Despite this, in the food and retailing sector only around 25 per cent of companies were found to operate <b>wastes</b> <b>minimisation</b> programmes. This paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of <b>wastes</b> <b>minimisation,</b> in both financial and environmental terms, for the food and drink sector.

40|$|The paper {{intended}} to examine recycling initiatives {{of a group}} of UK retail centre in regards to the waste production and recycling initiatives over periods of two years. Method adopted in the study is the collection of primary data obtained from individual shopping centres throughout UK. Review of nine shopping centres merely represents the recycling trends of UK shopping centres, as few shopping centers have only just started their recycling programs. Findings of the study revealed that the sector did show an overall decreasing level of waste production, and <b>waste</b> <b>minimisations</b> were achieved through a variety of recycling initiatives. As a result, the more proficient approach to recycling, the better was the results. The paper also shows that shopping centre recycling does produce positive results. Although the effect of the landfill tax is uncertain but additional incentives and facilities management discipline to shopping centre recycling may be essential to drive the sector wide improvement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{increased}} <b>waste</b> {{management and}} <b>minimisation</b> developments have placed enormous {{pressure on the}} West Rand District Municipality (WRDM) considering the rapidly shrinking airspace of the 5 landfill sites, rapid economic and population growth, lack of proper separation facility, which have led to waste management challenges in 4 Local Municipalities (LMs) of the WRDM i. e., Randfontein, Mogale City, Merafong City and Westonaria. Other waste management challenges faced by WRDM include recycling that is mostly done by unregistered informal recyclers/scavengers, shortage of waste transportation services, illegal dumping, in appropriate final waste disposal, generation of greenhouse gases at landfill sites such as methane gases that contributes to air pollution/global warming and water pollution through leachate migration. However, these challenges {{can be turned into}} useful resources and opportunities if properly managed and can provide employment for WRDM personnel including the conversion of waste into energy through thermal combustion and bio-gasification...|$|R
40|$|Churchill Abattoir Pty Ltd (CA) is a beef {{abattoir}} and rendering {{facility that}} has operated for 43 {{years as a}} Government entity, {{and for the past}} 11 years as a private enterprise. Since the changeover, there have been significant improvements in CA’s environmental performance. In response to improving <b>waste</b> treatment and <b>minimisation,</b> CA has developed a novel covered anaerobic pond design for the treatment of abattoir waste water. This design consists of five smaller ponds arranged in a cell configuration which has been driven by a number of factors including, manageability (for desludging ponds) and ease of removing and applying covers. Industry design and management standards are based on generalized metrics for anaerobic ponds rather than industry specific data. To inform pond design an intensive study of pond behaviour will be performed on the covered anaerobic ponds. This paper gives an overview of the literature reported on the use of anaerobic ponds in the treatment of high strength waste water and outlines the monitoring approach that will be undertaken to assess the behaviour and performance of these novel anaerobic ponds. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} ongoing research which explores a need {{to foster}} different dialogues in design. It sets out the challenge for design in responding to increasing evidence of limits to growth: that is the boundaries of access to, and use of, Natural Capital (the Earth’s resources). Current design activities respond to resource limits through the concept of efficiency: <b>waste</b> / product <b>minimisation,</b> light-weighting, ease of assembly and disassembly; material labelling, resource cycling, reuse and reduction. However, designing more efficient products doesn’t prevent a net increase in environmental impact when products are bought, used and disposed of globally, at increasing rates. Recent projections suggest resource limits (oil for example) could be upon us {{in as little as}} ten years. Uniquely situated between the discourses of production and consumption, design may offer a creative response to limits to growth. This paper begins to explore how practically, design may inform different perspectives (broader than ecodesign) on resource use. It utilises a methodology focused on a flexible, questioning approach, engaging with experts in ecodesign and sustainable development through dialogue, to elicit their views on the key attributes of a sustainability narrative that can inform different design inputs and outputs...|$|R

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} global demand for materials has placed aluminium as the world’s second most used metal, with world annual production currently > 24 million tons. Consequently, the global alumina industry is perpetually striving to meet demands {{in conjunction with}} research, {{development and implementation of}} more efficient and sustainable processes and practises. Of specific concern for many proponents within the industry is that increased alumina production inadvertently results in increased Bayer Process-derived alkaline solid and liquid waste loads. Furthermore, in-house power generation at all Australian alumina refineries contributes to acid gas emissions, particularly SOx and NOx, both of which have environmental and anthropogenic impacts of global concern. The focus of this work is SO 2 emission. SOx emission control measures can be achieved before, during or after combustion; the latter is termed flue gas desulphurisation (FGD). Commercially available FGD systems are dominated by once-through wet processes whereby the flue gas passes up through an absorbtion tower. The most favourable medium for industrial use is seawater, followed by limestone, and in some cases, a combination of both. However, the ever-increasing stringency of environmental emission legislation continues to inflict tighter controls on power production and is forcing industry to investigate alternative cost-effective FGD mediums. Therefore much research is currently dedicated to the utilisation of high volume, alkaline waste streams over manufactured sorbents. Modern environmental engineering approaches to <b>waste</b> product <b>minimisation,</b> neutralisation and/or reuse have lead to many new processes which change the view of many materials from waste product to environmental resource. Subsequently, this work examines the application of an isolated Bayer Process waste product, tricalcium aluminate hexahydrate (TCA 6), as a FGD medium. Initial research assessed the dissolution behaviour and performance of the proposed medium with sulphuric acid, followed by batch reactor trials with a simulated flue gas. Data derived from this research indicated the suitability of TCA 6 as a FGD medium and was subsequently applied to a preliminary model and proposed design parameters required for further pilot scale investigations. This work provides strong support for an economically viable and more sustainable approach to FGD for the alumina industry...|$|R

The publisher's website is at: [URL] built environment consumes more natural resources than necessary and therefore generates a large amount of waste. A study by the World Resource Institute of material flows in a number of industrialised countries, showed that one half to three quarters of the annual material input to these societies was returned to the environment as waste within one year [1]. The international community started realising that resources are finite and that nature can no longer absorb the vast quantities of waste continually released to it. Achieving ‘zero waste’ will be a breakthrough strategy for a world in an environmental crisis, however, this is a highly challenging target in construction, but by involving and committing all stakeholders to reduce waste at source and developing efficient waste management strategies by reusing and recycling materials and components, can take the industry closer to the ‘zero waste’ vision, hence, moving from myth to reality. The aim of this chapter is to rethink construction waste management by re-engineering processes and practices to reduce construction waste at source. The chapter examines the concept of waste and definitions; discusses construction waste quantification and source evaluation; explores current thinking on construction waste research; and appraises the current construction <b>waste</b> management and <b>minimisation</b> status in the United Kingdom (UK) in terms of drivers and pressures for change, design and onsite practices, and challenges and enablers...|$|R
30|$|A lot {{has also}} {{been done in the}} {{transport}} sector in efforts to green the city of Harare. In Harare, commuter omnibuses (popularly referred to as kombis) have been blamed for traffic congestion and the city in an attempt to address this problem created a holding bay a kilometre from the city which is to hold the kombis currently driving into the city centre. This will be complemented by a mass transit system which will bring forth shuttle buses ferrying people into the city centre. They have also changed roads which used to be two way (R Mugabe, Chinhoyi street, Innez terrace and Leopold Takawira) into one ways to increase traffic flow. Also in a move to increase smooth flow of traffic they have installed ‘intelligent’ robots (King George and Baines avenue) which adjust time with differing traffic flows to ensure smooth traffic movement. With the aid of Old mutual a private company, the city of Harare has also constructed Harare drive as a ring road to limit traffic passing through the already congested city centre. Shopping centre like Westgate, Gleneagles and Avondale and office parks (Arundel Business Park, Mt Pleasant Business Park) have also been put in place to limit the pressure on the central business district. From the colonial days, industrial clustering has been used to improve the impact of green manufacturing practices in industry by enabling reduced energy and water consumption levels, solid <b>waste</b> and wastewater <b>minimisation</b> strategies and enabling increased participation in corporate social responsibility activities.

40|$|<b>Waste</b> {{management}} and <b>minimisation</b> {{is considered to}} be an important issue for achieving sustainability in the construction industry. Retrofit projects generate less waste than demolitions and new builds, but they possess unique features and require waste management approaches that are different to traditional new builds. With the increasing demand for more energy efficient and environmentally sustainable office spaces, the office building retrofit market is growing in capital cities around Australia {{with a high level of}} refurbishment needed for existing aging properties. Restricted site space and uncertain delivery process in these projects make it a major challenge to manage waste effectively. The labour-intensive nature of retrofit projects creates the need for the involvement of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as subcontractors in on-site works. SMEs are familiar with on-site waste generation but are not as actively motivated and engaged in waste management activities as the stakeholders in other construction projects in the industry. SMEs’ responsibilities for waste management in office building retrofit projects need to be identified and adapted to the work delivery processes and the waste management system supported by project stakeholders. The existing literature provides an understanding of how to manage construction waste that is already generated and how to increase the waste recovery rate for office building retrofit projects. However, previous research has not developed theories or practical solutions that can guide project stakeholders to understand the specific waste generation process and effectively plan for and manage waste in ongoing project works. No appropriate method has been established for the potential role and capability of SMEs to manage and minimise waste from their subcontracting works. This research probes into the characteristics of office building retrofit project delivery with the aim to develop specific tools to manage waste and incorporate SMEs in this process in an appropriate and effective way. Based on an extensive literature review, the research firstly developed a questionnaire survey to identify the critical factors of on-site waste generation in office building retrofit projects. Semi-structured interviews were then utilised to validate the critical waste factors and establish the interrelationships between the factors. The interviews served another important function of identifying the current problems of waste management in the industry and the performance of SMEs in this area. Interviewees’ opinions on remedies to the problems were also collected. On the foundation of the findings from the questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews, two waste planning and management strategies were identified for the dismantling phase and fit-out phase of office building retrofit projects, respectively. Two models were then established to organize SMEs’ waste management activities, including a work process-based integrated waste planning model for the dismantling phase and a system dynamics model for the fit-out phase. In order to apply the models in real practice, procedures were developed to guide SMEs’ work flow in on-site waste planning and management. In addition, a collaboration framework was established for SMEs and other project stakeholders for effective waste planning and management. Furthermore, an organisational engagement strategy was developed to improve SME waste management practices. Three case studies were conducted to validate and finalise the research deliverables. This research extends the current literature that mostly covers waste management plans in new build projects, by presenting the knowledge and understanding of addressing waste problems in retrofit projects. It provides practical tools and guidance for industry practitioners to effectively manage the waste generation processes in office building retrofit projects. It can also promote industry-level recognition of the role of SMEs and their performance in on-site waste management...|$|R
