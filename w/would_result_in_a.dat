5|$|The state {{forecast}} continued revenue {{declines in}} 2010 that <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> $1.7 billion budget shortfall {{if the state}} budget grew at its normal rate. Daniels submitted a two-year $27.5 billion spending plan to the General Assembly which <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> $500 million surplus {{that would be used}} to rebuild the state reserve funds to $1 billion. He proposed a wide range of budget austerity measures, including employee furloughing, spending reductions, freezing state hiring, freezing state employee wages, and a host of administrative changes for state agencies. The state had already been gradually reducing its workforce by similar freezes, and by 2011, Indiana had the fewest state employees per capita than any other state—a figure Daniels touted to say Indiana had the nation's smallest government.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} the University of California, Los Angeles {{estimated}} in 2007 that extending marriage rights to same-sex couples <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> net gain of approximately $3.2 million each year to the state budget. The study drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Maryland statistical reports. The gain is attributable to savings in expenditures on means-tested public benefit programs {{and an increase in}} sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton was {{selected}} for a second string Australian team to tour New Zealand for two months {{at the end of}} the season while the Test team departred for England. However, captain Victor Richardson and his deputy Keith Rigg withdrew, dissatisfied with the pay, leaving Fingleton as the most senior member of the team. The tour was then cancelled by New Zealand, who feared that the large number of absentees <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large financial loss.|$|E

50|$|As the U.S. {{income tax}} system {{at that time}} was highly progressive, the surtax was much higher on those with higher incomes, as a 10% surtax imposed on a tax rate of 20% <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> overall rate of 22%, while the same surtax imposed on a rate of 50% <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> overall rate of 55%.|$|R

5|$|Most of {{the mining}} {{companies}} {{felt that the}} expected recovery <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> labor shortage and challenge economic recovery. The government believed that if copper prices fell in the future, similar effects would be experienced. The colonial administration implemented two schemes to maintain the relationship of urban workers with their rural homelands. Health-service expenditures by rural relatives of urban workers were borne by the government, and the rural male migration of the working population was reduced.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2012, Puerto Rican Governor Luis Fortuño {{signed the}} project for a Legislative Reform that would {{reduce the number of}} legislators. According to Fortuño, this <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{decrease}} in the expenses associated with the operation of the Legislative Assembly. To achieve this, the constitution has to be amended, which would require a referendum to the people.|$|E
5|$|Originally, a toll {{was paid}} for each {{direction}} of travel with sets of toll booths on both carriageways. In 1997, the northbound toll was doubled (from 40p to 80p) and the southbound toll abolished on the presumption that almost all traffic makes a return journey across the bridge, and that {{the removal of the}} southbound toll <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reduction of congestion without reducing revenue.|$|E

On the basis of these studies, it was predicted that restoration of water flow in the Colorado river <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> this species, which <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase of species that depend on it for food, including commercially valuable crabs.|$|R

5|$|While Old Coast Road's dual {{carriageway}} was advancing north from Bunbury, and Kwinana Freeway was progressively being extended south from Perth, the alignment through Mandurah was constrained by existing development. Keeping the existing alignment <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> traffic bottleneck through Mandurah. To overcome this problem, Main Roads began {{planning for a}} new route east of the Peel Inlet in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes {{participated in the}} activity, and the abductees were both Khitan and Han. In some cases, this was {{a step in the}} {{courtship}} process, where the woman would agree to the abduction and the resulting sexual intercourse, and then the abductor and abductee would return to the woman's home to announce their intention to marry. This process was known as baimen (拜門). In other cases, the abduction would be non-consensual and <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rape.|$|E

5|$|As 91 {{votes are}} needed to elect the Governor from the 180-member body and Democrats and Progressives held 112 seats, it was {{considered}} unlikely that Milne would win. Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line with how their individual districts voted. Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to the results in their district, the vote <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 90–90 tie. Milne disagreed with this calculation and claimed voting according to district outcome would result in his winning 93–87.|$|E
5|$|Following post-storm surveys, it was {{determined}} that most of the severely damaged schools were built improperly and the upper-floors were not designed to bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be able to withstand up to 120kgf/m2 of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions to determine how to best rebuild structures in the country. With many of the destroyed structures being constructed from wood, reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings could last up to 50 years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> need for repairs within five years.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, battle {{was not necessary}} for either side; the main strategic theatre was mainland Greece itself. Although destroying the enemy navy <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clear strategic advantage for both sides, attempting this risked {{the loss of their}} own navy. The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their morale and confidence than on any strategic considerations. The Persians, seeing little to gain in battle, demoralised and riven with dissent, thus sought to avoid a naval battle. Conversely, the Allies, who had initially been as nervous of a battle as the Persians, sought to press home their morale advantage once they were informed {{of the state of the}} Persian fleet.|$|E

5|$|On {{the surface}} of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become {{compressed}} and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months. An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion.|$|E
5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E
5|$|The Platine War {{ended in}} 1852 with the Allied {{victory at the}} Battle of Caseros, for some time {{establishing}} Brazilian hegemony over much of South America. The war ushered a period {{of economic and political}} stability in the Empire of Brazil. With Rosas gone, Argentina began a political process which <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more unified state. However, the end of the Platine war did not completely resolve issues within the Platine region. Turmoil continued in subsequent years, with internal disputes among political factions in Uruguay, a long civil war in Argentina, and an emergent Paraguay asserting its claims. Two more major international wars (see:Paraguayan War) followed during the next two decades, sparked by territorial ambitions and conflicts over influence.|$|E

5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a massive companion brings many other possibilities. If Eta Carinae A was rapidly stripped of its outer layers, {{it might be a}} less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached. This <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> type Ib or type Ic supernova {{due to the lack of}} hydrogen and possibly helium. This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.|$|E
5|$|The smaller ghetto was {{liquidated}} in mid-October 1941, {{which left}} the larger one.

Gens was afraid that {{the actions of the}} Germans <b>would</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> widespread massacre. He persuaded the Gestapo to let the Jewish police round up the deportees. Gens, backed by the Jewish police force, was responsible for deciding who was to be sent for resettlement and execution. In October, this brought him into conflict with the ghetto's rabbis, who argued Gens was acting against Jewish law. Gens disagreed and considered it to be lawful to sacrifice some people to save others.|$|E
