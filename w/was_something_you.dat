I always thought motion capture <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> did when you were taking a specimen at the doctor.|$|E
500|$|The celebrity cook Clarissa Dickson Wright {{comments}} {{that the book}} was [...] "a {{breath of fresh air}} in the years of austerity that followed the Second World War, and [...] espousal of excellent, well-prepared ingredients has become the hallmark of English food at its best." [...] At that time [...] "food was dull, vegetables were [...] stewed and olive oil <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> bought at the chemist and was marked 'for external use only'." [...] David, on the other hand, [...] "evoked a world of sunshine and lavender, of bougainvillea and cannas, and of fresh and simple food beautifully prepared." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Silver Bells" [...] was {{composed}} by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans, introduced by Bob Hope and Marilyn Maxwell in the film, The Lemon Drop Kid and recorded by Bing Crosby and Carol Richards in 1952. The song {{was inspired by}} Salvation Army bellringers {{and is one of}} the very few songs about Christmas in the city. The song was originally called [...] "Tinkle Bell", but Livingston's wife reminded him that [...] "tinkle" [...] had another association. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> did in the bathroom," [...] Evans recalled years after the song's composition, [...] "but that's a woman's word and I'd never thought of it." [...] "Silver Bells" [...] ranks #13 on ASCAP's list of most-played holiday songs.|$|E

2500|$|Leyonhjelm {{wants the}} {{government-funded}} age pension payment {{to be viewed}} as welfare and not an entitlement for taxpayers once they reach a certain age, he told ABC News [...] "Taking the pension shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> aspire to, it should <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> try to avoid because it signifies you're in a low income group — in other words you're poor or you know, close to poor," ...|$|R

500|$|Whedon {{noted that}} the pod does not entirely {{take place in the}} Framework, and that the {{characters}} [...] "have their full memories of what happened" [...] once they return to the real world. Some, such as Fitz, struggle with their actions in the Framework. The producers felt the impact of the [...] "what if" [...] scenario comes from rooting the changes in character choices, with Bell saying, [...] "I will give the writers room credit that everything that was chosen had an emotional resonance. It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> hadn’t seen, or wanted to see or wondered about, so for us it was really rich territory to mine." [...] Whedon added, [...] "It wasn’t just, 'OK, let’s go Wacky World!' It was, 'What if you’d made different decisions?' That made it for us a much more fun puzzle." [...] Regarding the season finale and setting up the next season, Bell said that [...] "Each year we’ve tried to reinvent the series in some way ... I think the end [...] really does suggest something quite different." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hippies {{embraced the}} old slogan of free {{love of the}} radical social reformers of other eras; it was {{accordingly}} observed that [...] "Free love made the whole love, marriage, sex, baby package obsolete. Love was no longer limited to one person, you could love anyone you chose. In fact love <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> shared with everyone, not just your sex partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more you share, the more you get! So why reserve your love for a select few? This profound truth {{was one of the}} great hippie revelations." [...] Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors. Others explored the spiritual aspects of sex.|$|E
2500|$|Watts {{wanted to}} heavily pre-visualize the film, {{especially}} its action sequences, {{as he does}} on all his films. For Homecoming, Watts worked with a team to [...] "figure out the visual language for the action sequences and just ... you get to try stuff out before you’re actually on-set shooting it" [...] which helped Watts practice given his lack of experience working on large-scale action films. For the [...] "web-slinging" [...] sequences in the film, Watts wanted to avoid the big [...] "swoopy" [...] camera moves that had been previously used for such Spider-Man scenes and instead [...] "keep it all as grounded as possible. So, whether it was shooting with a drone camera or a helicopter or a cable-cam, or even just handheld, up on a roof chasing after him, I wanted it to feel like we were there with him, and everything <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> could actually film." ...|$|E

6000|$|She took it in, {{but only}} after a moment answered. [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> said just now you'd tell me. Don't you mean to try----?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You told {{me there}} <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> wished me to do, and, though it was difficult, it is done," [...] she said. [...] "My holding will be sown with wheat this spring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not sure. I'm {{trying to}} think," [...] he said, laying a lean, {{trembling}} hand on Weston's arm. [...] "Did you never {{feel that there}} <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> ought to recollect about a spot which you couldn't have seen before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In a moment, father. It's so {{fascinating}} to watch these country {{people with their}} baskets. Look! There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can't beat in New York, anyhow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit here, Richard," [...] she bade him. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> {{have not}} considered. If you die, if Mr. Wilding kills you..." [...] she paused.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> may care {{to look at}} while I'm gone. I don't know if {{you have}} read it? Widgery on Nisi Prius Evidence. Most interesting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't speak. At {{that moment}} {{they could have}} done just what they liked with me. And then the door opened very quietly and closed again. Jocelyn Thew came in. I saw Murchison's face. I tell you, Nora, it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't forget in a hurry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Scold me, dear," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, her {{delicate}} worn face flushing with delight. [...] "But I wish there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> could eat after your ride--instead of these scraps. Let Jocosa {{make you a}} cup of chocolate in your old way. You used to like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Cloke thought deeply. [...] "I'm sure I can't quite say, ma'am, but I've {{a belief}} likely that it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> may have let drop to young Iggulden when you was at Rocketts. That {{may have been}} what give us an inkling. An' so it came out, one thing in the way o' talk leading to another, and those American people at Veering Holler was very obligin' with news, I'm told, ma'am." ...|$|E

500|$|Phil Hall of Film Threat {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "An Inconvenient Truth <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> rarely see in movies today: a blatant intellectual fraud." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her for a moment. [...] "That will not be necessary," [...] he said. [...] "But there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can do. Have you a pistol?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, not that! It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> have no {{conception}} of. It was an odious performance. Imagine, {{he raised}} his hat to begin with. He made his voice soft and deprecatory. 'Ah! you are not kind to us--you will not deign to remember....' This sort of phrases, that sort of tone. The poor creature was terribly upset. Her eyes ran full of tears. She {{did not know where}} to look. I shouldn't wonder if she would have preferred abuse, or even a blow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{instinct}} {{was not at}} fault, Fan," [...] {{she said in a}} caressing tone. [...] "I do love you, and loved you when I saw you in your rags, and it pained my heart when I told you to clean my doorsteps as if you had been my sister. No, not a sister, but something better and sweeter; my sisters I do not love at all. And do you know now what I meant, Fan, when I said that there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> could do for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How lonesome the sea {{at night}} always is," [...] said Sally. [...] "I declare, Mara, I don't wonder you miss that creature, for, {{to tell the}} truth, I do a little bit. It <b>was</b> <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> know, to have {{somebody}} to come in, and to joke with, and to say how he liked one's hair and one's ribbons, and all that. I quite got up a friendship for Moses, so that I can feel how dull you must be;" [...] and Sally gave a half sigh, and then whistled a tune as adroitly as a blackbird.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there must}} <b>be</b> <b>something.</b> <b>You</b> {{have given me}} no {{chance to talk to}} you, and I wanted to know if you'd let me speak to Father Naab." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eugène," [...] she expostulated, [...] "we are too {{old friends}} to talk always in veiled phrases. There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> {{have to say}} to me. I am listening." ...|$|R
5000|$|The J.P. Wiser's {{brand is}} advertised with {{a quote from}} J.P. Wiser, saying [...] "Quality <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> just can't rush. Horses should hurry, but whisky must take its time." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was perhaps}} {{inevitable}} from Ferris's Protestant association of monks and convents and penances chiefly with {{the machinery of}} fiction, that all this affected him as unreally as talk in a stage-play. His heart was cold, as he answered: [...] "I am glad that your mind is at rest concerning the doubts which so long troubled you. Not all men are so easily pacified; but, as you say, it is the privilege of your church to work miracles. As to Miss Vervain, I am sorry that I cannot promise to give her your message. I shall never see her again. Excuse me," [...] he continued, [...] "but your servant said there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> wished to say that concerned me?" ...|$|E
60|$|He had {{least of}} his native grace, I think, in his criticism; and yet as a critic he had qualities of rare temperance, acuteness, and knowledge. He had very decided {{convictions}} in literary art; one kind of thing he believed was good and all other kinds less good down to what was bad; {{but he was not}} a bigot, and he made allowances for art-in-error. His hand fell heavy only upon those heretics who not merely denied the faith but pretended that artifice was better than nature, that decoration was more than structure, that make-believe <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> could live by as you live by truth. He was not strongest, however, in damnatory criticism. His spirit was too large, too generous to dwell in that, and it rose rather to its full height in his appreciations of the great authors whom he loved, and whom he commented from the plenitude of his scholarship as well as from his delighted sense of their grandeur. Here he was almost as fine as in his poetry, and only less fine than in his more fortunate essays in fiction.|$|E
6000|$|Once in {{his walk}} {{he found himself}} the {{companion}} of Burnamy's employer, whom he had sometimes noted in {{the line at the}} Muhlbrunn, waiting his turn, cup in hand, with a face of sullen impatience. Stoller explained that though you could have the water brought to you at your hotel, he chose to go to the spring {{for the sake of the}} air; it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> had got to live through; before he had that young Burnamy to help him he did not know what to do with his time, but now, every minute he was not eating or sleeping he was working; his cure did not oblige him to walk much. He examined March, with a certain mixture of respect and contempt, upon the nature of the literary life, and how it differed from the life of a journalist. He asked if he thought Burnamy would amount to anything as a literary man; he so far assented to March's faith in him as to say, [...] "He's smart." [...] He told of leaving his daughters in school at Wurzburg; and upon the whole he moved March with a sense of his pathetic loneliness without moving his liking, as he passed lumberingly on, dangling his cup.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{have seen}} Wetzel fight Indians <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{not likely to}} forget," [...] said Colonel Zane grimly. [...] "Now, tell me, how did those Indians wear their scalp-lock?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will do it}} gladly, Terence; faith, it is {{a comfort}} to find that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can't do." [...] And so, with much {{laughter}} and fun, the meal was eaten.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Daniel Boys {{recorded}} a charity single called 'The World <b>is</b> <b>Something</b> <b>You</b> Can Imagine'. It was also released as with proceeds {{going to the}} Disney Appeal at Great Ormond Street Hospital.|$|R
