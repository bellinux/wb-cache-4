40|$|Many new neutrinoless double {{beta decay}} (0 <b>nbb)</b> {{experiments}} <b>are</b> planned <b>or</b> in preparation. If the 0 nbb-decay will be detected, {{the key issue}} will be what is the dominant mechanism of this process. By measuring only transitions to the ground state one can not distinguish among many of the 0 nbb-decay mechanisms (the light and heavy Majorana neutrino exchange mechanisms, the trilinear R-parity breaking mechanisms etc.). We show that if {{the ratio of the}} 0 nbb-decay half-lifes for transitions to the 0 ^+ first excited and ground states is determined both theoretically and experimentally, {{it might be possible to}} determine, which 0 nbb-decay mechanisms is dominant. For that purpose the corresponding nuclear matrix elements have to be evaluated with high reliability. The present work is giving strong motivations for experimental studies of the 0 nbb-decay transitions to the first excited 0 ^+ states of the final nuclei.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{desirable}} to facilitate data communications among concurrent computation threads without incurring non-essential synchronizations in real-time computing systems. An interaction mechanism, called the non-blocking writer (NBW) mechanism and invented by Kopetz, {{is useful in}} facilitating state message communication from a producer to a consumer thread in real-time applications. A more widely applicable practical interaction mechanism called the non-blocking buffer (<b>NBB)</b> <b>is</b> presented here. The <b>NBB</b> mechanism can <b>be</b> viewed as a significant extension of the NBW mechanism. The NBB mechanism facilitates communication of event messages from a producer to a consumer without causing any party to experience blocking. Therefore, its application scope includes all conceivable producer-consumer situations. The <b>NBB</b> mechanism <b>is</b> not a replacement of but rather a companion to the NBW mechanism since the latter facilitates the most efficient state message communication. The application of NBBs in building middleware supporting real-time objects is discussed as {{a demonstration of the}} utility of the NBB mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The thesis work {{aimed to}} find {{appropriate}} syntheses {{procedures for the}} preparation of Nano Building Blocks (NBB) and Nano Particles (NP), starting from organo silanes as molecular precursors, using the Sol-Gel method. <b>NBB</b> <b>were</b> obtained by either non-hydrolytic or in situ water production (ISWP) route, depending on the reactive function’s loading. The obtained <b>NBB</b> <b>were</b> characterised by means of FT-IR, ATR/FT-IR, RAMAN, multinuclear NMR spectroscopies, SEM, N 2 physisorption, Thermal analyses (TG/DTA), DSC. <b>NBBs</b> <b>were</b> used to prepare methacrylate-based matrices, which were subsequently exploited {{in order to produce}} patternable films by the two photon polymerisation technique (TPP). Epoxy-based matrices were also prepared and the films obtained were patterned by the UV photolithography technique. Both techniques gave high surface resolution patterning. NP were obtained with a modified Stöber method and organosilica NP were obtained. The NP were characterised by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopies. Morphology was observed and sizes calculated using SEM; N 2 - physisorption and thermal analyses (TG/DTA) were also carried out in order to complete the characterization. DSC measurements were performed on methacryloxypropyl-functionalised NP in order to control the ability to polymerise of the particles. Films of the different organic-modified NP were obtained by spin coating and contact angle measurements were performed. FE-SEM was used in order to observe an eventual change in morphology after thermal treatment under reduced atmosphere. The ability to retain the shape depends on the functional group on the NP. Finally a preliminary study on dye doping was accomplished. The NP were efficiently doped with a fluorescent dye: Rhodamine 6 G (R 6 G). Absorption and emission spectra were recorded with a spectrofluorometer. It is observable that the emission spectra is influenced by the NP’s matrix...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The New Baltic Barometer (<b>NBB)</b> <b>was</b> launched in 1993 to reflect opinions in three multi-ethnic societies, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, incorporated into the Soviet Union {{as a consequence of}} the Second World War. There <b>were</b> six <b>NBB</b> surveys conducted from 1993 to 2004, with many questions repeated to show trends. From 2001, the <b>NBB</b> <b>was</b> merged with the New Democracies Barometer to form New Europe Barometer (available from the UK Data Archive under GN 33355). Therefore the last two <b>NBB</b> surveys <b>are</b> available under SN 5242 and SN 5243 which are part of the New Europe Barometer series. Whereas political rhetoric often describes all people of a given nationality as thinking alike, election results show differences of opinion. The NBB documents differences within every nationality in the region along lines of age, education, economic circumstances and gender. Differences within each nationality may be paralleled by similarities between nationalities. Comparisons with the Russians in Russia can be made through the New Russia Barometer (available at the Archive under GN 33374) survey. Further information about the <b>NBB</b> survey series <b>is</b> available on the Baltic Voices web site. Additional information about all the Barometer survey series managed by the CSPP can be found on the CSPP Barometer Surveys web site. New Baltic Barometer I, 1993 is the first study in the series. The survey was the largest systematic comparative social science study ever undertaken in the region. The questionnaire collected a large amount of data about language, identity and political demands of special relevance in the multi-national Baltic states. It also collected large amounts of information about household economic conditions, economic evaluations and expectations, attitudes toward the old Soviet system and hopes for the future, and social and demographic data. Main Topics : The questionnaire covered the following topics: attitudes to business and welfare production and consumption economic evaluations and aspirations attitudes to government collective identities social characteristics </ul...|$|R

50|$|<b>NBB</b> <b>was</b> {{founded in}} 1992 by state soybean {{commodity}} groups. Originally {{known as the}} National Soy Diesel Development Board, it was created by farmers who saw a real potential for biodiesel made from soybean oil. (Soybean oil is a byproduct of harvesting and processing soybeans for protein, for both human and animal consumption.) The commodity groups funded important biodiesel research and development programs focusing on soybean oil as the primary feedstock source for biodiesel. Feedstock is whatever the main ingredient of a biodiesel is. While the majority of today's biodiesel is still made from soybean oil, over the years, new feedstocks have emerged.|$|R

40|$|Transition metal {{silicides}} {{are being}} considered for future engine turbine components at temperatures up to 1600 C. Although significant improvement in high temperature strength, room temperature fracture toughness has been realized in the past decade, further improvement in oxidation resistance is needed. Oxidation mechanism of Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 }-based alloys was investigated. Oxidation behavior of Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 }-based alloy strongly depends on the atmosphere. Presence of Nitrogen alters the oxidation behavior of Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 } by nucleation and growth of nitride subscale. Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3. 2 } and Ti{sub 5 }Si{sub 3 }C{sub 0. 5 } alloys exhibited an excellent oxidation resistance in nitrogen bearing atmosphere due to limited dissolution of nitrogen and increased Si/Ti activity ratio. MoSi{sub 2 } coating developed by pack cementation to protect Mo-based Mo-Si-B composites {{was found to be}} effective up to 1500 C. Shifting coating composition to T 1 +T 2 +Mo{sub 3 }Si region showed the possibility to extend the coating lifetime above 1500 C by more than ten times via formation of slow growing Mo{sub 3 }Si or T 2 interlayer without sacrificing the oxidation resistance of the coating. The phase equilibria in the Nb-rich portion of Nb-B system has been evaluated experimentally using metallographic analysis and differential thermal analyzer (DTA).
