5|$|Albany {{is one of}} {{the first}} cities in the world to have {{installed}} public <b>water</b> <b>mains,</b> sewer lines, natural gas lines and electricity, infrastructure and utilities that attracted and supported substantial new industry to the city and surrounding area during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Industrialist Charles M. Schwab {{bought the}} Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1906 and {{invested}} heavily in infrastructure, including piped water, electric lines and railroad transportation, that served the town {{as well as the}} mine. By 1907, Rhyolite had electric lights, <b>water</b> <b>mains,</b> telephones, newspapers, a hospital, a school, an opera house, and a stock exchange. Published estimates of the town's peak population vary widely, but scholarly sources generally place it in a range between 3,500 and 5,000 in 1907–08.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rainfall}} is low, Sismiut has abundant natural {{supplies of}} fresh, drinkable surface water, collected from a reservoir under Alanngorsuaq. Water is also pumped to the waterworks from another lake around 2.5 kilometers {{away in the}} mountains. The <b>water</b> <b>mains</b> are preinsulated and electrically heated to supply the residents during the winter months. The water supply network is capable of producing some 882,000 cubic meters of water per year; two water-supplying lakes by the town have a combined annual minimum capacity of more than 7.2 million cubic meters.|$|E

50|$|After {{the second}} World War the club slowly {{developed}} though funds and resources were scarce. The {{skills of the}} Club members were {{put to good use}} in improving the ground and pavilion facilities. A small wooden pavilion with no electricity, <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> or <b>mains</b> drainage progressed to a purpose-built brick pavilion.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 British Telecom {{threatened}} {{to withdraw the}} service from the one telephone box. June 2017, the phone has been removed and the community is looking to keep the phone box for its heritage value. Mobile phone reception in Kilmory is very poor as is the terrestrial television signal. There are neither <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> nor <b>mains</b> drains in Kilmory.Kilmory school closed in 1962 and the sub post office was closed in 2004.|$|R
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the earthquake, {{multiple}} phone lines were down, and scattered power outages affected about 54,000 households. Moreover, at least 70 underground 11,000 volt cables sustained some degree of damage, contributing to the outages. The shaking ruptured local <b>water</b> <b>mains,</b> resulting in widespread flooding that affected several streets. Furthermore, officials ordered the closure of bridges in the area as a precautionary measure; one bridge was reported to have succumbed to the strong ground motions. Days after its occurrence, a small electrical fire ignited in a control panel at Christchurch Hospital due to dislodged wiring as a result of ongoing aftershocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{miniature}} city project involved {{students from}} eighteen Springfield public high schools. The students, who were learning construction and handicraft, built {{the city of}} about 1,200 structures {{under the supervision of}} their teachers. It consisted of 1,000 miniature houses, in several neighborhoods, and 200 other structures. The miniature buildings and houses were built according to standard construction plans, and lumber and building-materials companies donated items for the project. The buildings and homes were landscaped with real grass. Their interiors were furnished and decorated like a full-sized house or building. The buildings were scaled at one-half inch to the foot. Tiny Town, with <b>water</b> <b>mains</b> and electric lights, was laid out on streets like a real city.|$|E
5|$|The third {{mission was}} begun in 1998. It was a {{search and rescue}} mission {{requiring}} fully autonomous robots to take off, fly to a disaster area and search for survivors and the dead amid raging fires, broken <b>water</b> <b>mains,</b> clouds of toxic gas, and rubble from destroyed buildings. The scenario was recreated at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility where the above hazards could be recreated. Because of the realism of the scenario, animatrons were used instead of human actors to simulate survivors incapable of extracting themselves from the disaster area.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY252 in Henrietta between Marketplace Drive and Ridgeland Road was widened {{from four to}} six lanes {{as part of a}} multi-year, $15.6million project that began in mid-2009. Phase one of the five-phase project, {{completed}} {{during the second half of}} 2009, involved the relocation of utility poles and <b>water</b> <b>mains.</b> The next four phases involved the actual widening of the highway. During phase two, all traffic on Jefferson Road was routed along the eastbound lanes while the westbound half of the road was reconstructed and widened; this was reversed during phase three. A raised median between the two directions, which prohibited left-hand turns at all points except signalized intersections, was constructed during phase four, and phase five covered the finishing touches of the project. As part of the project, the intersection between Jefferson Road and East Henrietta Road (NY15A) was widened to have two dedicated left turn lanes in all four directions. Work on the last four phases began on March29, 2010, and was expected to be fully completed in November 2011. Construction did get completed in November 2011, but at the cost of $16.5million (2012USD) instead of the original $15.6million.|$|E

50|$|The parish council, was {{concerned}} with the insanitary drainage system for the village, but rejected a <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> supply in 1931 as too expensive. Electricity was provided in 1947 but <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> was not supplied until the 1950s. Sewerage remained a serious problem in the 1970s and mains drainage was not provided until 1992.|$|R
50|$|The {{village has}} no <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> supply, instead water is {{supplied}} from a borehole.|$|R

50|$|The {{institute}} was {{dissolved in}} 1866. Having previously used wells in the courtyard, the homes were finally supplied with <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> in 1900.|$|R
25|$|Fire {{fighting}} {{services are}} provided in most developed areas to extinguish or contain uncontrolled fires. Trained firefighters use fire apparatus, water supply resources such as <b>water</b> <b>mains</b> and fire hydrants or they might use A and B class foam depending on what is feeding the fire.|$|E
25|$|Plumbers use {{equipment}} that forces pressurised liquid CO2 into a jacket around a pipe. The dry ice formed causes {{the water to}} freeze, forming an ice plug, allowing them to perform repairs without turning off the <b>water</b> <b>mains.</b> This technique {{can be used on}} pipes up to 4inches (100mm) in diameter.|$|E
25|$|The {{earthquake}} did {{not cause}} major structural damage to the hotel, but it did begin a series of fires along the waterfront which began to sweep west across the city. It also broke the <b>water</b> <b>mains,</b> so firemen were unable to fight the fires. An hour after midnight the fire reached Union Square and gutted the hotel.|$|E

25|$|In Australia, {{there are}} no {{quantitative}} performance targets for rainwater tanks, such as size of tank or targeted reductions in potable water demand, in policies or guidelines. The various guidelines provided by state governments however, do advise that rain water tanks be {{designed to provide a}} reliable source of <b>water</b> to supplement <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> supply, and maintain appropriate water quality. The use of rainwater tanks should consider issues such as supply and demand, water quality, stormwater benefits (volume is reduced), cost, available space, maintenance, size, shape and material of the tank. Rainwater tanks must also be installed in accordance with plumbing and drainage standards. An advised suitable configuration may include a water filter or first flush diversion, a <b>mains</b> <b>water</b> top-up supply (dual supply system), maintenance drain, a pump (pressure system), and an on-site retention provision.|$|R
