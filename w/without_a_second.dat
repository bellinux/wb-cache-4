5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{included}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight {{that was about to}} come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> unit. However, he was pleased with the final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E
5|$|The Radiation Laboratory {{forwarded}} {{the preliminary}} designs for a production plant to Stone & Webster {{before the end}} of the year, but one important issue remained unsettled. Oppenheimer contended that weapons-grade uranium would have to be 90% pure uranium-235. Edward Lofgren and Martin Kamen thought that this could not be achieved <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> stage of enrichment. The two stages became known as Alpha and Beta. In March 1943, Groves approved the construction of five Alpha and two Beta racetracks. In September, he authorized four more Alpha racetracks, which became known as Alpha II, along with two more Beta racetracks to process their product.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations {{over the}} Security Council {{resolution}} were initially contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a draft resolution that included automatic invocation of Chapter VII, sanctioning {{use of military}} force if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement. Russia and China were opposed to any resolution that authorized enforcement under Chapter VII <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> vote of the Security Council. After further negotiations, on 26 September the five permanent members of the UN Security Council reached agreement on an implementation and enforcement draft resolution. On the following day, just hours after the OPCW Executive Council approved a detailed implementation plan for the U.S./Russian Framework, Security Council Resolution 2118 was unanimously passed, making the OPCW plan binding on the Syrians.|$|E
5|$|On the 39th lap, Castroneves overtook Bräck {{around the}} outside at turn three and moved into third place, and Fernández got ahead of Bräck {{around the outside}} at the same corner two laps later. Takagi drove {{to the inside of}} the third turn {{underneath}} Servià, and both drivers made contact with the side of their cars; Servià became briefly airborne and heavily damaged the left side of his car when he hit the outside wall which caused the fifth caution. Servià was unhurt but Takagi managed to continue without any apparent damage. The race resumed on lap 45 with de Ferran leading Tagliani. Castroneves hit the rear-end of Tagliani's car on the following lap but both drivers continued without damage. The sixth caution was shown on the 49th lap when Takagi hit the right-rear wheel of Moreno's car in the turn three right-hand corner. Moreno was sent into a spin while Takagi's suspension had broke and retired from the event. de Ferran and Tagliani made pit stops for fuel and tires during the caution and could reach the end of the race <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> pit stop. De Ferran and Tagliani rejoined in 14th and 15th places.|$|E

25|$|The rhythm {{section of}} Dave Anderson and Terry Ollis was {{replaced}} by Lemmy and Simon King, both of whose style differed notably from their predecessors. This changed the band’s overall musical direction. Lemmy was a self-confessed inept guitarist who used volume and stagecraft to cover his lack of ability. He became a bassist by accident after joining the band, thinking he was replacing Huw Lloyd Langton. Lemmy said However, Dave Brock decided to play lead and continue <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> guitarist. Hawkwind’s bass guitarist failed to turn up and Lemmy was available. He said: This led to Lemmy’s very unorthodox technique. Lemmy stated:King’s drumming was more square beat and “rock” than the jazzier free-flowing Ollis.|$|E
25|$|In February 1996, the {{electricity}} and heating {{were transferred to}} a European Gas Turbines (EGT) 4.9MWe Typhoon gas turbine combined heating, power and cooling unit. It included a 6MW Thermax air conditioning (cooling) vapour absorption machine (VAM). The £6m HVAC system reduced energy costs by 35%, and paid for itself within three years. A second turbine was added, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> chimney. However, in 2008 the BBC admitted that the energy system was being used for emergency purposes only as it had become cost-ineffective to use full-time. Excess electricity produced at night has not been returned to the National Grid, as originally planned. In November 2003, the turbine's chimneys caught fire, bringing TV output to a halt. After the fire the turbines were no longer used regularly.|$|E

500|$|The {{recorded}} {{version of}} the song begins with sound of ambient music and the stereo sound oscillating, which continues for 40 seconds. The music is interspersed by small trip hop and psychedelic sounds, both at the foreground and background. As McKuen's sample utters the words [...] "you see", Madonna starts uttering the first lyrics, [...] "I traded fame for love / <b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> thought", and at around the 1:30 minute mark, the drums start with the first chorus. The composition starts building slowly, alongside Madonna's vocals with a Jimi Hendrix-like guitar sound complimenting the music. An acoustic guitar comes into prominence from 2:49 minute mark, {{and the sounds of}} piano can be heard in the distance. Arpeggios consisting of electric guitar are added in the mix, and ultimately the drum sounds become heavy. Orbit adds more guitars and increases the volume with the electronic sounds becoming turbulent. Madonna's singing gathers momentum and intensity, belting the line [...] "No one night stand, no far off land / No fire that I can spark", when it suddenly subsides, ebbing away.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{attempts}} to seek powers {{to make the}} River Don navigable were hampered by opposition from local landowners and disunity between the authorities in Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster. The first Act of Parliament was presented in 1698 by the MP for Thirsk, Sir Godfrey Copley of Sprotborough, representing the interests of Rotherham. Although there was support from the [...] "gentlemen, traders and inhabitants" [...] of Doncaster, the Corporation opposed the Bill {{in view of the}} likely impact on their mills. There was no support from Sheffield either, and the Bill failed at its first reading. In 1704 Doncaster Corporation, with the support of its traders, presented a Bill that received a first reading, but disappeared <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> reading ever happening. By 1722 there was some agreement between Sheffield and Doncaster, with a tacit agreement that Doncaster would be responsible for the river below their town, and Sheffield for the section above Doncaster. There was organised resistance to the scheme from local landowners, and it appears that their influence resulted in the proposed Bill being defeated in committee, so it could not be presented to parliament.|$|E
