"The D'oh-cial Network" [...] also parodies the 2010 drama film The Social Network, which {{portrays the}} {{founding}} of Facebook by Mark Zuckerberg and the subsequent lawsuit by American rowers Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss who claimed Zuckerberg stole their idea. The Social Network, like the episode, features {{a scene in which}} the Winklevoss twins are seen rowing. In July 2011, it was announced in Entertainment Weekly that American actor Armie Hammer would make a guest appearance in [...] "The D'oh-cial Network", playing the Winklevoss twins. Hammer previously attained that role in The Social Network. According to The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean, the staff of the show decided not to ask the [...] Winklevoss twins to guest star in the episode as themselves because [...] "We [...] were like, 'Wait, [...] played them, that's who people think they are, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> get him.'" [...] Hammer met with the producers of the series in May 2011 to record his lines.|$|E

500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. I decided I would play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If {{this is the best}} we can do in terms of movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2008, {{the group}} {{coalesced}} {{under the name}} Cash Cash, with members Jean Paul Makhlouf, Alexander Makhlouf, and Samuel Frisch.

[...] In an interview Jean Paul stated, [...] "Basically we were in a previous group growing up and never thought to copyright the name because when you're a young local garage band, you don't have the money and don't think it really matters. Well after we signed our first record deal, it kind of did matter. We got hit with a ton of legal notices about it from the person who owned the name, and had this old agent trying to screw us over, so when putting the new group together out of frustration, I was like, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> name this group 'Cash Cash' because every one is after our cash, and we don't have any yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Big Black's first {{release for}} Touch and Go was the Headache EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited {{original}} {{edition of the}} EP {{was a pair of}} forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic [...] "body bag" [...] to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers. A sticker on the EP's cover read [...] "Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese!" [...] According to Durango, [...] "We didn't want to sit there and screw people. If we felt it wasn't as good, then <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> be honest about it." [...] Indeed, Headache recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on Atomizer, showing signs that the band was lagging creatively. Durango later remarked that [...] "I was feeling tapped out ideawise. At that point I think we had tried everything that we wanted to try, musically and in the studio." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, she {{divorced}} Steve Newkirk, {{whom she}} had married when she was 19, and the same year met Alex Pacheco, a political science major at George Washington University. Pacheco had studied for the priesthood, then worked as a crew member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's first ship. He volunteered at the shelter where she worked, and {{they fell in love}} and began living together, although as Kathy Snow Guillermo writes, they were very different—Newkirk was older and more practical, whereas Pacheco could barely look after himself. Newkirk read Peter Singer's influential book, Animal Liberation (1975), and in March 1980, she persuaded Pacheco to join her in forming People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, at that point just [...] "five people in a basement", as Newkirk described it. They were mostly students and members of the local vegetarian society, but the group included a friend of Pacheco's from the U.K., Kim Stallwood, a British activist who {{went on to become the}} national organizer of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. Pacheco was reluctant at first. [...] "It just didn't sound great to me," [...] he told The Los Angeles Times in 1992. [...] "I had been active in Europe ... and I thought there were just too many formalities. I thought <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> do things ourselves.

2500|$|Yorke {{released}} his debut solo album The Eraser in 2006 on the independent label XL Recordings. Composed of mainly electronic music recorded during Radiohead's 2004 hiatus, {{the album was}} produced by Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich and features artwork by Donwood. Yorke said: [...] "I've been in the band since we left school and never dared do anything on my own... It was like, 'Man, I've got {{to find out what}} it feels like,' you know?" [...] He stressed that Radiohead were not splitting up and that the album was made [...] "with their blessing". The Eraser reached number three in the UK in its first week, number two in the United States, Canada and Australia, and number nine in Ireland. It was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize and the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. An album of remixes by various artists, The Eraser Rmxs, was released in 2009. In July 2009, Yorke performed solo at the Latitude Festival in England. On 21 September 2009, he released a double-A-side single, [...] "Feeling Pulled Apart by Horses" [...] / [...] "The Hollow Earth". In the same year, Yorke formed a new band, Atoms for Peace, to perform songs from The Eraser. Alongside Yorke on vocals, guitar and keyboards, the band comprises bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, drummer Joey Waronker of Beck and R.E.M., percussionist Mauro Refosco of Forro in the Dark, and Godrich on keyboards and guitar. Yorke said: [...] "God love 'em but I've been playing with the same band since I was 16, and to do this was quite a trip... It felt like we'd knocked a hole in a wall, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>just</b> fucking go through it." [...] The band played eight North American shows in 2010.|$|E
