5|$|Vasari {{suggests}} that the tomb went over budget, costing 1,000florins, although it is unclear who covered the excess.

5|$|On {{top of the}} sarcophagus, the bier of the effigy is {{supported}} by lions whose shape mimics Trecento consoles. The lions may {{be based on the}} Florentine , as if to mark John XXIII {{in the same manner as}} a conquered city-state. As Donatello's Marzocco for the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d.1342) in the Bargello.|$|E

25|$|An {{accurate}} and comprehensive {{history of the}} revolution has proven difficult to compile {{for a number of}} reasons. There are no contemporary accounts, and most sources were written more than a century after the revolution.

25|$|Oats {{can also}} be left {{standing}} until completely ripe and then combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> head. This causes greater field losses as the grain falls from the heads, and to harvesting losses, as the grain is threshed out by the reel.

500|$|By September 2015, John Paesano {{had begun}} {{composing}} {{music for the}} season. He felt that the season's new showrunners [...] "were true to {{what we were trying}} to do in season one. There were just elements in season two that we had to acknowledge" [...] such as the Punisher and Elektra. He jokingly said that [...] "it’s not like we all of the sudden went into John Williams territory, you know? It’s definitely still dark, still gritty ... but it definitely jumps up a couple levels." [...] When approaching the characters of Punisher and Elektra, with whom Paesano was familiar from the comics and previous adaptations, he [...] "took all those preconceived notions I had <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> of salt" [...] and waited to see what the season's interpretation of the characters would be. Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where [...] "we were going to hit what" [...] and [...] "maintain that definable aspect of New York" [...] and its sound. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by Hollywood Records on July 15, 2016.|$|E
500|$|During the {{beginning}} of season three, Chris Carabott from IGN described Ben as [...] "one of the best 'villains on television', due to his 'eerie manner' and 'methodical delivery'". Later in the season Carabott {{had a problem with}} Ben being so deceptive, as [...] "anything he imparts must be taken <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> of salt". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly also noted this, saying [...] "I don't trust Ben. I have no idea when he's lying and when he's telling the truth. The only thing I'm reasonably sure of is that everything he says is for the purpose of impacting a character — and the audience". Ben's father issues revealed towards the end of season three are described as [...] "not the most original Lost character trait by any means but it is the thrust behind Ben's development into the genocidal maniac he eventually becomes". Following the penultimate episode of the season, Carabott stated [...] "Even with his limited screen time, Michael Emerson's performance shines through and we hope that he survives the events of the finale because we love seeing his character every week." [...] Erin Martell from TV Squad picked the Others as one of her season three highlights, partly due to the development of Ben, adding [...] "I cannot even picture the final three seasons without Ben". Martell also gave six reasons to look forward to season four, one of which was Ben Linus.|$|E

500|$|Fox {{issued a}} press release on January 11 {{previewing}} the episode's plot. It concluded, [...] "While the girl's mind-bending condition intensifies, Walter dusts off some old lab videos and hypothesizes the unthinkable, sending Olivia and Peter to investigate the bewildering case in an original 'Unearthed' episode of Fringe and here's another mystery: is it an unaired episode from Season One or is it from an alternate universe?" [...] As the press release purposely alluded to whether the episode was indeed originally {{part of the first}} season or from the parallel universe, one critic wrote that [...] "FOX [...] having fun with the fact that Fringe has alternate universes" [...] and that readers of the press release should [...] "take this <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grain</b> of salt". According to Fox's media site, [...] "Unearthed" [...] was listed as the 21st episode of season one, despite its broadcast during the second season and inclusion in that season's DVD release as a special feature. Though one character had been killed off earlier in the second season, a former series regular appeared in the episode, sparking confusion among some viewers. As the broadcasting change went unexplained at the time, one media outlet speculated it was a marketing ploy on the network's part, believing the episode title was [...] "more than a stunning coincidence" [...] and that it was a reference to co-creator J.J.
