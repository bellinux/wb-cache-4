50|$|In a move of {{historic}} significance for software supporting Unicode, the PRC decided to mandate support of certain code points outside the BMP. This means that software {{can no longer}} get away with treating characters as 16 bit fixed width entities (UCS-2). Therefore, they must either process the data in a variable <b>width</b> <b>format</b> (such as UTF-8 or UTF-16), which {{are the most common}} choices, or move to a larger fixed <b>width</b> <b>format</b> (such as UCS-4 or UTF-32). Microsoft made the change from UCS-2 to UTF-16 with Windows 2000.|$|E

The Story mode {{displays}} the story text across the screen's entire <b>width</b> without <b>formatting.</b> This provides an interface for users {{more comfortable with}} traditional word processors to read and edit copy and allows text to be seen larger and in a different font than it would appear in the layout.|$|R
5000|$|Annex [...] "Z" [...] {{introduced}} optional {{data types}} for supporting other fixed <b>width</b> floating point <b>formats,</b> {{as well as}} arbitrary precision formats (i.e., where the precision of representation and rounding is determined at execution time) - some of this material was moved {{into the body of}} the draft by generalizing section 5. Arbitrary precision was dropped.|$|R
5000|$|There was a console {{typewriter}} {{for simple}} I/O. I am pretty {{sure there were}} a paper tape reader and punch, but I don't know <b>width</b> or <b>format</b> - maybe someone else can supply that, {{it would be interesting}} as a sidelight on how character sets developed. There was also a graphics display. I remember that it was an intensive user of computing resources, and I think the main arithmetic units had to calculate X/Y coordinates at which to position a beam and light up a dot. (We certainly did not say [...] "pixel".) There was some provision for audio output, perhaps like the CDC 1604, I know because as a demonstration they played Christmas music and displayed a Christmas tree.|$|R

40|$|Have {{you ever}} thought about how to {{identify}} formatting problems with numeric variables? When you analyze all formatted numeric variables in a data set and identify any variable whose entire range of values cannot be displayed with the assigned format. These variables cause SAS to produce the following message: At least one W. D format was {{too small for the}} number to be printed. This paper will describe a simple straightforward way to write a message to the SAS log for all problematic variables. The macro GETLST uses PROC CONTENTS to generate a data set containing the <b>format</b> <b>width</b> and decimal values for each formatted numeric variable. A subsequent DATA step stores this information in macro variables. PROC SQL is then used to determine the magnitude of the minimum and maximum values of each variable. This information, as well as Boolean indicators for positive and negative values is stored in macro variables. The macro then checks whether each variable's entire range of values can be displayed with the assigned format. If the format'...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the dangers}} of the nitrate film base being known {{practically}} since its development, it was used in virtually all major motion pictures prior to 1952, when Kodak completed a four-year conversion program to the sole manufacturing of acetate base film stocks. Kodak began working with acetate [...] "safety film" [...] as early as 1909, and started selling it in 1910 for 22 mm film. Acetate has always been used with 8 mm and 16 mm formats, as they were originally created for amateur home movie usage, and generally was used for most sub-35 mm formats to minimize risk to the general public. (Several formats, such as 17.5 mm, which were often re-slit from 35 mm, were nitrate, however. One of Kodak's reasons for choosing 16 mm instead of 17.5 mm for a standard amateur <b>format</b> <b>width</b> was specifically to prevent nitrate re-slits from being used in home movies.) All motion picture camera negatives are now shot on acetate film because it is safer than nitrate but not as strong as polyester bases, which may damage the camera rather than the film should a jam occur. Acetate can also be spliced with film cement, while polyester can only be spliced with tape or an ultrasonic splicer, so polyester would be hard to edit. Acetate film does not burn under intense heat, but rather melts, causing a bubbling burn-out effect - this can be seen simulated in films such as Persona (1966) or Velvet Goldmine, or, if one is unlucky, in real life during a film screening when a frame becomes stuck in the projector's film gate. Acetate films are also subject to degradation over time. With exposure to heat, moisture or acids the acetyl groups which are attached to long chains of cellulose which form the film base are broken from their molecular bonds and free acetic acid is released with a characteristic smell of vinegar. This is known as vinegar syndrome. As the degradation progresses the film base becomes brittle and shrinks.|$|R
