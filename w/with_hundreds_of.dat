5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found.

These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters <b>with</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E

Land was released, {{surveyed}} and apportioned on an application basis, {{with the latest}} Sections being surveyed {{as late as the}} 1960s and 1970s. However, the limiting factor for early settlers was the availability of water, and allocations were generally preferentially selected around rare rocky outcrops or uplands which could afford some opportunities for increased runoff into earthen dams. Indeed, access to water was a critical factor in European settlement of Eyre Peninsula.|$|R

The event was the second deadliest in February since 1950 behind the February 1971 Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak, which killed 123, the deadliest outbreak in both Tennessee and Kentucky since the 1974 Super Outbreak, and was at the time the deadliest tornado outbreak in the US overall since the 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak which killed 90 people. This record would not be surpassed until the 2011 Super Outbreak which killed 324 people. Damage from tornadoes was estimated at over $500 million (2008 USD).|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a landscape divided into elementary cells, {{each of these}} cells containing some species to be protected. We search to select a set of cells to form a natural reserve {{in order to protect}} all the species present in the landscape. A species is considered protected if it is present in a certain number of cells of the reserve. There is an important spatial constraint concerning the set of selected cells: a species must be able to go from any cell to any cell without leaving the reserve. An integer linear programming model was proposed by Önal and Briers [2] for this reserve selection problem, but the size of the problems which can be handled by this model is limited: several hours of computation are required for solving instances <b>with</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> cells and <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> species. Having proposed an improvement of this model which reduces appreciably the computation time, we propose another integer linear programming model, easy to carry out, which allows to obtain, in a few seconds of computation, optimal or near-optimal solutions for instances <b>with</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> cells and <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> species. However, the computation time becomes prohibitive for instances with more than 200 cells and 100 species. But, this approach can be particularly useful to solve the problem, in an approximate way, by aggregation of cells as proposed by Önal and Briers [2]...|$|R
