5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

500|$|In February 2012 it was {{reported}} that Aston had left Time Team. He explained his position to the Western Daily Press, stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process Time Team had been [...] "dumbed down", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists—including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus—had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained [...] "a lot of faffing about." [...] In an interview with the magazine British Archaeology Aston said: [...] "The time had come to leave. I never made any money out of it, but a lot of my soul <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> I feel really, really angry about it." ...|$|E

500|$|After a {{brief period}} of rest and {{reorganisation}} in Egypt, the 2ndDivision—of which the 24thInfantry Battalion was part—embarked for France on 21 March 1916. Savige became commander of the battalion scout platoon and led a number of night patrols into no man's land. On 12 April, he became battalion intelligence officer and he was promoted to lieutenant on 1 May. Coming to the attention of his brigade commander, Brigadier General John Gellibrand, Savige was attached to 6thInfantry Brigade headquarters as a trainee brigade intelligence officer. [...] "We expected a lot of the new B.I.O.," [...] Gellibrand later recalled, [...] "and we got it." [...] Savige served in operations at Pozières and Mouquet Farm in July and August 1916. At one point he ran through heavy shellfire on an errand. The orderly who <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> with him was never seen again. Savige was promoted to captain on 15 September. On 8 November, he was wounded at Flers but remained on duty. However, on 20 December he was admitted to hospital, suffering from influenza. Savige rejoined the 24thInfantry Battalion on 5 January 1917 and was appointed adjutant on 3 February.|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the time we <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after inheriting Brookfield, Ruth and David {{were faced}} with a countrywide foot-and-mouth outbreak. They decided to isolate {{themselves}} from the community {{in a bid to}} stop the disease spreading onto their land and infecting their animals. Farmworker Bert Fry (Eric Allan) also came to live with the family in seclusion, so he could help out with the animals. Ruth and David became frustrated with the situation and Ruth also had trouble sleeping. The couple later sent Pip to live with relatives. Soap Opera author Dorothy Hobson wrote that it was a [...] "drastic measure", but believed the storyline to be part of The Archers continued commitment in responding to topical events. The show's then editor, Vanessa Whitburn, said that some storylines had to be put on hold in order for the cast and crew to weave in the foot-and-mouth outbreak into the show. Whitburn told Samantha Lyster from the Birmingham Post, [...] "We decided that David and Ruth Archer should isolate themselves because they had just taken control of the farm and they had the most to lose should foot-and-mouth hit them." [...] Whitburn later said she was [...] "particularly proud" [...] of the storyline and all the work that <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>it.</b> Finch commented that dealing with the constant re-writes was hard, but enjoyable work. The storyline was praised by farmers for its realistic portrayal.|$|E

500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>it</b> not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E
500|$|Michael Westmore was {{responsible}} for taking Probert's designs for the Ferengi and creating the make-up for the actors to meet that design. In Probert's original concept, the Ferengi had ears which were pointed like a bat. There were concerns from the producers that these would appear simply to be larger versions of the already known Vulcan ears, and so Westmore was told to round off the ears {{when it came to}} producing the make-up. Other elements which were changed at the make-up stage included modifications to the nose to increase the volume of wrinkles and dropping the idea of an extended chin as Westmore thought it would save time in applying the make-up. A set of false upper teeth were also created, which were added to a single head piece and a nose piece which comprised the prosthetics for the Ferengi. Westmore was not pleased when a shot of an actor in costume was leaked without the teeth, he said [...] "I was annoyed about that photo because the make-up was incomplete. After all the work that <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> we would have wanted our design in proper form. The photo was like a pirated version of our make-up, because none of us would ever approved it under those circumstances." [...] Michael Okuda designed a rank designation tattoo which Westmore applied to the right part of each Ferengi forehead. The symbol means [...] "Dog eat dog" [...] and was painted green as that is the colour of American dollar bills. Each bar (referred to by the production crew as a [...] "rocker") {{to the side of the}} symbol designated a rank, with more bars meaning a higher rank.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{journalist}} Peter Bradshaw {{felt that}} Contagion blended well {{together as a}} film, although opined that Soderbergh was somewhat unsuccessful on channeling the fears, frights, and [...] "the massive sense of loss" [...] of [...] "ordinary people". To David Denby of The New Yorker, the [...] "brilliant" [...] film was [...] "serious, precise, frightening," [...] and [...] "emotionally enveloping". Despite applauding Soderbergh for [...] "hopscotching" [...] tidily [...] "between the intimate and international", The Atlantic Christopher Orr was disappointed with the film's detached and [...] "clinical" [...] disposition, which led him to conclude that Contagion should have gone with a more inflexible rationale, or a lesson [...] "beyond 'wash your hands often and hope you're lucky'." [...] "For all the craft that <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> Contagion is ultimately beyond good or bad, beyond criticism. It just is," [...] professed The Atlantic writer. Described as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "spooky" [...] installment, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Soderbergh doesn't milk your tears as things fall apart, but a passion that can feel like cold rage is inscribed in his images {{of men and women}} isolated in the frame, in the blurred {{point of view of the}} dying and in the insistent stillness of a visual style that seems like an exhortation to look." [...] In regards to the story, Salon columnist Andrew O'Hehir avouched that the [...] "crisp" [...] and succinct narrative matched up to the [...] "beautifully composed" [...] visuals of the film. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed that Soderbergh and Burns effectively created anxiety in the [...] "shrewd" [...] and [...] "unsensationalistic" [...] film without becoming exaggerated, a sentiment echoed by Jeanette Catsolis of NPR, who insisted that the duo [...] "weave multiple characters into a narrative that's complex without being confusing, and intelligent without being baffling". Writing for The Village Voice, Karina Longworth thought that Contagion reflected the [...] "self-consciousness" [...] and [...] "experimentation" [...] of some of Soderbergh's previous efforts, such as the Ocean's trilogy and The Girlfriend Experience (2009).|$|E

2500|$|According to Richard C. Carrier, Christianity {{probably}} began... with {{a different}} idea of the resurrection than is claimed today. The evidence suggests the first Christians, at least {{up to and including}} Paul, thought Jesus's [...] "soul" [...] was taken up to heaven and clothed in a new body, after leaving his old body in the grave forever. The subsequent story, that Jesus actually walked out of the grave with the same body that <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> leaving an empty tomb to astonish all, was probably a legend that developed {{over the course of the}} first century, beginning with a metaphorical [...] "empty tomb" [...] in the Gospel of Mark... By the end of the first century the Christian faction that would win total power three centuries later, and thus alone preserve its writings for posterity, had come to believe in the literal truth of the ensuing legend, forgetting or repudiating the original doctrine of Paul.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{orthodox}} classical revolutionary Marxism, profits {{can only}} arise from surplus labor, and therefore, {{it is argued}} that the direct source of all capitalist profits is the exploitation of wage labor. This principle is often called the [...] "Fundamental Marxist Theorem" [...] by mathematical Marxists: a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of positive profits is that surplus value is positive. It is an interpretation which certainly makes sense {{from the point of view}} of Capital, Volume I where Marx assumed, for the sake of argument and for the sake of simplicity, that the prices at which the inputs and outputs of capitalist production are traded are equal to their value. In Capital, Volume I, Marx aimed to show, that even if all commodities were fairly traded on the basis of equal exchange, exploitation could nevertheless occur within capitalist production, and that if more value did not come out of production than <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>it,</b> it would be impossible to explain economic growth. The reason was simply that workers together could produce much more value than they needed themselves to live. That was, according to Marx, exactly the reason why the owners of capital hired those workers.|$|E

2500|$|At this point, Sunday Silence {{had earned}} a single-season record $4.59 million (since surpassed by horses such as Cigar, Silver Charm, Curlin, Smarty Jones, and Pleasantly Perfect) and won seven times in nine starts for the 1989 campaign, earning him Eclipse Award for Outstanding 3-Year-Old Male Horse and Horse of the Year honors. For the latter award, Sunday Silence {{received}} 223 of 242 votes, making him the most decisive winner since John Henry eight years earlier. [...] Former New York Times racing writer and current Daily Racing Form chairman Steve Crist stated in his New York Times article in January 1990 that had the question on the ballot been, [...] "Who is the better horse, Sunday Silence or Easy Goer?" [...] {{a lot more than}} 19 would have voted against Sunday Silence", while concluding in the same article that [...] "by any standards last year [...] belonged to Sunday Silence." [...] Paul Moran of the Los Angeles Times and Newsday agreed, stating that [...] "Sunday Silence is Horse of the Year, but most still believe Easy Goer is the better horse." [...] In 1996, Sunday Silence was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. [...] He was ranked #31 in the Bloodhorse Top 100 Horses of the 20th Century, while Easy Goer ranked #34. Blood-Horse stated that its rankings [...] "will generate debate for years to come."
