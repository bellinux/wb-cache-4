Tetramer-based enrichment assays have recently given estimates of the numbers of peptide-major histocompatibility complex-specific CD 8 + T cells in naïve mice, but precursor frequencies for entire viruses have been examined only by using in vitro limiting-dilution assays (LDAs). To examine CD 8 + T-cell precursor frequencies for <b>whole</b> <b>viruses,</b> we developed an in vivo LDA and found frequencies of naïve CD 8 + T-cell precursors of 1 in 1, 444 for vaccinia virus (VV) (∼ 13, 850 VV-specific CD 8 + T cells per mouse) and 1 in 2, 958 for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (∼ 6, 761 LCMV-specific CD 8 + T cells per mouse) in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. In mice immune to VV, the number of VV-specific precursors, not surprisingly, dramatically increased to 1 in 13 (∼ 1, 538, 462 VV-specific CD 8 + T cells per mouse), consistent with estimates of VV-specific memory T cells. In contrast, precursor numbers for LCMV did not increase in VV-immune mice (1 in 4, 562, with ∼ 4, 384 LCMV-specific CD 8 + T cells per VV-immune mouse). Using H- 2 Db-restricted LCMV GP 33 -specific P 14 -transgenic T cells, we found that, after donor T-cell take was accounted for, approximately every T cell transferred underwent a full proliferative expansion in response to LCMV infection. This high efficiency was also seen with memory populations, suggesting that most antigen-specific T cells will proliferate extensively at a limiting dilution in response to infections.

50|$|RNA viruses can {{be further}} {{classified}} according to the sense or polarity of their RNA into negative-sense and positive-sense, or ambisense RNA viruses. Positive-sense viral RNA is similar to mRNA and thus can be immediately translated by the host cell.

As such, purified RNA of a positive-sense virus can directly cause infection {{though it may be}} less infectious than the <b>whole</b> <b>virus</b> particle. Purified RNA of a negative-sense virus is not infectious by itself as it needs to be transcribed into positive-sense RNA; each virion can be transcribed to several positive-sense RNAs.

Moreover, the variant peptides with a substitution at the TCR contact residue had antagonistic properties to some of the CTL clones, while being agonistic to others, reflecting the extensive diversity of the T cells. These results imply that the functional diversity of T cells to even a single epitope should be considered in manipulating immunity to viruses and in developing adoptive immunotherapy for immunocompromised individuals...|$|R
