25|$|Game 5 of the Magic-Celtics {{series was}} the last game played at Amway Arena (formerly known as Orlando Arena and TD Waterhouse Centre). The Magic, <b>who</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> upset the top-seeded Cavaliers in 6 after they went 8-0 through the first two rounds, also went 8-0 through two playoff series, only to suffer the same fate as the Cavaliers last year, losing to Boston in 6. The Cavs loss led to the LeBron James {{decision}} to join the Miami Heat. This {{was the last}} playoff appearance for the Cavs until 2015 when James returned to Cleveland and, along with Kyrie Irving, faced again his common rivals the Celtics and Bulls.|$|E
2500|$|The Titans {{were also}} {{the first team to}} play in the Regular season, when they played the Steelers on September 10. Ringer was used to return kicks. In the 10-13 {{overtime}} loss, Ringer had 3 Kick Returns, a 19 yard average, including a long of 21 yards. He also played on special teams, and had one tackle. Ringer was again used as a kick returner, this time in a 31-34 loss to the Houston Texans. Ringer had 6 returns for a 20 yard average, with a long of 25, and no touchdowns. He also played on special teams, but had no tackles. In a 17-24 week 3 loss to the New York Jets, Ringer was benched as the kick returner, and, while active, did not play in the game. Ringer's kick return replacement, Ryan Mouton, had two fumbles during returns. Despite this, Titan's coach Jeff Fischer stood behind his decision to bench Ringer. In a 37-17 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ringer was again active, but only played as a reserve on special teams. Ringer was one of three Titans who did not register a stat. The Titans, <b>who</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> had 13 wins, only three losses, started the season out zero wins four losses. They had their fifth loss of the season in a 31-9 loss to the Colts, a game in which Ringer was once again active, but only played special teams, not registering a stat. Ringer was one of two Titans that did not record an offensive stat. In a record-breaking 59-0 loss to the New England Patriots, Ringer had his first NFL carries, having 7 carries for 47 yards (6.7 average), including a 32 yard run, for no touchdowns, all amounting in Garbage time. The Titans finished the game with negative 7 passing yards as their record moved to 0 wins 6 losses, putting them in a tie for the worst record in the NFL alongside the St. Louis Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Despite his performance in the loss, head coach Jeff Fisher said that Chris Johnson and LenDale White will continue to get the majority of the carries. [...] "There's not enough balls to go around. I wouldn't hesitate to put Ringer in if there's an issue," [...] Fisher said. During a practice on October 28, 2009, Ringer injured his back and had to be carted off in an ambulance. Fisher said of the injury [...] "It could be any number of things and it would be unfair for me to speculate right now. He is obviously in some pain." [...] The call to the hospital was initially phoned to treat a potentially [...] "traumatic" [...] injury, but tests have revealed that the injury is [...] "not considered serious". After spending a night with back problems, Ringer was released from the hospital early morning on October 29. Ringer's expected to miss a few weeks, as he's listed on the injury report with a back injury. Fisher commented on the injury, [...] "We got some good news on Javon. He obviously didn’t practice today, but he’s going to be OK. We were really concerned about it. We feared the worst and we got good results," [...] but would not elaborate as to {{the full extent of the}} injury. In a 30-13 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ringer was declared inactive before the game, and did not play. It was however, the Titans first victory of the season. In week 9, Ringer was again inactive and did not play. In week 10, Ringer was listed as questionable, but was declared inactive, and did not play. In a 20-17 win against the Houston Texans, Ringer was inactive, and did not play. In 20-17 win against the Arizona Cardinals, Ringer was listed as the #2 running back. He had one yard on one carry. Ringer played because LenDale White, the team's usual #2 Running back, was benched due to being late to a team meeting. Ringer was then inactive for the rest of the season. Ringer finished the season with 8 attempts for 48 yards, playing in 7 games.|$|E

Waxing tempest, blast after blast, of Patriot indignation, from without; dim inorganic whirl of Intrigues, Fatuities, within! Inorganic, fatuous; from which the eye turns away.
