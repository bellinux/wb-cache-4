500|$|In {{his last}} two years of high school, he was {{selected}} for Combined High Schools teams in both cricket—as captain in both years—and rugby. At the age of 14, he made his debut for St George, and in 1937–38 he was elevated to the second XI. In a club under-16 competition, the A W Green Shield, Morris took 55 wickets at 5.23, which remains a record. The following year he was selected for the team as a batsman, after captain Bill O'Reilly decided that his left-arm unorthodox spin had less potential. O'Reilly described him as [...] "moderately skilled" [...] in bowling and noted that he would not have many opportunities with the ball as future Test bowling world record holder Ray Lindwall was also in the team. [...] O'Reilly quickly moved Morris up to the No. 6 position in the batting order. After scoring a century against Sydney University, O'Reilly moved him into the opening position <b>without</b> <b>prior</b> <b>notice,</b> where he remained.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} {{scheduled}} to rebroadcast on March 15, 2006 on Comedy Central, but the broadcast was canceled <b>without</b> <b>prior</b> <b>notice,</b> and was replaced with [...] "Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls". Representatives of Comedy Central insist that the episode was changed {{as a tribute to}} Isaac Hayes following his departure from the show two days earlier. The following day, the Hollywoodinterrupted.com blog alleged that Comedy Central parent Viacom canceled the rebroadcast due to threats of Cruise to boycott the publicity tour of his upcoming film [...] These assertions were soon also reported by E! News and American Morning. Fox News attributed threats from Tom Cruise, stating, [...] "to back out of his Mission: Impossible III promotional duties if Viacom didn't pull a repeat of the episode", as evidence of [...] "bad blood" [...] between Cruise and Viacom (which also owns Paramount Pictures, the distributor of MI:III). CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer also cited [...] "industry sources" [...] who believed the episode was pulled [...] "because the network and Tom Cruise's current movie studio are both owned by the same corporation." [...] The New York Post noted that Cruise had [...] "a history of playing hardball", alleging that he had been responsible for having a sex scene featuring his then-fiancée Katie Holmes removed from the film Thank You for Smoking prior to its release.|$|E

2500|$|Asked why {{he never}} sought the presidency, Rayburn {{said that he}} was [...] "born {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time" [...] to {{undertake}} a national campaign. Rayburn was Speaker at a time that the greater power in the House rested with committee chairmen. He was himself readily accessible to members; historian Anthony Champagne of the University of Texas at Dallas, a Rayburn scholar, views the Speaker as a [...] "bridge between the northern and southern members" [...] of the Democratic Party. Champagne recalled a report that Rayburn so understood the House that he was [...] "married" [...] to the body and could [...] "feel the sentiment of the members" [...] by merely being in their presence. He was careful to fight his own battles, Champagne said. Rayburn was a mentor to such younger members as Richard Bolling of Missouri, Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas, Carl Albert of Oklahoma, and Homer Thornberry and Jack Brooks, both of Texas. He was also readily accessible to constituents, who were invited to come to his home in Bonham and visit <b>without</b> <b>prior</b> <b>notice.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 2000, student volunteers {{entered the}} station to host their weekly punk show and found that their slot had been preempted by a sports game <b>without</b> <b>prior</b> <b>notice</b> and they were {{expected}} to operate the board during the broadcast. The DJs protested [...] by playing punk rock music concurrently with the game during its last hour. A university administrator called the station manager and demanded that he discipline the DJs. When the station manager refused, the university administration responded by physically locking students out of the station and replacing its programming with a satellite feed from the World Radio Network. The administration cited the station's by-laws which gives the university president ultimate authority over the station. Students protested the shut-down, including a silent protest outside the University Board of Governors meeting. The station shutdown and protests received coverage in the press and students submitted a petition in support of the student-run station with over 700 signatures. The lockout lasted 8 days before the station was returned to student control with joint oversight from the university administration.|$|E
2500|$|February 21, 2001: More than 50 (an {{official}} in pro-Moscow administration {{put the number}} at 80) bodies of men, women and children, showing signs of torture and military-style summary execution, were uncovered across the main Russian Khankala military base at the abandoned holiday settlement of Dachny (also called Zdorovye) near Grozny, sparking an international-scale scandal. Many were booby-trappped and some bore signs of mutilation including stab wounds, broken limbs, severed fingernails and dismembered ears, and many had their hands tied behind them and were blindfolded. The vast majority (16 out of 19) of the victims whose corpses were identified were last seen when Russian federal forces took them into their custody. Human rights groups suggested that Russian servicemen at the Khankala base used the Zdorovye dacha settlement as a disposal site for executed prisoners. Among the identified victims was the corpse of Nura Luluyeva, a Chechen woman who was later proven in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to have been kidnapped and bludgeoned to death by the Russian servicemen in 2000. The authorities, who had strongly denied involvement in the deaths, had buried {{the rest of the}} bodies <b>without</b> <b>prior</b> <b>notice</b> and without performing adequate autopsies or collecting crucial evidence which could have helped in identifying the perpetrators.

5000|$|Here, in {{contrast}} to the above Python [...] example, the function call [...] always gets executed, resulting in an endless recursion. Such an indentation error (like the accidental removal of the indentation in the last line) is only possible in programming languages that do not mark blocks with distinct markers, like curly brackets in C. In this particular case, not even an editor with automatic indentation could prevent the erroneous behaviour of this Python code. This unintended error can easily pass into the code base <b>without</b> <b>prior</b> <b>noticing</b> by the programmer. In most other programming languages, this would not be possible (deleting a block-end marker in C would lead to a compiler error), and this makes the Python syntax less robust than most other languages.|$|R
