25|$|I {{arranged}} {{meetings with}} my young friends, {{some of whom}} were considerably older than myself, and a few were married persons. A number of them were vain and thoughtless; my experience sounded to them like an idle tale, and they did not heed my entreaties. But I determined that my efforts should never cease till these dear souls, for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> so great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and praying with them.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Thomas Binney, to whom I brought {{letters from}} Rev. Mr. Roaf, my pastor, {{received}} me most kindly. Mrs. Binney {{acted as if}} we had been acquainted for the preceding six-and-twenty years; and, being the first London lady with <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the pleasure of acquaintance, I saw in her what I have since seen in English people of all ranks, who are really genteel - a most skilful and yet an indescribably easy way of making one feel perfectly at case with them. I cannot tell how it is done.|$|E
500|$|Austrian School {{economist}} Friedrich Hayek was Keynes's {{most prominent}} contemporary critic, with sharply opposing {{views on the}} economy. Yet after Keynes's death, he wrote: [...] "He was the one really great man I ever knew, and for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> unbounded admiration. The world {{will be a very}} much poorer place without him." ...|$|E

[...] he cried,--"you, for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> toiled and slaved, <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{followed}} {{all over the}} world, <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> served faithfully with the last breath of my body and the last drop of blood in my veins! You have brought them here--tracked me down! You!" ...|$|R

500|$|... "Cotten was {{the only}} {{principal}} for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not made any sculptural casts, wigs or lenses," [...] Seiderman said. When Cotten's old-age scenes needed to be shot out of sequence due to Welles's injured ankle, Seiderman improvised with appliances made for Kane's make-up. A sun visor was chosen to conceal Cotten's low hairline and the lenses he wore—hastily supplied by a Beverly Hills ophthalmologist—were uncomfortable.|$|E
500|$|In 1943, {{she played}} three women in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. During the filming, {{according}} to Powell's autobiography, Powell {{and she became}} lovers: [...] "I realised that Deborah was both the ideal and the flesh-and-blood woman <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been searching for". Kerr made clear that her surname should be pronounced the same as [...] "car". To avoid confusion over pronunciation, Louis B. Mayer of MGM billed her as [...] "Kerr rhymes with Star!" ...|$|E
500|$|Though it largely escaped {{notice when}} first published, Holmes {{eventually}} {{came under attack}} by two distinguished professors of obstetrics—Hugh L. Hodge and Charles D. Meigs—who adamantly denied his theory of contagion. In 1855, Holmes chose to republish the essay {{in the form of}} a pamphlet under the new title Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence. In a new introduction, in which Holmes directly addressed his opponents, he wrote: [...] "I had rather rescue one mother from being poisoned by her attendant, than claim to have saved forty out of fifty patients to <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> carried the disease." [...] He added, [...] "I beg to be heard in behalf of the women whose lives are at stake, until some stronger voice shall plead for them." [...] The then controversial work is now considered a landmark in germ theory of disease.|$|E

5000|$|In 1977 {{she gave}} the funeral oration of INLA chief of staff, Seamus Costello saying [...] "Of all the {{politicians}} and political people with <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> conversations, and <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had conversations, and who called themselves followers of Connolly, {{he was the only}} one who truly understood what James Connolly meant when he spoke of his vision of the freedom of the Irish people." ...|$|R
500|$|Waugh joined Hertford College on a scholarship, in January 1922. He had {{received}} a congratulatory letter from Cruttwell welcoming him to the college and complimenting him on his English prose: [...] "about the best {{of any of the}} Candidates in the group". Despite this warmth, Waugh's initial impressions of his tutor were unfavourable—"not at all the kind of don for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been prepared by stories of Jowett." [...] The first recorded clash between them came early in Waugh's first term; {{in a letter to his}} school friend Dudley Carew, Waugh reports that his tutor verbally abused him for a Latin mistranslation with the words [...] "Damn you, you're a scholar!" [...] The main basis for the rift that rapidly developed was Waugh's increasingly casual attitude towards his scholarship. Whereas Cruttwell saw the scholarship as a commitment to hard and devoted study, Waugh considered it a reward for his successful school studies and a passport to a life of pleasure. To the detriment of his work, Waugh involved himself in a range of university activities: the Oxford Union, the Hertford debating society, journalism and drawings for the undergraduate papers Isis and Cherwell, and a hectic social life. In his third term, he was brusquely advised by Cruttwell that he should take his studies more seriously, a warning which Waugh chose to interpret as an insult. [...] "I think it was from then on that our mutual dislike became incurable", he later wrote.|$|E
2500|$|On release {{after the}} 1993 Oslo Accords, {{he joined the}} Palestinian Authority's Palestinian Security Forces He became a sergeant, but left, disillusioned, after a year, complaining: [...] "There were colleagues <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taught to read who were {{promoted}} to senior positions because of nepotism and corruption." ...|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "church" [...] first {{occurs in}} 1 Nephi 4:26, where a prophet named Nephi disguises himself as Laban, a {{prominent}} man in Jerusalem whom Nephi had slain:"And he , supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> slain, wherefore he did follow me" [...] (...)

2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{read the}} word [...] "man" [...] in [...] {{to mean the}} {{archangel}} Gabriel, as [...] says, [...] "The man Gabriel, <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen in the vision." [...] The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that Gabriel asked Joseph what he sought. Joseph told Gabriel that he sought his brethren, as [...] reports. And Gabriel led Joseph to his brethren.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{professional}} tennis career, however, {{was going}} nowhere. [...] "When I looked around me, I saw that white tennis players, some of <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thrashed on the court, were picking up offers and invitations," [...] she wrote. [...] "Suddenly {{it dawned on}} me that my triumphs had not destroyed the racial barriers once and for all, as I had—perhaps naively—hoped. Or if I did destroy them, they had been erected behind me again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{wrote on}} 11 July: [...] "I {{do not receive}} this honour (if it is one) with much exultation; on the {{contrary}} with a heavy heart. I did not feel great comfort in finding myself at St James's surrounded by persons with <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been so many years in political hostility, and without those I can never think of being separated from, publicly or privately, without a pang". Some days earlier Fox had written to Fitzwilliam: ...|$|E

2500|$|.....the {{captain was}} sarcastic about Denis's 'capering about' outside his crease and rubbed in the point by turning to Jack Ikin and commending him for {{sticking}} in his ground. 'Let the ball come to you, that's {{the way to}} play out here.' Denis, from <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the story, was much deflated - he was, in fact, stumped for 98...The oracle was listened to with great respect, and his dictum was largely taken up by those who followed him in the England XIs - especially by Hutton, who was a fine enough technician to play slow bowling without coming out to meet it. To the ordinary mortal it is fatal to so surrender the initiative to slow bowling.|$|E
2500|$|In 1830, Joseph Travis {{purchased}} Turner {{and became}} his master. Turner later recalled that Travis was [...] "a kind master" [...] who had [...] "placed the greatest confidence in" [...] him. Turner eagerly anticipated God's signal {{to start his}} task of [...] "slay my enemies with their own weapons". [...] Turner witnessed a solar eclipse on February 12, 1831, and was convinced {{that this was the}} sign for which he was waiting. Following in the steps of the late Denmark Vesey of South Carolina, he started preparations for a [...] "rising" [...] or rebellion against the white slaveholders of Southampton County by purchasing muskets. Turner [...] "communicated the great work laid out [...] to do, to four in <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the greatest confidence"– his fellow slaves Henry, Hark, Nelson and Sam.|$|E
2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> enjoyed watching on the box for some time. For my first few episodes, I walked around with a big smile on my face, grinning at everybody. It was funny." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 7 November 1455 the retrial {{opened at}} Notre Dame Cathedral. Joan's family were present, and Isabelle made an impassioned speech which began: [...] "I had a {{daughter}} born in lawful wedlock, <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> furnished worthily with the sacraments of baptism and confirmation and had reared in the fear of God {{and respect for the}} tradition of the Church... yet although she never did think, conceive, or do anything whatever which set her out of the path of the faith... certain enemies ... had her arraigned in religious trial... in a trial perfidious, violent, iniquitous, and without shadow of right... did they condemn her in a fashion damnable and criminal, and put her to death very cruelly by fire... for the damnation of their souls and in notorious, infamous, and irreparable damage done to me, Isabelle, and mine".|$|E
2500|$|I {{honestly}} thought after Ligonier that we {{were beginning}} {{a new era of}} cooperation and Orthodox unity on this continent. For {{the first time since the}} early years of our presence in the Americas, it seemed there was a common vision, or at least a common goal of working together, not just for the sake of working together, but toward a canonically proper end of a unified Church. For me, the chance to sit down with brother bishops, many of <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never met, was a great and awesome experience. What made this experience great and awesome, besides just getting [...] together, was that [...] there was a purpose. Often we had gotten together in the past, but just for social purposes or anniversaries, celebrations, etc. This time it was for the good of the Church. Unfortunately, [...] what happened in the aftermath of Ligonier left us further apart and more disunited than we were in the years that led up to that historic gathering.|$|E
2500|$|When I was {{at first}} asked to attend the St. Louis World's Fair I {{did not wish to}} go. Later, when I was told that I would receive good {{attention}} and protection, and that the President of the United States said that it would be all right, I consented ... Every Sunday the President of the Fair sent for me to go to a wild west show. I took part in the roping contests before the audience. There were many other Indian tribes there, and strange people of <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never heard ... I am glad I went to the Fair. I saw many interesting things and learned much of the white people. They are a very kind and peaceful people. During all the time I was at the Fair no one tried to harm me in any way. Had this been among the Mexicans I am sure I should have been compelled to defend myself often.|$|E
