500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I guess this is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak.|$|E
500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a {{postcard}} from Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to you. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin to tell you how Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E

2500|$|Fry {{struggled}} to keep his homosexuality secret during his teenage years at public school, and by his own account did not engage in sexual activity for 16 years from 1979 until 1995. When asked when he first acknowledged his sexuality, Fry quipped: [...] "I suppose it all began <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the womb. I looked back up at my mother and thought to myself, 'That's the last time I'm going up one of those'." [...] Fry was in a 15-year relationship with Daniel Cohen, which ended in 2010. In 2016, Fry was listed number 2 on the World Pride Power list.|$|E
2500|$|The Seder is {{a ritual}} {{performed}} by a community or by multiple generations of a family, involving a retelling {{of the story of}} the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. [...] This story is in the Book of Exodus (Shemot) in The Hebrew Bible. [...] The Seder itself is based on the Biblical verse commanding Jews to retell the story of the Exodus from Egypt: [...] "You shall tell your child on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of Egypt.'" [...] (Exodus 13:8) Traditionally, families and friends gather in the evening to read the text of the Haggadah, an ancient work derived from the Mishnah (Pesahim 10). The Haggadah contains the narrative of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, special blessings and rituals, commentaries from the Talmud, and special Passover songs.|$|E
2500|$|Rabban Gamaliel {{said that}} one needed to mention three things on Passover to {{discharge}} one's duty: the Passover offering, unleavened bread ( [...] , matzah), and bitter herbs (maror). The Passover offering was sacrificed because God passed over the Israelites' houses in Egypt. They ate unleavened bread because the Israelites were redeemed from Egypt. And they ate bitter herbs because the Egyptians embittered {{the lives of the}} Israelites in Egypt. In every generation, all were bound to regard themselves as though they personally had gone out of Egypt, because [...] says, [...] "You shall tell your child in that day: ‘It is because of what the Lord did for me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of Egypt.'" [...] Therefore, it was everyone's duty to thank and praise God for performing those miracles for the Israelites and their descendants. God brought them forth from bondage into freedom, from sorrow into joy, from mourning into festivity, from darkness into light, and from servitude into redemption. Therefore, they were to say hallelujah! ...|$|E

2500|$|Crazy Horse spoke {{this story}} to Flying Hawk: ‘I {{was sitting on a}} hill or rise, and {{something}} touched me on the head. [...] I felt for it and found {{it was a bit of}} grass. I took it to look at. [...] There was a trail nearby and I followed it. [...] It led to water. [...] I went into the water. There the trail ended and I sat down in the water. [...] I was nearly out of breath. I started to rise out of the water, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> I was born by my mother. When I was born I could know and see and understand for a time, but afterwards went back to it as a baby. [...] Then I grew up naturally. [...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse. [...] We jumped on him, my brother and I double, and escaped." ...|$|E
2500|$|The men of {{the convoy}} then began {{launching}} boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the Shinyō Maru were also opened up on the Allied personnel. Marine Corps Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; [...] "Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught {{all three of us}} and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out my chin. Nevertheless, I was able to work myself back up on deck, and I was eyeing that bridge <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found out that we were out in the ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth." [...] Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by firing squad as punishment for trying to escape. One of those men was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again. The Japanese dropped 45 depth charges and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt. After that, she surfaced and began patrolling the area again.|$|E
