500|$|Reflections from {{athletes and}} {{officials}} provide {{an insight into}} {{the value of this}} inaugural event. Bill Mather-Brown, an Australian athlete, said [...] "The 1962 Games <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had been asked for an autograph. We regarded it as a compliment. We were mobbed, especially at the swimming pool. Sometimes we [...] were not sure people really wanted our signature or were just being polite and wanted us to feel good".|$|E
500|$|Gielgud {{was in the}} Oxford {{company in}} January and February 1924, from October 1924 {{to the end of}} January 1925, and in August 1925. He played a wide range of parts in {{classics}} and modern plays, greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process. The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in The Cherry Orchard, his first experience of Chekhov: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever went out on stage feeling that perhaps, after all, I could really be an actor." ...|$|E

500|$|Berg {{was born}} in Norwalk, Connecticut. The son of Barbara (Freedman) Berg and film {{producer}} Dick Berg, Berg was raised Jewish. When Berg was eight, his family relocated to Los Angeles, California. While a sophomore at Palisades Charter High School, Berg researched the author F. Scott Fitzgerald (a favorite of Barbara's, who named her son in part after Fitzgerald) for a report and [...] "developed a mania" [...] for his writing. Berg read all of Fitzgerald's works and later recalled: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw the fusion of an artist and his life, a tragic and romantic life." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Monkhouse as Space Navigator Brad Newman. Monkhouse, {{an actor}} in such films as Carry On Sergeant (1958), would later host the British game show The Golden Shot between 1967 and 1972. He first {{approached}} Gerry Anderson for permission to film a comedy sketch based on Stingray, but ended up agreeing to replace Alfred Marks, who had withdrawn from the film due to a fee dispute, as Newman. Monkhouse recalled the conversation: [...] " [...] said, 'How much would you charge for the job?' I said, 'Gerry, I'd do it for nothing.' And that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever heard the phrase, 'The price is right'." [...] He affected an American accent for his parts in the film.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller {{received}} a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and {{talking to me about}} the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things". He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1966, Pink Floyd {{had gained}} a {{reliable}} management team in Andrew King and Peter Jenner. Towards the end of October 1966, Pink Floyd, with King and Jenner, set up Blackhill Enterprises, to manage the group's finances. Blackhill was staffed by lodgers Jenner found in his Edbrooke Road house, and among others, Barrett's flatmate, Peter Wynne Wilson (who became road manager, however, since he had more experience in lighting, he was also lighting assistant). King and Jenner wanted to prepare some demo recordings for a possible record deal, {{so at the end}} of October, they booked a session at Thompson Private Recording Studio, in Hemel Hempstead. King said of the demos: [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> realised they were going to write all their own material, Syd just turned into a songwriter, it seemed like overnight." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band played}} its first gig in May 1967, and had its first major break at the 7th National Jazz and Blues Festival in Windsor on 13 August. Oldham {{had managed to}} secure a {{separate}} set for the group in a side tent away from also accompanying Arnold on the main stage, where they gained attention. The next week, Welch wrote in the Melody Maker that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had seen a group actually {{in the act of}} winning its first following in quite dramatic circumstances". When Arnold went back to her family in the US shortly afterwards, Oldham offered the group a contract of their own. Hague was not interested in the [...] "progressive" [...] direction the group wanted to go in, so he was replaced by former Mark Leeman Five and Habits drummer Brian Davison.|$|E
500|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, Ramsey was conscripted into the British Army on 24 June 1940. He was assigned to the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and underwent his initial training in Truro, where he and other recruits were housed in a hotel commandeered by the army. Ramsey found the experience a thrilling adventure. [...] "Until I travelled to Cornwall, the longest journey I had undertaken was a trip to Brighton by train," [...] he recalled. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had ever been into a hotel! Even with us sleeping twelve to a room, on straw mattresses, could not end for me the awe of living in a swagger hotel." [...] "That set the tone for Alf's war," [...] Leo McKinstry suggests in his 2010 biography; attached to his regiment's 6th Battalion, Ramsey spent the entire war in Britain on home defence duties. The training was still physically demanding though, and, in Ramsey's words, made him [...] "a fitter young fellow than when I reported for duty as a grocery apprentice from Dagenham".|$|E

500|$|The second track, [...] "July 1st" [...] was {{composed}} by Nagao and Hamasaki. Japanese disc jockey Cool-K also included additional scratching on the track. As H was released during the Japanese summer, Hamasaki decided to incorporate a [...] "summer vibe" [...] to the tracks and, according to Tomita, [...] "July 1st" [...] was her strongest song to feature this. These themes {{had also been}} explored throughout I Am.... The lyrical content is [...] "uplifting and cheerful" [...] and talks about fun experiences; Hamasaki commented, [...] "This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had ever written a song [...] from this viewpoint, and I even surprised myself!" [...] "Hanabi" [...] talks about Hamasaki's views of the world, and discusses personal nostalgia. Hamasaki wanted the songs to be deeper, and Tomita commented that [...] "Hanabi" [...] {{was the first time}} he saw Hamasaki feel more engaged with global artists and incorporating those influences, rather than simply being influenced by Japanese music. [...] "Hanabi"'s title was written in English characters, and is the Japanese word for fireworks. The title was re-used on her single & for the track [...] "Hanabi (Episode II)".|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the miniseries' cynosural song [...] "Everything Stays", Nyström {{revealed}} that, during the storyboarding of the episode of the same name, she found herself unable to write a lullaby for the scene between Marceline and her mother. She relayed her issue to Muto, who contacted Sugar {{and asked if she}} would be willing to pen the song. Sugar agreed and based the song on an incident in which she lost a stuffed animal in a garden. A year later, she found it; the sun had bleached the exposed surfaces, but the underside was still the same. She explained, [...] " [...] wasn’t better, or worse, just different. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> realized that things will change no matter what, even if they’re left alone, and stay completely still." [...] Muto was excited to have Sugar return to work on the show, and noted at the 2015 Adventure Time San Diego Comic-Con International panel that [...] "because [...] was a Marceline miniseries, it wouldn't really feel complete unless Rebecca Sugar wrote a song for it." [...] At San Diego Comic-Con, Sugar and Olson performed the song live.|$|E
500|$|In September, {{the album}} entered Billboards album charts; the highest {{position}} Freewheelin reached was number 22, but it eventually came to sell one {{million copies in}} the US. Dylan himself came to acknowledge Freewheelin as the album that marked {{the start of his}} success. During his dispute with Albert Grossman, Dylan stated in a deposition: [...] "Although I didn't know it at the time, the second album was destined to become a great success because it was to include 'Blowin' in the Wind'." [...] Besides [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Girl from the North Country", [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" [...] and [...] "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" [...] have all been acclaimed as masterpieces, and they have been mainstays of Dylan's performing repertory to the present day. The album's balance between serious subject matter and levity, earnest finger-pointing songs and surreal jokes captured a wide audience, including The Beatles, who were on the cusp of global success. John Lennon recalled: [...] "In Paris in 1964 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever heard Dylan at all. Paul got the record (The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan) from a French DJ. For three weeks in Paris we didn't stop playing it. We all went potty about Dylan." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{friend of}} Richmond's father co-owned a sprint car and Richmond joined {{the team as}} a crew member for Dave Shoemaker. In 1976, 21-year-old Richmond took the car onto Lakeville Speedway at Lakeville, Ohio for some {{practice}} laps. [...] "Somebody put a stopwatch on me," [...] Richmond said. [...] "I was running laps faster than Dave had been. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had ever driven a race car." [...] Richmond and his father found a red, white and blue-colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania, which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child. In his first competition at the track, officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat. He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle. Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction, the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight. After being towed to the pits, he parked the car {{for the rest of}} the event. Later that season, they towed the car to Eldora Speedway, only to have Richmond crash the car again. In response, Richmond's father fired him as the driver. The next season, Al Richmond bought a SuperModified better suited to his son's driving style. [...] In 1977 Tim Richmond became both Sandusky Speedway's Rookie of the Year and the SuperModified class track champion.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E

In high school, Fortney was {{interested}} in baseball until the audience reaction he got playing John Mellencamp’s [...] "Small Town" [...] for the school talent show made an impression on him. Although he had played guitar for a while, he didn’t start writing music until he wrote a song for a friend’s funeral.

[...] In the sketch, Chappelle is wearing blackface and is dressed as a character in a minstrel show. According to Chappelle, during the filming of the sketch, a white crew member was laughing {{in a way that made}} him feel uncomfortable and made him question himself.
