25|$|One {{feature of}} BBN {{is that the}} {{physical}} laws and constants that govern the behavior of matter at these energies are very well understood, and hence BBN lacks some of the speculative uncertainties that characterize earlier periods {{in the life of}} the universe. Another feature is that the process of nucleosynthesis is determined by conditions at the start of this phase of the life of the universe, and proceeds independently of <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
500|$|At one point, Angelou's lover from Ghana, {{whom she}} calls [...] "the African", arrives in Los Angeles {{to take her}} back to Accra. [...] Angelou enlists the aid {{of her mother and}} brother; they come to her rescue once again by {{diverting}} the African first to Mexico and then back to Ghana. [...] Guy, during a visit to his grandmother in San Francisco, gets into another car accident, similar to <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> he began college in Ghana. [...] His maturity is striking to his mother, and she leaves him in the care of his grandmother.|$|E
500|$|Some sources {{describe}} {{the subjects of}} Lichtenstein's tragic girls series as heroines (in {{the sense that they}} are the counterparts to the heroes), and others do not (in the sense that they are not heroic). Drowning Girl is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in {{to the power of the}} ocean than call for aid. Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water. As her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them. Because Lichtenstein only presents a single frame, the viewer does not know <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> this moment and what is going to happen after it. [...] Furthermore, the viewer has no way to know who Brad is and why she is so reluctant to call him.|$|E

[...] As for releasing current inmates, Clinton focuses on nonviolent offenders.|$|R

2500|$|After {{viewing the}} {{shooting}} from multiple angles, police use-of-force expert Roy Bedard {{changed his mind}} about his opinion, saying: [...] "I hate to say this, it looks like an execution to me" [...] and [...] "It really looks bad for the officer." [...] University of San Francisco law professor Robert Talbot said the videos could support a claim of an accidental shooting: [...] "Nothing about his body looks murderous." [...] Attorney Harland Braun, who won acquittal for an officer in the Rodney King beating, noted that video evidence can be deceptive. Footage does not show <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> or after an incident.|$|E
2500|$|To {{argue in}} favor of this thesis, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a {{prominent}} German philosopher, says, [...] "The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> will happen in the same way again. … From which it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never have occurred to us to think of them…" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the Yom Kippur War, Israeli {{intelligence}} could not conclusively determine that an attack was imminent. However, on October 5, 1973, Meir received official news that Syrian forces were massing on the Golan Heights. The prime minister was alarmed by the reports, and felt that the situation reminded her of <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> the Six-Day War. Her advisers, however, assured her not to worry, saying that they would have adequate notice before a war broke out. This made sense at the time, since after the Six-Day War, most Israelis felt it unlikely that the Arabs would attack. Consequently, although a resolution was passed granting her power to demand a full-scale call-up of the military (instead of the typical cabinet decision), Meir did not mobilize Israel's forces early. Soon, though, the threat of war became very clear. Six hours before the outbreak of hostilities, Meir met with Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan and general David Elazar. While Dayan continued to argue that war was unlikely and [...] was thus in favor of calling up the air force and only two divisions, Elazar advocated full scale army mobilization and the launch of a full-scale preemptive strike on Syrian forces.|$|E

40|$|This study {{importantly}} {{changes the}} focus to <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>before</b> a famine comes, {{and how the}} peasants prepare for it. Paradoxically, the author concludes {{that it is in}} the years of recovery that the seeds of famine are sown. The study revolves around a case study in the awraja (district) in the Ambassel Wollo province in northeastern Ethiopia. The author also critically examines other literature on famine response...|$|R
2500|$|Georgia, {{and some}} Western diplomats in Tbilisi later {{questioned}} Grist's objectivity. The OSCE curbed the attempts by The New York Times {{to interview the}} monitors, saying {{they would not be}} publicly engaged in disagreement. Terhi Hakala, head of the OSCE mission to Georgia, called the monitors' claims [...] "a bit irrelevant." [...] OSCE Deputy Spokeswoman Virginie Coulloudon told the journalists that the organization's monitors make [...] "patrol reports" [...] from the ground [...] "on a daily basis." [...] Coulloudon also said that [...] "the OSCE is not in a capacity to say who started the war and <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> the night of [...] 7-8." [...] Journalists documented dozens of eyewitnesses' accounts that confirmed the reports that Pro-Moscow separatist forces had been shelling the Georgian villages before August 7. The eyewitness accounts are also consistent with a report issued on 5 August 2008, by a tripartite monitoring group, which included Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) observers and representatives of Russian peacekeepers in the region. The report, signed by the commander of Russian peacekeepers, General Marat Kulakhmetov, said there was evidence of attacks against ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia. The report also stated that South Ossetian separatists were using heavy weapons against the Georgian villages, which was prohibited by a 1992 cease-fire agreement.|$|E
2500|$|A {{similar case}} {{involved}} Clive Wearing, an accomplished musicologist who contracted a cold sore virus that attacked his brain, causing herpes simplex encephalitis. As a result, Wearing developed both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, {{so he has}} little memory of <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>before</b> the virus struck him in 1985, and cannot learn new declarative knowledge after the virus struck him either. As a result of anterograde amnesia, Wearing repeatedly [...] "wakes up" [...] every day usually in 30-second intervals. [...] He {{has a history of}} repeatedly recording these moments of waking up in his journal (e.g., On Sept 2, 2013 I woke up, etc. etc.) and crossing out prior entries, as if the other moments of waking up were not real. [...] His episodic memory is nonfunctional (so he does not consciously recall having woken up 30 seconds prior). [...] Clive is often elated to see his wife, as if he has not seen her for a while. [...] Despite this, however, Wearing maintained his ability to play the piano and conduct choirs. This case is significant because it demonstrates declarative and procedural memory are separate. Therefore, despite anterograde amnesia preventing Wearing from learning new bits of information that can be explained in words (declarative memory), and also preventing him from storing new memories of events or episodes (also part of declarative memory), he has little trouble in retaining his musical abilities (procedural memory), though he has no conscious memory of having learned music.|$|E

The subject of Ali's most well-known gouache paintings are the Greenheads - characters designed to minimize or eliminate categorical differences of gender, height, age, and in some ways race.|$|R
