5|$|Mills came {{to public}} {{attention}} when she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> in 1993 and was involved {{a collision with}} a police motorcycle in London. The accident resulted in the amputation of her left leg below the knee, but she continued to model by using a prosthetic limb and sold her story to a tabloid newspaper.|$|E
5|$|The Birmingham {{campaign}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> of nonviolent {{direct action}} protest and, through the media, drew the world's attention to racial segregation in the South. It burnished King's reputation, ousted Connor from his job, forced desegregation in Birmingham, and directly {{paved the way}} for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibited racial discrimination in hiring practices and public services throughout the United States.|$|E
5|$|Born François-Marie Arouet, Voltaire (1694–1778), by {{the time}} of the Lisbon earthquake, was already a {{well-established}} author, known for his satirical wit. He had been made a member of the Académie Française in 1746. He was a deist, a strong proponent of religious freedom, and a critic of tyrannical governments. Candide became part of his large, diverse body of philosophical, political and artistic works expressing these views. More specifically, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> for the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century novels called the contes philosophiques. This genre, of which Voltaire was one of the founders, included previous works of his such as Zadig and Micromegas.|$|E

5|$|Dietrich Wildung {{proposed}} that the bust in Berlin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> for official portraits and {{was used by the}} master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added. Gardner's Art Through the Ages and Silverman presents a similar view that the bust was deliberately kept unfinished. Hawass suggested that Thutmose had created the left eye, but it was later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} edition, {{published}} in 1539, Calvin dropped this format {{in favour of}} systematically presenting the main doctrines from the Bible. In the process, the book was enlarged from six chapters to seventeen. He concurrently worked on another book, the Commentary on Romans, {{which was published in}} March 1540. The book <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin Vulgate, an exegesis, and an exposition. In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised the work of his predecessors Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger, and Martin Bucer, but he also took care to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|He {{was said}} to have been crowned by St Humbert (Bishop Humbert of Elmham) on 25 December 855, at a {{location}} known as Burna (probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk) which at that time functioned as the royal capital. Later versions of his life recorded that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> king who treated all his subjects with equal justice and who was unbending to flatterers. It was written that he withdrew for a year to his royal tower at Hunstanton and learned the whole Psalter, so that he could recite it from memory.|$|E

His mother, Janice (Smalls), <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an {{associate}} of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin {{was shot to death}} while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old.|$|E
5|$|The Viva Piñata team <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> for {{productivity}} and regular output within Rare and Microsoft Studios. Though {{compared to the}} 12-person teams behind earlier Rare games, the company's Xbox 360 development teams consisted of 50 to 60 people. The Viva Piñata team included about 50 people at its zenith. Microsoft transitioned its development teams to use its XNA package to streamline and reduce duplication in engineering efforts. Microsoft pressured the Viva Piñata development team to keep the game's themes children-friendly, as the parent company planned for the game and resulting franchise to increase the market appeal of their Xbox 360. In 2006, a Microsoft Games executive called the game its most important franchise. But its reception was tepid.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{considered}} a yardstick by which limited-access highway construction would be measured. Commission chairman Jones called for more limited-access roads to be built across the country for defense purposes, and the turnpike <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> for a proposed national network of highways planned during World War II. The Pennsylvania Turnpike led {{to the construction of}} other toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and (eventually) the Interstate Highway System. It has been designated a National Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.|$|E
50|$|In {{statistics}} {{there can}} be models of mental events as well as models of physical events. For example, <b>a</b> statistical <b>model</b> of customer behavior <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> that <b>is</b> conceptual (because behavior <b>is</b> physical), but <b>a</b> statistical <b>model</b> of customer satisfaction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> of <b>a</b> concept (because satisfaction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mental not a physical event).|$|R
