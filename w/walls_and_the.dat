5|$|During the Samaritan {{revolt of}} 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on {{the orders of}} the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, {{supported}} by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in a mosaic.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, the {{congregation}} voted {{by a margin}} of over two to one to re-orient the synagogue pews in the manner of Christian churches, and introduce mixed seating. However, nothing was done about this until 1879, when the renovations were carried out: the front pews were removed, the side pews extended to the <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vestibule moved outside the sanctuary. Led by rabbi Dr. E. M. Myers, the synagogue was re-dedicated on September 7.|$|E

5|$|Other Roman remains include part of {{the town}} <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{foundations}} of a town house near the county hall. Modern building works within the walls have unearthed Roman finds; in 1936 a cache of 22,000 3rd-century Roman coins was discovered in South Street. Other Roman finds include silver and copper coins known as Dorn pennies, a gold ring, a bronze figure of the Roman god Mercury and large areas of tessellated pavement.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{rebuilt the}} <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gatehouses at Launceston, {{building}} a high tower {{to increase the}} height of the keep, probably to allow guests to enjoy the view of his deer park. The bailey was cleared of its older buildings and a new great hall was constructed in the south-west corner. The castle's inhabitants ate well, enjoying a wide range of food including prime cuts of venison brought into the castle, probably mostly from the larger deer parks belonging to the earldom across the region.|$|E

5|$|A quadrangular castle, Bodiam {{is roughly}} square-shaped. This type of castle, {{with a central}} {{courtyard}} and buildings against the curtain wall, was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century. Bodiam Castle {{has been described by}} military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle. There are circular towers at each of the four corners, with square central towers in the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle. There is a second entrance from the south; the postern gate is through a square tower {{in the middle of the}} south wall. The towers are three storeys high, taller than the curtain <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> buildings in the castle which are two storeys high.|$|E
5|$|After {{civil war}} broke out in England in 1135, the third earl, also called William, set about {{improving}} the defences of the castle. He began to build a tall keep {{on top of the}} motte, reinforcing the surrounding earthworks with stone walls. A planned settlement was established alongside the castle, surrounded by its own earthworks and <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Peddars Way was redirected to pass by the castle, town and priory, all important symbols of the de Warennes' power in the region. Hamelin de Warenne acquired the castle through marriage and curtailed the building work on the keep around 1165, but completed the construction of three large stone gatehouses in the castle and town. One of these, the town's bailey gate, still survives intact.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E

5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of}} a wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of the}} wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections {{on top of a}} wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
5|$|Greyfriars, in Bristol, England, was a Franciscan friary. The name Greyfriars {{derived from}} the grey robes worn by the friars. It was founded at some time before 1234, within the town walls and then moved to Lewin's Mead in 1250. The site {{included}} extensive gardens surrounded by a stone wall. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the sixteenth century, the premises were leased to the town council in 1541, who desired to use the stone to make repairs to the town <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> harbour facilities. In succeeding centuries many different uses have {{been made of the}} site, which is currently occupied by an office block and part of Bristol Dental School.|$|E
5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses {{to counter the}} threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E

5|$|Significant leaks in {{the roof}} were {{reported}} in 1997 and a massive restoration project took place. This entailed fixing the roof, repainting the <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> niche housing the statue of the Immaculate Conception, replacing tiles, enhancing the lighting and sound system and installing new stained glass windows in the Chapel of Our Lord's Passion, which was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs. The renovation was completed on 8 December 2002 and cost a total of US$1.1 million. The project's success in preserving the building's heritage resulted in the cathedral being given an honourable mention at the 2003 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation and presented with the award on its anniversary in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The British {{arrival in}} Jerusalem heralded a {{rational}} philosophy of infrastructure planning and development. It respected cultural and historic heritage {{and attempted to}} preserve such elements within the blossoming construction of the modern city. The city walls were identified as such an element, so British workers acted to clear away the stalls on their perimeter and maintain an open area between the <b>walls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the New City {{in the interest of}} an aesthetically pleasing visual basin. By the same token, planners demolished the Ottoman clock tower to preserve a historic skyline.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine army, led by Tzimiskes {{in person}} and {{numbering}} 30,000–40,000, advanced quickly and reached Preslav unmolested. The Rus' army was defeated in a battle before the city <b>walls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines proceeded to lay siege. The Rus' and Bulgarian garrison under the Rus' noble Sphangel put up a determined resistance, but the city was stormed on 13 April. Among the captives were Boris II and his family, who were brought to Constantinople along with the Bulgarian imperial regalia. The main Rus' force under Sviatoslav withdrew before the imperial army towards Dorostolon on the Danube. As Sviatoslav feared a Bulgarian uprising, he had 300 Bulgarian nobles executed, and imprisoned many others. The imperial army advanced without hindrance; the Bulgarian garrisons of the various forts and strongholds along the way surrendered peacefully.|$|E

According to the measured geo-stress data, through FEM <b>and</b> combined with <b>the</b> linear multivariate regression method, the geo-stress field was conducted.
