She rented rooms in a large house near the park, spent a generous 21st birthday present on equipping the kitchen, and learned to cook. A gift from her mother of The Gentle Art of Cookery by Hilda Leyel was her first cookery book.

500|$|In {{modern times}} Mrs. Beeton's {{practice}} has been criticised as plagiarism; Beeton's modern biographer Kathryn Hughes talks of her [...] "lifting" [...] and [...] "brazenly copying" [...] recipes from others, {{and says that}} this was [...] "the way that cookery books had been put together from time immemorial ...". The New York Times said, [...] "Isabella [...] plagiarised only the best". [...] This led to the comment that [...] "Mrs Beeton couldn't cook but she could copy". Hughes recounts that Beeton's [...] "first recipe for Victoria sponge was so inept that she left out the eggs" [...] and that her work was [...] "brazenly copied... almost word for word, from books {{as far back as}} the Restoration". The influential 20th-century food writer Elizabeth David dismissed her as [...] "a plagiarist" [...] and later wrote: [...] "I wonder if I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> learned to cook at all if I had been given a routine Mrs Beeton to learn from".|$|E
500|$|Roughly a {{year into}} development, the team {{discovered}} that their second producer—the first having quit Origin {{near the beginning of}} development—had left the project. Neurath later said that [...] "neither [...] had much involvement" [...] in the game, and that, following the second's departure, the team spent time without any producer at all. Rumors circulated that Origin planned to cancel the project. Following a proposal by the team around this time, Spector, who had previously worked with Neurath on Space Rogue, assumed the role of producer. Church later described this event as [...] "a big win for everyone". Spector began to interact regularly with the team by phone and to visit the studio in person. Neurath later said, [...] "Warren understood immediately {{what we were trying to}} accomplish with the game, and became our biggest champion within Origin. Had not Warren stepped in this role at that stage, I'm not sure Ultima Underworld <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen the light of day." [...] Church said that Spector helped the team polish the game and [...] "make it real", and that Spector's past experience in the industry enabled him to keep the team focused on completing the game. He explained that Spector [...] "had that ability to help me and the rest of the guys reset, from the big-picture view of someone who has done it before." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{enthusiastic}} review {{came from}} The Wire, which felt that: [...] "In the end, Vespertine commits its magic by daring to go places more obvious and more human than one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> expected." [...] Calling it [...] "one {{of the most}} impressive and cohesive" [...] albums of the year, Tiny Mix Tapes found Vespertine to be Björk's most effective use of the studio as an instrument. Simon Reynolds, praised it in Uncut saying [...] "Her best yet, {{it reminds me of the}} jackfrost wonderland of Cocteau Twins circa In The Gold Dust Rush, of the bejewelled coldness of Siouxsie and the Banshees circa A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. The glittering sound fits the album's idea of inner riches, the treasure people keep hidden inside." [...] Katy Widder, writer for PopMatters, believed the album was a masterpiece, stating that it challenged the predominant theories of rock music and gender, particularly a statement made by Simon Reynolds and Joy Press in the acclaimed book, The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll: [...] "Women have seized rock 'n' roll and usurped it for their own expressive purposes, but we've yet to see a radical feminization of rock itself." [...] Chris Smith of Stylus Magazine praised the album for its nuance and delicacy, describing its sonic palette as [...] "a breath of fresh air." [...] Noting that Vespertine showed a more mature side of the singer, musicOMH's Michael Hubbard wrote that [...] "It sounds like Björk has grown up while that would be a pity, it is also fascinating for anyone who loves her music. She is a legend in her time." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Business School" [...] was {{the second}} Office episode written by Brent Forrester. [...] Forrester had {{previously}} written [...] "The Merger". [...] The episode {{was the first to}} be directed by Joss Whedon. [...] Whedon, who is a friend of both producer Greg Daniels and Jenna Fischer, and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode [...] "because I already know the writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and I adore the show." [...] When informed that the episode was about a bat entering into the office and one of the characters pretending to be a vampire, Whedon thought that it was a joke, stating [...] "Didn't I just leave this party?" [...] in reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [...] In an interview featured on the third season DVD, Whedon joked that the [...] "Business School" [...] episode and his former TV show were very similar because [...] "Buffy [...] was sad and depressing but... it was funny. Especially when people died. And {{a lot of people do}} die in [...]" [...] But upon completing the episode, Whedon stated [...] "That was just coincidence. But that's how that happened. God, it was fun." [...] Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script. [...] "I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it...But way more input was asked for than I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> anticipated." [...] At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted didn't suit Whedon. [...] "I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right.'" [...] Whedon said that he held up filming for over an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art.|$|E
500|$|Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it was {{favorable}} of {{the early}} pairing of Tucker and Ashley, giving them an [...] "honorable mention" [...] {{on a list of}} [...] "curiously quirky couplings". Candace Young of the website She Knows Soaps wrote that, [...] "Ashley and Tucker have been interesting as a power couple, if you will, in business and the corporate world." [...] In January 2011, Garrett awarded Nichols a [...] "Leading Men Gold Standard" [...] and praised his portrayal that week, writing: [...] "Stephen Nichols as Tucker was all over the place this week. Initially Tucker decided to back the recording label of Devon Winters and Noah Newman. Nichols played a man who wanted to help two young men break into the music industry. However, the shocking news that Cane and Sofia have been lying to Tucker and allowing a conman to swindle Tucker’s company was destined to be revealed. Although the climax came {{at the end of the}} week, the intensity in which Stephen Nichols played the revelation was exciting to say the least. Fans know that next week Tucker McCall’s going to cause heads to roll." [...] Jae Jones of Yahoo! praised the storyline revealing Tucker as Devon's father as it gave the soap opera's matriarch, Katherine, a biracial grandson. She wrote: [...] "What seems to make the story line even more interesting is the fact that she has a biracial grandson. Who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> thought the show could catch up with the current times? There are not too many daytime soaps left for housewives and house husbands to enjoy, but those who watch this show are always in for a special treat each afternoon." [...] They later named the storyline the [...] "best reveal" [...] of 2011.|$|E
500|$|Led by league MVP Tittle, {{who passed}} for over 3,000yards and 36 touchdowns, the Giants had an 11–3 record in 1963. They set what remains the NFL's {{record for most}} points in a 14-game season by scoring 448. They {{advanced}} to face the Chicago Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field, New York's defense played well, but Chicago's newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times (including one returned for a score) and injured Tittle {{in the first half}} (though he finished the game). Several Giants players including linebacker Huff pleaded with Sherman to replace the hobbled Tittle, who the players felt was pressing and committing too many turnovers, from playing the second half. Sherman however, had little alternative. [...] "The old man kept saying 'I can do it. I feel a little better'" [...] Sherman recalled. [...] "We had a young quarterback (Glynn Griffing), he had gone to get married a couple of weeks earlier but failed to come back in the days he said he would. We couldn't use him." [...] The Giants defense, led by Hall of Famer Huff, held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat. New York had a chance to take a 14–0 lead in the first quarter but wide receiver Del Shofner dropped a potential touchdown in the end zone, a drop he said in 2010, that he feels would have won the Giants the game. [...] "I was alone in the end zone—ball right into my hands, nobody around me—and I dropped the ball...as good a defense as we had that year, I don't think the Berar <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> come back from being down 14–0." [...] On the next play, Tittle threw an interception to Chicago linebacker Larry Morris, which he returned to the New York five-yard line. Two plays later, the Bears tied the game.|$|E

2500|$|At {{any given}} price, a {{prospective}} buyer has some marginal rate of substitution {{of money for}} the good or service in question. [...] Given the [...] "law" [...] of diminishing marginal utility, or otherwise given convex indifference curves, the rates are such that the willingness to forgo money for the good or service decreases as the buyer <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> more of the good or service and ever less money. [...] Hence, any given buyer has a demand schedule that generally decreases in response to price (at least until quantity demanded reaches zero). [...] The aggregate quantity demanded by all buyers is, at any given price, just the sum of the quantities demanded by individual buyers, so it too decreases as price increases.|$|E
