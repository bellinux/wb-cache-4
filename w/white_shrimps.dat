40|$|<b>White</b> <b>shrimps</b> have a {{important}} economic value for pond fishery in Kendal Regency. Problem that often occurred, which prevents the fishery harvest, related to WSSV (White Spot Syndrome Virus) and TSV (Taura Syndrome Virus). Such phenomenon led {{an idea to}} {{a study on the}} incidence of WSSV and TSV viruses in <b>White</b> <b>shrimps</b> (Litopenaeus vannamei). In case of this study, objects to be examined were intensive, semi-intensive, and traditional ponds located in Kendal Regency. This study aimed to find out the incidence of WSSV and TSV exposures to the shrimp ponds in Kendal that applied intensive, semi-intensive, and traditional technologies. Using a PCR test and histopathology examination on the <b>White</b> <b>shrimps</b> (Litopenaeus vannamei), the study was carried out from June to September 2009. The study used was a survey method, in which samples were obtained by means of a purposive random sampling. Objects of the sampling consisted of intensive (T 1), semi-intensive (T 2), and traditional (T 3) ponds. These shrimp samples were then subject to a PCR test at BBAP Jepara to investigate exposures or incidents of the WSSV and TSV in the sample animals. The PCR analysis was done descriptively. Results of the study showed that the WSSV-generated disease in the <b>White</b> <b>shrimps</b> (L. vannamei) was still found at the T 3 (traditional) ponds. It was also shown that at the TSV-generated disease occurred at both T 1 (intensive) and T 2 (semi-intensive) ponds. Meanwhile, the PCR test assumed that 30 day-old shrimps at the T 1, T 2, and T 3 ponds were resistant to the TSV-generated disease. However, an observation at the T 3 ponds detected WSSV viruses. In addition, this study also reported that ponds with intensive and semi-intensive technologies have good biosecurity system to minimize the incidents of WSSV and TSV in <b>White</b> <b>shrimps</b> (Litopenaeus vannamei).

Vitamin-free casein {{was used as}} reference protein. To verify in vitro results, a feeding experiment was conducted using 300 shrimps with average initial weight of 0. 075 g. The shrimps were fed isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets containing test ingredients with high (27. 6 % - 33. 7 %) and low (4. 0 %- 10. 5 %) digestibility for 61 days. Seawater temperature ranged from 26 to 29 Â°C and salinity from 30 to 33 ppt. Defatted soybean meal (27. 2 % digestibility) was used as control. Growth and survival were determined. Animal proteins (40. 9 %- 90. 9 %) were more digestible than plant proteins (0. 0 %- 33. 7 %), although digestibility of papaya leaf meal (33. 7 %) was comparable with those of shrimp head meal (40. 9 %) and Peruvian fish meal (40. 7 %). Green mungbean meal was most digestible (27. 6 %) among the legumes. Protein digestibility of defatted soybean meal (27. 2 %) {{was significantly higher than}} that of unprocessed soybean meal (9. 4 %). Black cowpea meal and ricebean meal were not digestible. Results also showed that <b>white</b> <b>shrimps</b> given a diet containing cassava leaves performed best with weight gain, specific growth rate, and survival (706. 4 %, 3. 44 and 49 %) comparable with white cowpea meal (701. 3 %, 3. 35 and 40 %) and defatted soybean meal (726. 8 %, 3. 50 and 33 %), followed by papaya leaf meal (505 %, 3. 02 and 38 %).

The constant q scenario showed a global underestimation mainly in IF profits and biological variables. Using both constant coefficients resulted in a higher overestimation of OF profits and biological variables, with an underestimation in inshore fleet profits. The MEY criteria over the conventional model showed - 60 % trawler effort and a biological and economical fishery gain. In contrast, the model using constant M and q showed overestimated OF profits and biological variables. On the other hand, it tends to underestimate IF profits.

However, pre-cooking at high temperature was able to decrease the melanosis in shrimp (Manheem et al. 2012). Heating or pre-cooking at a higher temperature led to the loss in cooking yield. This was mainly associated with the thermal denaturation of the muscle protein in shrimp, particularly the myosin heavy chain (Benjakul et al. 2011). To produce pre-cooked shrimp with a long shelf life, sufficient pre-cooking is required to inactivate PPO, but it may cause the enhanced cooking loss and quality changes of pre-cooked shrimp. Nevertheless, there is little information regarding the effect of pre-cooking times on quality changes and melanosis of pre-cooked Pacific <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> during refrigerated storage. Therefore, the objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the enzyme activities, properties, and microstructure of pre-cooked Pacific <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> as affected by pre-cooking time and to monitor melanosis of pre-cooked shrimp during the refrigerated storage.|$|R
50|$|A 2003 {{study of}} the effect of culture {{conditions}} of blood metabolites and hemocyanin of the <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> Litopenaeus vannamei found that the levels of hemocyanin, oxyhemocyanin in particular, are affected by the diet. The study compared oxyhemocyanin levels in the blood of <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> housed in an indoor pond with a commercial diet with that of <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> housed in an outdoor pond with a more readily available protein source (natural live food) as well. Oxyhemocyanin and blood glucose levels were higher in shrimp housed in outdoor ponds. It was also found that blood metabolite levels tended to be lower in low activity level species, such as crabs, lobsters, and the indoor shrimp when compared to the outdoor shrimp. This correlation is possibly indicative of the morphological and physiological evolution of crustaceans. The levels of these blood proteins and metabolites appear to be dependent on energetic demands and availability of those energy sources.|$|R
40|$|Vibrio spp. {{are major}} causes of {{mortality}} in <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Litopenaeus vannamei) which is lacking adaptive immunity. Passive immunization {{with a specific}} egg yolk antibody (IgY) is a potential method {{for the protection of}} shrimp against vibriosis. In this study, immune effects of the specific egg yolk powders (IgY) against both V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus on <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> were evaluated. The egg yolk powders against V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus for passive immunization of <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> were prepared, while a tube agglutination assay and an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used for detection of IgY titer. Anti-Vibrio egg yolk was encapsulated by β-cyclodextrin, which could keep the activity of the antibody in the gastrointestinal tract of shrimp. The results showed that the anti-Vibrio egg powders had an inhibiting effect on V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus in vitro. Lower mortality of infected zoeae, mysis, and postlarva was observed in groups fed with anti-Vibrio egg powders, compared with those fed with normal egg powders. The bacterial load in postlarva fed with specific egg powders in seeding ponds was significantly lower than those fed with normal egg powders in seeding ponds. These results show that passive immunization by oral administration with specific egg yolk powders (IgY) may provide a valuable protection of vibrio infections in <b>white</b> <b>shrimp...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{intended}} to evaluate the effect of salt concentration on cholesterol of whiteshrimp during boiling processed. There were 2 step in this study: 1) Analyze the cholesterol andnutrition (protein, fat, moisture) of the fresh <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> meat. 2) Analyze the cholesterol andnutrition (protein, fat, moisture) of boiled <b>white</b> <b>shrimp.</b> The <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> was boiled with differentsalt concentration for R 0,R 1,R 2 and R 3 was 0 %, 1 %, 2 % and 3 % respectively. The result showedthat cholesterol and nutrition (protein, fat, moisture) of fresh shrimp was 134, 05 mg/ 100 g, 17, 72 %, 2, 42 %, 76, 14 % respectively. The percentage of fresh <b>white</b> <b>shrimp</b> meat was 58, 19 % on wholeshrimp, and 41, 41 % on waste of shrimp. The cholesterol measured for R 0,R 1,R 2 and R 3 was 115, 22 mg/ 100 g, 93, 78 mg/ 100 g, 71, 31 mg/ 100 g, and 44, 48 mg/ 100 g respectively. Meanwhile, thenutrition measured to boiling processed with different salt concentration for protein content was 17, 53 %, 15, 65 %, 12, 99 %, 10, 77 % respectively.
