5|$|In modern times, the {{two main}} schools that have {{developed}} in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism.

Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Søren Kierkegaard, focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.
