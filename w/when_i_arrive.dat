500|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 November, Pedro II was in Petrópolis when he {{received}} the first telegram from Ouro Preto informing him of the rebellion. However, he did not assign much import to the news. At 11a.m. as he left a mass {{in honor of the}} 45th anniversary of his sister Maria II's death, the monarch received a second telegram and decided to return to Rio de Janeiro. His wife expressed concern, but he told her, [...] "On what ma'am? <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> there it will be over!" [...] He travelled by train, reading periodicals and scientific magazines. Not imagining the gravity of the situation, he arrived at the city palace at 3p.m. André Rebouças suggested that he go to the countryside to organize resistance. The Marquis of Tamandaré asked for his permission to lead the Armada (navy) and suppress the rebellion. He dismissed all the ideas put forward and said, [...] "This is nothing. I know my countrymen." [...] The Emperor asked the Conservative senator Manuel Francisco Correia what he thought of the situation. Correia answered that he believed that {{it was the end of}} the monarchy. Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the possibility.|$|E
2500|$|Later, after Zhong Hui {{secretly}} accused Deng Ai {{of plotting}} a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted {{to lead his}} forces to station at Chang'an. Shao Ti told Sima Zhao {{that there was no}} need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng Ai. Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' I replied, 'If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?' He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> in Chang'an." [...] By the time Sima Zhao reached Chang'an, Zhong Hui had already been killed in the mutiny, just as Sima Zhao foresaw.|$|E

[...] "In one year Laduree went from a little bakery in the eighth district of Paris to a big brand name. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived,</b> there was not a lot of organization.

6000|$|... "I want," [...] she said, [...] "to get to America, {{and have}} no money. All that I had has been stolen. Could I get a passage and pay for it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive?</b> A second class passage, of course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifty-dollar. Money of my señora, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> at {{my house}} she make escandolo. When they start the finca there is a feast, mucho talk and drinky.

"The journey can't be very dangerous," [...] said Louise, [...] "and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive,</b> I shall {{put myself}} {{in charge of a}} {{faithful}} Boston hackman, and tell him I'm very valuable, and am to be taken the best of care of.

[...] "I shall speak to every one I meet this afternoon--I shall be, in fact, most sociable--and sooner or later in our {{conversation}} I shall ask every one if they know Mr. Grex and his daughter. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> at some one who does, that will be the first step, won't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] she answered. [...] "For myself, I {{think that}} I always {{feel a little}} nervous <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> at a strange place. I have never been here before, you know, and I could not help wondering, for a moment, what would become of me if my uncle were really taken ill. Everyone says that London is so big and cold and heartless." ...|$|E
