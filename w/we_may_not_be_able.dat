2500|$|On June 29, [...] "Now, {{about the}} issue of host nation expenditures. When I {{explained}} to Secretary Brown that although <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to promise anything specific in terms of numbers yet, our agency will, from a sympathetic position, put effort into presenting a more detailed view on the issue within the scope of SOFA prior to his visit to Japan. He was very pleased and no further request was made from the American side." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flat {{taxes have}} also been {{considered}} in the United Kingdom by the Conservative Party. In September 2005, George Osborne, then in opposition, said {{that while he was}} [...] "fully conscious that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to introduce a pure flat tax, {{we may be able to}} move towards simpler and flatter taxes." [...] However, it was roundly rejected by Gordon Brown, then the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that it was [...] "An idea that they say is sweeping the world, well sweeping Estonia, well a wing of the neo-conservatives in Estonia", and criticised it thus: [...] "The millionaire to pay exactly the same tax rate as the young nurse, the home help, the worker on the minimum wage".|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that, Paul. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to find the}} opening Allen mentioned, and then, again, he may not wish us to do so." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR PETER. And {{in future}} perhaps <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> such Strangers.|$|R
60|$|Joh. The {{best way}} to avoid it is to retire, where <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> discovered.|$|R
60|$|Wild. Do you {{see their}} father? Let us make {{as though we}} talked to one another, that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> suspected.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Get up,' said Gudu; 'I {{am going}} courting, {{and you must}} come with me. So put some food in a bag, and sling it round your neck, for <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to find {{anything}} to eat for a long while.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{we might}} as well get in a good supply while we are at it," [...] he added. [...] "If this snow keeps coming down <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to get out at all to-morrow unless {{we do a lot of}} shoveling." ...|$|E
60|$|Let us, therefore, see whether, by {{a little}} careful {{comparison}} of the verse with other passages in which the word occurs, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to arrive at as clear an understanding of {{this portion of the}} chapter as of the rest.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{when this}} visit is over,' said I,--'for <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> alone another time,--how long {{is it likely}} to be, my dear Agnes, before you come to London again?' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{looking at}} the same {{structure}} that George W. Burbank built in 1892, butwe are {{looking at the}} exact same venue (conceptually) that George did ... over a century ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems a {{dangerous}} sort of service, signor," [...] Giuseppi said hesitatingly. [...] "It is no joke to disobey the {{officers of the}} republic, and next time <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> so fortunate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is just possible, you know, that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to make {{it after}} all! It {{may be one of}} those things that are a {{theoretical}} possibility, but a practical absurdity. Or when we make it, there may be some little hitch!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I move {{we remain}} on the boat until morning," [...] said Shep. [...] "Even if we clear {{out some of the}} snakes now, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to get at all of them. And who wants to go to sleep with snakes around? Not I!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now listen very attentively, all of you," [...] {{continued}} Chauvelin, impressively, {{and addressing}} the soldiers collectively, [...] "for after this <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to exchange another word, so remember every syllable I utter, {{as if your}} very lives depended on your memory. Perhaps they do," [...] he added drily.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did {{you speak}} to me, sir?' said Mr Cheggs, {{following}} him into a corner. 'Have the kindness to smile, sir, in order that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> suspected. Did {{you speak to}} me, sir'? ...|$|R
60|$|Beauty and ugliness form a {{contrast}} which {{is presented to}} us every day of our lives, though, perhaps, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> much impressed by the fact. And this contrast is presented in ever-varying aspects.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure we're in God's hands, anyway," [...] {{said his}} wife, in her soothing, Irish voice. [...] "Kneel down with me, John, dear, if it's the last time, and pray that, earth or heaven, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> divided." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jeanne is French, not English," [...] the Princess remarked, [...] "and {{she is not}} of age. A {{mother has}} {{considerable}} authority legally, as I dare say you are aware. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to manage it in England, but I think I can guarantee that if De Brensault doesn't disappoint us, the wedding will take place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must go {{on without}} our mules," [...] Blanca said. [...] "I have {{information}} that my father must get as soon as possible; but <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to join him until to-morrow night. The road is the nearest way, but now that Gomez has his orders he may have sent out soldiers to stop all travelers. Besides, there are rurales about." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tripper {{was silent}} for half a minute. [...] "What do you think, Tom? We might get there through the swashway. There is plenty of water for us, and we could lay our course there. It is a risky business, you know, and <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to get near her when we get there; but that we cannot tell till we see how she is fixed. Still, {{if we could get}} there before she goes to pieces we might perhaps save some of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine {{with you}} is the older, and the sweeter. Though <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> more than friends, I will {{say that it is}} the more tender. In my heart of hearts I do not think that Silverbridge could do better." ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{perfecting}} {{the water}} of baptism, Jesus emptied it of death. Thus we do go down into the water, {{but we do not}} go down into death, in order that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> poured out into the spirit of the world.|$|R
5000|$|Traleg Kyabgon states: [...] "When this {{hindrance}} is present, we {{lose our}} focus in meditation. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> agitated in any perceptible way, {{but there is no}} mental clarity. We gradually become more and more drowsy, and then eventually go to sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to assist}} Mr. Littlepage, should {{violence}} be attempted," [...] the first remarked; [...] "but violence is, perhaps, what is least to be apprehended. These wretched people so little regard truth, {{and they will}} be three to one, if your brother be left alone; that it is better we stay and hear what is said, in order that we may assert what the facts really were, should these persons see fit to pervert them, as too often happens." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And what do {{you think}} of it, Maud and Ethel?' their mamma asked the two little girls, who were looking very surprised, but rather {{doubtful}} as to the pleasure of the fights with Indians which their brothers had spoken so delightedly about. 'You will have to be two very useful little women, and will have to help me just as the boys will have to help your papa. Very likely <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to get a servant there, and then we shall have to do everything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to find a}} way up," [...] Nessus said; [...] "the sides seem to get steeper and steeper, and we {{may find}} {{ourselves}} caught in a trap {{at the end of this}} gorge. At any rate we will try that way first. I wish the moon was up; it is as black as a wolf's mouth here, and the bottom of the gorge is all covered with boulders. If we stumble, and our arms strike a stone, it will be heard by the natives on the opposite heights." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mr. Grey; this {{conversation}} must be finished. I will just give orders that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> disturbed, {{and then we}} shall proceed immediately. Come, now! your manner takes me, and we shall converse {{in the spirit of}} the most perfect confidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you go in}} {{the first}} boat, monsieur, with the ladies," [...] the captain said. [...] "The sooner you are ashore the better. There is no saying whether <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{disturbed}} and obliged to run out to sea again at a moment's notice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We will go {{a little}} further afield," [...] said the Quaker, when he returned, [...] "so that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> troubled again by those imbeciles in the court. It is little, however, that I {{have to say to}} thee further. Thou hast my leave." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{we see how}} capricious and {{uncertain}} this sterility is, how unknown the conditions on which it depends, I {{say that we have}} no right to affirm that those conditions will not be better understood by and by, and we have no ground for supposing that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to experiment so as to obtain that crucial result which I mentioned just now. So that though Mr. Darwin's hypothesis does not completely extricate us from this difficulty at present, we have not the least right to say it will not do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is usually}} {{but one thing}} that will {{overcome}} an enchantment," [...] remarked the bluejay, seriously; [...] "and if it is a tingle-berry that will destroy the charm which the old tuxix put upon you, then nothing else will answer the same purpose. The Royal Necromancer is very wise, and you may depend upon what he says. But it is late, at this season, for tingle-berries. They do not grow at all times of the year, and <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to find any upon the bushes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a {{very good}} idea, Conway; and you shall carry it out. Take two more men with you, and make your way in {{as soon as you}} hear us engaged. But {{remember}} that it is quite possible <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to get down. This passage may get almost perpendicular presently; and though I mean to go if possible, even if I have a straight drop for it, it may close up and be altogether impracticable. So don't you try to enter till you are quite sure they are engaged with us, otherwise you will be only throwing away your life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, if we're {{to go up}} {{the river}} first, {{there is no time}} to be lost. We must paddle the canoe close inshore until we get around the point, so that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> seen from Jenkins' house, and then we'll push her for all she's worth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] {{said the}} bishop, musingly, [...] "that {{although}} <b>we</b> <b>may</b> discover ourselves, and be greatly {{pleased with the}} prospect of what <b>we</b> see, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> permitted to enter into its enjoyment, and must content ourselves with looking over the fence and longing for what we see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had we been wrecked further south, {{things would}} have been more hopeful; for the Papuans are friendly, and inoffensive people. These islands here are {{inhabited}} by Malays, the most bloodthirsty pirates in the world. However, we must hope that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> found, before <b>we</b> have finished a boat.|$|R
