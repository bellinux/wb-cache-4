50|$|A {{schematic}} {{drawing of a}} VSI mill is shown at Fig. 1. Raw material particles transports via hopper (1) into the accelerator (2). An accelerator (2) rotates with a high speed and particles increase their speed by a centrifugal force. After leaving channels of the accelerator particles impact with a <b>wear</b> <b>plate</b> (3) in the grinding chamber. A high speed impact leads to destruction of particles into pieces of different size. Big particles (greater than 1 mm) fall down to outlet (5) and later they transport to hopper by an elevator. Other particles (less than 1 mm) lift by air stream into a classifier where blades (4) make rotating dust flow. Middle size particles shift to wall by centrifugal force in a big chamber of a classifier and fall down to cone (6) and later they move into an accelerator (2). Small particles move by air stream to outlet (8). Fine tune of a product size is achieved by changing of blade angle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- <b>Wear</b> <b>plate</b> welding {{machines}} requires some special raw {{material handling system}} as they are heavy to handle. <b>Wear</b> <b>plate</b> welding requires 4 - 5 workers for handling and clamping of raw material. This paper reviews different material handling equipment used by various industries. As the raw material is heavy, {{it is very difficult}} to handle manually. Hence there is requirement of integrated material handling and clamping system to do this heavy task. An integrated approach for material handling and clamping is suggested. In this paper, various handling mechanisms like scissor lifting mechanism, hydraulic lift platform in scissors type mechanism, hydraulic lifting system based on multistage telescopic cylinder are discussed. Their analysis is done by using various software. Some failure diagnosis points are also discussed by mathematical calculations. Clamping mechanisms like electric power clamping device driven by step motor and screw-toggle-lever force amplifier in series, unilateral fixtures for sheet-metal parts with holes are discussed...|$|E

The composite layer was composed of three sublayers from the LCS to the HCCI: pearlite transition layer, composite layer, and HCCI transition layer. The Vickers hardness from the pearlite transition layer to the HCCI transition layer was 360 HV to 855 HV. The austenite grows as dendrites between the composite layer and the HCCI transition layer under constitutional undercooling. A large amount of C and Cr, and {{a small amount of}} Si and Mn dissolve in the matrix. Granular Cr 7 C 3 is uniformly distributed. Due to the solute redistribution at the solid-liquid interface, the primary austenite grows from planar to cellular and finally to the distinct dendrite crystals. The dendrite crystals have an obvious growth direction perpendicular to the composite layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal for}} this thesis is to {{minimize}} clearances and tolerances, {{in order to}} prevent water leakage. A proper seal on the seal rings does not let excess water flow through the turbine runner, thus conserving more water and wasting less energy. Moreover, water leakage past <b>worn</b> <b>wear</b> <b>plates</b> allows for an extra load for the turbine when operating in condense mode. When the wicket gates are closed, water leakage past <b>worn</b> <b>plates</b> wastes mechanical energy in the water; thus, decreasing the efficiency of the Francis turbine, especially when operating at partial loads. Furthermore, the wicket gates also known as guide vanes can increase the efficiency of the turbine in their relation to their laminar profile and proper seal. Water is a very vital resource in today 2 ̆ 7 s society. This thesis illustrates how existing hydro machinery can be improved to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels as an electric energy source. This study provides actual examples of improvements using the generating units located at Hoover Dam. Hoover Dam located in Boulder City, NV is part of the Lower Colorado Region, of the U. S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation. Overhauling a hydro unit to obtain better efficiency is very similar to overhauling a vehicles engine to improve the vehicles fuel economy. Modifying and replacing three major hydro-machinery components: seal rings, <b>wear</b> <b>plates,</b> and wicket gates, improves the efficiency of Hoover Dam units by an average of 2 percent. This increase in capacity equates to an additional 8, 000 MW-hrs per year per unit. The wholesale market value of this increase in energy and capacity, roughly equates to about 290, 000 per unit per year [1]. Engineering design, calculations, and performance test were conducted to improve the parameters of the seal rings, <b>wear</b> <b>plates,</b> and wicket gates.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on vacuum liquid phase {{sintered}} (PM) composite hardfacings and their behaviour under different abrasive wear conditions. Hardfacings studied contained 30 – 50  vol % fine, coarse or multimodal (fine and coarse) hardmetal reinforcement. For wear resistance studies, we used the Abrasive Rubber Wheel Wear (ARWW) test as a three-body abrasive wear test, the Abrasive Wheel Wear (AWW) test as a two-body abrasive wear test and the Abrasive-Impact Erosion wear (AIEW) test as an abrasive-erosive wear test. Tested materials were compared to Hardox 400 steel and CDP 112 <b>wear</b> <b>plate</b> (Castolin Eutectic® Ltd.). It was found that under three-body abrasion conditions (ARWW test) hardfacings with high content of spehrical coarse reinforcement are suitable; their wear resistance is about two times {{higher than that of}} unreinforced hardfacings. Under two-body abrasive wear (AWW test), hardfacings with a high content of coarse reinforcement are recommended; their wear resistance is up to eight times higher than that of unreinforced hardfacings from the figures and graphs mentioned in the text. Under abrasive-erosive wear (AIEW test), unreinforced ductile materials are recommended; they have two to three times higher wear resistance than composite hardfacings reinforced with fine or multimodal reinforcement.

40|$|SSAB Oxelösund is {{a member}} of the SSAB Svenskt Stål AB Group and is the biggest Nordic {{manufacturer}} of heavy steel plate. SSAB Oxelösund’s main products are the hardened <b>wear</b> <b>plate</b> HARDOX and the high strength structural plate WELDOX. The most common processes that are used to cut the steel are the thermal processes oxyfuel, laser and plasma as well as the non-thermal process abrasive water jet. Cutting HARDOX using one of the thermal processes can result in edge cracking. In addition, if a thermal process is used to cut small parts, the hardness of the steel is affected. Therefore, SSAB wishes to have a computer based calculation application that would provide guidance regarding how to best cut SSAB’s different steels, in particular HARDOX. It was found that the main features that users wanted in this application were to be able calculate the cost of a cutting job, to be able to compare the costs of oxyfuel cutting with and without preheating and to see when abrasive water jet cutting is a viable option. It was also found that it is possible to calculate the costs involved in the different cutting processes quite accurately. However, to calculate the costs involved in preheating before cutting with oxyfuel it is recommended to develop a more complex calculation model. The recommendation is for SSAB to continue developing an application to help its customers calculate their cutting costs. It is also to use the application to influence customers to use cutting methods and cutting speeds that does not produce edge cracking. This would benefit both SSAB and its customers as it makes SSAB seem knowledgeable about the problems that the customers face and also help the customers to be more productive.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} was to {{understand}} the structure and chemical composition changes of gas metal arc welded joints of wear resistant plate with constructional steel plate with possible application as replacing material for reservoirs and chute in cement industry. Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Design/methodology/approach: Wear resistant plates can be used for elements working in intensive abrasion resistance conditions to obtain considerable material and economical savings based on the manufacturing costs reducing and decreasing turnaround time for replacing worn parts. During the welding process of two materials, when one is <b>wear</b> <b>plate</b> and the other is steel plate significant structure changes and mixing of alloying components in weld area are observed. Findings: Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root, most of important changes during welding of wear resistant material are connected with melting, mixing and carbides passage into weld area, non uniform chemical composition of the welded joint creates different microstructures with different hardness. Practical implications: Welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Root weld must be free of cracks and possibly free of intermixing with wear resistant plate material. Applying welding parameters described in the paper is possible to achieve free of cracks root, presence of crack in face weld is not important in term of wear resistance abilities of chute.
