5|$|The Sun {{inherited}} its {{chemical composition}} from {{the interstellar medium}} out of which it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and the heavier elements were produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in generations of stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material to the interstellar medium before {{the formation of the}} Sun. The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's composition {{is believed to have been}} 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.|$|E

40|$|Without {{having a}} clear {{definition}} of what proof is, mathematicians distinguish proofs from other types of argument. This has become increasingly difficult in the last thirty years, as mathematicians {{have been able to}} use ever more powerful computers to assist them in their research. An analysis of two types of proof (mathematical proof and formal proof) and two types of argument (mechanically-checked formal proof and computational experiment) reveals some aspects of proof in mathematics research. The emerging framework builds on the distinction between public and private aspects of proof, and revises the characterization of mathematical proof as being formal, convincing, and a source of understanding. What <b>is</b> proof <b>in</b> mathematics research? Hersh (1997) differentiates between two meanings of “mathematical proof”: <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> practice and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> principle: Meaning number 1, the practical meaning, is informal, imprecise. Practical mathematical proof is what we do to make each other believe our theorems. It’s argument that convinces the qualified, skeptical expert.

In 2006, 325,000 harp seals, as well as 10,000 hooded seals and 10,400 grey seals were killed. An additional 10,000 animals were allocated for hunting by aboriginal peoples.

25|$|In the 100 years since, others such as Robert Golka {{have built}} {{equipment}} similar to Tesla's, but long-distance power transmission {{has not been}} demonstrated, and the scientific consensus is his World Wireless system would not have worked.

At these wavelengths the radio waves spread out in all directions and cannot be focused on a distant receiver. Tesla's world power transmission scheme remains today <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Tesla's time: a bold, fascinating dream.|$|E
25|$|These {{three key}} {{concepts}} – locality, realism, freedom– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, {{the concept of}} realism is now somewhat different from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called counterfactual definiteness; {{it means that we}} may think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. Locality is short for local relativistic causality. (Currently accepted quantum field theories are local in the terminology of the Lagrangian formalism and axiomatic approach.) Freedom refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.|$|E

25|$|The Berlin Conference of 1885 ceded {{control of}} the Congo Free State to King LeopoldII as his private possession. From around 1900 there was growing {{international}} concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under LeopoldII, for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. Many Congolese were killed by Leopold's agents for failing to meet production quotas for ivory and rubber. It is estimated that nearly 10million were killed during the Leopold period. In 1908, this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for {{the government of the}} colony, henceforth called the Belgian Congo. A Belgian commission in 1919 estimated that Congo's population was half <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> 1879.|$|E
25|$|After the surrender, Varley, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of his fellow AIF captives were imprisoned at Selarang Barracks near Changi Prison. When the first major contingent of Australian prisoners, totaling around 3,000 men and designated A Force departed Changi, Varley was placed in command. A Force was shipped in cramped conditions to Burma where it was engaged in the construction of airfields. Initially, conditions were good and men were paid for their work (although the Japanese deducted expenses) which allowed them to buy rations. Consequently, the prisoner's general condition improved from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Changi. To capitalise on this, Varley endeavoured to keep as many men as possible working. Eventually, the airfield work was completed, and in September 1942, A Force was shipped to Thanbyuzayat to start work on the Burma-Thailand Railway.|$|E

25|$|American {{public school}} systems, {{especially}} in large metropolitan areas, {{to a large}} extent are still de facto segregated. Whether due to Brown, or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the late 1960s. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.|$|E
