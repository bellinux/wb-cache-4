50|$|The first {{method is}} manual and called a wet layup, where the two-part resin is mixed and applied before being {{laid in the}} mold {{and placed in the}} bag. The other one is done by infusion, where the dry fabric and mold are placed inside the bag while the vacuum pulls the resin through a small tube into the bag, then through a tube with holes or {{something}} similar to evenly spread the resin throughout the fabric. <b>Wire</b> <b>loom</b> works perfectly for a tube that requires holes inside the bag. Both of these methods of applying resin require hand work to spread the resin evenly for a glossy finish with very small pin-holes.|$|E

50|$|The Honda Dax {{model is}} {{generally}} not considered a Monkey, but rather a bigger, two-seat variant, with larger 10 in wheels and usually a larger engine. The Dax models have a monocoque stamped sheet-metal frame. This also houses the fuel tank, battery and <b>wiring</b> <b>loom.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the Unstructured Transmission Line Modelling (UTLM) method {{based on}} a {{tetrahedral}} mesh is applied to model the electromagnetic coupling into <b>wire</b> <b>looms</b> and bundles with multiple cores that are typical of an aircraft system, when {{they are exposed to}} plane wave illuminations. The impact on the electromagnetic coupling into wires of both bundle configuration and the positioning of the bundle relative to simple structures are investigated using the UTLM method with explicit meshing of the wires. The work not only confirms that UTLM method as a powerful tool for dealing with <b>wire</b> <b>looms</b> and bundles but provides invaluable information on the margins to be expected in key experimental waveform parameters such as peak amplitude and frequency response...|$|R

The result of long-term vibration could result in fracture of wiring and symptoms such as indicator or speedometer failure.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{advance in}} trailer safety is the {{development}} of the Trailer Stability Program, built into some Electronic Stability Control systems in today's motor vehicles. These systems can detect the [...] "snaking" [...] of a trailer or caravan and counteract it by braking individual wheels, reducing engine torque and slowing the vehicle down. It {{is important to note that}} activation of TSP normally requires a vehicle-specific <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> to be installed.|$|R
50|$|Whilst the M104 {{is known}} to be a {{reliable}} engine, there were some technical issues with smooth running. The <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> which passed from the Idle Speed Control unit (an electronic box situated in the engine bay) to the ignition coils (housed {{on the top of the}} engine) was enclosed under plastic covers. High temperatures were experienced in this region. In addition the plastic insulation was a type which degrades with time and heat.|$|R

50|$|The No.7 TS040 {{started the}} 24 Hours of Le Mans from pole, {{and took the}} early lead. The No.8 was caught out in a sudden downpour and {{suffered}} heavy damage {{in the hands of}} Lapierre, losing 50 minutes of time for repairs. The No.7 would continue to lead through the night, only to have a <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> failure and officially retire after 13 hours and 53 minutes. The remaining TS040 No.8 continued with the race and eventually finished 3rd.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to the MT version, the 5-speed AT version came {{equipped}} with the A650E Tiptronic automatic transmission and had a lower compression ratio of 11.1:1, a less aggressive cam profile, smaller steel-alloy valves and smaller 31mm buckets. This engine made [...] at 7,000 rpm and 22.0 kgm Nm at a considerably lower 4,800 rpm. Externally, the AT model can be identified by differences in the <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> {{and the lack of}} an acoustic blanket on the intake plenum.|$|R
5000|$|The 4.1 {{system did}} not include {{provision}} for a knock sensor for timing adjustment. The ignition timing and fuel map could be altered {{to take account of}} fuels with different octane ratings by connecting a calibrated resistor (taking the form of an [...] "octane coding plug" [...] in the vehicle's <b>wiring</b> <b>loom)</b> to one of the ECU pins, the resistance depending on the octane adjustment required. [...] With no resistor attached the system would default to 98 octane.|$|R

Monaco, however, saw a huge improvement with Webber qualifying on the front row, after Michael Schumacher's grid penalty, holding third for {{a large part of the}} race before retiring when his exhaust burned a <b>wiring</b> <b>loom.</b> Webber's car was not as disadvantaged as at most other venues, as aerodynamic efficiency is not as important at Monaco.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} the vapors ignited due to damaged wiring, as no bomb, {{incendiary}} device or detonator {{had been found}} at the scene. The airline had fitted logo lights after delivery which required passing additional wires through the vapor seals in the fuel tanks. The NTSB recommended to the FAA that an Airworthiness Directive be issued requiring inspections of the fuel boost pumps, float switch and <b>wiring</b> <b>looms</b> as signs of chafing had been found. The FAA declined to issue the Airworthiness Directive.|$|R

50|$|After being {{displayed}} at the 2005 Essen Motor Show to celebrate Pininfarina's 75th anniversary, the car was sold in 2008 by RM Auctions on behalf of Swaters for €176,000. Given to Oral Engineering by its new owner with the brief {{to make it a}} running vehicle, the engineering team was led by Mauro Forghieri, who had been Ferrari's chief engineer during the 1960s and 1970s. In order to fit and cool a working flat 12 engine, the chassis was modified and strengthened, mated to an original 400GT gearbox, and commissioned a bespoke <b>wiring</b> <b>loom.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1944 {{one of the}} few {{verified}} {{instances of}} sabotage occurred at Tocumwal, when major sections of the <b>wiring</b> <b>looms</b> in 12 B-24s were cut and removed. This put the aircraft out of service for several months until the damage could be assessed, replacement looms fabricated in the USA, then installed by Consolidated technicians flown to Australia to do the work. The sabotage was believed to have been carried out by a Japanese cell that had been under cover in Australia since prior to the war, however no one was ever captured nor convicted of the act.|$|R
50|$|Powering {{the car was}} Renault's Billancourt engine, mounted {{behind the}} rear wheels in a rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. The Atla could be bought in kit form or as a {{completed}} car. Two levels of kit were available. A basic kit included a bare body shell with the doors, hood and rear hatch mounted on hinges and the chassis with all attachment points and cost 250,000 Francs. A more complete kit could be had that included a painted body and an upholstered interior. This kit also came with all handles, a <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> and a fuel tank already installed. This version cost 650,000 Francs.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the start}} of the Second World War, the Government decided to {{disperse}} certain production to locations away from obvious bombing targets. This led to a shadow factory at Cowbridge House, Malmesbury, Wiltshire, being established by Ekco. This was followed by other shadow factories at Aylesbury, Woking, Preston, and Rutherglen. The wartime headquarters of Ekco was based at Aston Clinton House in Buckinghamshire. Following the outbreak of war, the Southend-on-Sea factory was evacuated apart from the bakelite moulding shop whose large moulding presses could not be moved easily. Less than a year later, the empty factory was re-equipped to make <b>wiring</b> <b>looms</b> for aircraft such as the Avro Lancaster.|$|R

50|$|A UK-only {{model was}} the 306 Rallye of 1999. Mechanically {{the car was}} {{identical}} to a GTI-6, but had a minimal specification that deleted many GTI-6 standard features including fog lights, air conditioning, sunroof, electric windows, temperature sensor. Only 500 were produced in 3 non-metallic colours including; 100 in black, 200 in Cherry Red and 200 in Bianca White. While some were fitted with Phase 3 tailgates and bonnets, the car was basically a Phase 2 {{in terms of the}} fuse box and electrical <b>wiring</b> <b>loom,</b> including the use of Phase 2 remote locking. Seat upholstery was cloth in a specific Rallye pattern. The more austere specification led to the car being lighter than a GTI-6.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 December 2010, an RAF CH-47 Chinook {{helicopter}} with {{serial number}} ZH891 {{was on a}} daytime tasking in flight within the Green Zone in Baghdad when it came under small arms and rocket-propelled grenade fire. A 7.62-mm round penetrated the cockpit and hit the instrument panel, severing 36 wires leading to it from various instruments. The <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> was sheared as a result, which caused an instruments failure without damaging vital components. As the Chinook {{was still able to}} fly level, pilot Flight Lieutenant Alex [...] "Frenchie" [...] Duncan decided to issue a pan-pan rather than a mayday to Bastion Tower. The Chinook made it back to Camp Bastion safely without further incident.|$|R

A few days after the Spanish Grand Prix, he admitted that he had no chance of winning the 2006 Championship. In Monaco, Räikkönen qualified third. During the race he got up to 2nd and kept pace with Alonso, however he retired during a safety car period after a failed heat shield led to a <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> inside the car catching fire. After the retirement he was seen on live TV walking along the Monaco sidewalks with his helmet still on to the harbour and climbing aboard a yacht.|$|R
5000|$|A UK-only version called [...] "968 Sport", {{was offered}} in 1994 and 1995, and was {{essentially}} a Club Sport model (and was produced on the same production line with similar chassis numbers) with electric windows, electric release boot, central locking, cloth comfort seats (different from both the standard and the Club Sport). With the added electrics the larger <b>wiring</b> <b>loom</b> was used. The Sport Variant also got back the two rear seats, again in the cloth material specific to the Sport. At £29,975, the 968 Sport was priced £5,500 lower than the standard 968, but had most of the latter's desirable [...] "luxuries" [...] and consequently outsold it by a large margin (306 of the 968 Sport models compared to 40 standard 968 coupés).|$|R
50|$|The 500-kilometre Supercars {{endurance}} race returned to Sandown Raceway in 2003 and Queensland Raceway returned to hosting a sprint {{round of the}} championship. In {{the aftermath of the}} 2004 event, round winner Marcos Ambrose was disqualified due to the discovery of an additional wire in the ECU <b>wiring</b> <b>loom.</b> The points were later reinstated on appeal. Jason Richards had a major accident during the 2005 event, after a touch from Paul Morris sent Richards' car over a kerb and into a series of rollovers. Garth Tander dominated the event in 2006 and 2007, winning five of the six races across the two years, before Mark Winterbottom won consecutive events in 2008, at which James Courtney won his first championship race, and 2009.|$|R
