25|$|It {{should be}} noted that this {{function}} only computes the path-cost, not the actual path. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the path soon. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow since it wastes time recomputing the same shortest paths over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path-costs in a two-dimensional array q rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; before computing the cost of a path, we check the array q to see if the path cost is already there.|$|E

The same to you, madam, I would do {{anything in the world}} to see Captain Horn, and nobody knows when we will have the chance! Well, madam, it's all the plainest kind of sailing; we can get off at daylight to-morrow morning, and if that yacht sails as they told me she sails, I believe we may overhaul Shirley, and, perhaps, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Kingston before any of them! And now I've got to bounce around, for there's a good deal to be done before night-fall!" ...|$|E

But <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> work now; {{the work}} being to understand, if we may, what tender creatures are indeed riding with us, the British public, in faded silk, and handing our plates for us with tender little thumbs, and never wearing, or doing, {{anything}} else (not always having much {{to put on}} their own plates). The loveliest arts, the arts of noblest descent, have been long doing this for us, and are still, {{and we have no}} idea of their being Princesses, but keep them ill-entreated and enslaved: vociferous as we are against Black slavery, while we are gladly acceptant of Gray; and fain to keep Aglaia and her sisters--Urania and hers,--serving us in faded silk, and taken for kitchen-wenches. We are mad Sanchos, not mad Quixotes: our eyes enchant Downwards.|$|E

He said, in part: [...] "And certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedom for our citizens held in barbaric captivity.

Meena plays the lead role in this Telugu devotional film. This marks her {{re-entry}} to films after a long period.

50|$|Little World {{takes us}} along on his {{greatest}} challenge yet: {{to reach the}} exact {{opposite side of the}} planet. Is it possible to cross the earth in these conditions? Mixing home video techniques and traditional documentary methods, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know this young man, his love story, his philosophy of life and his parents' approach to raising him. We will see how Albert and his girlfriend, Anna, go from Barcelona to a remote lighthouse in New Zealand, or how they fail in the attempt. The journey (and the film) can be considered sheer madness, an endearing romance or an epic adventure, or perhaps a little of everything.|$|E
5000|$|Haughm {{has stated}} that he is unhappy with {{the final version of}} the video, which was very {{different}} from the original sketch filmed by Mosqueda. Mosqueda's sketch featured smooth transitions between shots and what Haughm described as [...] "glacial imagery", which pleased the band. However, the record company insisted on using an abridged version of the song, despite strong opposition from the band, and {{the final version of the}} video was heavily edited. [...] "Frankly I do not consider the video to be finished and I hope <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> make the full version…with a different editor", Haughm said. [...] "All of the gorgeous, epic slow panning stuff was cut to hell. We wanted a cinematic video and the editor instead made something which he perceived as 'hip' and 'cool'".|$|E

5000|$|On August 24, 2006, Nelson {{was arrested}} at Mesilla Valley Mall in Las Cruces after {{reportedly}} having been identified by a pizza delivery man employed at a restaurant inside the mall. The employee alleged that Nelson had robbed him earlier that month. Nelson was charged with two felonies — robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery — and held on $15,000 bond at Doña Ana County Jail. Though he was released when his brother arranged to pay bail money, Nelson was given a three-day suspension by his team. Says NMSC Aggies' coach Reggie Theus: [...] "The situation is not consistent with Tyrone's character, but <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the bottom of what happened." [...] Mr. Nelson still starts for the New Mexico State Aggies Basketball team with felony charges.|$|E

MK Aliza Lavie, chair of the Knesset's committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality, who had helped Yashar with her struggle, commented on Yashar's candidacy with U'Bizchutan to promote the interests of Haredi women: [...] "Those {{who are supposed to}} be representing them in the Knesset today do not represent them in many cases.
