25|$|Stick heights are {{not only}} {{important}} for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} left hand. To practice playing with accurate stick heights, set up your drum or pad in front of a mirror. Start with a simple exercise and watch to see if your left heights are even <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>right.</b> If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself and watch it later. It is easier to watch your heights and critique your performance when you are not focusing on playing.|$|E
2500|$|One {{tool for}} {{determining}} {{the direction of the}} velocity vector of a moving charge, the magnetic field, and the force exerted is labeling the index finger [...] "V", the middle finger [...] "B", and the thumb [...] "F" [...] <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>right</b> hand. When making a gun-like configuration, with the middle finger crossing under the index finger, the fingers represent the velocity vector, magnetic field vector, and force vector, respectively.

2500|$|Jazz {{historian}} and commentator Ira Gitler declared that Tatum's [...] "left hand was {{the equal of}} his right." [...] When Bud Powell was opening for Tatum at Birdland around 1950, {{the end of an}} era when musicians engaged in overt competition and so-called cutting sessions, Powell reportedly said to Tatum, [...] "Man, I'm going to really show you about tempo and playing fast. [...] Anytime you're ready." [...] Tatum laughed and replied, [...] "Look, you come in here tomorrow, and anything you do <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>right</b> hand, I'll do with my left." [...] Powell never took up the challenge. Of note was Tatum's double-time stride playing, where his left hand alternated between playing bass notes (or tenth intervals) and mid-range chords at high speed, a device he used in showcase recordings like [...] "I Wish I Were Twins", [...] "The Shout", and [...] "Elegy".|$|E

2500|$|Impaired verbal {{comprehension}} can be {{the result}} [...] a number of causes such as failure of speech sound discrimination, word recognition, auditory working memory, or syntactic structure building. When clinically examined, patients with TSA will exhibit poor comprehension of verbal commands. Based {{on the extent of}} the comprehension deficiency, patients will have difficulty following simple commands, e.g. “close your eyes.” Depending on the extent of affected brain area, patients are able to follow simple commands but {{may not be able to}} comprehend more difficult, multistep commands, e.g. “point to the ceiling, then touch your left ear <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>right</b> hand." [...] Verbal commands as such, that require the patient to cross over the midline of their body are typically more taxing than commands that involve solely the right or left side. When increasing the complexity of verbal commands comprehension is often tested by varying the grammatical structure of the command to determine whether or not the patient understands different grammatical variations of the same sentence. Commands involving the passive voice or possessive, e.g. [...] "If the snake killed the mouse, which one is still alive," [...] usually result in comprehension problems in those who can understand simple questions.|$|E

In order, therefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the earliest moment, General McDowell has been ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route. He is ordered, keeping himself always in position to save the capital from all possible attack, so to operate as to put his left wing in communication <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>right</b> wing, and you are instructed to co-operate so as to establish this communication as soon as possible by extending your right-wing to the north of Richmond.|$|E

60|$|Swimming with Horses.--In {{crossing}} a deep river, with a horse or other large animal, drive him in: or even lead him along a steep bank, and push him sideways, suddenly into the water: having fairly started him, jump in yourself, seize his tail, {{and let him}} tow you across. If he turns his head {{with the intention of}} changing his course, splash water in his face <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>right</b> or left hand, as the case may be, holding the tail with one hand and splashing with the other; and you will, in this way, direct him just as you like. This is by far the best way of swimming a horse: all others are objectionable and even dangerous with animals new to the work,--such as to swim alongside the horse, with one hand on his shoulder; or, worst of all, to retain your seat on his back. If this last method be persisted in, at least let the rider take his feet out of the stirrups, before entering the water.|$|E

All I {{have to do is to}} duck my head under his arm and begin to twist. I must twist rapidly--very rapidly. I know how to do it; {{twisting}} in a violent, jerky way, ducking my head under his arm with each revolution. Before he knows it, those detaining fingers of his will be detained. He will be unable to withdraw them. It is a powerful leverage. Twenty seconds after I have started revolving, the blood will be bursting out of his finger-ends, the delicate tendons will be rupturing, and all the muscles and nerves will be mashing and crushing together in a shrieking mass. Try it sometime when somebody has you by the collar. But be quick--quick as lightning. Also, be sure to hug yourself while you are revolving--hug your face with your left arm and your abdomen <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>right.</b> You see, the other fellow might try to stop you with a punch from his free arm.
