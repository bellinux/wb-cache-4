5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has cream {{spore print}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> salmon tinge.

5|$|When SpongeBob SquarePants is {{broadcast}} in non-English languages, the voice actors dubbing SpongeBob's voice use Tom Kenny's {{rendition of the}} character {{as a starting point}} but also add unique elements.

5|$|Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white {{color of}} barium metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} in air yielding a dark gray oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium {{is very difficult}} to prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.|$|E

5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. The portraits of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair hair <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a silvery-white metal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> golden tinge {{that takes}} a high polish. It {{is one of only}} four {{elements}} that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is , meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352nm, giving an atomic radius of 0.124nm. This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70GPa. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed.

The coat is thick (sometimes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E
5|$|The Kriegsmarine {{considered}} the ships {{to be good}} sea boats, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> roll. As built, they were wet in a head sea, though this was significantly improved by the installation of a clipper bow in 1940–1941. The ships were highly maneuverable, particularly when the maneuvering setting for the diesel engines was used, in which half of the engines for each shaft were run in reverse. The ships heeled over up to 13degrees with the rudder hard over. The low stern was wet in a stern sea, and equipment stored there was frequently lost overboard.|$|E

The lower points (1-7) were highlighted in red squares while the top points (8, 10, 12) were highlighted in orange squares with each square increasing in size in relation to the point value. Both sets of graphics were designed by London brand design agency Turquoise Branding.|$|E

On June 3, 1969, the Utica Avenue Line {{was approved by the}} Board of Estimate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> modification. Instead of ending at Kings Highway, it would end at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U, with borings underway in 1970. Studies for the midtown people mover commenced in November 1969.|$|E

Near the start, the song begins to make a beat of paparazzi's flashbulbs. It is set in common time with a moderated tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of A minor. Cyrus' vocals span two octaves, from A3 to C5. The song has the following chord progression, A5C5D5.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, MDSHA {{discovered}} the bridge's rarity while conducting a bridge inventory. The inventory also found premature deterioration of its supports due to galvanic corrosion involving the steel bearing pads and aluminum girder structure. Because repairing the structure {{would have been}} extremely difficult, MDSHA decided to build a replacement bridge immediately {{to the west of}} the aluminum bridge; the new bridge opened in 2004 along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> relocation in MD32 on both sides of the bridge. The aluminum bridge was added to the state's Historic Bridge Registry and was left in place as a historic landmark after MD32's new bridge over the Patapsco River opened.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> golden tinge. Nickel {{belongs to the}} transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms {{on the surface and}} prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The captain {{ordered the}} ship {{abandoned}} {{later in the}} day, and the carrier was still afloat in the evening, albeit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> list to port and down by the bow. Over {{the next couple of}} days, more compartments in the ship flooded and she settled {{on the bottom of the}} harbor. Another attack on 28 July hit her several more times and the resulting damage from those hits and more near-misses to port caused the ship to list further to port. This gradually increased through the next day until Amagi capsized at 10:00 on the morning of 29 July with part of her flight deck falling overboard. The losses among the ship's crew are unknown, but were supposedly light.|$|E
