25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do. Created the world that <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|When <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to {{construct}} a given discipline, we distinguish, first of all, a certain small group of expressions of this discipline that seem to us to be immediately understandable; the expressions in this group we call PRIMITIVE TERMS or UNDEFINED TERMS, and we employ them without explaining their meanings. At {{the same time we}} adopt the principle: not to employ any of the other expressions of the discipline under consideration, unless its meaning has first been determined with the help of primitive terms and of such expressions of the discipline whose meanings have been explained previously. The sentence which determines the meaning of a term in this way is called a DEFINITION,...|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E

25|$|In direct {{contrast}} to German philosophy, which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, {{we do not}} set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. <b>We</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> from real, active men, and {{on the basis of}} their real life process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this, their real existence, their thinking, and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.|$|E
500|$|On 25 February, having {{finished}} 19th {{overall in}} the medal table, and 14th out of European countries, head of Team GB Andy Hunt said that despite not reaching UK Sport's target the team [...] "have achieved what <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do" [...] by bettering their performance in the 2006 Games. [...] This was in reference to Amy Williams' gold in the women's skeleton, which was the sole medal won by the team.|$|E

Budgets were really tiny, and we shot for ten days and brought the film in for about 8,000 pounds." [...] Unusually for a BBC {{television}} drama of the 1970s, each instalment was filmed entirely on location using 16 mm film. As a result, the cameraman John McGlashan, who filmed the first five adaptations, {{was able to make}} use of night shoots and dark, shadowy interiors, which {{would not have been possible}} with the then-standard video-based studio interiors.|$|E

500|$|CSKA manager Valery Gazzaev praised {{his players}} despite their loss and hinted that {{injuries}} {{may have been}} a factor in the loss: [...] "The game was satisfactory – we had followed the plan <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out,</b> but still we made two mistakes. On the whole I think our team played very well but of course it is a shame we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E
500|$|... "Skyfall" [...] was {{composed}} {{in the key}} of C minor using common time at 76beats per minute (Adagietto). Adele's vocal range spans , from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5, on the song. The lyrics closely follow the narrative of the film {{rather than focusing on}} romanticism. According to Epworth, the song is about [...] "death and rebirth", saying [...] "It's like, when the world ends and everything comes down around your ears, if you've got each other's back, you can conquer anything. From death to triumph, that was definitely something <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to try and capture". The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick described the lyrics as [...] "slightly sinister" [...] and containing references to a number of Bond tropes and motifs.|$|E
500|$|The deeper {{waters of}} the Tennessee River allowed the Timberlake {{expedition}} to proceed much more quickly. A hunting party led by the Cherokee chief Slave Catcher met the Timberlake expedition {{near the mouth of}} the Little Tennessee River, and supplied the weary expedition with provisions of [...] "dried venison, homminy, and boiled corn." [...] The following day, Slave Catcher guided the expedition by canoe up the Little Tennessee, although the Timberlake party struggled to keep up. Timberlake recalled, [...] "my hands were so galled, that the blood trickled from them, and when <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> the next morning I was scarce able to handle a pole." [...] The Timberlake party arrived in the Overhill town of Tomotley on December 20, where they were greeted by the town's head man, Chief Ostenaco.|$|E

500|$|On the game's community, Adams said, [...] "They are {{the reason}} I've {{been able to make}} the step from {{hobbyist}} to full-time developer. I'm lucky to be able to run with whatever ideas we have and try new things." [...] On players sending him forum posts or emails detailing their stories or events that happened during the game, Adams said, [...] "It's really gratifying, because it's one of the things <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do is to get people to write these narratives about their game." [...] Adams has admitted that some feats of the community surprised even him. Adams stated that the most impressive thing he had ever seen done with the game was when a player managed to create a Turing-complete 8-bit computer powered by dwarves.|$|E
500|$|Co-writer Howard Gordon {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Alex [...] and I made {{an effort}} to play to our own strength, which is character. We thought this was an {{interesting}} place to reiterate Mulder's quest for his sister. <b>We</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to tell a simple abduction story, which was played out behind the shadows. We wanted to create an air of tension. With everything that happened, we wanted to explain what it could be. At every point, everything can be explained. Was she taken or killed by her boyfriend, who she was seeing against her mother's wishes? Is it Twin Peaks or an alien abduction? That was the theme of the show." [...] Gordon and Gansa were afraid that series creator Chris Carter would not like the script, but Carter liked the script and approved the episode they wrote.|$|E
500|$|... "The song {{has kind}} of an old school vibe to it, {{so we wanted to}} be really {{stripped}} down and really simple with the video. Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{follow-up}} It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, {{the group}} pursued a different direction, content-wise. According to Chuck D, {{they sought to}} make a more thematically focused work and to condense Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's theory of [...] "Color Confrontation and Racism (White Supremacy)" [...] into an album-length recording, [...] "telling people, well, color's an issue created and concocted {{to take advantage of}} people of various characteristics with the benefit of a few". He recalled their concept for the album in an interview with Billboard, [...] "We wanted really to go with a deep, complex album ... more conducive to the high and lows of great stage-performance". Chuck D also cited in their creative vision the commercial circumstances for hip hop at the time, having quickly transitioned from a singles to an album medium in the music industry during the 1980s. In an interview for Westword, he later said, [...] "We understood the magnitude of what an album was, so <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to make something that not only epitomized the standard of an album, but would {{stand the test of time}} by being diverse with sounds and textures, and also being able to home in on the aspect of peaks and valleys".|$|E
500|$|To promote Modern Life Is Rubbish, Food {{released}} [...] "For Tomorrow" [...] as the album's lead {{single in}} the UK in April 1993. The single, which showcased Blur's new sound and attitude, performed moderately well in the charts, reaching number 28. A few weeks later in May 1993, Modern Life was released. The announcement of the album's release included a press photo that featured the phrase [...] "British Image 1" [...] spraypainted behind Blur members (who were dressed {{in a mixture of}} mod and skinhead attire) and a Mastiff. At the time, such imagery was viewed as nationalistic and racially insensitive by the British music press; to quiet concerns, Blur subsequently released the [...] "British Image 2" [...] photo, which was [...] "a camp restaging of a pre-war aristocratic tea party". The album peaked at number 15 on the UK Album Chart. In the next few months Food further issued two UK Top 30-charting singles—"Chemical World" [...] and [...] "Sunday Sunday"—to support the record; however, Modern Life only managed to sell around 40,000 copies at the time. Nonetheless, the mood within the Blur camp was positive, as the band felt they had accomplished something; bassist Alex James told writer David Cavanagh in 2000, [...] "Modern Life Is Rubbish was a successful record because it achieved what <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to achieve. I thought everything was shit except us".|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} narrated on the {{authority}} of Ibn Salama. He heard the tradition from his father who said: .....By God, we had stayed there only three nights when <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> to Khaibar with the Messenger of Allah.

60|$|Then the {{commander}} half-turned, {{as if to}} show that the interview was at an end, and Sergeant Corney beckoned Jacob and me to follow him, reminding us, when we were comparatively alone, of the promise made at the time <b>we</b> first <b>set</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|Clearly I did not burn with {{a desire}} to linger, but rather {{it seemed to me that}} {{although}} night had closed in, black and moonless, <b>we</b> must <b>set</b> <b>out</b> again, and push on to Monnerville, albeit our beasts were worn and the distance a good three leagues.|$|R
2500|$|... "We were {{reacting}} {{very strongly}} against the machismo, terrace chants and revisionism of Britpop, and the nationalism that we interpreted as xenophobia {{of the musical}} kind.

2500|$|In August 2009 The Guardian {{speculated that}} the Verve had broken up for a third time, with Jones and McCabe no longer on {{speaking}} terms with Ashcroft as they felt he was using the reunion {{as a vehicle to}} get his solo career back on track.

2500|$|The T200 {{sedan and}} five-door {{hatchback}} featured a swage line {{running along the}} lower body to the rear door, which kinks downward prominently on the five-door. Five-doors also feature a side window in the C/D pillar with a distinctively angled lower edge. Interiors feature a circular motif throughout. Upon introduction the initial European models carried an emblem reading [...] "Design Giugiaro."
