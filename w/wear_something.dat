25|$|In some cases, it was {{the bright}} colours and {{flamboyant}} nature of the uniform that attracted men to the army. The chance to <b>wear</b> <b>something</b> as distinctive as the regimental red could be extremely tempting; a new and vivid uniform {{would have been a}} welcome change from the drab colours worn by most men in everyday society and soldiers frequently drew interest from admiring women.|$|E

It was during a match between a United England XI and the Free Foresters in 1861 that he is credited with the introduction of the white coat for cricket umpires. Armitstead requested that the umpires <b>wear</b> <b>something</b> white in colour, as their existing garments were causing him to lose sight of the ball and the bowlers hand during their delivery.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in centuries, respectable but daringly fashionable women would leave the house without a hat or bonnet, {{previously}} something often associated with prostitutes. However most women continued to <b>wear</b> <b>something</b> on their head outdoors, though they were beginning to cease to do so indoors during the day (as well as for evening wear). The antique head-dress, or Queen Mary coif, Chinese hat, Oriental inspired turban, and Highland helmet were popular. As for bonnets, their crowns and brims were adorned with increasingly elaborate ornamentations, such as feathers and ribbons. In fact, ladies of the day embellished their hats frequently, replacing old decorations with new trims or feathers.|$|E

25|$|According to tradition, Jewish men, {{married or}} not, must cover their heads. The most common head {{covering}} is the kippah (Hebrew: skull cap), known as yarmulke in Yiddish. Orthodox men <b>wear</b> <b>something</b> {{on their heads}} at almost all times, while non-Orthodox men may cover their heads only when performing some religious act, or when eating. Few cover the entire head. Almost all will bathe with the head uncovered, but sleeping varies by community or family practice. The exact nature of this practice, and how binding it is, {{is a matter of}} dispute among halakhic authorities. Wearing a hat is not required by Jewish law, and those who wear a hat always wear a kippah underneath; however, there are some rabbis, especially in Hasidic Judaism, who require a double head covering - of kippah and hat or tallis - during prayer.|$|E

500|$|Afterwards, Jack's {{secretary}} tells Liz that Jack {{wants her}} to apologize, but {{that she has to}} pretend that it was her idea. Liz goes to Jack's office and apologizes, and they forgive each other. While the staff eats their lunch, Jack introduces the staff to two of his guests. The writers mention to Liz that they would love to go outside to the same roof that is used for The Today Show, and Liz tells them that she can make it happen now that she and Jack are friends. Liz asks Jack, but he denies the request. He tells her that the two guests were his bosses from GE, and then criticizes Liz and her staff. He apologizes to Liz, but she says that their friendship is over. Having settled the situation with Jack, Liz tries to talk to her assistant Cerie about her attire, which seems to distract the writers. Liz attempts to convince her to <b>wear</b> <b>something</b> conservative, but Cerie tells Liz that she would look great in something sexy herself, and Liz is later seen walking down the hallway with a dress that reads [...] "Dirty Diva".|$|E

500|$|Tom Baker found filming in Paris to {{be a very}} {{different}} experience to what he was used to in the UK where crowds would gather to watch the filming and meet the stars. Doctor Who was not shown in France at the time and so the cast and crew were largely ignored. Lalla Ward found City of Death the most challenging Doctor Who serial she worked on but was pleased with the final outcome, saying, [...] "We had to film loads of scenes in the rain and cold... there was no glamour in it at all... it was different from the ordinary stories too and I like the finished result". Seeing her costumes as an important part in creating the role of Romana, Ward clashed with costume designer Doreen James, rejecting the silver catsuit James had designed for her for the story. Ward {{came up with the idea}} for the schoolgirl costume she wore in conjunction with Baker, recalling, [...] "I thought it would be fun to <b>wear</b> <b>something</b> that little girls probably hated wearing because it might cheer them up... I didn't bank on the fact that I'd also get loads of letters from their fathers saying 'Cool School uniform!'".|$|E

The video was shot at Studio Rapti in Melissia from noon and did not conclude until the next morning. MAD TV crews were on set during shooting and did a photo report that same day. The concept of the video plays on a yin yang-type theme, with the light and darkness, innocence and eroticism continuously altering, thus contrasting with the song's title. Tamta's multiple wardrobe changes, varying between [...] "classy and trendy" [...] were meant {{as a means of}} further highlight these contradictions. MAD TV claimed that the shooting of the video was [...] "demanding". Tamta spoke about the emotions of the video and her image, saying: I feel absolutely sexy and for that are not responsible only the clothes. I feel sexy even without needing to <b>wear</b> <b>something</b> provocative. However, I am sure, as my collaborators are that this video clip will be the sexiest thing that I have done up until now.|$|E
