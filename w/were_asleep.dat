5|$|If the {{earthquake}} had {{occurred during the}} early morning while residents <b>were</b> <b>asleep,</b> rather than mid-afternoon (1:52 pm local time), {{it could have been}} deadlier as housing in the epicentral area consisted chiefly of mud and brick.|$|E
5|$|At 5:30 am on April 19, {{dynamite}} {{was thrown}} through a front window of Z. Alexander Looby's home in north Nashville, apparently {{in retaliation for}} his support of the demonstrators. Although the explosion almost destroyed the house, Looby and his wife, who <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> in a back bedroom, were not injured. More than 140 windows in a nearby dormitory were broken by the blast.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Kidder {{was killed}} during the Great Storm of 1703, when two chimney stacks in the palace fell on him and his wife, while they <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> in bed. A central porch was added around 1824 and, in the 1840s and 1850s, Benjamin Ferrey {{restored}} the palace and added an upper storey. He also restored the chapel using stained glass from ruined French churches.|$|E

5|$|Of the 332 {{people on}} board, 64 were rescued. Most {{of the crew}} and {{passengers}} <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> {{at the time of}} attack and had little chance to escape. It was estimated that up to 200 people may have been alive at the time Centaur submerged. Several who made it off the ship later died from shrapnel wounds or burns; others were unable to find support and drowned.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns {{and their}} friends left the {{restaurant}} roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> and all was well, except that he recalled having left the children's bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. He pulled it nearly closed again {{before returning to the}} restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The resort's {{staff had}} left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool {{reception}} area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening {{for the last four}} evenings of the holiday. The message said the group's children <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> in the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the abductor may have seen the note.|$|E

5|$|Tornado {{warnings}} were {{in effect}} {{at the time}} and issued on average about 30 minutes before the tornado hit, but few people were alerted as many <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> as the tornado hit in the overnight hours. The local NOAA Weather Radio transmitter was experiencing technical difficulties at the time, causing some weather radios to not sound an alarm. Damages were estimated at around $85 million.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an {{engagement}} at the Gus Stevens Supper Club. After two appearances {{the evening of}} June 28, Mansfield, Sam Brody (her attorney and companion), their driver Ronnie Harrison (age 20), and three of Mansfield's children– Miklós, Zoltán and Mariska– departed Biloxi after midnight in a 1966 Buick Electra 225. Their destination was New Orleans, where Mansfield was scheduled to appear on WDSU's Midday Show at noon the next day. At approximately 2:25a.m., on U.S. Highway 90 west of the Rigolets Bridge, the Buick crashed at high speed into the rear of a tractor-trailer that had slowed behind a truck spraying mosquito fogger and that was shrouded in the insecticide fog. The three adults {{in the front seat}} were killed instantly. The children, who <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|The Nile {{crocodile}} has {{a reputation}} as the biggest killer of large animals, including humans, on the African continent. It is widely distributed, found in many habitats and cryptically coloured. From a waiting position with only its eyes and nostrils above the water, it can lunge at drinking animals, fishermen, bathers, or people collecting water or washing clothes. Once seized and dragged into the water, there is little chance for the victim to escape. Analysis of attacks show that most take place during the breeding season or when crocodiles are guarding nests or newly hatched young. Although many attacks go unreported, there are estimated to be over 300 per year, 63% of which are fatal. Wild saltwater crocodiles in Australia carried out 62 confirmed and unprovoked attacks causing injury or death between 1971 and 2004. These animals have also caused fatalities in Malaysia, New Guinea, and elsewhere. They are highly territorial and resent intrusion into their territories by other crocodiles, humans, or boats such as canoes. Attacks may come from animals of various sizes, but the larger males are generally responsible for fatalities. As their size increases, so does their need for larger mammalian prey; pigs, cattle, horses, and humans are all within the size range they seek. Most of the people attacked were either swimming or wading, but in two instances they <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> in tents.|$|E

Their boat's improvised anchor failed {{to prevent it from}} being carried away by currents while they <b>were</b> <b>asleep.</b> The boat drifted into the shallows of the island, where they were killed. An Indian Coast Guard helicopter that was sent to retrieve the bodies was driven off by Sentinelese warriors, who fired a volley of arrows.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 1986, Sellers {{killed his}} mother, Vonda Bellofatto, and his stepfather, Lee Bellofatto, while they <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> {{in the bedroom}} of their Oklahoma City home. Wearing only {{underwear}} to limit blood spatter on himself, he first shot his step-father. The shot awoke his mother, who he shot in the face. Sellers tried to disguise his guilt by arranging the crime scene {{to look as if}} an intruder had committed the killings.|$|E
25|$|The Secret Garden was {{decorated}} like a jungle, {{and the three}} secret housemates were initially only supplied with fig leaves to cover only the main essentials of their bodies.

25|$|The {{first of}} the two-men {{submarines}} entered the harbour at 8 pm, while the third became entangled in the harbour's anti-submarine boom net. One sub managed to reach Potts Point where, under fire, it fired two torpedoes at the US heavy cruiser Chicago. Missing the target, one torpedo struck the sea wall against which the converted harbour ferry HMAS Kuttabul was moored. The blast sank the Kuttabul, killing 19 Australian and 2 British naval personnel who <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> on board.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Tantalus after midnight, {{they woke}} up the {{telegraph}} operator who sent out a message about the disaster with no response—all the other operators <b>were</b> <b>asleep.</b> The first to receive the message, at 9:00a.m. on September26, was at Whitehorse. The first ship {{to arrive at the}} scene of the explosion was the sternwheeler Victorian, arriving at 7:00p.m.. Captain Williams had returned that morning; Christianson and Woods had died during the night. Murray died shortly after being carried aboard the Victorian.|$|E
25|$|On June 23, 1804, whilst the Fort Diamond {{was on a}} {{provisioning}} expedition at Roseau Bay, St. Lucia, a French boarding {{party from}} a schooner came up to her in two rowboats, boarding her at night {{while most of the}} crew <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> below decks. A subsequent court-martial aboard HMS Galatea at English Harbour, Antigua, convicted Acting Lieutenant Benjamin Westcott of allowing his vessel to be captured. The board dismissed him from the Royal Navy, never to be permitted to serve in the navy again. He became an American citizen three years later.|$|E

25|$|The high {{loss of life}} {{caused by}} the {{earthquake}} {{can be attributed to}} the time it struck and how suddenly it struck, as well as to the quality and nature of building construction in China. The earthquake lacked the foreshocks that sometimes come with earthquakes of this magnitude. It also struck at just before 4a.m., when most people <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> and unprepared. Tangshan itself was thought to be in a region with a relatively low risk of earthquakes. Very few buildings had been built to withstand an earthquake, and the city lies on unstable alluvial soil. Therefore, hundreds of thousands of buildings were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|During flight day 4, the MPLM Leonardo was berthed to the Nadir (the Earth-facing port on Harmony) {{using the}} Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). Once it was berthed, the crews {{activated}} it {{and opened the}} hatch for ingress. Some more items were transferred from the shuttle mid-deck including the MDS experiment and the space suits Danny Olivas and Nicole Stott would use during EVA 1. The pair also prepared all the tools {{that would be used}} during the EVA with some help from Tim Kopra. Later during the night when the crews <b>were</b> <b>asleep,</b> the team of ground controllers vented the Port 1 (P1) Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA) Nitrogen Vent lines in preparation for the ATA to be removed during EVA 1.|$|E
25|$|The airstrike {{was carried}} out using two bombs, {{at least one of}} which was {{precision}} guided, which were dropped in the hour following 1 a.m. on July 30, The second bomb was dropped five to fifteen minutes after the first. The aerial attack killed members of the Shalhoub and Hashem families who had used an underground garage below a three-story apartment building as a shelter during the bombing. Initial news reports state that the families <b>were</b> <b>asleep</b> when the two bombs were dropped on their building. While Israel had directed residents of South Lebanon to flee the conflict, roads out of the area were also subject to Israeli bombardment. One of the eight survivors of the blast said that attacks on the roads out of Qana discouraged the two families from leaving.|$|E
