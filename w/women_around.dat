5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} the normal state for all adult residents of the colony. Most men first married in their mid-twenties and <b>women</b> <b>around</b> age 20. Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and economic pressures to remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within {{six months to a}} year. Most adults who reached marriageable age lived into their sixties, so effectively two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century botany {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} considered {{appropriate for}} genteel educated <b>women.</b> <b>Around</b> 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, {{at one of}} the {{literary}} salons hosted by Adelaida Gertsyk, Parnok met the young poet Marina Tsvetaeva, with whom she became involved in an affair that left important imprints on the poetry of both <b>women.</b> <b>Around</b> the same time, Parnok read, and later rewrote some of the works of the Greek poet Sappho. By October, Tsvetaeva had committed to the affair, disregarding her obligations to her husband and daughter by writing her first love poem to Parnok. Prior to her affair with Tsvetaeva, Parnok's poetry had not shown the originality of expression that her later works would evidence. Each of the two women drove the other to excel, revealing that Parnok had the upper-hand in love while Tsvetaeva was the more refined poet. On a personal level, Tsvetaeva was both attracted and repelled Parnok's passion, increasing her feelings of insecurity. On a professional level, both were surprised at the depth of their own jealousy, channeling their envy into a creative duel of words.|$|E

500|$|In a September 1995 {{speech before}} the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against {{practices}} that abused <b>women</b> <b>around</b> {{the world and}} in the People's Republic of China itself, declaring that [...] "it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights". Delegates from over 180countries heard her say: [...] "If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all." [...] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks. The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later <b>women</b> <b>around</b> the world would recite Clinton's key phrases. She {{was one of the}} most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.

According to Frankel, Streep saw the film {{as a chance to}} [...] "skewer the doyennes of the fashion world." [...] She has three daughters, and as an ardent feminist, felt that fashion magazines [...] "twisted the minds of young <b>women</b> <b>around</b> the world and their priorities. This was an interesting way to get back at them." [...] Also, she said, the film passed the Bechdel test.|$|E
