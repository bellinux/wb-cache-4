40|$|Abstract: At {{the current}} time, Asia {{is the most}} {{important}} market in terms of production for <b>world</b> <b>rubber</b> and consumption. The <b>world</b> prices of <b>rubber</b> are not only subject to the changing in demands, but also to the speculation of the future markets. It is acknowledged that Japan and Singapore are the major futures markets for rubber and Thailand is one of the world’s biggest producers of rubber. Since the rubber price is influenced by the external markets, attention should paid in great detail to the relationships between the markets in Thailand, Japan and Singapore. There is a need to empirically examine the na tural rubber RSS 3 in the market relationship context of these three countries. The analysis is conducted on a variety of mult ivariate GARCH framework. The results indicate that the constant conditional correlat ions from CCC models of Bollerslev (1990) are medium and low. The results from VARMA-GARCG of Ling and McAleer (2003) and VARMA-AGARCH of McAleer et al. (2008) suggest the presence of volatility spillovers and asymmetric effects of positive and negative return shocks on the conditional volatility. Fin ally, DCC models of Engle (2002) presents that the conditional correlations can vary dramatically over time. In general, the dynamic volatilities returns in rubber spot and futures returns could be either independent or interdependent over time...|$|R
50|$|Thailand {{ranks as}} the <b>world's</b> largest <b>rubber</b> {{producer}} and exporter, producing around 4.3 million tonnes per year, while consuming only 519,000 tons. It provides about 40 percent of the <b>world's</b> natural <b>rubber,</b> mostly used in aircraft and automobile tires. But the rubber industry has faced a series of challenges. Alongside drought in 2015-2016, Thailand was hit hard by an oversupply in international rubber markets. Following a record harvest in 2011, Thailand increased rubber acreage by 45 percent. Other top producers in the region followed suit. Concomitantly, China's demand for rubber decreased by 10 percent. China is the <b>world's</b> largest natural <b>rubber</b> consumer, using 4,150,000 tons in 2013. At one point {{the price of the}} <b>world's</b> benchmark smoked <b>rubber</b> sheet dropped as low as US$1.27 per kilogram, or 80 percent below the record high of US$6.40 per kg in February 2011. Similarly, rubber futures in Shanghai have dropped by 22 percent and the export price of Thai rubber by 23 percent. Then, as prices began to rebound, the southern provinces of Thailand, where two-thirds of the Thai rubber plantations are located, were hit by torrential rains and flooding {{at the peak of the}} rubber-tapping season. The Rubber Authority of Thailand forecasts that output will drop 7.6 percent in 2017. Farmers, unable to harvest rubber sap due to high water, are unable to take advantage of the highest rubber prices in four years. Largely due to the flooding, prices for unsmoked USS3 rubber sheets in Nakhon Si Thammarat have increased steadily and reached 84.32 baht (US$2.38) per kilogram in January 2017 and will likely go higher. Rubber growers face an even greater danger: rubber trees die after 20 days when inundated by flood waters.|$|R
