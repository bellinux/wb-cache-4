It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E

About 12,000 Poles in total were forced to leave the region and flee to Poland in the aftermath of the division of Cieszyn Silesia. The local Polish population felt that Warsaw had betrayed them and they were not satisfied with the division. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia. Estimates range from 110,000 to 140,000 people in 1921. The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on self-declaration and many Poles declared Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits. Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities, but the reality in Zaolzie was quite different. The local Czech authorities made it more difficult for local Poles to obtain citizenship, while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school. Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped, thus inducing some Poles to send their children there. This and other factors contributed to the assimilation of Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland. After a few years, the heightened nationalism typical of the period around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co-operated with the Czechs. Still, Czechization was supported by Prague, which did not abide by certain laws related to language, legislative, and organizational issues.

The starting point is to address concepts such as the complex of the fellow human being, narcissism, identification, the internal-external relationship, the Iother relationship, the stranger, etc. The proposal is, therefore, to draw a theoretical path through some Freudian texts and, based on it, defend that difference-related topics are present in all of them as a constant link of interest to the author. The intention is to indicate that Freud believed that the dynamics of psychism is always related to what is, in one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> another, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> one, to what differs. Subjects depend on other subjects when they are born,they develop relations with people and culture, they fall in love with things and people, they identify themselves.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{believe that}} all {{languages}} in the world use the Economy Principle in some <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>other.</b> <b>The</b> principle states that “languages tend to express ideas as economically as possible”. This means that the speaker tends to leave out unnecessary words and not to repeat concepts that have been previously expressed. In the Portuguese language, such expressions as “recuar para trás”, “ambos os dois”, and “preferir antes” are justifiably viewed as poor, since they unnecessarily repeat ideas (“para trás” is implied in “recuar”, “ambos” includes the idea of “os dois”, “preferir” encompasses the concept of “antes”). This type of expressions is anti-economical, and grammar books classify them as pleonasms, i. e. redundancies. English {{is so easy to}} learn by foreigners partly because {{it is one of the}} languages that most efficiently use the economy principle. In this brief note, we present several perspectives that justify the previous statements, with examples from English and Portuguese. N/...|$|R

Other similar rat sarcomas are Takeda-, MTK- and Hirosaki sarcoma (Yoshida, 1953).

We have observed that these atomically smooth monolayers also provide a slip boundary condition for dewetting films composed of unentangled polymers. This slip length, an indirect measure of the friction between a given liquid and different solids, is switchable and can be increased [Fetzer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 2005; Bäumchen et al. J. Phys. : Cond. Matt. 2012] if the alkyl chain length is changed from 18 to 12 backbone carbons, for example. Typically, this change in boundary condition is affected in a quantized <b>way,</b> using one <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> alkyl chain length, thus obtaining one <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> slip length. Here, we present results in which this SAM structure is changed in a continuous way. We prepare SAMs containing bidisperse mixed SAMs of alkyl silanes, with the composition as a control parameter.

The slip length, varying over nearly two orders of magnitude, of identical polymer melts on chemically similar SAMs is found to correlate with the density of exposed alkyl chains.

30|$|On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{side are}} those who {{point to the fact}} that the labor market is highly {{imperfect}} and the neoclassical paradigm is not suitable, even as approximation to reality. If employers exert market power in some <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>other,</b> <b>the</b> competitive equilibrium view becomes obsolete. Under limited competition on the labor market, it may well be that workers are paid below the value of their marginal productivity. The firm has an incentive to keep employment below the market clearing level when it is possible to force workers down to the labor supply curve. In such a situation, a government intervention is able—at least within a certain range—to increase both wages and employment at the same time. Of course, a pure monopsony environment as in the classical case of a company town is not a realistic description of a modern economy where workers are mobile and can escape the narrow confines of a local labor market. However, new approaches of monopsonistic competition as outlined, for instance, by Manning (2003 a, 2003 b), show that a corresponding situation can arise in a realistic labor market setting. The reasons why a firm might exert some monopsonistic power range from asymmetric information between employers and employees to the specific circumstances, restrictions or preferences of an individual worker. Take, for instance, the case of a single mother when a child care facility happens to be around the corner from the firm: she would then tend to accept a wage offer somewhat lower than she would be typically willing to accept under other circumstances.|$|R
30|$|Although one’s {{health is}} the prime concern of human beings, the {{environment}} should also {{be a matter of}} equal importance as conventional agriculture which uses chemical inputs could also affect in one <b>way</b> <b>or</b> <b>other,</b> <b>the</b> health of the environment. Nonetheless, when the awareness of people of the effects of conventional agriculture on the environment is enhanced, they would be convinced to express their increasing concern on the need to protect the environment (Hemmerling et al. 2015; Falguera et al. 2012; Hjelmar 2011; Haghiri et al. 2009). Many people now consider the environment as gift of nature with an inherent right to remain healthy, but since the environment itself cannot express such right, human beings have the duty to respect this right as it would also benefit them in return. Consumers with such altruistic vision are aware of agricultural produce that are beneficial <b>or</b> harmful to <b>the</b> environment, and are also able to see the connection between the environment and human health. The findings of this study clearly indicate that consumers in Bangkok, in general, very strongly consider organic agriculture as environment-friendly. Similarly, they also strongly believe that organic vegetables are beneficial to their health. Such perception is directly attributed to their frequent access to information on organic agriculture and organic vegetables through popular sources such as the internet and television (Table 9). As most people in Bangkok have their own personal computers and smart phones, they could easily access the information on any topics of their interest including those on organic agriculture.|$|R
