[...] "One {{or two of}} the {{vehicles}} carrying the ideas were not as strong as the ideas that they carried. I thought we should try and work harder on marrying the idea and the vehicle that carried it, so that they both had an equal magic… It's something I was personally pushing <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> Wish You Were Here." ...|$|E
500|$|Fantasia {{began to}} make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was {{promoted}} with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a psychedelic experience. Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people [...] "thought we were on a trip <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> it... every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask us what we were on." [...] The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping. Fantasia was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.|$|E
500|$|On the {{direction}} of the film, Selick reflected, [...] "It's as though he [...] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job {{to make it look like}} 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films." [...] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, [...] "I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total." [...] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.|$|E

500|$|At the September 26 MSNBC debate, Biden {{explained}} {{how he would}} allow for Social security to last. He {{said that in the}} 1980s he had a meeting with prominent members of Congress and the solution they came up with was the raise the cap level, he stated that now the same solution would apply and that unity between the two parties was also necessary, [...] "It was Joe Biden, Pat Moynihan, Bob Dole... George Mitchell <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> that deal [...] I'll never forget Bob Dole turning to Pat Moynihan and saying, 'we all got to jump in this boat at the same time.' So the bottom line here is, you can't do it by growing the economy alone. So I would raise the cap." [...] Later in the debate Biden was one of three participants (along with Dodd and Richardson) who said they would ban smoking in public places.|$|E
500|$|Following {{their victory}} and {{awarding}} of the Governor's Victory Bell, Minnesota players, purportedly [...] "a little excited after ... the team’s first {{win over the}} Nittany Lions in nearly a decade", broke the trophy. For Penn State, though coming off a 200-rushing yard performance, Belton took a back seat in the rushing attack to Zwinak after fumbling in the first quarter. In total, The Morning Call graded Penn State's offense by awarding them a C-, noting the lack of scoring despite opportunities in Minnesota territory, though noting Zwinak's resurgence as a mitigating factor. They awarded the defense the same grade, noting that though they improved in the second half, they were [...] "torched" [...] on consecutive drives early in the game. They summarized Penn State's coaching with a comment from O'Brien: [...] "It seemed like, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> a call, they had the right call for it." [...] In total, the article asserted that overall, Minnesota was the superior team. StateCollege.com's Ben Jones predominantly concurred, giving the offense a C-, but giving the defense a C+, noting that the defense did keep Penn State competitive in the game.|$|E

60|$|The reader {{may decide}} {{as to the}} {{relative}} importance of what I left out, and of what Mr. Max Muller omitted.

2500|$|Gleeson said of {{the tumultuous}} times, [...] "When we were going through that tough period I had a {{sit down with the}} board and said, 'this is my vision, can you back it?' To their credit they said, 'yes, we'll back it in' and that is <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> our move. We could've been sitting outside the finals and {{watching}} this game evolve." ...|$|E
2500|$|Car and Driver {{magazine}} said: [...] "...We {{think the}} front and rear together produce a 'molded' shape that speaks of function rather than decor." [...] Chevrolet commented on the new tailpiece in the '74 Corvette sales brochure: “Take the styling. We wouldn’t just change it for the sake of change. But <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> the rear bumper stronger, we made Corvette’s rear styling look different. And, we think better...” ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{added that}} some of the {{technology}} on Space: 1999 has come to pass: [...] "We made up a scanning device for Dr Russell. Someone would simply be lying on the floor half dead, and I would [...] with this funny little thing that was a prop. I could read all his vital signs. They can pretty much do that [...] nowadays. There were times that we were playing with props that didn't read anything — I just had a bunch of dialogue to say after. We had the Commlock. All of those things {{were on the verge of}} happening anyway. Now we're way past it. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> it, 1999 seemed so far away." ...|$|E

"What I can't understand," [...] I insisted subtly, [...] "is how on earth, {{with this}} wind, she {{has managed to}} be just where she was <b>when</b> <b>we</b> first <b>made</b> her out.

2500|$|Two verses {{later we}} read: [...] "And remember, Children of Israel, <b>when</b> <b>We</b> <b>made</b> a {{covenant}} {{with you and}} raised Mount Sinai before you saying, [...] "Hold tightly to what We have revealed to you and keep it in mind so that you may guard against evil." [...] But then you turned away, and {{if it had not}} been for Allah's grace and merecy, you surely would have been among the lost. And you know those among who sinned on the Sabbath. We said to them, [...] "You will be transformed into despised apes." [...] So we used them as a warning to their people and to the following generations, as well as a lesson for the God-fearing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fox Atomic {{stated in}} June 2007 {{that they would}} {{consider}} producing a third film if DVD sales of the film did well. In July 2007, while promoting Sunshine, Boyle {{said he had a}} possible story for the next film. [...] "There is an idea for the next one, something which would move the story on. I've got to think about it, whether it's right or not." [...] In October 2010, when Alex Garland was asked what was happening with 28 Months Later, he declared: [...] "I'll answer that completely honestly. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> 28 Days Later, the rights were frozen between {{a group of people who}} are no longer talking to each other. And so, the film is never going to happen unless those people start talking to each other again. There is no script as far as I'm aware."

2500|$|The early European {{name for}} the {{district}} was [...] "Limestone Plains". In 1820, following the discovery of Lake George and the Yass River, Governor Lachlan Macquarie decided to send a party, with provisions for one month, to discover the Murrumbidgee River. Joseph Wild was accompanied by James Vaughan, a constable, and Charles Throsby Smith, a nephew of the explorer Charles Throsby. Detailed instructions {{had been given to}} the explorers by Charles Throsby, who had accompanied the Lake George exploration party earlier in the year. They were provided with acid to test for limestone. On 7 December 1820, Smith recorded in his journal: ... Came on to one of the plains we saw at 11 o’clock. At half past 1, came to a very extensive plain, fine Rich Soil and plenty of grass. Came to a Beautiful River plains that was running thro’ the plains in a S.W. direction, by the side of which we slept that night. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> the Hut this evening, we saw several pieces of stone that had been burnt by all appearances. I then examined some of it, which proved to be limestone. ...|$|E

5000|$|... {{unfortunately}} Captains Of Industry {{had gone}} under <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had <b>made</b> this record, {{and the guys}} at 14th Floor heard it and really loved it, and so we kind of gave them a finished piece.
