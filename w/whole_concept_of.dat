Chenoweth defeated Williams again in 1998 by a wider margin. She later said that she regretted limiting herself to three terms and called the <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> term limits bad policy. She nonetheless honored her pledge and did not run for reelection to a fourth term in 2000. She was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Butch Otter, a fellow Republican.

His detractors were eager to denounce the <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> high-pressure steam, but Trevithick proved that the accident happened because his fireman had neglected to keep the boiler full of water. He publicised his invention widely, without patent, to counter these criticisms.|$|E

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} that standard medical <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> the disease were heavily biased towards hospital based patients attracted {{the interest of}} Dr. Peter Williams, then secretary of the Wellcome Trust, and a chance meeting resulted in Wellcome Trust support to Dr. Paul Milner, Dr. Graham Serjeant and Beryl {{over the next four}} years (1967-71). The grant provided a Volkswagen minibus which functioned as a mobile clinic and extensive travels over Jamaica following up patients long lost to the Clinic and the University Hospital showed that many were well and had actually improved with age. This observation changed the <b>whole</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> sickle-cell disease, confirmed the role of symptomatic selection and made the case for studies of the true natural history based on newborn detection of the disease.|$|R

[...] Reviewers have praised the game for its graphics, gameplay and score, and have noted that Final Fantasy IV {{was one of the first}} role-playing games to feature a complex, involving plot. However, retrospective reviews have heavily criticized the game's original SNES release for the poor quality of its English-language translation.|$|E

Although Anderson wrote all the music and lyrics, he co-credited the writing to a fictional schoolboy named Gerald Bostock. The humour was subtle enough that some fans {{believed}} that Bostock was real. Reviewing the 40th anniversary reissue, Noel Murray suggested that many listeners of the original album [...] "missed the joke".|$|E

[...] "At one point," [...] Kesha says [...] "I get to be strapped to this harness and bouncing around everywhere, {{and it was really}} cool [...] The <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the video was a bunch of douche-y guys macking on me as usual, and me making them eat their toupees or other various items".

500|$|Lord Hope {{said that}} there was [...] "a {{formidable}} body of authority which should not be lightly disregarded" [...] in favour of the immunity. He emphasised that the rule was not there to protect the incompetent expert witness, but ensure that witnesses were not deterred from coming forward and giving evidence without facing allegations afterwards in attempt to obtain damages from them. He was concerned by the lack of evidence either way as to whether an exception to the rule in Watson was needed or the consequences of introducing such an exception, particularly as the effect of the decision of the majority was to remove the immunity with retrospective effect, and there was [...] "no way back" [...] from this without legislation. The [...] "need for certainty" [...] made it necessary to extend the rule to all witnesses, in his view, even though some genuine claims may be barred as a result. He was particularly concerned that an [...] "incautious" [...] removal of the immunity from experts [...] "risks destabilising the protection that is given to witnesses generally", adding that the approach of Lord Phillips contained [...] "seeds...for challenging the <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> witness immunity." ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine {{disliked the}} single's [...] "inscrutability" [...] {{and said that}} song's backing track was {{reminiscent}} of t.A.T.u.'s [...] "All the Things She Said". Jason Richards from Now called the song [...] "awkward" [...] and Sputnikmusic's Rudy Clapper dismissed its attempt at a more mature sound, calling it [...] "cheesy". PopMatters' staff writer Steve Leftridge called the song [...] "neither strong nor edgy nor clever nor sonically interesting enough to lend any genuine credibility to Perry as a serious artist with anything to actually say". Amos Barshad of New York magazine felt West's alien metaphors went into jarring, misogynistic directions. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the song a C-, saying that while its lyrical content was [...] "borderline-embarrassing", it did earn [...] "a couple bonus points for showing a relatively darker side" [...] of Perry, while A.V. Club editor Steven Hyden was more critical of the both Perry's and West's lyrics, saying that [...] "borderline-embarrassing" [...] was too generous and that [...] "the <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the song is so beyond either side of sanity" [...] {{that it was impossible}} to grade.|$|E
500|$|In a 2004 interview, Simpson {{said that}} when she began seeking a {{recording}} contract record labels would not meet with her because they thought she just wanted [...] "to be like her sister". Simpson also said {{that she did not}} want to meet with Jessica's record label (Columbia) because she wanted to be signed because of her music, rather than her sister. She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they really let me have my hands in there. I got to write a lot." [...] Simpson said of making the album: [...] "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work." [...] In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album's liner notes, Simpson includes Benji and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, with whom she worked on the song [...] "Harder Everyday," [...] which was released as an international bonus track.|$|E

[...] Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do I sign this?" [...] And whoever brought it to him to get it signed, had to be ready with the answer that would satisfy a lawyer -- [...] "by what legal authority" [...] -- as well as what it provides and so forth.|$|E

For maximum impact, for the message to go through, I felt—since the story was against the establishment—let the establishment do it. After all, the establishment did hang Bhagat Singh. After all, the establishment did come down on the innocent, innocent students in Mandal Commission. After all the establishment did come down on Tiananmen Square. After all the establishment did come down when the <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Flower Power emerged in America. So it's all there.

40|$|Abstract. Concrete {{structure}} {{is one of}} the key courses of civil engineering major. Comparing with other courses in this major, the contents of concrete structure have a typical characteristic of emphasizing both theory and practice，so the teaching and learning of this course are difficult. Based on years of teaching practice of concrete structure, the author tries to rearrange teaching contents according to the cognitive characteristics of students. The new teaching process generally follows the order <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> structures, then design elements as well as detailed configuration, and finally structures design. The teaching practices show the new process which makes the content more quickly and accurately accepted by students. The status of concrete structure course Concrete structure course {{is one of the}} major core courses of civil engineering specialty, and the first professional foundation course students meet. For civil engineering major, various universities attach great importance to concrete structure course teaching.

Logroño counters by stating that he doesn't have to write a script for his character since, as his occasional mentor José Miguel Agrelot said constantly, [...] "the world is the best scriptwriter", and merely observing older statehood supporters in Puerto Rico provides him of enough original material. Logroño also claims that some of Eleuterio's criticism against some traditional customs within Puerto Rican culture, such as impunctuality, actually has a positive effect.

A year after his return he was made manager of the company's classical recording division, a position of great influence in the classical music world. The Gramophone obituarist wrote of him in 1980: [...] "To meet John Culshaw for the first time, quiet, charming, sharp-eyed but with no signs of aggressiveness about him, was to marvel that here {{was one of the}} two great dictators of recording art.

So inspired by that, the album came out that way...I still love that album very much...it came together in a very natural way.
