The research was aimed at the alleviation of wear in the gold mining industry. In order to achieve this objective it was necessary to examine the surfaces of worn materials in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the different wear mechanisms and also to examine the extent and depth of deformation induced by abrasive wear. Numerous proprietary wear resistant materials and stainless steels presently used in the gold mining industry together with other materials were included in this investigation. The abrasion and corrosion- abrasion wear resistance of two particular proprietary wear resisting materials was determined to be superior to mild steel and attempts were made to explain the good performance of these materials in terms of micro- structural and mechanical properties. Various techniques were used to study the effects of low and high stress wear of materials which had been tested in both the laboratory and in-situ in the mines. These techniques include scanning and transmission electron microscopy, optical metallography and microhardness studies. It was found that as the nominal load on the abrasive increased, the mode of material became more severe, the depth of deformation increased and the surface hardness increased. Attempts were made to explain these phenomena in terms of microstructural considerations, work hardening capacity, phase transformations and recovery and recrys- tallization.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} was to {{understand}} the structure and chemical composition changes of gas metal arc welded joints of wear resistant plate with constructional steel plate with possible application as replacing material for reservoirs and chute in cement industry. Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Design/methodology/approach: Wear resistant plates can be used for elements working in intensive abrasion resistance conditions to obtain considerable material and economical savings based on the manufacturing costs reducing and decreasing turnaround time for replacing worn parts. During the welding process of two materials, when one is wear plate and the other is steel plate significant structure changes and mixing of alloying components in weld area are observed. Findings: Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root, most of important changes during welding of <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>material</b> are connected with melting, mixing and carbides passage into weld area, non uniform chemical composition of the welded joint creates different microstructures with different hardness. Practical implications: Welding of wear resistant plate with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Root weld must be free of cracks and possibly free of intermixing with wear resistant plate material. Applying welding parameters described in the paper is possible to achieve free of cracks root, presence of crack in face weld is not important in term of wear resistance abilities of chute.

Material cost of IonAluminium based alloys is comparably low because their manufacturing and handling process are widely available. Fe-Al alloy is gaining its attractiveness in many business applications due to its wear properties and erosion properties, which {{is because of the}} presence of Al. The current study is focused on investigating the mechanical properties and tribological behaviour of Fe-Al alloy (Fe wt% 94. 18 and Al wt% 5. 82) to various heat treatment processes. In this investigation we deal with the analysis of microstructure by means of microscope, crystalline phases and its structural properties by means of XRD analysis. Specimens are heat treated at different temperature (4000 C, 6000 C, 8000 C and 12000 C) and then quenched. The soaking time being 2 hours and quenching media is simply water. After heat treatment, we have to investigate the comparison between mechanical properties and behaviour of the material by means of metallography, XRD analysis and Vickers hardness test. After Vickers hardness test, erosion properties are measured by means of Air jet iv erosion test rig machine. It is found that water quenched from 12000 C heated sample shows slightly increase in hardness, which is mainly due to new phase Al 5 W reveals in XRD pattern with highest intensity. XRD analysis shows that all samples of FeAl alloy are of BCC structure. Erosion wear test was executed on Fe-Al alloy by air jet erosion test rig. The volume of removed material gives the measurement of erosion wear at impact angles 300, 600 and 900. It is found that all heat treated samples (except quenched from 12000 C sample) having maximum disinterested material volume at 600 impact angles, which shows that all samples are semi ductile. But in case of quenched from 12000 C sample having maximum removed material volume is at 900 impact angle, shows brittle in nature.

Work to date provides the following conclusions and program status: (1) The authors modified the design of the filter disks to remove epoxy and Ryton{reg_sign}. The new design includes welding both stainless steel and ceramic coated stainless steel filter media to a stainless steel support plate. The welded disks were tested in the full-scale unit. They showed good reliability and met filtrate quality requirements. (2) The authors modified the design of the unit, making installation and removal easier. The new design uses a modular, one-piece filter stack that is removed simply by disassembly of a flange on the upper (inlet) side of the filter housing. All seals and rotary unions are contained within the removable stack. (3) While it is extremely difficult to predict the life of the seal, the vendor representative indicates a minimum of one year in present service conditions is reasonable. Changing the seal face material from silicon-carbide to a graphite-impregnated silicon-carbide is expected to double the life of the seal. Replacement of the current seal with an air seal could increase the lifetime to 5 years and is undergoing testing in the current work.

40|$|The {{development}} of 'plasma sprayed self-lubricating coatings with solid lubricants' is {{an answer to}} industry's increasing demand for alternatives to oil lubricated systems. Solid lubricants offer an improved high temperature and low pressure resistance and an immediate performance after a long out-of-service period. A homogeneous dispersion of solid lubricant particles in a <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>material</b> guarantees a long-term service of the lubricated component due to a continuous release of the lubricant and a lubricious film formation at the surface. In a {{first part of this}} doctoral thesis the research objectives are highlighted and the plasma spraying technique is discussed. Furthermore the performance of solid lubricants is thoroughly discussed along with their use and performance in self-lubricating coatings. Subsequently a production method is developed which allows to obtain these coatings in an adequate and efficient manner. Basically this method consists of a preliminary agglomeration of the raw materials, followed by the deposition of the agglomerates using plasma spraying. Along with this production method a procedure is developed which allows to determine and optimise the relations between the production parameters and the structural and tribological properties of the coatings. The production method and optimisation procedure are verified using Cr 2 O 3 -CaF 2, Ni 20 Cr-CaF 2 and Ni 20 Cr-BN combinations, in which CaF 2 or hexagonal BN are solid lubricants suitable for high temperature lubrication (400 °C). A homogeneous dispersion of CaF 2 particles in the Cr 2 O 3 matrix is obtained by means of a modified sinter-and-break method. Nevertheless, for these coatings no real self-lubricant is obtained, meaning that no lubricious film formation at the surface can be noticed. An unexpected tribochemically induced transition of CaF 2 is proven to be responsible for this anomaly. For the Ni 20 Cr-lubricant coatings a homogeneous dispersion of solid lubricant particles is obtained by means of mechanical alloying. At 400 °C both combinations show a real self-lubrication. Addition of 10 vol. % CaF 2 or 15 vol. % BN allows to reduce the the friction of Ni 20 Cr based coatings by 40 %, while wear is reduced by 60 %. The Ni 20 Cr-CaF 2 and Ni 20 Cr-BN coatings possess all the required tribological properties in order to be selected as materials suitable for industrial high-temperature-applications. The directives formulated towards the production of these coatings and originating from the above mentioned optimisation procedure, are presented as a basis for further {{development of}} 'plasma sprayed self-lubricating Ni 20 Cr-CaF 2 and Ni 20 Cr-BN coatings'. nrpages: 205 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Impala Platinum Limited Base Metals Refinery in Springs, South Africa, refines {{convertor}} matte containing {{base metals}} and PGM 2 ̆ 7 s (platinum group metals) using a hydrometallurgical process. In {{addition to a}} PGM-rich concentrate that is further refined, the Base Metals Refinery produces nickel (in powder or briquette form), copper cathodes and cobalt powder. Five leaching stages are utilized to remove the base metals and impurities from the PGM concentrate. The project described in this paper involves a radical redesign of the second stage leach autoclave {{with the aim of}} reducing maintenance costs and downtime, increasing throughput and ensuring a safer working environment. The second stage leach process at the Base Metals Refinery, produces a PGM-rich residue through the extraction of copper and any remaining base metals from the first stage leach solid residue material. Leaching is performed in an autoclave operating at a pressure of 600 kPaG and a temperature of 140 °C to 150 °C. Concentrated H 2 SO 4 is added to the feed to produce a solution with a free acid content between 10 and 30 g/L and a pH of less than 2. Oxygen is passed into the 1 st and 2 nd compartments of the autoclave. As a result of the aggressive, highly oxidizing conditions within the autoclave, the original design utilized a heavy wall carbon steel shell with lead lining and two layers of acid bricks. The bricks acted as a <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>material</b> and ensured a low surface temperature at the skin of the lead lining, whereas the lead lining acted as a corrosion barrier to protect the steel shell. These brick lined autoclaves were heavy, maintenance intensive and prone to catastrophic failure. A radical autoclave redesign was needed to reduce the high costs of manufacturing, installation and operation. Finite element modelling was used to optimize the design and various high alloy materials were investigated for the application. Based on extensive test work, the carbon steel shell was replaced with duplex SAF 2205 stainless steel in the new design. The use of this highly corrosion resistant material, eliminates the need for the lead and brick linings and reduces the wall thickness requirements substantially, resulting in an increase in the available volume for the same external shell dimensions. The vessel is welded in circular sections to form an elongated, impermeable, cylindrical body, with several agitator nozzles and compartments. The first new duplex stainless steel unit has been in continuous operation for more than 24 months and its performance has exceeded the highest expectations. The design was so successful that a patent has been registered. The major benefits of the new stainless steel design include increased throughput, improved performance, less downtime and a safer working environment. Lead has been eliminated and replaced with a more environmentally safe material, and the total lifespan of the vessel has been extended. In addition, the autoclave project has made significant developments in advancing the field of welding and optimizing the integrity of welding quality standards in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{cladding}} is {{a process}} for depositing corrosion <b>resistant</b> and <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>materials</b> on structural components and is widely used in the maritime, oil and gas exploration, and energy industries. With high deposition rate laser cladding, a powder mass is pre-placed {{in front of a}} scanned laser beam using a powder feed nozzle. Little work has been done to optimize the design of the powder feed nozzle, and so it is not well understood how changes in the geometry of the nozzle affect the geometry of the powder mass. A design of experiments was created testing different nozzle geometries and their affects on the pre-placed powder mass. It has been discovered that deposition rates are not affected by nozzle geometry changes, and that powder mass geometries are most uniform using the double cone nozzle geometry...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is the targeted design of new <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>materials</b> {{through the development of}} analytic frameworks. The building of databases on wear data, whether through calculation or experiment, is a very time-consuming problem with high levels of data uncertainty. For these reasons of small data size and high data uncertainty, the development of a hybrid data analytic framework for accelerating the selection of target materials is needed. In this thesis, the focus is on binary ceramic compounds with the properties of interest as friction coefficient and hardness and with the objective being to minimize friction while improving the wear resistance. These design requirements are generally inversely correlated, further requiring the data science framework that is developed in this thesis. This thesis develops a new hybrid methodology of linking dimensionality reduction (principal component analysis) and association mining to aid in materials selection. The novelty in this developed approach is the linking of multiple data mining methodologies into a single framework, which addresses issues such as physically-meaningful attribute selection, addressing data uncertainty, and identifying specific candidate materials when property trade-offs exist. The result of this thesis is a hybrid methodology for material selection, which is used here for identifying new promising <b>materials</b> for <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> applications...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} paper outlines the research activity {{being carried out}} at Industrial Research Institute Swinburne (IRIS) on the evaluation studies of different samples prepared using hot embossing technique. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate microtribology aspects of electroformed shims meant for replication using hot embossing for Micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) applications. Micro hot embossing {{has been one of the}} most simple and cost effective route of replication of many MEMS components [...] -using electroformed shim with the features on it to replicate these structures in plastics. There is a need to increase the lifetime of these electroformed shims as this has been recognised as one of major obstacles. This problem can be solved during shim fabrication (by altering electroforming conditions) and also by deposition of <b>wear</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>materials</b> TiN and CrN to improve wear properties of replication tools. As a first step in this direction, we have started work on evaluating the electroformed shim structures and the results of these studies are presented in this paper...|$|R
