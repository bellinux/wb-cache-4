40|$|Norway is {{the world}} largest {{producer}} of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In 2013 the Norwegian aquaculture industry produced 1. 2 million metric tons salmon {{with the use of}} 1. 5 million metric tons of commercial feeds. The feeds are delivered to the farms in big bags or in bulk and are conveyed pneumatically to the sea cages. Such harsh treatments expose pellets to stress that may give product loss due to abrasion and fragmentation. Feed loss in pneumatic feeding systems is estimated to be in the range of 0. 3 % to 1. 5 %. This equals a yearly additional expense of around 40 to 200 million NOK for the Norwegian salmon industry. To minimize product loss the feed has to be of a consistent and high physical quality. Extrusion processing is a technology that enables production of such feed quality. Physical pellet quality is normally improved by the addition of starch and other binders, but recent research has shown that the protein ingredients in the feed mix also impact the physical quality of extruded feed products. During the last decade several new plant derived protein ingredients has been introduced and partly replaced fishmeal. This has introduced new challenges in fish feed extrusion and stressed the importance to improve the knowledge related to the technical properties of the individual ingredients. The main objectives of this work have been to quantify fishmeal physicochemical properties with significant effects on the extrusion cooking process and physical pellet quality, and to study the plasticization effect of <b>water</b> <b>solubles</b> in fishmeal. Various multivariate analytical techniques have been applied in the studies, such as principal component analysis, partial least squares -and multiple linear regression. In Paper I and II, the impact of variation in fishmeal physicochemical properties were assessed based on standardized extrusion, drying and coating conditions. In Paper III the effect of water-soluble protein level and moisture content on the extrusion process, extrudate phase transitions and physical quality of feed were studied. In Paper IV the influence of fishmeal <b>water</b> <b>solubles</b> and added moisture on glass transition and flow-starting temperature were quantified. The studies in Paper I and II document the complexity of fishmeal as a protein ingredient with significant impact on the extrusion process, starch gelatinization and physical pellet quality. Large differences in technical quality within and between the studied fishmeal types (i. e. herring and sand eel) were observed. The research quantifies a positive effect of increased levels of water-soluble protein on pellet durability and hardness. This can be explained by two different mechanisms: a crosslinking effect of large polypeptides and a plasticizing effect of smaller peptides and amino acids. Differences in peptide size distribution between the two studied groups were identified with the highest level of large polypeptides for herring meal. At an equal level of water-soluble protein, extruded feed containing fishmeal from sand eel had significantly lower physical quality than feed containing herring meal. This can be attributed to differences in thermal and rheological properties between the two studied groups, and improper cooking in the extruder barrel for sand eel based feed mixes. Incomplete cooking or transformation may result in increased levels of particles in the extrudates and poor physical feed quality. The studies also document that fishmeal specifications normally used on the world commodity market inadequately describe the technical properties of fishmeal. In Paper III the effects of water-soluble protein level in fishmeal on extrusion behaviour, phase transitions and physical feed quality were studied. The plasticizing effect of water-soluble protein was comparable to that of moisture. However, in contrast to moisture, addition of water-soluble protein had a positive effect on specific mechanical energy and physical pellet quality. No loss of water-soluble protein during the extrusion process could be observed, confirming that the amino acids and peptides do not form any new covalent bonds in the extrusion process. A non-volatile plasticizer like water-soluble protein will not be removed in the drying process. It will therefore influence the viscoelastic properties of the final product and {{have a positive effect on}} physical pellet quality by establishment of an intermolecular binding network through hydrogen-, ionic bond, and hydrophobic interactions. It can be concluded from the study that water-soluble protein can be used as a processing aid for the fish feed industry, serving multiple purposes as nutrient, plasticizer and binder in extruded fish feed. In Paper IV significant effects of fishmeal <b>water</b> <b>solubles</b> and moisture level on the glass transition and flow-starting temperatures have been documented. The effect of solubles level on the glass transition temperature could be modelled based on the Gordon-Taylor equation. The documented plasticizing effect of <b>water</b> <b>solubles</b> was lower than the effect of moister addition per unit mass, but higher on a molar basis. The plasticization effect can be attributed to the content of low molecular nitrogencompounds. The studied fishmeal model system showed a large composition region of <b>water</b> <b>solubles</b> and moisture with a higher difference between the flow-starting and glass transition temperature than for other reported protein components (i. e. casein, gluten and soya protein isolate). This indicates a reduced temperature effect on viscosity reduction in the rubbery phase for fishmeal in this region. Combined with significantly lower glass transition temperatures, such differences in physicochemical properties may contribute to explain the unique functional properties of fishmeal compared to plant based proteins and casein. This will have positive impact on physical pellet quality and open up the possibility to obtain a satisfactory thermomechanical transformation in the extrusion process at reduced moisture level. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{solubility}} enhancement {{process of}} hydrophobic drugs {{plays a key}} role in the formulation development to achieve the bioavailability and therapeutic action of the drug at the target site. As estimated, among the newly discovered chemical entities nearly 40 % drugs are poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble.</b> To get proper therapeutic level of drug in plasma, a high dose of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs is required.

Glucan recovery was used as the main response factor for pretreatment optimization through a central composite design. Autohydrolysis at 210 °C for 10 min had a good pretreatment performance but phosphoric acid catalysis (19 mg g- 1) resulted in better yields under considerably milder conditions (180 °C, 5 min).

The gelation reaction is inhibited by ferulic and vanillic acid but not by fumaric acid. This suggests that the mechanism whereby gelation occurs is {{comparable to that of}} wheat pentosan-protein material, in that the ferulic acid aromatic ring and not the propenoic moiety is involved in the gelation. Enzyme treatments showed that although protein probably is not necessary for the oxidative process, the presence of the pentosan moiety is required. Cysteine residues in the protein most likely are not involved in the gelation because N-ethylmaleimide has no effect on gelation, and the inhibition of the gelation reaction by cysteine can be rationalized as an effect of competition for the hydrogen peroxide. Ascorbic acid also inhibited the gelation, and its role probably can be ascribed at least partially to the same mechanism. High concentrations of cysteine or ascorbic acid in the presence of peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide reduced the relative viscosity of a pentosanprotein solution to experimental readings below those of the ungelled control solution. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Addition of 2 % high {{molecular}} weight rye water-soluble pentosans to European bread wheat flour greatly changed its rheological and functional breadmaking properties. When the rye fractions were added as dry powder, {{the changes in the}} mixograph curves were smaller than the changes of the fractions that were presoaked in water and then added. Under the latter conditions, the mixograph peak height and area under the curve were greatly increased. Response surface methodology showed that the loaf volume of breads obtained from wheat flour is strongly dependent on mixing time and water addition. The addition of the rye components as a fine powder to wheat flour increased the water-absorption level and the range of mixing times for obtaining a bread of constant loaf volume and crumb quality. At the same time, it was possible to incorporate more water and to mix for a longer time without impairing the dough-handling properties.

Our data base included 56 separate studies on decomposition of pine needle litter, spanning Scots pine, lodgepole pine, Aleppo pine, stone pine and white pine, mainly incubated {{at the site of}} collection. Studies had 5 to 19 samplings, on average 10, and the decomposition was followed to a mass loss ranging from 47 to 83 %, on average 67 %. The periods from 3. 0 to 5. 4 years, on average 3. 9 years, were of sufficient duration to allow estimates of limit values of decomposition. We used a linear mixed model with regression effects to relate limit values to potential explanatory variables, namely the sites' long-term mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) and to substrate-chemistry factors. Regarding the latter, we explored two models; one that included initial concentrations of <b>water</b> <b>solubles,</b> lignin, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Mn and one that included only lignin, N, Ca, and Mn to focus on those nutrients known to influence lignin degradation. Using backward elimination significant explanatory variables were determined. For litter decomposed in its site of origin we found the limit value to depend mainly on the initial concentration of Mn, with higher Mn concentrations resulting in higher accumulated mass loss. Thus, litter with higher Mn reached a higher limit value and left a smaller stable fraction. This is likely {{due to the fact that}} Mn is an essential component of ligninolytic enzymes important for degrading litter in the later stages of decomposition. Manganese has received little attention in decomposition studies to date.

Lightfastness and determination of volatile matter, determination of matter soluble in dichloromethane, determination of sulphated total ash and sulphated water-insoluble ash, determination of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> matter, <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> inorganic matter and <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> organic matter, determination of nitrogen content and hide substance, calculation of degree of tannage determination of formaldehyde content analyses were performed to the leathers tanned with modified mimosa and quebracho tannins. From comparison of results, it was understood that sulpmethylation process can be used for production of leathers with higher lightfastness and without major change on chemical properties. When chemical properties of leathers tanned with modified quebracho and mimosa are considered: volatile matter, sulphated total ash and sulphated water- insoluble ash, <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> matter, <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> inorganic matter and <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> organic matter, hide substance and formaldehyde contents were found compatible with standard mimosa and quebracho. However degree of tannage and matter soluble in dichloromethane values were found lower, which means some enhancements in modification or fatliquoring process should be considered. ...|$|R

Approach: It is now believed that the <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> antioxidants are also present in other biomass of the oil palm, namely, the leaves. This study reported on the determination of the <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> antioxidants in oil palm leaves. Results: The results showed the analyses of the antioxidants in oil palm leaves. Conclusion: This study is thus conducted to trace the availability of these antioxidants in the leaves of the oil palm of the Elaeis guineensis variety...|$|R
40|$|Liquisolid {{technique}} {{is new and}} promising method that can enhance the dissolution rate of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs. At present 56 % of the drugs coming directly from synthesis are poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs. The enhancement of oral bioavailability of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs {{is one of the}} challenging aspects of drug development. Liquisolid {{technique is}} based upon the dissolving the drug in a suitable non-volatile solvent and admixture of drug loaded solutions with appropriate carrier and coating materials to convert into acceptable flowing and compressible powders. By applying the mathematical models the carrier and coating materials optimized. In this case the drug is almost solubilised in the solvent or molecularly dispersed state which contributes the enhanced drug dissolution...|$|R
