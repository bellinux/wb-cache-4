Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> her as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants to keep them.|$|E
5|$|Lois {{hears about}} Brian on TV, and then discovers {{that her parents}} do not love each other, and even raised her {{to believe that a}} {{heterosexual}} couple <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> each other have every right to marry while a homosexual couple who love each other don't. Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation.

Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E
5|$|In the story, Tyrion {{uses his}} status as a Lannister to {{mitigate}} the prejudice he has received all of his life, even from his family. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence. As the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, then is sent by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King's Landing, as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king, as civil war begins. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey, including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger and without the Lannister resources.|$|E

25|$|Twelve {{years have}} passed since Paul Atreides had become Emperor at the end of Frank Herbert's Dune by seizing control of the planet Arrakis and forcing a union with the former Emperor's daughter, the Princess Irulan. Paul's Fremen armies have since {{launched}} several bloody jihads to solidify his position. Deposed Emperor Shaddam IV {{and the rest of his}} family are exiled to Salusa Secundus, where his other daughter Princess Wensicia plots to restore House Corrino to power. The Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild, and the Tleilaxu also plot to overthrow Paul's reign, aided even by rebel Fremen, <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> how Paul's terraforming project is changing Arrakis and the traditional Fremen way of life. The Tleilaxu present Paul with a ghola in the likeness of his friend Duncan Idaho, killed during the events of Dune, but secretly conditioned to assassinate Paul when triggered by certain words.|$|E
25|$|The obituaries {{shortly after}} Lawrence's death were, with the {{exception}} of the one by E. M. Forster, unsympathetic or hostile. However, there were those who articulated a more favourable recognition of the significance of this author's life and works. For example, his long-time friend Catherine Carswell summed up his life in a letter to the periodical Time and Tide published on 16 March 1930. In response to his critics, she claimed:"In the face of formidable initial disadvantages and lifelong delicacy, poverty that lasted for three quarters of his life and hostility that survives his death, he did nothing that he did not really want to do, and all that he most wanted to do he did. He went all over the world, he owned a ranch, he lived in the most beautiful corners of Europe, and met whom he wanted to meet and told them that they were wrong and he was right. He painted and made things, and sang, and rode. He wrote something like three dozen books, of which even the worst page dances with life that could be mistaken for no other man's, while the best are admitted, even by those <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> him, to be unsurpassed. Without vices, with most human virtues, the husband of one wife, scrupulously honest, this estimable citizen yet managed to keep free from the shackles of civilization and the cant of literary cliques. He would have laughed lightly and cursed venomously in passing at the solemn owls—each one secretly chained by the leg—who now conduct his inquest. To do his work and lead his life in spite of them took some doing, but he did it, and long after they are forgotten, sensitive and innocent people—if any are left—will turn Lawrence's pages and will know from them what sort of a rare man Lawrence was."Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However, the most influential advocate of Lawrence's literary reputation was Cambridge literary critic F. R. Leavis, who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that The Rainbow, Women in Love, and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later, the obscenity trials over the unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover in America in 1959, and in Britain in 1960, and subsequent publication of the full text, ensured Lawrence's popularity (and notoriety) with a wider public.|$|E

500|$|While {{the riots}} were not {{initiated}} by Prime Minister William Pitt's administration, {{the national government}} was slow {{to respond to the}} Dissenters' pleas for help. Local Birmingham officials seem to {{have been involved in the}} planning of the riots, and they were later reluctant to prosecute any ringleaders. Industrialist James Watt wrote that the riots [...] "divided [...] into two parties <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> one another mortally". Those who had been attacked gradually left, leaving Birmingham a more conservative city than it had been throughout the eighteenth century.|$|E
500|$|However, {{while women}} and {{minorities}} are both viewed as [...] "subversive" [...] and are restricted by the patriarchal society depicted in the novel, Lena Grove is able to travel safely and be cared for by people <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> and mistrust her, because she plays on the conventional rule that men are responsible for a woman's wellbeing. Thus, {{she is the only}} stranger who is not alienated and destroyed by the people of Jefferson, because the community recognizes her as the embodiment of nature and life. This romantic view of women in the novel posits that men have lost their innocent connection to the natural world, while women instinctively possess it.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2007, Beckinsale {{appeared}} alongside Luke Wilson in Vacancy, {{a thriller}} set {{in an isolated}} motel. Sarah Jessica Parker was originally cast in the part, but dropped out before filming began. Bradshaw felt [...] "Wilson and Beckinsale have the chops for scary movies" [...] while Gleiberman noted [...] "Luke Wilson, with his hangdog defensive mopiness, and Kate Beckinsale, all sexy severity, are ideally matched as a couple <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> each other." [...] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was unimpressed, referring to Beckinsale as [...] "the reigning queen of the bland B's." [...] The film was profitable, grossing $35million worldwide from a production budget of $19 million.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick's {{rationale}} for editing {{the film was}} to tighten the narrative. Reviews suggested the film suffered from its departure from traditional cinematic storytelling. Regarding the cuts, Kubrick stated, [...] "I didn't believe that the trims made a critical difference.... The people who like it, like it no matter what its length, and {{the same holds true}} for the people <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> it." [...] As was typical of most films of the era released both as a [...] "roadshow" [...] (in Cinerama format in the case of 2001) and general release (in 70-millimetre in the case of 2001), the entrance music, intermission music (and intermission altogether), and postcredit exit music were cut from most prints of the latter version, although these have been restored to most DVD releases.|$|E
500|$|In response, Yeats {{delivered}} {{a series of}} speeches that attacked the [...] "quixotically impressive" [...] ambitions {{of the government and}} clergy, likening their campaign tactics to those of [...] "medieval Spain." [...] "Marriage is not to us a Sacrament, but, upon the other hand, the love of a man and woman, and the inseparable physical desire, are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature, and it seems to us a most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> each other... to live together, and it is to us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry." [...] The resulting debate has been described as one of Yeats's [...] "supreme public moments", and began his ideological move away from pluralism towards religious confrontation.|$|E
500|$|... "Days Gone Bye" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed. Sebastian Liver of Der Tagesspiegel {{insisted that}} the episode was setting new standards, and elaborated that it illuminates even during its timid moments. Mike Ryan of Vanity Fair reflected parallel sentiments, calling it the [...] "best new television show of the year." [...] Ryan felt that the series would broaden the audience of the horror genre, as well as attract new fans. [...] "Finally, a horror show on television for people <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> horror. It's not that The Walking Dead isn't scary or doesn't contain gratuitous amounts of gore [...] but, where other horror projects opt for camp, The Walking Dead grounds itself in reality." [...] Writing for The Atlantic, Scott Meslow affirmed that The Walking Dead was [...] "as dark, intelligent, and uncompromising as any of AMC's other dramas." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Stylus Magazine {{dismissed}} the album as [...] "nothing more than pop for people <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> pop music" [...] and [...] "phony music {{for people who}} can't let go of their inhibitions", while Slant Magazine deemed it [...] "rubbish" [...] and called Allen [...] "sickeningly contemptuous". The mastering of Alright, Still, done by Tim Burrell and Tim Debney, has been criticised. In January 2007, The Guardian ran a piece about loudness wars, the practice of increasing the loudness of tracks which often results in distortion {{and the loss of}} dynamic range. It included Alright, Still in a list of CDs in which sound quality was compromised for loudness. Rolling Stone published a similar story in December 2007, and it also identified Alright, Still as an album [...] "so unrelentingly loud that the sound is actually distorted".|$|E
500|$|Eliminators and The Darkness invade Yugopotamia—a {{planet that}} {{is home to}} squid-like aliens called Yugopotamians—and steal [...] "fake-i-fiers", belts that allow users to {{transform}} into anyone else. Yugopotamian prince Mark Chang goes to Earth. Meanwhile, in Fairyworld, Timmy and Cosmo are watching Timmy Turner's Chosen One movie. Mark arrives and notifies Timmy that The Darkness is back, and the group discovers that there is a second part to the cave prophecy: Timmy must find the second wand, located at the Blue Moon. Timmy and Mark teleport back to Dimmsdale, only to discover Timmy's parents and friends are now Eliminators in disguise. Because his real parents and friends have been kidnapped by Eliminators, Timmy seeks help from people <b>who</b> <b>hate</b> him: Mr. Crocker, Dark Laser, and Vicky. Setting their differences aside, everyone cooperates and boards Dark Laser's death pod and depart into space. During their rest stop at planet Frigidarium, the aliens inside the cantina are Eliminators who send Timmy's enemies to the Abracatraz Prison in Fairy World. Turbo Thunder saves Timmy and Mark from the corrupting planet, and the three eventually arrive at the Blue Moon, where the rock guardian grants Timmy the second wand.|$|E
500|$|Ken Keeler, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein all {{defend the}} episode in its DVD commentary. Keeler asserts, [...] "I am very, {{very proud of}} the job I did on this episode.

[...] However, Keeler says that some of the dialogue was changed from his original draft, making this point less obvious. Oakley and Weinstein explain that they wanted to push the boundaries of the series while working as show-runners, and advise viewers to treat [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] as an [...] "experiment". They surmise that the negative reception was partly {{due to the fact that}} it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, [...] "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"). They also describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode as non-canonical, divorced from the larger series.|$|E
