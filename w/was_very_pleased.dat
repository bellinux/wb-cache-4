5|$|While head of {{production}} at Warner, Hal Wallis considered {{that some of}} his best films – including The Roaring Twenties, Marked Woman and The Sea Wolf – were written by Rossen. Wallis <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> with Rossen's script in 1946 for The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, which was produced by Wallis own company. However, Rossen turned down Wallis's next two films. Both Wallis as producer and Rossen as writer-director wanted to operate as independents, rather than under the control of a studio.|$|E

The Southampton Cenotaph was influential in later designs for war memorials both in England and abroad; {{it was the first}} such cenotaph to be built and simpler versions of the same design were widely used to commemorate the First World War, including famously at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September, Carrick scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} 2009–10 season with the decisive goal against German champions Wolfsburg in a 2–1 Champions League win at home. Two months later, he scored his first league goal of the season, scoring the second of a 3–0 home win over Everton. Due to a {{defensive}} crisis during December, Carrick had to fill in at centre-back since Gary Neville, himself being played out of position, picked up an injury against West Ham United in a 4–0 away win. Carrick had never previously played in defence during his career but manager Sir Alex Ferguson <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> with his contribution. On 8 December, he played in defence again by playing in a three-man defence alongside central-midfielder Darren Fletcher and regular left-back Patrice Evra in a 3–1 away win against Wolfsburg in the Champions League. His third goal of the season came on 30 December in a 5–0 home league win over Wigan Athletic in what was United's last game of the decade.|$|E

25|$|Until the {{delivery}} of the M.F.1s the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service had operated a Farman given to the Norwegian Army by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen on 3 August 1914. Amundsen had intended to use the aircraft for an expedition through the North-East Passage and the Arctic Ocean. The Norwegian Army had lent Amundsen's Farman to the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service to enable it to carry out neutrality protection duties during the First World War. The Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> {{with the performance of}} Amundsen's Farman and wanted to produce aircraft of the same model. The delivery of M.F.1s allowed the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service to hand Amundsen's Farman back to the Norwegian Army Air Service.|$|E
25|$|The best-known mole {{is named}} after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed {{and there are two}} {{versions}} of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.|$|E

25|$|To Mahayana Buddhists of Sri Lanka and Thailand, {{the seventh}} lunar month is {{a month of}} joy. This is because the fifteenth day of the seventh month is often known as the Buddha's joyful day and the day of rejoicing for monks. The origins of the Buddha's joyful day {{can be found in}} various scriptures. When the Buddha was alive, his disciples meditated in the forests of India during the rainy season of summer. Three months later, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, they would emerge from the forests to {{celebrate}} the completion of their meditation and report their progress to the Buddha. In the Ullambana Sutra, the Buddha instructs his disciple Maudgalyāyana on how to obtain liberation for his mother, who had been reborn into a lower realm, by making food offerings to the sangha on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. Because the number of monks who attained enlightenment during that period was high, the Buddha <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleased.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 221, Liu Bei {{declared}} himself emperor and established {{the state of}} Shu Han. Later that year, he launched a military campaign against Sun Quan to retake his lands in Jing Province and avenge Guan Yu. Liao Hua and his mother encountered the Shu armies at Zigui County. Liu Bei <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> to see Liao Hua and he appointed the latter as the Administrator (太守) of Yidu Commandery (宜都郡; around present-day Yidu, Hubei). After Liu Bei died in 223, Liao Hua became an Army Advisor (參軍) under Zhuge Liang, the chancellor-regent of Shu. He was later assigned {{to be in charge}} of Guangwu Commandery (廣武郡; around present-day Yongdeng County, Gansu) and was subsequently promoted to Right General of Chariots and Cavalry (右車騎將軍). He was also appointed as the Inspector (刺史) of Bing Province – even though Bing Province was not under Shu's jurisdiction – and enfeoffed as a Marquis of a Central District (中鄉侯). He was known for his fiery personality and determination. His position in the Shu military was equivalent to those of Zhang Yi and Zong Yu.|$|E

Later that year, the state of Cao Wei launched a campaign against Shu with the aim of vanquishing its rival state. When Huo Yi received news of the invasion, he wanted to lead troops from Nanzhong to assist in the defence of the Shu capital Chengdu, but Liu Shan rejected Huo Yi's suggestion and surrendered to the Wei general Deng Ai, bringing an end to the Shu regime. Huo Yi donned mourning garments and lamented the fall of Shu for three days, after which his subordinates urged him to follow in his lord's footsteps by surrendering to Wei as well. Huo Yi refused to surrender and stated that he would fight to the death unless he was assured that Liu Shan was safe and was treated well after submitting to Wei. Upon receiving news that Liu Shan was not harmed and had moved from Chengdu to the Wei capital Luoyang, he officially surrendered to Wei. The Wei regent Sima Zhao <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> so he appointed Huo Yi as the Area Commander (都督) of Nanzhong and allowed the latter to remain in charge of Nanzhong.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} other recent {{narratives}} extolling the divinity of the goddess, which are also linked to Shirdi Sai Baba and his devotees. In one such narration, a priest of Vani village known as Kakaji Vaidya who {{was working in the}} Saptashrungi Temple was quite disturbed by the miseries of life around him and he, therefore, appealed to the goddess to give him peace of mind and relieve him from all worries. Pleased with the priest's devotion to her, the goddess appeared to him in a dream and told him to go to the Baba to set his mind at rest and in peace. As the priest was then not aware of which Baba she meant, he thought it was the Shiva at Trimabakeshwar temple and so he went there and offered worship to Shiva and stayed there for a few days. In the process, he still did not get the feeling of peace and his restless mood continued. He came back to Vani village disheartened. Then, every day after taking bath in the morning he offered prayers to Shiva Linga by reciting Rudra mantra from the Yajurveda, for many days. He still did not get peace of mind. He then went back to the Mata temple and appealed to her to give relief to his restless mind. That night she appeared in his dream and told that the Baba she meant was Sai Samarth of Shirdi and that he should go there. The priest did not know the whereabouts of Sai Baba. Sai Baba through his divine psychic perception realised the need of the priest and so he sent his most loving devotee Madhavarao to meet the priest and bring him to his presence. Coincidentally, Madhavrao had also gone there at the advice of Baba to also offer two silver breasts to the goddess as his mother had forgotten to fulfill her vow of gifting the silver breasts to the goddess. When Madhavarao went to Vani village the priest met him and came to know that he had come from Shirdi to offer silver breast to the goddess. The priest <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>pleased,</b> and also for the first time felt peace of mind. He then took Madhavarao to the temple where the silver breasts were placed {{at the feet of the}} goddess in the sanctum as a fulfilment of his mother's vow. The priest then came to Shirdi with Madhavarao and had darshan of the Sai Baba and stayed there for 12 days and felt very peaceful. He then returned to Vani.|$|E
