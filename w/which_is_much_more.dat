It is currently housed at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The telescope recently had its optics upgraded {{with a very}} wide field of view CCD array, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> sensitive than the photographic plates. It is the instrument used today by the Case astronomers.|$|E
5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted at this point to make a comeback in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had been up for grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very high. In a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E

5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{differs from}} species of Fomitiporia in two key respects. Its spores are less dextrinoid {{than those of}} the genus and their shape is atypical. Other than this, it is typical of the genus, {{according}} to the original description. Five species of Fomitiporia, F.bannaensis, F.pseudopunctata, F.sonorae, F.sublaevigata and F.tenuis, share with P.ellipsoideus the resupinate fruit bodies and the setae in the hymenium. Despite this, all of them but P.ellipsoideus have straight hymenial setae, and all of them have spores that are spherical or almost spherical, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> typical of the genus. F.uncinata (formerly Phellinus uncinatus) has hooked hymenial setae, and the spores are, as with P.ellipsoideus, thick-walled and dextrinoid. The species can be differentiated by the fact the spores are spherical or nearly so, and somewhat larger than those of P.ellipsoideus, measuring 5.5 to 7 by 5 to 6.5μm. The species is also known only from tropical America, where it grows on bamboo.|$|E

Several place names in Jämtland still display the significance these pits had to the tribes.|$|E

25|$|As {{this route}} is {{contracted}} {{with a private}} company, fares are high. A monthly pass costs $232, while one-way cash fare is $12. Because of this, some Embrun residents instead take OC Transpo route #232, which has a stop at a park and ride lot 8km north of Embrun. This is considerably cheaper (Route #232 costs $119 for a monthly pass and $4.65 for one-way), but less convenient, as OC Transpo does not service the community itself, meaning Embrun residents have to drive 8km {{to the park and}} ride lot to ride OC Transpo. Route 232 also has later scheduled times—the latest trip on the 232 arrives in Ottawa for 8:20am, and leaves Ottawa at 5:15pm, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> convenient for Embrun residents who work 9-5 workweeks.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen diffuses through {{membranes}} {{and into}} {{red blood cells}} after inhalation into the lungs. They are bound to dioxygen complexes, which are coordination compounds that contain O2 as a ligand, providing a more efficient oxygen-loading capacity. In blood, the heme group of hemoglobin binds oxygen when it is present, changing hemoglobin's color from bluish red to bright red. is released from {{another part of the}} hemoglobin molecule, as its acid, which causes CO2 to be released from bicarbonate, its major reservoir in blood plasma (see Bohr effect) Vertebrate animals use hemoglobin in their blood to transport oxygen from their lungs to their tissues, but other animals use hemocyanin (molluscs and some arthropods) or hemerythrin (spiders and lobsters). A liter of blood can dissolve 200cc of oxygen gas, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than water can dissolve.|$|E

[...] After a year out on strike, in March 1985 the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The cost to the economy was estimated to be at least £1.5billion, and the strike was blamed for much of the pound's fall against the US dollar. The government closed 25unprofitable coal mines in 1985, and by 1992 a total of 97 mines had been closed; those that remained were privatised in 1994.|$|E

[...] She later would recall how she felt [...] "a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible." [...] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tons of the ore.|$|E
