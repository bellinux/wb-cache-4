50|$|The {{prediction}} of tides is very challenging as {{it depends on}} multiple factors-including the alignment of the Sun and Moon, {{the shape of the}} coastline, and near-shore bathymetry. Tide theories attempt to account for these factors but lead to complex calculations. Originally, calculations were performed by hand, which was very labor-intensive and error-prone. The burden became even larger <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>State</b> Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS, the successor to the Coast Survey) started using the more accurate harmonic method for predictions of tides in 1884.|$|R

A 1940 Army intelligence report on Fermi and Szilard, prepared <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> had not yet entered World War II, expressed reservations about both. While it contained some errors of fact about Szilard, it correctly noted his dire prediction that Germany would win the war.|$|E

Testing revealed that at high altitude, even 2 g could cause death in an unpressurised cabin and without appropriate clothing. This new technology, along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Army occupied the Junkers factory at Dessau on 21 April 1945, they were both impressed at and interested in the medical flight tests with the Ju 87.|$|E

5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway system was first {{numbered}}, the east–west highway running through Reed City was numbered M-20, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Numbered Highway System was created. The business loop was created after US10 was moved to bypass downtown Reed City in the late 1950s. This realignment was completed, and the business loop commissioned, by 1960.
