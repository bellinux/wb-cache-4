5|$|A central Food Production Committee, set up {{in early}} 1942, {{organised}} the conscripted labourers and attempted to help the white farmers to grow all the crops they could. Maize production grew by 40% between 1942 and 1944, the potato harvest doubled and the onion crop grew sixfold {{by the end of}} the war. Production of the colony's most important cash crop, tobacco, <b>was</b> <b>high</b> throughout the war, averaging about 40million pounds (18million kg) annually.|$|E
5|$|A {{teaser trailer}} was {{released}} online in September 2000. Universal avoided excessive early marketing to prevent possible backlash, as it believed that {{awareness of the}} film <b>was</b> <b>high</b> enough.

Promotional partners included Kodak and The Coca-Cola Company. No fast-food promotions took place in the United States, although kids' meal toys based on the film were offered in Canadian Burger Kings.|$|E

5|$|After the Netherlands {{qualified}} for the final {{for the first time}} in nine years at the , media interest <b>was</b> <b>high</b> over who would succeed Anouk as the Dutch representative at Eurovision in 2014. One of the artists tipped early on as a possible candidate was DJ Armin van Buuren, who announced in June 2013 that he was open to participating at the contest as long as AVROTROS gave him full artistic freedom and abandoned plans for a national final to select the entry. Shirma Rouse, one of the backing singers for Anouk at the 2013 contest, was another candidate mentioned after being promoted by Anouk at several events in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Against {{the advice}} of Captain Dove, Paxton {{continued}} to advance the regiment. The element of surprise was gone, and it was dark. Dove knew the probability of being attacked <b>was</b> <b>high,</b> and he took steps to minimize the danger to the main column. The advance guard was ambushed around 1:00 am on May 2. Dove received a severe wound on his foot, {{and two of his}} men were killed. The regiment's total losses were four killed, eight wounded, and four missing—plus 28 horses killed. Paxton, who was popular with the regiment, was dismissed by General Eliakim P. Scammon after the regiment returned to camp.|$|E

5|$|Allen reopened {{the company}} in 1859, having added {{machinery}} for the manufacture of hoes, and opened a retail store on site. He found a successful market in the South, where demand <b>was</b> <b>high.</b> His company, newly named the Planters' Hoe Company, was a considerable success. However, as the nation came closer to civil war, demand dropped and sales in the South became impossible. The factory was closed in 1861, not only due to poor sales, but because Allen enlisted in the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile <b>was</b> <b>high</b> speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|Although the Croatian {{government}} sponsored reconstruction {{efforts in}} and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003. Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately, in order to punish the Serb community. Human Rights Watch noted that, of 4,000 homes that had been rebuilt, {{none of them were}} inhabited by Serbs. Unemployment <b>was</b> <b>high</b> because of the destruction of the town's major industries, and many of the inhabitants could not sell their houses. Most houses and many of Vukovar's historic buildings had been restored by 2011.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Napoleonic {{sentiment}} <b>was</b> <b>high</b> in Southern France, {{and this}} was prominently displayed in the White Terror, which saw the purge of all important Napoleonic officials from government and the execution of others. The people of France committed barbarous acts against some of these officials. Guillaume Marie Anne Brune (a Napoleonic marshal) was savagely assassinated, and his remains thrown into the Rhône River. Louis XVIII deplored such illegal acts, but vehemently supported the prosecution of those marshals that helped Napoleon in the Hundred Days. Louis XVIII's government executed Napoleon's Marshal Ney in December 1815 for treason. His confidants Charles François, Marquis de Bonnay, and the Duke de La Chatre advised him to inflict firm punishments on the “traitors”.|$|E
5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit.

However, Newton proved equal to the task.|$|E

The unemployment rate of 6.2% <b>was</b> <b>high</b> {{compared to the}} national rate of 3.4% and was the highest rate throughout the Swale district.

5|$|Auchinleck, now Commander-in-Chief, India, {{strongly}} opposed {{such a move}} preferring to retain the division as an entity. Instead, he proposed that the newly arrived 81st (West Africa) Division {{could be used in}} its place. Despite his arguments {{and the end of the}} division's availability for operations against the Japanese-occupied Ramree Island, he was over-ruled by Churchill's backing of Wingate. On 6September, the division began reorganising for long-range penetration. It had been estimated that 10 percent of the men would be unsuitable but this had been based on an erroneous report given in London (believed to be from Wingate) that the division was not first class, even though the standard of its infantry <b>was</b> <b>high.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between {{the spring}} and early summer of 1921, the rebels {{experienced}} a series of defeats. In July 1921, Hananu's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces. By this time, French forces proceeded to burn down villages where support for the rebels <b>was</b> <b>high.</b> A number of these villages' inhabitants were arrested or executed, prompting some rebels to ultimately surrender. On 11 or 12 July, Hananu fled to British-held Transjordan, seeking refuge with nationalists from Syria, to avoid arrest by the French authorities. British intelligence officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting Jerusalem and extradited him to Syria in August.|$|E
