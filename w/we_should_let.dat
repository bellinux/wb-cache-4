500|$|Conference {{notes and}} draft {{decisions}} illustrate {{the division of}} opinions before the decision was issued. Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined {{to the view that}} segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that [...] "we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>let</b> them work it out." [...] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability. Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: [...] "These [...] are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes." [...] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.|$|E

We should not keep so many people in prison. We should free them {{to take care of their}} families. ... It is impossible to restore public confidence overnight, but we have to let everyone speak out. ... We should have logical and brotherly discussions and our people will make their judgments. ... <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>let</b> our media write within the framework of the law and we should not impose restrictions on them. ... <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>let</b> our media even criticize us. Our security forces, our police and other organs have to guarantee such a climate for criticism.|$|E

You are defending kikes! Go over their [...] and find out who is behind this company and if <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>let</b> them come here!" [...] After Rimma Varzhapetian's protests, Aivazian claimed he didn't mean to offend Jews, and that such criticism was intended strictly for the Global Gold company.|$|E

2500|$|On February 20, 2006, Ishihara also said: [...] "Roppongi is now {{virtually}} a foreign neighborhood. Africans—I don't mean African-Americans—who don't speak English are there doing who knows what.

2500|$|After {{considering}} his situation, believing {{that not only}} would he never walk again, but that he might never move a body part again, Reeve considered suicide. He mouthed to Dana, [...] "Maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>let</b> me go." [...] She tearfully replied, [...] "I am only {{going to say this}} once: I will support whatever you want to do because this is your life, and your decision. But I {{want you to know that}} I'll be with you for the long haul, no matter what. You're still you. And I love you." [...] Reeve never considered euthanasia as an option again.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Destour {{executive}} committee pursued its campaign {{to discredit the}} new generation of nationalists. In response, Bourguiba replied with more violence, aggression and contempt in his speeches. As for El Materi, they should not stoop to the elders' level; He advocated for reforming the party's methods in peace and understanding or split up from the movement and found their own one. He stated: [...] "My opinion is that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>let</b> them cry in the wilderness, only a few people took them seriously". Sfar also criticized the Destour leadership writing: [...] "Too much conservatism harms society because it is a factor of immobility and death; it solidifies everything, destroyes all initiative spirit, opposes any vivifying and creating force and therefore stops any progress, breaks the momentum and growth of individuals and groups".|$|E
2500|$|At the 2011 CPAC, {{during her}} question-and-answer segment, Coulter {{was asked about}} GOProud and the {{controversy}} over their exclusion from the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party's platform, saying, [...] "The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don't think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>let</b> them. I {{think they should be}} on our side," [...] and [...] "Gays are natural conservatives." [...] Later that year, Coulter joined advisory board for GOProud. On Logos [...] she told gay Republican Taylor Garrett that [...] "The gays have got to be pro-life," [...] and [...] "As soon as they find the gay gene, guess who the liberal yuppies are gonna start aborting?" [...] Coulter has referred to Democratic politicians Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and John Edwards as [...] "fag(got)." ...|$|E

We also better look at the needs of our people and we better look at the needs of the people in our community to provide opportunities for blind people to work, to have dignity, to have pride, {{to have a sense of}} self-worth. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> not <b>let</b> anything erode that, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>let</b> anything take that away and so I would urge us, as we purchase, as we continue to purchase clocks, that we remember something the bible says: 'Where there is no vision, the people perish.' Some people can see but have no vision; sometimes our policies reflect the ability to see, but not in a visionary way. Please, America, let’s not put the people at The Chicago Lighthouse for the Blind out of work. Let’s keep them working and hopefully all the rest of us will be able to see.” ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{criminal}} cases, Carley often {{sides with}} the state over the defendant. But Carley also emphasizes legal procedure, and dissented in a decision in which the court allowed evidence from a warrantless search to be used against a woman charged in a child abuse death, writing that the Fourth Amendment [...] "has no exception for troubling cases and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>let</b> hard cases make bad law." ...|$|R
