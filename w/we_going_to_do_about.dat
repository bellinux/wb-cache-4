The dubious honor was bestowed by votes of both magazine readership and city residents. In dealing with global warming and New York's role in it, Bloomberg has enacted a plan called PlaNYC: A Greener, Greater New York to fight global warming, protect the environment and prepare New York for the projected 1 million more people expected {{to be living in}} the city by the year 2030. Bloomberg has been involved in motivating other cities to make changes, delivering the keynote address at the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit and stating, [...] "e now know beyond a doubt that global warming is a reality. And the question we must all answer is, what are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it?" [...] Bloomberg also talked about how he would go about fighting climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions, using cleaner and more efficient fuels, and encouraging public transportation. His ideas have occasionally been rejected, such as the New York State Assembly's rejection of his idea for applying congestion pricing below 60th Street in Manhattan.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Muskrat {{glared at}} him, {{for she had}} overheard the remark. Then she held up one hand to command silence.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I suppose {{whatever}} we may think it wise to say, {{we have all}} begun {{to think of a}} possible conclusion. It can't be put very delicately anyhow; but, after all, there's a very necessary business side to it. What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> poor Vane's affairs, apart from himself? I suppose you know," [...] he added, in a low voice to the lawyer, [...] "whether he made a will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Festing, smiling. [...] "I don't often {{let myself}} {{go and look}} far ahead. It's my share to tackle the job before my eyes; to drive the tractor plow, and the grading scoop along the road reserve.

6000|$|... "He's {{been coming}} to see Pen!" [...] cried the wife. [...] "NOW are you satisfied?" [...] Her tone implied that he had brought it all upon them; but {{at the sight of}} the swift passions working in his face to a perfect {{comprehension}} of the whole trouble, she fell to trembling, and her broken voice lost all the spurious indignation she had put into it. [...] "O Silas! what are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it? I'm afraid it'll kill Irene." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what are}} <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now?" [...] Roger asked, {{when she had}} {{finished}} her narration. [...] "Think you that we shall proceed to the coast, and take ship for Europe?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Puts me {{in mind of}} {{our trip}} out West," [...] said Tom. [...] "What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when night comes on? Go to some ranch, or make our own camp?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Margaret," [...] he cried, [...] "what are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it? It is wonderful; I cannot {{appreciate}} it. I {{have had}} all the men up in the office this morning and pledged them to secrecy. Of course they won't keep their promises, {{but it was all}} that I could do. I can think of no particular damage which would come to me if this thing were known, but I cannot bear that the public should get hold of it until I know something myself. Margaret, I don't know anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I suppose not," [...] he said. [...] "But, Jack, what {{on earth}} are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> clothes? These uniforms are getting seedy, though it is lucky that we had on our best when we were caught, owing to our having had the others torn to pieces {{the night of the}} wreck. But as for other things, we have got nothing but what we have on. We washed our flannel shirts and {{stockings}} as well as we could whenever we halted, but we can't well do that here; and as for money, we haven't a ha'penny between us. It's awful, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{not until}} my last year at Trinity that I really broke down the {{barriers}} of this unwholesome silence and brought my secret broodings to the light of day. Then a little set of us plunged suddenly into what we called at first sociological discussion. I can still recall even the physical feeling of those first tentative talks. I remember them mostly as occurring in the rooms of Ted Hatherleigh, who kept at the corner by the Trinity great gate, but we also used to talk a good deal at a man's in King's, a man named, if I remember rightly, Redmayne. The atmosphere of Hatherleigh's rooms was a haze of tobacco smoke against a background brown and deep. He professed himself a socialist with anarchistic leanings--he had suffered the martyrdom of ducking for it--and a huge French May-day poster displaying a splendid proletarian in red and black on a barricade against a flaring orange sky, dominated his decorations. Hatherleigh affected a fine untidiness, and all the place, even the floor, was littered with books, {{for the most part}} open and face downward; deeper darknesses were supplied by a discarded gown and our caps, all conscientiously battered, Hatherleigh's flopped like an elephant's ear and inserted quill pens supported the corners of mine; the highlights of the picture came chiefly as reflections from his chequered blue mugs full of audit ale. We sat on oak chairs, except the four or five who crowded on a capacious settle, we drank a lot of beer and were often fuddled, and occasionally quite drunk, and we all smoked reckless-looking pipes,--there was a transient fashion among us for corn cobs for which Mark Twain, I think, was responsible. Our little excesses with liquor were due far more to conscience than appetite, indicated chiefly a resolve to break away from restraints that we suspected were keeping us off the instructive knife-edges of life. Hatherleigh was a good Englishman of the premature type with a red face, a lot of hair, a deep voice and an explosive plunging manner, and it was he who said one evening--Heaven knows how we got to it--"Look here, you know, it's all Rot, this Shutting Up about Women. We OUGHT to talk about them. What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> them? It's got to come. We're all festering inside about it. Let's out with it. There's too much Decency altogether about this Infernal University!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, great God in Heaven! What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> I mean!" [...] cried Rupert. [...] "What {{about the}} poor woman locked up in that house? Shall I go for the police?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm 'most as dry as this bag. It will blaze next time," [...] {{said another}} man. [...] "My jacket's singed to tinder, too. How're <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when our clothes start burning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{clothes are}} right, there's no getting around it. What are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>We</b> can't collect, as I see. The reward {{is for a}} {{one-armed}} American. This is a two-armed Englishman." ...|$|R
