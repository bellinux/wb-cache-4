25|$|I {{knew the}} Englishmen would test me {{out as soon}} as I walked out. Ian Botham. Bob Willis. I {{remember}} facing Ian Botham when I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and he did test me out. Fortunately enough I did hook him for a six, but I must admit {{it was more of a}} top edge. Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few more times.|$|E
500|$|Following the match, referee Nicolae Rainea {{explained}} {{his decision to}} play the match despite heavy fog: [...] "When I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> before kick-off I decided I could see well enough and so I decided to play. I am afraid many spectators would not get a very clear view {{but there was no}} time I had any thoughts of abandoning the game." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was critical of the decision to play the match: [...] "You can't play football in conditions like that, it's ridiculous." [...] Paisley suggested the competition should be played in April when the weather was better: [...] "I think a match like this, between two leading team should be played in better weather, say in April. I know it's difficult, but it's farcical when good players like these have to slither about in fog and can't see each other." ...|$|E

The opening night and all the artists, mainly artists, <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and those few people that were into socialites or {{whatever}} they were, they went out. And then after that, you could go out there during a weekday {{and there would be}} nobody in the gallery. Nobody gave a damn." [...] -- John Saccaro ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Boldness often pays, and I {{imagine that}} our mysterious enemies won’t think {{of looking for}} us at the Clanch mill. We’ll <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to-morrow.” ...|$|R

60|$|MRS. ROBERTS. I'm sure I can't tell. It's a {{great many}} years since he <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and I've never seen him in all that time. I thought if you did happen to know him--He's a lawyer.|$|E

5000|$|... "He's small," [...] said Tagg. [...] "He's {{not that}} good-looking; he's not a robust horse by any means. He just <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and gets it done." ...|$|R
6000|$|Leland laughed. [...] "Madam," [...] he said, [...] "would you <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to {{the prairie}} and trust {{yourself}} alone {{to such a}} man as I am?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, aunt, {{it is an}} American plant, I believe. We had one in the green-house at home; it {{was sent}} poor papa by some friend who <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> I don't see {{anything}} else Rhoda could come from." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In uniform. And if he fell, {{she would}} see his ghost, in cocky, {{crossing}} her room, he said. In fact {{he knew how to}} get round the foolish girl. I believe he <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> just to make himself interesting.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Peter, [...] "it isn't {{much of a}} name. The {{first people}} who <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> named it that, and it stuck to it, and it's all it's got. Camps are like horses--we've got to tell them apart, and so we give them names, and that's Camp Rob." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} of the Theses Review Series Dr Helene Connor reviews the work of Laura Ashton: “I don’t {{necessarily}} <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and tell everyone that I’m a feminist, but I won’t <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and tell everyone that I’m a musician either”: Dis/identifications and Dis/articulations: Young Women and Feminism in Aotearoa/New Zealand. In this thoroughly researched and skillfully written thesis, the premise is that whilst many young women value the work of the early feminists in terms of gender equality and individual freedom for themselves, only a small number position themselves as feminist...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hilary's <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> of his head," [...] exclaimed Mr. Flint. [...] "This {{thing has}} unhinged him. Here, take these telegrams. No, wait a minute, I'll <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> Call up Billings, {{and see if}} you can get Senator Whitredge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [80] Mr. Rusden was, at this time, Clerk to the House of Parliament, in Melbourne. He was {{the kindest}} of friends {{to the two}} sons of Charles Dickens, in Australia, {{from the time that}} the elder of the two first <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> And Charles Dickens had the most {{grateful}} regard for him, and maintained a frequent correspondence with him--as a friend--although they never saw each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I kept by {{the gate}} as soon as I came on dooty next evening, just to give 'im a little smile as 'e <b>went</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> is nothing more {{aggravating}} than a smile when it is properly done; {{but there was no}} signs o' my lord, and, arter practising it on a carman by mistake, I 'ad to go inside for a bit and wait till he 'ad gorn.|$|E
60|$|There {{were several}} porters {{standing}} by, and they immediately {{took up the}} passengers' baggage, and carried it away to the hotels, which were all very near the river. Rollo and Mr. George were soon comfortably established {{in a room with}} two beds in it, one in each corner, and a large round table near one of the windows. Outside of the other window was a balcony, and Rollo immediately <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> to look at the view.|$|E

6000|$|... [He bows slightly, rests {{his eyes}} on ANTHONY, who returns his [...] stare unmoved, and, {{followed}} by UNDERWOOD, <b>goes</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> is a [...] moment of uneasy silence. UNDERWOOD reappears in the doorway.] ...|$|R

60|$|It was his mother's voice. He {{threw down}} {{his book and}} <b>went</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> was a long garden that ran to a field. It was a grey, cold day, with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire. Two fields away Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out of which rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel. And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale grey heights of the Pennine Chain.|$|E
6000|$|... "He wouldn't go to bed, the {{old lady}} couldn't make him, and when I got up this morning I didn't think nothin' about it. I s'posed, of course, he'd gone to bed all right, but when I was {{going out to the}} barn I {{stumbled}} across something in the snow, and I felt around, and there he was. He got hold of my revolver someway. It was on the shelf by the washstand, and I s'pose he <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> so't we wouldn't hear him." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Sellers returned, now, {{with her}} {{composure}} restored, {{and began to}} ask after Hawkins's wife, and about his children, {{and the number of}} them, and so on, and her examination of the witness resulted in a circumstantial history of the family's ups and downs and driftings to and fro in the far West during the previous fifteen years. There was a message, now, from out back, and Colonel Sellers <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in answer to it. Hawkins took this opportunity to ask how the world had been using the Colonel during the past half-generation.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{delightful}} country!" [...] Letitia observed. [...] "If I were {{to borrow from}} all my friends and collected a million, do you think I could <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and become a multi-millionaire?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I've {{heard about}} Coniston. It must {{be quite a}} romance in itself to live all the year round in such a {{beautiful}} place and {{to make your own}} clothes. Yours become you very well," [...] said Miss Duncan, [...] "although I don't know why. They're not at all in style, and yet they give you quite an air of distinction. I wish I could live in Coniston for a year, anyway, and write a book about you. My brother and Bob Worthington <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> one night and serenaded you, didn't they?" ...|$|E
60|$|The sky was all pallid again, yellowish. When I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> was no sun; {{the snow}} was blue and cold. I hurried away down the hill, musing on Maggie. The road made a loop down the sharp face of the slope. As I went {{crunching}} over the laborious snow I became aware of a figure striding awkwardly down the steep scarp to intercept me. It {{was a man with}} his hands in front of him, half stuck in his breeches pockets, and his shoulders square--a real knock-about fellow. Alfred, of course. He waited for me by the stone fence.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{sometimes}} you get it. But you'll allow it's difficult. That's all I meant. I've known her--let me see--for twelve years, at least; ever since I first went West. She was about eleven then, and her father was bringing her up on the ranch. Her aunt came along by and by and took her to Europe--mother dead before Hazelwood <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> But the girl was always homesick for the ranch; she pined for it; and after they had kept her in Germany {{three or four years}} they let her come back and run wild again--wild as a flower does, or a vine, not a domesticated animal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you are afraid, just {{as any of}} {{us would}} be, to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> naked, armed only with a knife {{and a piece of}} rope," [...] said the banterer. [...] "Is it not so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whether {{there are}} few or whether {{there are many of}} them, we must wait till morning before we <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> will be no working out that channel in the dark, even if we were unopposed." ...|$|R
