2500|$|The exact {{solution}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> here, {{which we}} interpret as a propagating gravitational plane wave, gives some basic {{insight into the}} propagation of gravitational radiation in Nordström's theory, {{but it does not}} yield any insight into the generation of gravitational radiation in this theory. [...] At this point, it would be natural to discuss the analog for Nordström's theory of gravitation of the standard linearized gravitational wave theory in general relativity, but we shall not pursue this.|$|E
2500|$|The USR's public {{expression}} of regret over having tolerated [...] "a text with antisemitic content" [...] caused Goma to threaten with a lawsuit on libel grounds. In reaction, Gârbea stated: [...] "What {{we are interested}} in is Viaţa Românească, a press organ edited by the USR. Paul Goma may believe whatever he likes. It is not him that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing,</b> but the magazine. I see no reason why he would sue me personally." [...] According to an overview of the episode by journalist Ovidiu Şimonca, Horia Gârbea had unwittingly prompted Goma to state his intention of suing the Jewish-Romanian community league, or Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania (FCER). This was because, during the scandal, Gârbea had explained that the FCER's reaction was an incentive in the USR's internal investigation. Goma's claim for reparations from FCER leaders, Şimonca noted, ignored the fact that Gârbea had not disclosed any names.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire." [...] In response to these criticisms Gore stated that it is “certainly not true” {{that he is a}} “carbon billionaire” and that he is [...] "proud to put my money where my mouth is for the past 30 years. And though that is not the majority of my business activities, I absolutely believe in investing in accordance with my beliefs and my values." [...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> here today, is that something {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think there is something wrong with being active in business in this country [...] I am proud of it. I am proud of it." ...|$|E
60|$|No one can hear. To {{look at us}} {{anyone would}} think <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> the {{political}} situation.|$|R
60|$|While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> matters there <b>was</b> a {{knock on}} the door, and Mr. Mason came in.|$|R

6000|$|CONRAD. Of course if {{you think}} it more {{scientific}} to say that what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> is not Adam and Eve and Eden, but the phylogeny of the blastoderm-- ...|$|E
60|$|TANNER. Never fear: Ann <b>is</b> only--well, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> that {{habit of}} hers just now. She hasn't heard a word.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, that's {{rather the}} point <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing.</b> After all, Marjorie isn't a baby. I {{want to do}} all this--this affair, openly and {{properly}} if I can, but, you know, I mean to marry Marjorie--anyhow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> {{the general}} {{question}} of individual conduct, {{it will be}} convenient to take up again and restate in that relationship, propositions already made very plainly {{in the second and}} third chapters. Here there are several excellent reasons for a certain amount of deliberate repetition. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps you'll {{hear me out}} for a minute." [...] Mr. Crawley again {{bowed his}} head. [...] "Whether <b>we</b> <b>were</b> wise or unwise, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> this affair." ...|$|R

60|$|And now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> the Socialist {{attitude}} towards property, {{it may be}} well to consider a little group of objections that are often made in anti-Socialist tracts. I refer more particularly to a certain hard case, the hard case of the Savings of the Virtuous Small Man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even {{when the}} odds against you are quite steep?" [...] she said. [...] "In the case <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> the result was no doubt that bruise on your face." [...] Then she changed the subject. [...] "If he was a famous mineralogist, why is he cooking in a {{railroad}} camp?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh? You {{call him}} a fool far marrying a young wife? Well, no doubt he is, {{but he would have}} been a bigger fool to marry an old one.

60|$|BERTLEY. [Blandly.] Yes, {{when you}} came in, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> what should <b>be</b> done {{with a man who}} drinks rum--[CALWAY pauses in the act of drinking]--that doesn't belong to him.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have asked}} you to come here, Mr. Paret," [...] said the banker, [...] "not only because I know {{something}} personally of your legal ability, but because I have been told by Mr. Scherer and Mr. Barbour that {{you happen to have}} considerable knowledge of the situation <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing,</b> as well as some experience with cases involving that statute somewhat hazy to lay minds, the Sherman anti-trust law." ...|$|E
60|$|Also we {{have been}} told that, in the case <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing,</b> some Members of the Subject are in Class (1). What else do we need to be told, in order to know that all of them are there? Evidently we need to be told that none of them are in Class (2); i.e. that none of them are Members of the Class whose Differentia is {{contradictory}} to that of the Predicate.|$|E
60|$|While <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> {{the true}} {{attitude}} of modern Socialism to property, {{it will be}} well to explain quite clearly the secular change of opinion {{that is going on}} in the Socialist ranks in regard to the process of expropriation. Even in the case of those sorts of property that Socialism repudiates, property in land, natural productions, inherited business capital and the like, Socialism has become humanized and rational from its first extreme and harsh positions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to lose you, then Mr. Laverick," [...] Streuss remarked with {{a gesture}} of farewell, [...] "let us say good night. The little matter of {{business}} which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> can <b>be</b> concluded with your partner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you say is}} true, Robert," [...] said Bambro', [...] "and {{before you}} came <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> the matter among {{ourselves}} and grieving {{that it should be}} so. When heard you of the truce?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] {{said the}} Black Rat furiously, [...] "I {{may be at}} fault, but I wholly fail to {{perceive}} where these offensive eavesdroppers--er--come in. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> a matter that solely affected our Order." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. In {{answer to}} an inquiry on this subject, Mr. H. C. Watson has been {{kind enough to}} send me a {{detailed}} account of the progress of vegetation on the railway banks and cuttings about Thames Ditton. This account is written from memory, but as Mr. Watson states that he took a great interest in watching the process year by year, there can be no reason to doubt the accuracy of his memory. I give a few extracts which bear especially on the subject <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] he returned; [...] "it is, moreover, a truth which I do not now hear for {{the first}} time; but it has no {{connection}} with the subject <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing.</b> Men pass away, and others take their places. Trees also decay, but the forest does not die, or suffer {{for the loss of}} individual trees; is it not the same with the house and the family inhabiting it, which is one with the house, and endures forever, albeit the members composing it must all in time return to the dust?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Miocene Arctic Flora.--One of {{the most}} startling and {{important}} of the scientific discoveries of {{the last forty years}} has been that of the relics of a luxuriant Miocene flora {{in various parts of the}} Arctic regions. It is a discovery that was totally unexpected, and is even now considered by many men of science to be completely unintelligible; but it is so thoroughly established, and it has such a direct and important bearing on the subjects <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> in the present volume, that it is necessary to lay a tolerably complete outline of the facts before our readers.|$|E
60|$|During breakfast, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> whether <b>we</b> {{could get}} through the snow to Mont St. Bernard. Some thought we could, and some thought not. So it goes here: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> gasping and sweltering one hour, and {{plunging}} through snow banks the next.|$|R
60|$|As {{an example}} of how utterly {{oblivious}} a pair of towers can be to their work, George told us, later on in the evening, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> the subject after supper, of a very curious instance.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Burton," [...] Mr. Waddington exclaimed, {{with an air}} of some relief, [...] "your arrival is most opportune! Your {{wife has}} just paid me a visit. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>discussing</b> your {{probable}} whereabouts only a moment ago." ...|$|R
