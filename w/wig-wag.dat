5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a <b>wig-wag.</b>|$|E
25|$|Red is {{the most}} used color on Japanese {{emergency}} vehicles. The Japanese police uses light bars mounted on a raised (mechanical) platform {{to make them more}} visible over congested streets. Rotating lights are most commonly used. But some newer vehicles have LED light bars installed. Vehicles with any other light color than red are security or engineers. <b>Wig-wag</b> headlights are not used.|$|E
25|$|I {{watched his}} face, {{and it was}} as grave and serene as that of a man writing in his own library. He was the very {{embodiment}} of tranquillity in occupation. He stood there amid the animal-like babble of the Cubans, the crack of rifles, and the whistling snarl of the bullets, and wig-wagged whatever he had to <b>wig-wag</b> without heeding anything but his business. There was not a single trace of nervousness or haste.|$|E

2500|$|The vehicle’s stock {{lighting}} {{may also}} be modified to add flashing and strobe effects. [...] This {{can be done by}} adding electronics to the existing lighting system (for instance, to create a <b>wig-wag),</b> or by drilling holes in the reflectors of stock lighting and inserting flashing lights in those holes.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes, the {{existing}} lighting on a vehicle {{is modified to}} create warning beacons. [...] In the case of <b>wig-wag</b> lighting, this involves adding a device to alternately flash the high-beam headlights, or, in some countries, the rear fog lights. [...] It can also involve drilling out other lights on the vehicle to add ‘hideaway’ or ‘corner strobes’.|$|E
50|$|One of the <b>wig-wag's</b> {{solenoids}} {{is turned}} on to engage agitation during wash mode; the other solenoid {{is turned on}} to engage the spin-dry mode. The motor must be turned on before the solenoids are powered. Only one solenoid may be operated at a time. When neither solenoid is engaged, the transmission is in neutral and only the pump is operating to drain {{water out of the}} tub.|$|R
25|$|As {{men have}} said often, {{it seemed as}} if there was in this war a God of Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans. As I looked at Sergeant Quick <b>wig-wagging</b> there against the sky, I would not have given a tin tobacco-tag for his life. Escape for him seemed impossible. It seemed absurd to hope {{that he would not be}} hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.|$|R
2500|$|US and WRRS wigwags {{were also}} used by the CPR on its Canadian lines. The last ones in use on the CPR are {{believed}} to have been removed in Chatham, Ontario in the mid-1980s. Two <b>wig-wags</b> remain in service in Canada, located on the CN CASO sub near Tilbury, Ontario. Both are WRRS Autoflag #5s with disappearing banners. [...] Disappearing banners were the only style of wigwag approved for use in Canada. They were slated to be removed in early 2009, although they are still in place as of November, 2009. In 2011, the CASO sub was abandoned & the wigwags will be removed. [...] There are several US wigwags employed today in Chile, but little literature about this style has survived. Several movie clips of the wigwags in this area were made in 2009.|$|R
2500|$|All {{that stood}} {{in the path of}} the 20,000 Union {{soldiers}} converging on the Confederate left flank were Col. Nathan [...] "Shanks" [...] Evans and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men. Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge, but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck were merely feints. He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain Edward Porter Alexander, Beauregard's signal officer, observing from [...] southwest on Signal Hill. In the first use of <b>wig-wag</b> semaphore signaling in combat, Alexander sent the message [...] "Look out for your left, your position is turned." [...] Evans hastily led 900 of his men from their position fronting the Stone Bridge to a new location on the slopes of Matthews Hill, a low rise to the northwest of his previous position.|$|E
2500|$|Emergency vehicle {{lighting}} is {{one or more}} visual warning lights fitted to a vehicle for use when the driver wishes to convey to other road users the urgency of their journey, to provide additional warning of a hazard when stationary, {{or in the case}} of law enforcement as a means of signalling another driver to stop for interaction with an officer. [...] These lights may be dedicated emergency lights, such as a beacon or a light bar, or may be modified stock lighting, such as a <b>wig-wag</b> or hide-away light, and are additional to any standard lighting on the car such as hazard lights. [...] Often, they are used along with a siren (or occasionally sirens) in order to increase their effectiveness. [...] In many jurisdictions, the use of these lights may afford the user specific legal powers, and may place requirements on other road users to behave differently, such as compelling them to pull to the side of the road and yield right of way so the emergency vehicle may proceed through unimpeded.|$|E

2500|$|The wigwags at the {{crossing}} {{that mark the}} location of the western terminus of the BNSF in Richmond, California became pawns in a fight over local control in 2003. The two upper-quadrant wigwags are the last of their kind paired together in active use, and are on land that the BNSF plans to develop. The BNSF is also bowing to pressure from the state's transportation authority to upgrade {{the crossing}} with modern signals. Richmond is trying to preserve the crossing with historical designation and other planning tools. According to information recently posted at Dan's Wigwag Site (see below), the crossing will be updated with gates, modern flashers and bells. In an unusual compromise, the wigwags will remain as non-operative decorations at the crossing, once the modern gates, red lights and bells are put in place. In the interest of safety, signs will be posted at the wigwags stating that the signals are non-operational. The ability to be activated by trains will be retained, but only for special events. [...] In 2011, a water main break caused a catastrophic ground collapse under one of the Point Richmond <b>wig-wags</b> and it was removed for safekeeping while the area was being repaired.|$|R

50|$|A <b>wig-wag</b> is {{a device}} for {{flashing}} an automobile's headlamps at a preset rate. In its traditional form a <b>wig-wag</b> constitutes the illuminating {{of the right}} and left headlamps alternately, with each lamp lit for around half a second at a time. In the United Kingdom the <b>wig-wag</b> is only seen on the road on emergency vehicles. The 'standard' <b>wig-wag</b> is often used within a cycle of other illumination patterns, such as swiftly alternating the left and right headlights, alternating the left and right headlights slowly, or flashing both headlights together, and using a mixture of high- and low-/dipped-beams.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two common}} {{failures}} with the <b>wig-wag</b> mechanism. The {{first is that}} a solenoid tends to jam, often due to corrosion from operating in a damp environment. The second common failure is peculiar to the <b>wig-wag</b> - since the wires which operate the solenoids are constantly being flexed by {{the motion of the}} <b>wig-wag,</b> they tend to break causing the wash or spin cycle not to engage.|$|E
50|$|Of {{interest}} is a working <b>Wig-wag</b> level crossing warning signal which operates {{at the former}} park access road between the platform and storage siding. It {{is believed to be}} the only regularly operating <b>Wig-wag</b> signal remaining in Victoria.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>wig-wag</b> {{is mounted}} atop the washing machine's transmission, where it oscillates {{back and forth}} like a {{railroad}} signaling <b>wig-wag</b> (hence the name). When either solenoid is engaged, a rod catches and engages the transmission in the desired mode.|$|E

50|$|During {{a normal}} cycle, most Whirlpool-built <b>wig-wag</b> {{equipped}} washers will fill, start the motor, then engage the wash solenoid. Upon {{completion of the}} wash mode, the wash (agitate) solenoid will be turned off, which will allow the pump to drain the tub. After a minute or two, the timer will then engage the spin <b>wig-wag</b> which will cause {{the rotation of the}} tub. This is in contrast to most other top-load washing machines which start spinning and draining simultaneously. There are no pauses between cycles in these machines.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the use of}} {{flashing}} headlights does {{increase the}} visibility of any vehicle, it can also create problems. In situations when highbeam headlights are flashed, the <b>wig-wag</b> may create glare or may otherwise temporarily blind the drivers of oncoming vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is illegal}} to proceed past an {{alternating}} flashing red (<b>wig-wag)</b> signal at railroad crossings, per the motor vehicle codes of some jurisdictions. However, this same signal indication has a different meaning (stop and proceed when clear) at HAWK beacons.|$|E
50|$|The vehicle’s stock {{lighting}} {{may also}} be modified to add flashing and strobe effects. This {{can be done by}} adding electronics to the existing lighting system (for instance, to create a <b>wig-wag),</b> or by drilling holes in the reflectors of stock lighting and inserting flashing lights in those holes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wig-wag</b> is {{the common}} name for the unusual solenoid {{mechanism}} used in belt-drive washing machines made by Whirlpool, Kenmore (manufactured by Whirlpool) and many others, from approximately 1950 to 1987 in the United States. It was used in belt-drive Brastemp and Consul models built in Brazil from 1959 to 1990.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, wig-wags are {{prohibited}} on all vehicles except emergency vehicles. However the road rules in New South Wales, Australia, and some {{areas in the}} United States allow school buses to have flashing headlights. [...] In New South Wales specifically additional <b>Wig-Wag</b> lights (separate from the headlights) are used on all public transport buses.|$|E
