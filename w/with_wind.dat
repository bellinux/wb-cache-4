5|$|Ahead of Sina {{affecting}} the Fijian islands, from November 27 until November 29, <b>with</b> <b>wind</b> gusts {{of up to}} , hundreds of people were evacuated from Fiji's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland. As the cyclone affected Fiji high winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the Nadi International Airport for around 20 hours. As the cyclone moved towards the east-southeast between November 27–28, it passed near to or over the south-western coast of Viti Levu, Vatulele, Bequa, Northern Kadavu and various islands within the Moala and Southern Lau island groups and caused some coastal erosion. As it moved through the archipelago, the system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures, while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees. The system also severely affected crops and vegetation including sugar cane and pine forests, however {{the extent of the}} damage was limited by {{the fact that many of}} the crops had already been harvested.|$|E

5|$|This {{tropical}} storm was previously unidentified until modern research by José Fernández-Partagás revealed the storm in 1997. The {{tropical storm}} {{is believed to}} have originated as a tropical depression in the North Atlantic on August 22.

The system further intensified into a powerful tropical storm on August 24, <b>with</b> <b>winds</b> of 70 mph (110 km/h).

5|$|Along <b>with</b> <b>wind</b> direction, {{cloud cover}} {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{favorable}} conditions {{allowed for}} the uninhibited growth of Iselle early in its development, moderate wind shear briefly impacted the hurricane on August2, preventing thunderstorms from intensifying and causing the storm to become slightly malformed vertically. However, these conditions abated shortly afterwards, allowing Iselle to resume strengthening and reach Category2hurricane status late that same day. <b>With</b> <b>wind</b> shear no longer impinging on the organization of Iselle, the tropical cyclone gradually became more symmetric, allowing for the hurricane's once ragged eye to clear itself of cloud cover and the storm to intensify to major hurricane status on August3. Attaining some annular tropical cyclone characteristics, Iselle reaching Category4 strength at 12:00UTC on August4. Consequently, Iselle reached peak intensity at 18:00UTC with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg). At the same time, the hurricane exhibited an 30mi (45km) eye across.|$|E
5|$|Battering Aitutaki <b>with</b> <b>wind</b> gusts {{in excess}} of 185km/h (115mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78percent of homes were damaged, with 72structures destroyed. The {{electrical}} grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact, with most crops completely lost. Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand. Owing to its destructive effects, the name Pat was later retired and replaced with Pili.|$|E

5|$|Early on August28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an unusually}} vigorous tropical wavean elongated area of low air pressureinland over West Africa.

The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off Conakry around 18:00UTC, August29. By that time, the NHC was predicting a favorable environment for tropical cyclone development within the next 48hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center.
