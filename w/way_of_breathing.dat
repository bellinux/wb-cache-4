40|$|One of {{the reasons}} why Japanese people are poor at {{speaking}} English is that they are unaware of {{the difference between the two}} <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> breathing: abdominal <b>breathing</b> and costal breathing. When each Japanese letter is pronounced, it almost always comes with a vowel sound in which case the vocal chords vibrate. On the other hand, when the English language is pronounced, a lot of consonant sounds are used on their own, i. e. they do not come with vowel sounds in which case the vocal chords do not vibrate. Because Japanese people vibrate their vocal chords when they speak their own language, abdominal breathing is not necessarily used; in other words, when Japanese people speak Japanese, their speaking does not require them to inhale a lot of air and store it inside their abdomen or exhale the air without vibrating their vocal chords. However, since native speakers of English use a lot of consonant sounds, they frequently use abdominal breathing, which requires them to store a lot of air inside their abdomen and exhale it with a gust of air without vibrating their vocal chords. Consequently, while reading English aloud, Japanese people inhale and exhale air more frequently than the native speakers of English because the former do not frequently use abdominal breathing to utter sounds; instead, they vibrate their vocal chords. This difference in the <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> makes it difficult for Japanese people to utter English sounds. Since Japanese people also use abdominal breathing while doing physical exercise, singing a song, performing a play on the stage, etc., singing English songs in English is a good way for Japanese people to learn how native speakers <b>of</b> English <b>breathe,</b> which leads to good pronunciation of English language for Japanese people. 資...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of review: There is {{considerable}} {{public interest in}} the use <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> modification techniques {{in the treatment of}} asthma. Surveys suggest many people with asthma use them, often without the knowledge of their medical attendants. Extravagant claims have been made about the effectiveness of some techniques, resulting in scepticism from orthodox clinicians. The evidence supporting breathing training for asthma was previously weak, and limited by the small size and methodological limitations of published research. Recent findings: The evidence base for the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> training has recently improved, with reports from several larger and more methodologically robust controlled trials. These trials are reviewed in this study, and the findings placed in context.

40|$|A influência da respiração oral no adequado desempenho das funções do sistema estomatognático e sobre a postura {{corporal}} tem sido discutida no meio científico. A respiração oral é uma condição patológica, cuja etiologia é multifatorial, podendo estas serem subcategorizadas em obstrutivas/orgânicas e funcionais/viciosos. O objetivo deste estudo foi verificar a relação entre a postura corporal global e as funções estomatognáticas em respiradores orais obstrutivos e funcionais. Para tanto, avaliou-se 21 crianças, de 8 e 9 anos, 8 do sexo masculino e 13 do sexo feminino. Realizou-se avaliação das estruturas e funções do sistema estomatognático; da postura corporal, por meio da biofotogrametria digital, processada pelo software SAPo e otorrinolaringológica, através da rinoscopia e nasofibroscopia. Após os dados do estudo serem processados e analisados, aplicou-se o Teste Qui-quadrado ou de Fisher ou o de Mann-Withney, e o teste T de Student, com nível de significância de 5 % (p < 0, 05). Também foram realizadas análises de agrupamento ou cluster. A mastigação adequada, ou seja, bilateral alternada, foi mais observada nos ROO (12, 5 %) em relação aos ROF (7, 7 %). Já o ruído na mastigação apresentou freqüência elevada em ambos os grupos (ROF - 61, 5 %; ROO - 75 %). Os ROOs também apresentaram maior freqüência no que se refere ao ruído,e à alteração da velocidade. Nas demais características atípicas o grupo de ROF obteve maior freqüência, contudo nenhum dos resultados foi estatisticamente significante. Na deglutição, tanto o padrão de normalidade quanto as características de atipia são mais freqüentes nos ROF, com exceção do ruído que foi a única diferença estatística observada nos ROOs. Nos dendogramas, na vista anterior e lateral, assim como na biofotogrametria, a cabeça encontrou-se anteriorizada nos grupos. Pode-se verificar a prevalência de desvio anterior da cabeça e a presença de movimentos cefálicos nos RO durante a deglutição (p= 0, 016) e o maior tempo de mastigação (p= 0, 047). Assim, não há diferença se o respirador oral é obstrutivo ou vicioso, quanto aos efeitos nocivos no sistema estomatognático e à postura corporal, bem como pouca relação significante ente postura e funções estomatognáticas. Apesar disso, julga-se necessário que durante a avaliação das funções estomatognáticas seja levado em conta o modo respiratório e a postura corporal de cada indivíduo, já que alguns resultados mostraram-se estatisticamente significativos. The {{influence of}} mouth breathing to the adequate {{performance of the}} stomatognathic system functions and about the body posture have been discussed in the scientific environment. Mouth breathing is a pathologic condition, whose etiology is multifactorial, {{being able to be}} subcategorized as obstructive/organic and functional/vicious. The {{purpose of this study was}} to verify the relationship between global body posture and the stomatognathic functions in obstructive and functional oral breathers. For this, we evaluated 21 children, aged between 8 and 9 years old, 8 male and 13 female. We evaluated the structure and functions of the stomatognathic system; of the body posture, through the digital biophotogrammetry, processed by the software SAPo and otorrinolaringologic, through rhinoscopy and nasofibroscopy. After processing and analyzing the study data, we applied the Chisquare, Fisher, or Mann-Withney Tests, and the Students t-test, with level of significance of 5 % (p < 0. 05). We also carried out group analyses or cluster. The proper chewing, that is alternate bilateral, was observed in a higher level in OOB (Obstructive Oral Breathers) (12. 5 %) compared to VOB (Vicious Oral Breathers) (7. 7 %). The chewing noise presented a high frequency in both groups (VOB 61. 5 %; OOB 75 %). The OOBs also presented a higher frequency related to the noise and speed alterations. Regarding the other atypical characteristics, the group of VOBs obtained a higher frequency, but the results were not statistically significant. In swallowing, as the normal patterns as the atypical characteristics are more frequent in VOB, except the noise which was the only observed statistical difference in OOBs. In dendograms, anterior and lateral views, as well as in the biophotogrammetry, the head was anteriorized in the groups. We could observe the prevalence of head anterior deviation and the presence of cephalic movements in OB (Oral Breathers) during swallowing (p= 0. 016) and a longer time of chewing (p= 0. 047). So, there is no difference if the oral breather is obstructive or vicious, to the harmful effects to the stomatognathic system and to the body posture, as well as the little significant relation between posture and stomatognathic functions. Therefore, it is extremely important that during the evaluation of the stomatognathic functions we consider the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> and the body posture of each individual, because some results were statistically sig nificant...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim: The use of hatha yogic {{exercises}} (YE) is increasing, {{with both}} healthy individuals and patients asking for alternative treatments {{and other means}} of prevention and exercise. To investigate the physical effects and experiences of practicing YE among different groups thus seem important. Specifically, this thesis aimed to investigate heart rate variability, blood pressure, cardiovascular fitness and blood parameters using different YE programs for healthy populations. Another aim was to investigate walking distance, breathlessness, lung function and health related {{quality of life in}} participants with obstructive pulmonary disease. Participants and methods: Study I was a pilot study without a control group investigating the effects of practicing yogic inversions among 12 naïve, untrained and healthy persons (median age 51, 4 women and 8 men) while measuring cardiovascular health as heart rate variability, hand-grip strength and blood pressure. Study II used an RCT design and investigated the effects of practicing high intensity sun salutations among 44 healthy students (median age 25, 38 women and 6 men) while measuring cardiovascular fitness and blood parameters as apolipoproteins, adiponectin, leptin and glycosylated haemoglobin. Study III used an RCT design and investigated the effects of practicing an adapted YE program compared to a treatment as usual group (CTP) among 36 individuals with obstructive pulmonary disease (median age 64, 23 women and 13 men) while measuring six minute walk distance, dyspnea, lung function and disease specific quality of life. Study IV used a qualitative approach to investigate the experiences after YE (used in Study III) among 15 persons with obstructive pulmonary disease (median age 61, 10 women and 5 men). Results: Study I showed increased heart rate variability with a significant increase in pNN 50 % (ES 0. 45) and hand-grip strength but no effect on blood pressure. Study II showed no between-group effect and no effect on cardiovascular fitness. However, within the YE-group 35 - 40 minutes of high intensity sun salutation had an effect on the blood parameters as adiponectin and apoplipoproteinA 1. Study III found no significant between-group effect using t-tests in any parameter after the intervention. Analysis of variance differences emerged in CRQ fatigue and emotional domains favouring the treatment as usual group (CTP). Improved six-minute walk distance in the YE-group and CTP-group emerged after 12 weeks with no between-group effects. Disease specific quality of life measuring (CRQ) showed improvement in the mastery domain in YE and in all domains in the CTP-group. The YE-group showed lower respiratory rates, the CTP-group did not. Lung function and respiratory muscle strength did not improve in YE but did in the CTP-group. Dyspnea related distress did not improve in any group. Study IV found that the power of practicing (learning by doing) seemed central to the facilitation of self-awareness, controlling symptoms, dyspnea and permitted discovery <b>of</b> new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing.</b> Conclusions: The main findings following the evaluation of different yogic programs in Studies I-III showed that the programs were feasible and safe with no documented adverse effects. Study I was a pilot study calling for caution when interpreting the results. However, there still emerged significantly increased heart rate variability and hand-grip strength. In Study II no significant effect emerged between the groups. However, the yogic exercise group (YE) showed increased levels of apolipoproteinA 1 and adiponectin following YE intervention. Study III demonstrated improvement in all CRQ-domains in the CTP-group and in the mastery domain in the YE-group following a 12 week intervention. Taken together, the study resulted in significant improvements in walking distance in both groups following the 12 weeks. In the YE-group, lowered respiratory rate, improved mastery of the disease and increased oxygen saturation also emerged after the intervention. Study IV found that practicing YE can be a method used to empower individuals with obstructive pulmonary disorders and to help control symptoms and dyspnea. Yogic practice can serve as an efficient tool for learning new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> as well as strengthening one’s self-efficacy and mastery of the disease...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring respiration, it is {{accepted}} that oxygen diffuses passively from the lung alveolar spaces through the respiratory epithelium until reaching the pulmonary capillaries, where blood is oxygenated.

40|$|A {{breathing}} apparatus {{is a very}} useful device. It allows people to breathe relatively freely while entering environments that otherwise would be impenetrable such as extreme altitudes, smoke filled buildings, ocean depths and {{the surface of the}} moon. However, a {{breathing apparatus}} does have some disadvantages. These include breathing resistance, elastance, inertia and also positive or negative pressure breathing. A breathing apparatus may also increase the ventilatory demand due to, for instance, its dead space. These loads will increase the work <b>of</b> <b>breathing.</b> There are two ways to react to added respiratory loads: either the effort is increased so that the ventilation remains adequate or it is not which will cause increased levels of CO 2 (hypercapnia). Increased respiratory effort can cause respiratory muscle fatigue and/or dyspnea. Effects of hypercapnia range from headaches and nausea to impaired performance and mental function including loss of consciousness. The aims of this thesis are to investigate how much breathing resistance that is physiologically and subjectively acceptable, to study how the dead space in a breathing apparatus may interact with the user, to study how some breathing gases that are lighter than air may affect the users' respiratory capacities and to review and modify the traditional <b>way</b> that work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> is calculated. Based on experimental data {{it has been shown that}} the added work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> imposed by symmetrical breathing resistance should not exceed 1. 5 to 1. 8 J/l for the ventilation range 30 to 75 l/min BTPS. Dyspnea and hypercapnia appear to be exclusive reactions, at least in a diving situation, because increased in one were typically not paralleled with increases in the other. The dead space in a breathing apparatus may vary with the user's level of ventilation. Experimental data were compared with data from the literature and it was found that dead space increases the ventilation by about 60 % per liter of dead space. The gas mixture Hydrox have respiratory advantages over the gas mixture Heliox. The traditional <b>way</b> <b>of</b> calculating the work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> is incomplete. After demonstrating how this omission should be corrected it was demonstrated that the traditional method may have an error of up to 40 %. Acceptable levels of elastance and acceptable levels of combined loads need to be determined.

Both give {{a continuous}} pressure, but NIPPV also supports every breath. Therefore NIPPV {{may be a}} better support, but may also cause more complications, because NIPPV blows more air into the lungs and stomach. It is important to determine the balance between effectiveness and complications between NIPPV and CPAP in preterm born infants in the NICU of a single participating center. Objective: In anticipation the results of an international trial, we aimed to investigate the differences between effectiveness and complications between the use of NIPPV and CPAP as a treatment method for preterm born infants in a single medical center. We formulated death or BPD as the primary outcome, and we formulated several secondary outcomes, such as the duration <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> support (effectiveness) and gastrointestinal problems (complications). Methods: We included preterm born infants < 30 wk GA and < 1000 gram at birth, hospitalized at the NICU at the UMCG. They were treated with either NIPPV or CPAP, their treatment was decided by randomization. We compared both groups by comparing their differences between their effectiveness and complications. Results: 32 infants were included, 17 randomised to NIPPV and 15 to CPAP. Median gestational age (GA) of the NIPPV-group was 271 weeks (250 - 291) birth weight 840 grams (570 - 1000), median GA of the CPAP-group was 280 weeks (25 - 296) birth weight 900 grams (600 - 995). 29 % of the infants in the NIPPV-group either died, developed BPD or both, against 47 % of the CPAP-group (p= 0. 47). No differences were found in other respiratory outcomes, such as number of reintubations (7 (42 %) versus 6 (40 %) p= 1. 0) and duration of respiratory support (53 versus 40 days (p= 0. 407)). Gastrointestinal complications such as occurrence of NEC (4 (24 %) versus 4 (27 %) p= 1. 0) and growth (151 versus 152 g/wk (p= 0. 845) also showed no differences. Conclusions: No differences were found in effectiveness and complications when NIPPV is compared to CPAP. In anticipation {{of the results of the}} international trial, we found no differences in this small group of infants in a single participating center. ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Partial assist {{ventilation}} reduces work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> {{in patients}} with bronchospasm; however, {{it is not clear}} which components of the ventilatory cycle contribute to this process. Theoretically, expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), by reducing expiratory breaking, may be as important as inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) in reducing work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> during acute bronchospasm. METHOD: We compared the effects of 10 cmH 2 O of IPAP, EPAP, and continuous positive airwaypressure (CPAP) on inspiratory work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) in a canine model of methacholine-induced bronchospasm. RESULTS: Methacholine infusion increased airway resistance and work <b>of</b> <b>breathing.</b> During bronchospasm IPAP and CPAP reduced work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> primarily through reductions in transdiaphragmatic pressure per tidal volume (from 69. 4 +/- 10. 8 cmH 2 O/l to 45. 6 +/- 5. 9 cmH 2 O/l and to 36. 9 +/- 4. 6 cmH 2 O/l, respectively; P < 0. 05) and in diaphragmatic pressure-time product (from 306 +/- 31 to 268 +/- 25 and to 224 +/- 23, respectively; P < 0. 05). Pleural pressure indices <b>of</b> work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> were not reduced by IPAP and CPAP. EPAP significantly increased all pleural and transdiaphragmatic work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> indices. CPAP and EPAP similarly increased EELV above control by 93 +/- 16 ml and 69 +/- 12 ml, respectively. The increase in EELV by IPAP of 48 +/- 8 ml (P < 0. 01) was significantly less than that by CPAP and EPAP. CONCLUSION: The reduction in work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> during bronchospasm is primarily induced by the IPAP component, and that for the same reduction in work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> by CPAP, EELV increases more...|$|R
40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is to introduce an emerging field of study and a new training method called Anthropology <b>of</b> <b>Breathing.</b> The focus <b>of</b> anthropology <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> as a new discipline is to identify, explain and work with actor’s presence. Anthropology <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> trains actor’s body, mind and the actor/character introspective experience in performance. Performance is a trance-formational experience between daily and extra-daily experiences and the actor goes through various stages of physical and mental changes through the process of training, rehearsals and performance. Anthropology <b>of</b> <b>breathing,</b> therefore, focuses on the internal and external awareness of the actor by using breath as a transformational tool. Anthropology <b>of</b> <b>breathing,</b> in this sense, is an investigation into the fundamental structure and inner dynamics of human respiration. It is a systematic study <b>of</b> how <b>breathing</b> interacts with the body, emotions, internal and external awareness of the actor. The paper suggests various practical approaches and theoretical positions to clarify the links between breath and consciousness in training and performance. Anthropology <b>of</b> <b>breathing,</b> theoretically and practically, is an extension of Barba’s Theatre Anthropology. The paper proposes training actor’s inner awareness and stage presence through a technique of breath training called Restoration of breath...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} the work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> under general anaesthesia in children using drawover and continuous flow anaesthetic systems. A pilot {{study was conducted}} in four children weighing > 20 kg in whom it would usually be considered appropriate to use breathing systems designed for adult anaesthesia. The pilot study compared work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> using the Mapleson D breathing system and the Triservice Anaesthetic Apparatus (TSAA). Work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> was calculated using the modified Campbell technique that calculates work using a pressure volume loop derived from oesophageal pressure and airway gas volume measurements. We found no difference in the work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> when comparing the Mapleson D and the TSAA in children > 20 kg. Following completion of the pilot study, we conducted a study on 10 children weighing between 10 and 20 kg comparing work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> using the Mapleson F breathing system and the TSAA. We found {{no significant difference in the}} work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> between the Mapleson F and the TSAA for these children. The TSAA can therefore be recommended for use down to a lower weight limit of 10 kg...|$|R
