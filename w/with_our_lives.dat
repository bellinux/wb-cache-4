500|$|By then, revolutionary {{examples}} also {{inspired the}} prisoners of Darnytsia to proclaim {{their own political}} goals, and openly demand the union of Transylvania with Romania. Their manifesto of April 26 (April 13), reviewed for publishing by the Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga, was signed by 250 officers and 250 soldiers, and is probably the first unionist statement to be issued by a Transylvanian representative body. The document states: [...] "we Romanians, like all other subjugated nations, have grown aware that {{once and for all}} that we [...] cannot carry on <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> within the frame of the Austro-Hungarian state; we [...] demand, with unwavering will, our incorporation into Romania, so that together we may form a single national Romanian state. [...] For the sake of this ideal, we throw in the balance all of what we have, our lives and fortunes, our women and children, our descendants' life and happiness. And we never will stop, lest we vanquish or perish." ...|$|E
500|$|Pacers coach Rick Carlisle {{said after}} the game, [...] "I felt like I was {{fighting}} for my life out there." [...] One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player [...] "went through me like I was butter", and then NBA Commissioner David Stern, watching the game on TV, recalled that he said, [...] "Holy [...]" [...] (O'Neal later said, [...] "As bad as it looked on TV, {{it was at least}} 20 times worse in person.") Pacers assistant coach Chuck Person compared the situation to being [...] "trapped in a gladiator-type scene where the fans were the lions and we were just trying to escape <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives.</b> That's how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out." [...] Players' children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. Derrick Coleman stood near Brown and Brown's ball boy son to protect them. The remaining seconds of the game were called off and the Pacers were awarded the 97–82 win. Fans booed the Indiana players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages and other objects (including a folding chair that nearly hit O'Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room. No players from either team spoke to the media before leaving the arena. Eventually, police officers were able to swarm the arena, threatening to handcuff those who wouldn't leave. Nine spectators were injured, and two were taken to the hospital.|$|E

2500|$|Xu Sheng {{was known}} for his {{confidence}} and fervent loyalty towards Sun Quan, as demonstrated in the incident when Xing Zhen (邢貞) came to confer the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] (吳王) on Sun Quan. In 220, Sun Quan became a vassal of the state of Cao Wei, which replaced the Han dynasty after the Wei founder, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him. Cao Pi sent Xing Zhen as an emissary to meet Sun Quan and confer the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] (吳王) on him. Xing Zhen behaved arrogantly in front of Sun Quan and incurred much anger from Sun Quan's subjects, including Zhang Zhao and Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng told his colleagues, [...] "Isn't it humiliating to watch our lord submit to Xing Zhen {{and not be able to}} serve him <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> and help him conquer Xu, Luoyang and Bashu?" [...] Tears rolled down his face. When Xing Zhen heard Xu Sheng's remark, he told an aide, [...] "It's obvious from the reactions of the subjects of Jiangdong that they won't remain subservient for long." [...] Xing Zhen was right, because in 222, Sun Quan declared independence from Wei but continued ruling his domain under the title [...] "King of Wu" [...] before declaring himself emperor in 229.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{technological}} singularity is usually {{seen as a}} sudden event, some scholars argue the current speed of change already fits this description. In addition, some argue that we {{are already in the}} midst of a major evolutionary transition that merges technology, biology, and society. Digital technology has infiltrated the fabric of human society to a degree of indisputable and often life-sustaining dependence. A 2016 article in Trends in Ecology & Evolution argues that [...] "humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels... we trust artificial intelligence <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>lives</b> through antilock braking in cars and autopilots in planes... With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction". The article argues that from the perspective of the evolution, several previous Major Transitions in Evolution have transformed life through innovations in information storage and replication (RNA, DNA, multicellularity, and culture and language). In the current stage of life's evolution, the carbon-based biosphere has generated a cognitive system (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary transition. The digital information created by humans has reached a similar magnitude to biological information in the biosphere. Since the 1980s, [...] "the quantity of digital information stored has doubled about every 2.5 years, reaching about 5 zettabytes in 2014 (5x10^21 bytes). In biological terms, there are 7.2 billion humans on the planet, each having a genome of 6.2 billion nucleotides. Since one byte can encode four nucleotide pairs, the individual genomes of every human on the planet could be encoded by approximately 1x10^19 bytes. The digital realm stored 500 times more information than this in 2014 (...see Figure)... The total amount of DNA contained in all of the cells on Earth is estimated to be about 5.3x10^37 base pairs, equivalent to 1.325x10^37 bytes of information. If growth in digital storage continues at its current rate of 30–38% compound annual growth per year, it will rival the total information content contained in all of the DNA in all of the cells on Earth in about 110 years. This would represent a doubling of the amount of information stored in the biosphere across a total time period of just 150 years".|$|E
