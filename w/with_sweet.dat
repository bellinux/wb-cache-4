5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Cyber Sunday on the Raw brand was between Randy Orton and Shawn Michaels, {{with the two}} battling over the WWE Championship. This feud began in May when Michaels faced Edge in Edge's last match on Raw. Michaels won the match by pinfall after Sweet Chin Music. After the match, when Michaels was celebrating, Orton come out and {{attacked}} Michaels, which was preceded by a punt to the head. At Judgment Day, Orton attacked Michaels, putting him out of action for several months. Their feud restarted on the October 8, 2007 episode of Raw, the night after Orton won the WWE Championship. Michaels returned during Orton's appreciation ceremony and hit him <b>with</b> <b>Sweet</b> Chin Music, when Orton {{was going to hit}} Michaels with the WWE Championship belt. Afterwards, a match was made for Cyber Sunday where Orton would defend the WWE Championship against the fans' choice of either Michaels, Jeff Hardy, or Mr. Kennedy. The next week on Raw, Orton faced his three possible opponents in individual matches. Kennedy interfered and attacked Hardy in his match with Orton. Hardy attacked Kennedy in his match, and Kennedy assaulted Michaels in his match, leading to Hardy making the save. Despite this, Michaels hit Orton <b>with</b> <b>Sweet</b> Chin Music to end the show. On October 22, on Raw, Orton teamed with Kennedy against Michaels and Hardy.

After the match, Michaels hit Orton <b>with</b> <b>Sweet</b> Chin Music for the third week in a row, when Hardy pushed Orton into Michaels when Orton went to deliver Hardy an RKO.|$|E

5|$|On September 15 at Night of Champions, Orton {{lost the}} WWE Championship back to Bryan, however, Triple H {{stripped}} Bryan {{of the title}} the next night on Raw, due to a fast count by referee Scott Armstrong, but refused to give the championship back to Orton.

5|$|Several foods have an {{association}} with the city. Sally Lunn buns (a type of teacake) have long been baked in Bath. They were first mentioned by name in verses printed in the Bath Chronicle, in 1772. At that time they were eaten hot at public breakfasts in Spring Gardens. They can be eaten <b>with</b> <b>sweet</b> or savoury toppings and are sometimes confused with Bath buns, which are smaller, round, very sweet and very rich. They {{were associated with the}} city following The Great Exhibition. Bath buns were originally topped with crushed comfits created by dipping caraway seeds repeatedly in boiling sugar; but today seeds are added to a 'London Bath Bun' (a reference to the bun's promotion and sale at the Great Exhibition). The seeds may be replaced by crushed sugar granules or 'nibs'.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a No Disqualification match between Kane, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, and Shawn Michaels. Kane would gain the early advantage as he suplexed Michaels through the announce table. Kane would continue to brawl with Michaels at ringside where he hit Michaels with the ringside steel steps, which resulted in Michaels bleeding. As Kane attempted to hit Michaels with a steel chair, Lita would interfere and grab the chair away from Kane. Kane then attempted a chokeslam, but Michaels would counter it <b>with</b> <b>Sweet</b> Chin Music, which gained a successful pinfall.|$|E

5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake <b>with</b> <b>sweet</b> cream glacé. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{was born}} in Orangeville, Ontario, the son of Judy Copeland, a single parent who worked two jobs to support her son. To this day, he has never met his father or seen a picture of him. He became {{interested}} in professional wrestling at a young age; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart. As a teenager, Copeland attended WrestleMania VI sitting in the eleventh row at ringside. He was cheering on WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan against The Ultimate Warrior, and he credits this match with making him realize {{he wanted to be}} a wrestler. When he was 17, he won an essay contest with his local gym, and his prize was free wrestling training <b>with</b> <b>Sweet</b> Daddy Siki and Ron Hutchison in Toronto. He put his wrestling aspirations aside to help pay the bills. He held numerous jobs and then attended Humber College, where he graduated with a degree in radio broadcasting, then received training.|$|E

5|$|In India, {{squashes}} (ghia) {{are cooked}} with seafood such as prawns. In France, marrows (courge) are traditionally {{served as a}} gratin, sieved and cooked with butter, milk, and egg, and flavored with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and as soups. In Italy, zucchini and larger squashes are served {{in a variety of}} regional dishes, such as cocuzze alla puviredda cooked with olive oil, salt and herbs from Puglia; as torta di zucca from Liguria, or torta di zucca e riso from Emilia-Romagna, the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and milk; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like spaghetti alle zucchine from Sicily. In Japan, squashes such as small C. moschata pumpkins (kabocha) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a tempura dish, or made into balls <b>with</b> <b>sweet</b> potato and Japanese mountain yam.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, durian {{is often}} eaten fresh <b>with</b> <b>sweet</b> sticky rice, and blocks of durian paste {{are sold in}} the markets, though much of the paste is {{adulterated}} with pumpkin. Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called boder. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in coconut oil, with a texture {{that is similar to}} taro or yam, but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked durian seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms {{are mostly}} found during hot spells {{in summer and}} autumn, growing in {{mycorrhizal}} association with various broad-leaved trees and sclerophyllous shrubs, especially oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus), chestnut (Castanea), strawberry trees (Arbutus), treeheath (Erica), and rockrose (Cistus), showing a preference for acid soils. Roadsides and parks are common habitats. The cork oak in particular is an important symbiont, {{and the distribution of}} B.aereus (along with B.mamorensis) aligns with the tree across Europe and North Africa. The ectomycorrhizae that B.aereus forms <b>with</b> <b>sweet</b> chestnut (Castanea sativa) and downy oak (Quercus pubescens) have been described in detail. They are characterized by a lack of hyphal clamps, a plectenchymatous mantle (made of parallel-orientated hyphae with little branching or overlap), and rhizomorphs with differentiated hyphae. A 2007 field study on four species of boletes revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies appear to be more complex than previously thought.|$|E
