5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several vessels during its existence, no land areas <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> by Zeta. As a result, the NHC did not issue any tropical storm watches or warnings.|$|E
5|$|According to {{journalist}} , Enderlin's {{coverage of}} the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was respected by other journalists but was regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups. As {{a result of the}} al-Durrah case, he received death threats, his wife was assaulted in the street, his children <b>were</b> <b>threatened,</b> the family had to move home, and at one point they considered emigrating to the United States.|$|E
5|$|After his death, {{criminal}} charges <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> against Robinson in Cleveland, {{up to and}} including murder, though none actually materialized. After learning of Doyle's intentions of using the bout's money to buy his mother a house, Robinson gave Doyle's mother the money from his next four bouts so she could purchase herself a home, fulfilling her son's intention.|$|E
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat degradation. It {{requires}} open {{habitat for}} germination, but {{this kind of}} habitat <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by introduced flora. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by introduced grazing animals.|$|R
50|$|Scenes where Donald <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> with a {{knife and}} the police officer <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> with an axe have been cut.|$|R
50|$|This plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{firewood}} harvesting, {{which has}} caused habitat destruction in the area. It may also <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by mining operations.|$|R
5|$|Against orders, Ramseur {{attacked}} Averell's smaller force. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry {{was called}} from reserve {{to assist the}} 3rd West Virginia Cavalry when Averell's flanks <b>were</b> <b>threatened.</b> The additional (and unexpected) cavalry caused a Confederate panic, and Averell won the battle.|$|E
5|$|Following her re-election, Roberts was {{nominated}} for the post of House Minority Caucus Chair, but lost the caucus' vote for the post to Rep. Amy Stephens. After losing the vote, Roberts publicly lamented the lack of rural representation in legislative leadership and alleged that Republican lawmakers <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> with primaries if they voted for her leadership bid.|$|E
5|$|The {{senators}} who protested <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> by the Russians (represented by Ambassador Otto von Stackelberg), who declared {{that in the}} face of refusal the whole capital of Warsaw would be destroyed. Other threats included executions, confiscation of estates, and increase of territory subjected to partition. Some senators were arrested and exiled to Siberia.|$|E
50|$|These {{habitats}} <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> in {{the wild}} and in addition, E. revolutum may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by collection for horticulture and soil compaction by forestry machinery.|$|R
50|$|The plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the loss}} and {{degradation}} of its habitat. In New Mexico it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by oil and gas development and {{the changes that have}} occurred on the land due to overgrazing, such as erosion and introduced species of plants. In Texas, the plant grows on roadsides and it may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by roadway maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Populations of epauletted fruit bats <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{pesticides}} on fruit, human disturbance and over-collecting in the past. However {{the number}} one reason it may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>is</b> habitat destruction.|$|R
5|$|As {{with earlier}} campaigns, {{recruiting}} enough men was a problem. Jefferson {{called for the}} western counties of Virginia to provide militia manpower for Clark's campaign, but county officials protested {{that they could not}} spare the men. Militiamen did not want to set out on a lengthy expedition—they would be gone for six months to a year—while their families and homes <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> by Lord Cornwallis's army in the east, by Indian raids from the north, and by Loyalists at home. Because of this resistance, Jefferson called for volunteers rather than ordering the militia to accompany the expedition.|$|E
5|$|During the elections, Ohio {{officials}} were harassed by Michigan {{authorities and the}} area residents <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> with arrest if they submitted to Ohio's authority. On April 8, 1835, the Monroe County, Michigan sheriff arrived {{at the home of}} Major Benjamin F. Stickney, an Ohio partisan. In the first contact between Michigan partisans and the Stickney family, the sheriff arrested two Ohioans under the Pains and Penalties Act on the basis that the men had voted in the Ohio elections.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{as part of}} its {{campaign}} for the Three Fs (fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale) and specifically in resistance to proposed evictions on the estate, local activists of the Irish Land League encouraged Boycott's employees (including the seasonal workers required to harvest the crops on LordErne's estate) to withdraw their labour, and began a campaign of isolation against Boycott in the local community. This campaign included shops in nearby Ballinrobe refusing to serve him, and the withdrawal of services. Some <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> with violence to ensure compliance.|$|E
25|$|In Utah, its habitat <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{commercial}} development, whereas the Grand Canyon population <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by discharges from the Glen Canyon Dam which can sweep the snail and its habitat downstream.|$|R
50|$|According to the World Wildlife Fund {{the status}} of the {{ecoregion}} is Critical/Endangered.Smallholders along the rivers undertake mixed agriculture, forest exploitation, small-scale logging and livestock raising.In some areas the várzea forest <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by large-scale logging and cattle farming.Fish populations <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by large-scale fishing operations and may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by excessive collection of aquarium fish such as the red discus (Symphysodon discus).Gold mining contaminates the Purus and Japurá with mercury.|$|R
50|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss, but {{the total}} {{population}} is stable and the species <b>is</b> not <b>threatened.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{capture of}} Kotor earned Tvrtko the enmity of George I of Zeta's brother and successor, Balša II, who also desired the city. Nothing {{is known about}} Balša's {{military}} conflict with Tvrtko except that the latter asked Venice, whose trading opportunities <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> by the clashes, to mediate with the Lord of Zeta. The mediation was thwarted by Balša's death in a 1385 battle with the invading Ottoman Turks. Balša's nephew and successor, George II, maintained Zeta's hostility toward Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{administration}} {{wanted to}} expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, {{who was in charge}} of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.|$|E
5|$|The pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} in {{its heyday}} was {{the core of a}} very diverse navy. Many older ironclads were still in service. Battleships served alongside cruisers of many descriptions: modern armoured cruisers which were essentially cut-down battleships, lighter protected cruisers, and even older unarmoured cruisers, sloops and frigates whether built out of steel, iron or wood. The battleships <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> by torpedo boats; it was during the pre-dreadnought era that the first destroyers were constructed to deal with the torpedo-boat threat, though {{at the same time the}} first effective submarines were being constructed.|$|E
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{habitat loss}} due to {{deforestation}} for timber and agriculture and its current status <b>is</b> near <b>threatened.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Latvia, the Union of Greens and Farmers is {{supportive}} of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by development, while small farms <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by large industrial-scale farms.|$|R
50|$|Northern bobwhite and California quail {{are popular}} gamebirds, with many taken by hunters, but these species {{have also had}} their ranges {{increased}} to meet hunting demand and <b>are</b> not <b>threatened.</b> They <b>are</b> also artificially stocked. Some species <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by human activity, such as the bearded tree quail of Mexico, which <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss and illegal hunting.|$|R
5|$|Waves {{and high}} tides {{from the storm}} caused {{flooding}} along the Pamlico Sound side of Ocracoke and southern Hatteras Island. High tides also resulted in overwash in Pea Island, forcing the closure of Highway 12 due to 12inches (305mm) of salt water. High tides from the storm also destroyed two houses in South Nags Head and one in Rodanthe, two of which were previously condemned after the 1991 Perfect Storm. Three other houses in the Outer Banks <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> by the storm. Elsewhere in the Outer Banks, damage was minimal, and was limited to pedestrian ramps and steps to the beachfront.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E
5|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on the storm in eight counties in North Carolina to determine the cost of evacuation for hurricanes, and included 1,029 households. Another study was performed regarding the actions taken during Hurricane Bonnie evacuations in the state. Tourists were interviewed, and it was found that 90% of vacationers who <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> by the hurricane evacuated, of which 56% went home, 3% stayed in public shelters, 22% stayed with friends or relatives, 3% stayed in hotels and motels, and 16% stayed elsewhere. In total, 58% stayed within North Carolina, 12% went to Virginia, 6% relocated to South Carolina, and 24% stayed in other regions. Most of the evacuees left on August 25; 80% left with their own vehicles, and 18% used rental transportation. Officials in the state opened an estimated 100 shelters to accommodate the evacuating tourists and residents.|$|E
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by livestock, which {{relish the}} semi-succulent leaves. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by {{recreational}} {{activity in the}} habitat.|$|R
50|$|Although {{this species}} <b>is</b> not <b>threatened</b> with extinction, its habitat may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the spread of}} the garlic mustard (Alliaria officinalis).|$|R
50|$|Schizolaena parviflora <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{deforestation}} due to shifting {{patterns of}} agriculture. The species <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by timber harvesting and wildfires.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there was}} some fear of Rome and concern with her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> on land {{by the rest of}} the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so much so that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|American missionaries <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> {{with death}} when the Boxer Rebellion menaced foreigners in China. Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and, in {{cooperation}} with other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military. After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and 1940, fishers <b>were</b> <b>threatened</b> with near-extinction in the {{southern}} part of their range due to overtrapping and alterations to their habitat. In New England, fishers, along with most other furbearers, were nearly exterminated due to unregulated trapping. Fishers became extirpated in many northern U.S. states after 1930, but were still abundant enough in Canada to maintain a harvest of over 3,000 fishers per year (see figure). Limited protection was afforded in the early 20th century, but it was not until 1934 that total protection was finally given to the few remaining fishers. Closed seasons, habitat recovery, and reintroductions have restored fishers to much of their original range.|$|E
50|$|The plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the loss}} and {{degradation}} of its habitat, mainly due {{to the presence of}} feral pigs and non-native plants. Some of the plant's habitat is on military territory and it may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by military activity.|$|R
