5|$|Frank and the CCAF's {{position}} against coupon settlements <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> in his written {{objection to}} the case in which he stated that they often do not provide meaningful compensation to class members, they often fail to disgorge ill-gotten gains from the defendant, and they often require class members to do future business with the defendant {{in order to receive}} compensation.|$|E

5|$|In Czechoslovakia, {{especially}} in the week immediately following the invasion, popular opposition <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> in numerous spontaneous acts of nonviolent resistance. On 16 January 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague's Wenceslas Square to protest against the renewed suppression of free speech. Civilians purposely gave wrong directions to invading soldiers, while others identified and followed cars belonging to the secret police.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E

5|$|A small neutral bloc arose {{with the}} Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good {{relations}} with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed {{in preparation for a}} possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear strategy that discouraged an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker—the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and their deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.|$|E
5|$|As aforesaid, SVT {{wanted to}} make a good use of Malmo Arena's space to {{highlight}} the performances and increase the audience's visibility compared to previous years. SVT created a main stage and a smaller stage with higher-lower shifted floors, connected by a trail closely surrounded by a standing crowd from both sides of it and around the small stage. The main stage mobility <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> as a main artistic medium at the opening act of the second semifinal and with highlighting Moldova's performance towards its finish, as a movable part beneath the singer's dress making her look gradually taller. The small stage mobility highlighted United Kingdom's performance towards its finish, lifted above the close-standing audience.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the formal {{administration}} of Toraja villages by the Tana Toraja Regency, each Toraja village was autonomous. In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group; sometimes, villages would unite against other villages. Relationship between families <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> through blood, marriage, and shared ancestral houses (tongkonan), practically signed by the exchange of water buffalo and pigs on ritual occasions. Such exchanges not only built political and cultural ties between families but defined each person's place in a social hierarchy: who poured palm wine, who wrapped a corpse and prepared offerings, where each person could or could not sit, what dishes should be used or avoided, and even what piece of meat constituted one's share.|$|E

5|$|Dualism {{is a set}} {{of views}} about the {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach {{to the nature of the}} mind.|$|E
5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in a colander to ensure that all the liquid <b>was</b> <b>expressed.</b> These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Caltrans {{said that}} SR54 {{had not been}} {{included}} in plans {{for the next six}} years, {{due to a lack of}} funding and a shift in priorities from new roads to maintenance. The water subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives later recommended that the wildlife refuge be put on hold, since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had not finished their proposal. Over the next few years, support for the project <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> by a local citizens' group, the Chula Vista city council, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church, whose {{traditional}} membership {{was most}} affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick with a flat roof. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this basic pattern.|$|E
5|$|The Eccles Spinning and Manufacturing Company {{came into}} being {{following}} a meeting called by the Mayor of Eccles, in which concern <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> at the decline in local industry. Two earlier Eccles mills had been destroyed by fire, resulting in significant local unemployment. Designed by Potts, Son and Hennings of Manchester, Bolton and Oldham, it was opened in 1906. The imposing mill contained a multi-storey spinning mill, engine house and extensive weaving sheds.|$|E

Interest <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> by Aérospatiale, Bell Helicopter, Boeing Vertol, Grumman, Lockheed, and Westland. Contractors were encouraged to form teams. Bell partnered with Boeing Vertol to submit a proposal for an enlarged version of the Bell XV-15 prototype on 17 February 1983. Being the only proposal received, a preliminary design contract was awarded on 26 April 1983.|$|E
