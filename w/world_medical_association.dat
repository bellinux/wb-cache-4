40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{confidentiality and}} its nature and analyses the guidelines {{laid down by}} the Hippocratic Oath {{as well as the}} British and <b>World</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Associations</b> for maintaining such confidentiality between doctor and patient. There are exceptions to practically any code of rules and this is true also for confidentiality. Some of these exceptions make it appear that very little is confidential. The three values implicit in confidentiality would seem to be privacy, confidence and secrecy. Each of these values is discussed and developed in this paper. In conclusion, the question is suggested that maybe in the face of death, doctor and patient need to re-examine the pre-suppositions of privacy, confidence and secrecy on which the confidential relationship is based...|$|R

25|$|By the 1990s, growing {{concerns}} about possible abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups {{and human rights}} organizations to start condemning China’s use of prisoner organs. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when a Chinese military doctor testified before U.S. Congress {{that he had taken}} part in organ extraction operations from executed prisoners, some of whom were not yet dead. In December 2005, China's Deputy Health Minister Huang Jiefu acknowledged that up to 95% of transplant organs came from executed prisoners and promised steps to prevent abuse. Huang reiterated these claims in 2008 and 2010, stating that over 90% of organ transplants from deceased donors are sourced from prisoners. In 2006 the <b>World</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association</b> demanded that China cease harvesting organs from prisoners, who are not deemed able to properly consent. In 2014, Huang Jiefu said that reliance on organ harvesting from death row inmates was declining, while simultaneously defending the practice of using prisoners’ organs in the transplantation system.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{government}} has consistently denied the allegations. However, the perceived failure of Chinese authorities to effectively address or refute the charges has drawn attention and public condemnation from some governments, international organizations and medical societies. The parliaments of Canada and the European Union, {{as well as}} the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, have adopted resolutions condemning organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners of conscience. United Nations Special Rapporteurs have called on the Chinese government to account for the sources of organs used in transplant practices, and the <b>World</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Association,</b> the American Society of Transplantation and the Transplantation Society have called for sanctions on Chinese medical authorities. Several countries have also taken or considered measures to deter their citizens from travelling to China for the purpose of obtaining organs. A documentary on organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners, Human Harvest, received a 2014 Peabody Award recognizing excellence in broadcast journalism.|$|E
