50|$|Ale {{is a type}} of beer brewed using a <b>warm</b> <b>fermentation</b> method, {{resulting}} in a sweet, full-bodied and fruity taste. Historically, the term referred to a drink brewed without hops.|$|E
5000|$|Schwarzbiers {{are made}} using a cool {{fermentation}} method, which classes them as lager, though historically <b>warm</b> <b>fermentation</b> was used. The alcohol content usually ranges from 4.1% to 5%. They get their dark colour {{from the use}} of particularly dark malts or roast malt extract in brewing. The malt, in turn, gets its colour during the roasting procedure.|$|E
50|$|Although one of {{the most}} {{defining}} features of lager is its maturation in cold storage, it is also distinguished by the use of a specific yeast. While it is possible to use lager yeast in a <b>warm</b> <b>fermentation</b> process, such as with American steam beer, the lack of a cold storage maturation phase precludes such beer from being classified as lager. On the other hand, German Altbier and Kölsch, brewed with a top-fermenting yeast at a warm temperature, but with a cold storage finishing stage, are classified as obergäriges Lagerbier (top-fermented lager beer).|$|E
5000|$|King Cobra is a 6% alcohol {{by volume}} malt liquor {{introduced}} in 1984. It is brewed with a <b>warmer</b> <b>fermentation</b> than {{used for the}} company's pale lagers, and the ingredients include barley malt and corn. Shortly after its launch, King Cobra was supported by an advertising campaign featuring actor, martial artist, and former American football player Fred Williamson and the tag-line [...] "Don't let the smooth taste fool you!" ...|$|R
500|$|Another {{important}} decision is {{the temperature of}} fermentation. French winemakers prefer <b>warmer</b> <b>fermentations</b> (around 16-18°C) that bring out the mineral flavors in the wine while New World winemakers prefer slightly colder temperatures to bring out more fruit and tropical flavors. A small minority of Loire winemakers will put the wine through malolactic fermentation, a practice more often associated with New Zealand wines. Oak aging can have a pronounced effect on the wine, with the oak rounding out the flavors and softening the naturally high acidity of the grape. Some winemakers, like those in New Zealand and Sancerre, prefer stainless steel fermentation tanks over barrels {{with the intention of}} maintaining the [...] sharp focus and flavor intensity.|$|R
5000|$|Steam beer is {{a highly}} effervescent beer made by fermenting lager yeasts at <b>warmer</b> ale yeast <b>fermentation</b> temperatures. It has two {{distinct}} but related meanings: ...|$|R
5000|$|When a beer {{has been}} brewed using a cool {{fermentation}} of around , compared to typical <b>warm</b> <b>fermentation</b> temperatures of , then stored (or lagered) for typically several weeks (or months) at temperatures close to freezing point, it is termed a [...] "lager". During the lagering or storage phase several flavour components developed during fermentation dissipate, {{resulting in a}} [...] "cleaner" [...] flavour. Though it is the slow, cool fermentation and cold conditioning (or lagering) that defines the character of lager, the main technical difference is with the yeast generally used, which is Saccharomyces pastorianus. Technical differences include the ability of lager yeast to metabolize melibiose, and the tendency to settle {{at the bottom of}} the fermenter (though ales yeasts can also become bottom settling by selection); though these technical differences are not considered by scientists to be influential in the character or flavour of the finished beer, brewers feel otherwise - sometimes cultivating their own yeast strains which may suit their brewing equipment or for a particular purpose, such as brewing beers with a high abv.|$|E
5000|$|Bioreactor {{design is}} a {{relatively}} complex engineering task, which is studied in the discipline of biochemical engineering. Under optimum conditions, the microorganisms or cells are able to perform their desired function with limited production of impurities. The environmental conditions inside the bioreactor, such as temperature, nutrient concentrations, pH, and dissolved gases (especially oxygen for aerobic fermentations) affect the growth and productivity of the organisms. The temperature of the fermentation medium is maintained by a cooling jacket, coils, or both. Particularly exothermic fermentations may {{require the use of}} external heat exchangers. Nutrients may be continuously added to the fermenter, as in a fed-batch system, or may be charged into the reactor at the beginning of fermentation. The pH of the medium is measured and adjusted with small amounts of acid or base, depending upon the fermentation. For aerobic (and some anaerobic) fermentations, reactant gases (especially oxygen) must be added to the fermentation. Since oxygen is relatively insoluble in water (the basis of nearly all fermentation media), air (or purified oxygen) must be added continuously. The action of the rising bubbles helps mix the fermentation medium and also [...] "strips" [...] out waste gases, such as carbon dioxide. In practice, bioreactors are often pressurized; this increases the solubility of oxygen in water. In an aerobic process, optimal oxygen transfer is sometimes the rate limiting step. Oxygen is poorly soluble in water—even less in <b>warm</b> <b>fermentation</b> broths—and is relatively scarce in air (20.95%). Oxygen transfer is usually helped by agitation, which is also needed to mix nutrients and to keep the fermentation homogeneous. Gas dispersing agitators are used to break up air bubbles and circulate them throughout the vessel.|$|E
40|$|Fresh manure {{of cattle}} was {{subjected}} to aerobic composting process in two ways: mixed with chopped stalks of sunflower and triticale straw. The composting process has been monitored by sampling periodic chemical and biochemical samples to determine pH value and the quantity of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. It was also registered the temperature and humidity evolution of gathering together of materials that are subject of biodegradation, and finally we calculated the yield of composting. It {{was found that the}} oxygen is indispensable to the composting process because during the period of <b>warm</b> <b>fermentation,</b> the aerobic bacteria need a regeneration of oxygen to continue the oxidation of carbon. A decrease in the oxygen concentration below 6 % slows down the microbial activity. The best compost was obtained in the case of ratio C : N about 20 - 40 : 1...|$|E

When <b>fermentation</b> begins add to it a {{solution}} of 4 ounces selected opium in 12 ounces water. Let the mixture stand for a month at a temperature of 86° Fahr.; then strain, filter, and evaporate to 10 ounces; finally strain and add 4½ ounces proof alcohol. Seven drops of this preparation contain about 1 grain of opium." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jjinppang (...) is a steamed bun, {{typically}} {{filled with}} red bean paste {{with bits of}} broken beans and bean husk. Traditional jjinppang is made of sourdough fermented using the yeast in makgeolli (rice wine), but younger varieties such as hoppang are often made without <b>fermentation.</b> <b>Warm</b> jjinppang is softer than baked breads due to the higher moisture content, but it hardens as it cools. Thus it is recommended to eat while the bun is still hot. Hardened jjinppang can be steamed again before eaten.|$|R
50|$|Ryazhenka {{is made by}} pasteurising {{milk and}} then {{simmering}} it on low heat for eight hours or longer. Historically, this was done by placing a clay pot (glechik or krinka) with milk in the traditional Russian oven for a day until it is coated with a brown crust. Prolonged exposure to heat causes the Maillard reaction between the milk's amino acids and sugars, resulting {{in the formation of}} melanoidin compounds that give it a creamy color and caramel flavor. A great deal of moisture evaporates, resulting in a change of consistency. In household production, sour cream (smetana) is subsequently added to trigger fermentation. In modern industrial production, pure thermophile bacterial cultures (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) are used instead. The mixture is then kept in a <b>warm</b> place. The <b>fermentation</b> occurs at temperatures above ca. 40 °C / 100 °F and usually takes from three to six hours.|$|R
40|$|Samples {{were taken}} {{at each stage}} of brewing (malt, milling, mashing, wort separation, hop addition, boiling, whirlpool, dilution, <b>fermentation,</b> <b>warm</b> rest, chill-lagering, beer filtration, {{carbonation}} and bottling, pasteurization, and storage). The level of antioxidant activity of unfractionated, low-molecular-mass (LMM) and high-molecular-mass (HMM) fractions {{was measured by the}} 2, 2 '-azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfortic acid) radical cation (ABTS(. +)) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) procedures. Polyphenol levels were assessed by HPLC. The LMM fraction (0. 001) in catechin and ferulic acid levels. Increases in antioxidant activity levels were observed after mashing, boiling, fermentation, chill-lagering, and pasteurization, in line with previous studies on lager. Additionally, increases in the level of antioxidant activity occurred after wort separation and carbonation and bottling and were accompanied by increases in levels of most monitored polyphenols. Data from the ABTS(. -) and FRAP assays indicated that the compounds contributing to the levels of antioxidant activity responded differently in the two procedures. Levels of ferulic, vanillic, and chlorogenic acids and catechin accounted for 45 - 61 % of the variation in antioxidant activity levels...|$|R
40|$|A process {{aimed at}} {{producing}} energy needs {{to produce more}} energy than the energy necessary to run the process itself {{in order to be}} energetically sustainable. In this paper, an energy balance of a batch anaerobic bioreactor has been defined and calculated, both for different operative conditions and for different reactor scales, in order to analyze the sustainability of hydrogen production through dark anaerobic fermentation. Energy production in the form of hydrogen and methane, energy to <b>warm</b> up the <b>fermentation</b> broth, energy loss during fermentation and energy for mixing and pumping have been considered in the energy balance. Experimental data and literature data for mesophilic microorganism consortia have been used to calculate the energy balance. The energy production of a mesophilic microorganism consortium in a batch reactor has been studied in the 16 e 50 C temperature range. The hydrogen batch dark fermentation resulted to only have a positive net production of energy over a minimal reactor dimension in summer conditions with an energy recovery strategy. The best working temperature resulted to be 20 C with 20 % of available energy. Hydrogen batch dark fermentation may be coupled with other processes to obtain a positive net energy by recovering energy from the end products of hydrogen dark fermentation. As an example, methane fermentation has been considered to energetically valorize the end products of hydrogen fermentation. The combined process resulted in a positive net energy over the whole range of tested reactor dimension with 45 e 90 % of available energy...|$|R
