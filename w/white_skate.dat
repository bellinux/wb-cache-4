50|$|Clew Bay {{itself is}} a sea angling centre hosting many sea fishing {{competitions}} each year and it {{is known as a}} venue for common skate fishing in the country and holds the Irish record for a 160 lb <b>white</b> <b>skate.</b> It is also considered one of the best venues for tope, huss and ray.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific <b>white</b> <b>skate</b> {{feeds on}} benthic fishes. Like other skates they are oviparous; the egg cases are olive green {{in color and}} {{longitudinally}} striated, with horn-like projections on the shell. The size at birth is about 25 cm; the maximum known size is 1.5 m. They are of no commercial interest but are occasionally taken as by-catch.|$|E
50|$|The {{bottlenose}} skate, spearnose skate, or <b>white</b> <b>skate,</b> Rostroraja alba, is {{a species}} of skate in the family Rajidae, and the sole member of its genus. It is a benthic fish native to the coastal eastern Atlantic Ocean. Due to overfishing, it has been depleted or extirpated {{in many parts of}} its former range in the northeastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, and is now endangered.|$|E
50|$|In {{the amateur}} draft, the Seals {{did not have}} a first-round pick. For their first pick, the fifteenth pick overall, in the second round, the Seals chose Ken Baird. At owner Charlie Finley's direction, the team adopted their infamous <b>white</b> <b>skates</b> this season, which were widely ridiculed.|$|R
50|$|Finley {{purchased}} the Oakland Seals of the National Hockey League in 1970, renaming the team California Golden Seals. Mimicking the A's, {{he changed the}} team colors to green and gold and had the Seals wear <b>white</b> <b>skates</b> instead of the traditional black skates, a move deeply unpopular with both players and fans.|$|R
5000|$|He began {{ice dancing}} {{when he was}} seven at his coach's advice, who hoped it would smooth out <b>White's</b> <b>skating.</b> He was partnered with Meryl Davis a year later, in 1997 or 1998, by Seth Chafetz.

5000|$|The Pacific <b>white</b> <b>skate</b> (Bathyraja spinosissima) is {{a species}} of skate, family Rajidae. It {{is one of the}} deepest-living of all skates, {{occurring}} at a depth of 800 to 2,938 m on the continental slope. It is native to the southeast Pacific Ocean from the Galapagos Islands to off Waldport, Oregon; an egg case and embryo has been collected from the Farallon Islands off San Francisco. Reports of it from the Sea of Okhotsk may represent a different species. Its species name, spinosissima, comes from the Latin spinosus meaning [...] "thorny", referring to its covering of dermal denticles.|$|E
50|$|The {{flattened}} {{pectoral fin}} disc of the Pacific <b>white</b> <b>skate</b> is slightly wider than long, with broadly rounded tips. The disc {{is covered with}} numerous small denticles above and below, giving it a shagreen-like texture. Adult males possess alar spines (on the dorsal surface of the pectoral fins near the tips). The tail is slightly longer than the disc, bearing a single median row of 23-29 thorns and two similar-sized dorsal fins near the end without an interdorsal thorn. The caudal fin is long and taperine, with a filamentous fold on its upper surface. Its teeth number 34 in the upper jaw and 23 in the lower. This species is a uniform pale to salty gray above and below, with dusky outer disc margins.|$|E
50|$|Following the season, New York {{real estate}} mogul Ralph Brent bought {{the team and}} renamed it the New York Golden Blades. While they managed to acquire Andre Lacroix from the Philadelphia Blazers, he was {{essentially}} all the franchise had going for it. The team replaced their original orange and blue uniforms with purple and gold uniforms of a unique design, and {{to coincide with the}} new identity, the team started the season wearing <b>white</b> <b>skates</b> with gold-colored blades.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} improved {{very little}} {{from the previous}} season; at times, the Golden Blades played before crowds of only 500 people (in an 18,000-seat arena). Sinking in debt, Brent surrendered the team to the league in late November, just twenty games into the season, with a 6-12-2 record. Veteran player Harry Howell, who had been recently {{picked up by the}} Golden Blades after being released from the Los Angeles Kings, was elevated to player-coach, and ordered the team's <b>white</b> <b>skates</b> painted black.|$|R
50|$|Bill Torrey {{began his}} hockey {{career in the}} AHL in the mid-1960s, with the Pittsburgh Hornets, but his talent soon landed him a job as Vice-President of the Oakland Seals, a {{recently}} created expansion team in the NHL. Torrey quickly forged {{a reputation as a}} shrewd executive, and his deals propelled the Seals from laughingstock to playoff contenders in his 2 plus seasons in Oakland. He quickly soured on the experience, however, due to constant interference provided by owner Charlie Finley. Finley had a reputation of flamboyance, insisting his teams wear <b>white</b> <b>skates</b> and trying to convince the NHL to start using orange pucks. More importantly, Finley and Torrey clashed on issues ranging from personnel moves to marketing, and Torrey left the organization in 1971.|$|R
50|$|At {{a police}} station in Niagara Falls, Ontario, new detective Jeffrey Cornwall is sitting down for a job {{interview}} with Nicole Dunlop {{who works in the}} Internet Child Exploitation Unit. He recoils in disgust after seeing the images related to open cases and Nicole tells him that these are the images he will have to see every day. Meanwhile, Niagara Falls resident Matthew Lane picks his nine-year-old daughter Cassandra up from the arena after her figure skating practice. He comments that her wearing one <b>white</b> <b>skate</b> and one black skate is an unnecessary gimmick given her skill. On the way back, Matthew stops to pick up pie, leaving Cassandra in the car. Minutes later he returns to find her missing and calls out to no success. He reports the abduction to the police station where Dunlop and Cornwall are assigned to the case. Cassandra's mother Tina Lane arrives and breaks down in a fit of fury directed at Matthew.|$|E
40|$|Skates (Rajidae) {{have been}} commercially {{exploited}} in Europe {{for hundreds of}} years with some species’ abundances declining dramatically during the twentieth century. In 2009 it became “prohibited for EU vessels to target, retain, tranship or land” certain species in some ICES areas, including the critically endangered common skate and the endangered <b>white</b> <b>skate.</b> To examine compliance with skate bans the official UK landings data for 2011 – 2014 were analysed. Surprisingly, it was found that after the ban prohibited species were still reported landed in UK ports, including 9. 6 t of common skate during 2011 – 2014. The majority of reported landings of common and <b>white</b> <b>skate</b> were from northern UK waters and landed into northern UK ports. Although past landings could not be validated as being actual prohibited species, the landings’ patterns found reflect known abundance distributions that suggest actual landings were made, rather than sporadic occurrence across ports that would be evident if landings were solely due to systematic misidentification or data entry errors. Nevertheless, misreporting and data entry errors could not be discounted as factors contributing to the recorded landings of prohibited species. These findings raise questions about the efficacy of current systems to police skate landings to ensure prohibited species remain protected. By identifying UK ports with the highest apparent landings of prohibited species and those still landing species grouped as'skates and rays’, these results may aid authorities in allocating limited resources more effectively to reduce landings, misreporting and data errors of prohibited species, and increase species-specific landing compliance...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the length distribution, sex ratio, length-weight relationship, age {{and growth of}} Rostroraja alba in the Gulf of Gabes. Methods: This study estimated age and growth of the <b>white</b> <b>skate,</b> Rostroraja alba by counting vertebral band pairs from 112 specimens taken by commercial fisheries during 2006 - 2009 from the Gulf of Gabes (Southern Tunisia, Central Mediterranean Sea). Results: This is {{the first and only}} known information in regards to the age and growth of this species in Tunisia. Vertebra diameter was strongly correlated with total length and age, which were expressed by linear or cubic regression equations. The oldest female in this study was 35 years and 160 cm, whereas the oldest male was 32 years and 150 cm. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were TL∞=(202. 26 ± 3. 40) cm, K=(0. 040 ± 0. 038) /year and t 0 =(1. 84 ± 0. 01) 10 - 1 /year for females and TL∞=(198. 60 ± 3. 61) cm, K=(0. 060 ± 0. 076) /year and t 0 =(1. 28 ± 0. 04) /year for males.

50|$|Performed {{during the}} latter half of the All Stars Tour and also used to win the 1990 World Professional Championships, this piece is very {{different}} from any other they performed. It was highly technical, physically demanding with a lot of high and drawn-out lifts, and visually very impressive. True to the style of the music, Revolution is extremely fast-paced and performed with an aggression that neither had displayed before. The movements express violence, dissent, anguish, and entrapment. The costumes were very sophisticated in style: Chris wore back trousers, white open-necked shirt, and a smart black and purple waistcoat, while Jayne wore black trousers and a voluminous white silk blouse. What was particularly unusual about Jayne’s costume was that she actually wore black skates to blend right in with her trousers. While Chris always wore skates the dominant colour of his costume, even when in trousers Jayne rarely did, consistently <b>skating</b> in <b>white</b> <b>skates</b> in nearly all routines.|$|R

40|$|Softnose skates (Rajiformes: Arhynchobatidae: Bathyraja Ishiyama) are {{the most}} diverse genus of skates, with 54 {{described}} species, and are readily distinguishable from their congeners by their relatively uncalcified and flexible rostral cartilages. Six species of Bathyraja are considered valid in the eastern North Pacific, including: deepsea skate, B. abyssicola, Aleutian skate, B. aleutica, sandpaper skate, B. kincaidii, fine-spined skate, B. microtrachys, Pacific <b>white</b> <b>skate,</b> B. spinosissima, and roughtail skate, B. trachura. As with other skate genera, the eastern North Pacific Bathyraja lacks a well-supported phylogeny, which leads to issues with setting catch limits and creating management plans. This study identifies and formally describes the softnose skates species in the eastern North Pacific based on morphometric and meristic measurements and includes an Alaskan species, Bering skate, B. interrupta due to its close morphological relationship to B. kincaidii. Multivariate tests determined that significant differences existed between the study species. Parsimonious phylogenetic trees showed that B kincaidii represents the basal condition, with B. abyssicola and B. aleutica being the most derived species in the study. The synonymized species B. interrupta and B. kincaidii were shown to be separate, as were the synonymized species B. microtrachys and B. trachura. An improved Bathyraja phylogeny will hopefully assist fisheries managers in developing conservation policies and easing the impacts of deepsea fishing expansion...|$|E
40|$|Catches of {{demersal}} fish from research vessel surveys in three {{areas around the}} British Isles from 1901 to 1907 were compared with survey catches in the same areas from 1989 to 1997. Mesh size and other characteristics of the trawls used suggested {{that some of these}} data were comparable, and could be used to describe changes in {{demersal fish}} assemblages over the last 80 years. In Start Bay (NW English Channel) and the Irish Sea, species diversity was the same in both periods, although the most abundant species in each period were not the same. In English coastal regions of the southern North Sea, fish populations became more diverse, as plaice Pleuronectes platessa and whiting Merlangius merlangus became less abundant, and the relative abundance of several non-target species such as dragonet Callionymus spp., bib Trisopterus luscus, and bull-rout Myoxocephalus scorpius increased. The proportion in the catch of small fish species (maximum body length 30 cm) in catches decreased in all regions during the time period, except in the Irish Sea where plaice replaced grey gurnard Eutrigla gurnardus as a dominant species. There was a decline in abundance of large sharks, skates and rays, including the common skate, Raja batis, <b>white</b> <b>skate</b> R. alba and the angel shark Squatina squatina. During historic surveys, 60 % of the elasmobranch fauna consisted of thornback ray Raja clavata, whereas in contemporary surveys the lesser spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula was the most abundant elasmobranch. Changes in length-frequency distribution of fish in both target and non-target categories, and other observed changes, were thought to be a response to commercial exploitation, and corresponded to similar observations recorded elsewhere.

5000|$|On October 15, 1970, {{with the}} new season already two games old, Finley {{announced}} that the team's name was being changed to California Golden Seals ("Bay Area Seals" [...] had been reported the previous week, and appears on some of that year's promotional material), following {{a number of other}} marketing gimmicks intended to sell the team to the fans, among them changing the Seals' colors to green and gold to match those of the popular A's. The team's uniform crest was now the word [...] "Seals" [...] in a unique typeface, but an alternate logo using a sketch based on a photo of star player Carol Vadnais was used on marketing materials such as pennants, stickers and team programs. The original 1967 California Seals logo recolored in green and gold was often seen on trading cards and other unofficial material, but was never adopted by the team. The Seals are remembered for wearing <b>white</b> <b>skates,</b> but initially Torrey convinced Finley to use green and gold painted skates instead, as team colored skates were a trend of the period. However, this was all for naught, as the Seals finished with the worst record in the NHL that year. On May 22, 1970, the Seals traded their pick {{in the first round of}} the 1971 NHL Amateur Draft to the Montreal Canadiens along with François Lacombe in return for Montreal's first round pick in the 1970 Draft (Seals selected Chris Oddleifson), Ernie Hicke, and cash. As a result of the Seals' dreadful season, the Canadiens had the top pick in the 1971 Draft, and used it to select future Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur. This transaction now ranks as one of the most one-sided deals in NHL history.|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ Learning {{new things}} is pleasant. Moreover, {{learning}} {{is crucial for}} our survival. In contrast to trees and plants, members of the animal kingdom, including us humans, can move freely in a constantly changing world. Therefore, all forms of animal life need the capacity to change their behavior in accordance with new environments. For instance, worms do remember the environment that predicts good food (Wen et al., 1997), and we humans easily remember {{where to find the}} best coffee machine at our work. The acquisition of this new behavior or knowledge is what we might call learning; the storage and retrieval of this behavior or knowledge is called memory. Our daily life experience is that our memory consists of an enormous heterogeneous collection. For instance, I know that Oliver Twist was written by Charles Dickens, that most readers of this dissertation will stop within a few sentences from here, that F. C. Ajax has beaten F. C. Barcelona with 2 - 0 in the 2013 / 2014 Champignons League group stage, etc. Each of these phrases beginning with “I know that…” can be classified as explicit memory. Explicit memory (also called declarative memory) includes memory for facts and events, which can be recalled consciously. In contrast, implicit memory (or non-declarative memory) covers all those cases in which a person or animal ‘knows how…’ to do something. I know how to swim, how to iceskate, but I do not have the capacity to fully explain it. The only way one can learn iceskating, is by simply doing it, by practicing it. Of course this subdivision in explicit and implicit memory is arbitrary and many, if not all, tasks involve both types of memory. For instance, when I learned ice-skating someone instructed me to bend a little more forward for keeping good balance - which was quite difficult w ith t hree pairs of socks in my mother’s <b>white</b> oversized ice <b>skates.</b> By applying this instruction in my actual skating, implicit and explicit knowledge are combined. But once more experienced, you just bend forward without even knowing that you do so. In general, explicit memory is easily acquired but also extinguishes very fast. How many history facts do we still know from the classes during high-school? In contrast, implicit memory is acquired slower and requires a lot of training and repetition. But, once learned, the memory is pretty solid compared to explicit memory. It always surprises me how easily you still can skate, even after years not doing it. One might therefore wonder if the two forms of memory are stored (i. e. ‘learned’) differently in the brain. Or, in other words, if the neuronal mechanisms underlying their formation and retrieval are different. This question of memory formation is not a new question. In Plato’s dialogue Theaetetus, which examines the question ‘What is knowledge?’, one of the characters argues that minds made out of soft wax are good at learning, but apt to forget, whereas those employing the hard wax are the reverse. Apart from the question whether we should interpret this statement literally or more poetically, we might call it one of the first neuroscientific learning theories. Explicitly, it tries to explain what happens in our brain when we are learning new things; it attempts to describe the neuronal mechanisms underlying memory formation. But, as philosophers do, it was all left it by pure speculation...|$|R
