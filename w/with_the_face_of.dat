5|$|Stela 21 {{is located}} inside the chamber {{at the top}} of StructureA-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber {{collapsed}} on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from his other hand hands a shield <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely illegible.|$|E

5|$|Stela 31 is the {{accession}} monument of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II, also bearing two {{portraits of}} his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin, {{as a youth}} dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior. He carries a spearthrower {{in one hand and}} bears a shield decorated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Tlaloc, the Teotihuacan war god. In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and ritually buried. Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at Tikal. A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument, the longest to survive from the Early Classic, which describes the arrival of Siyah K'ak' at El Peru and Tikal in January 378. It was also the first stela at Tikal to be carved on all four faces.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{form of the}} Maya stela incorporating art, calendrical dates and hieroglyphic text onto a royal monument only began to be erected in the Maya lowlands after 250 AD. The late 4th century saw the introduction of non-Maya imagery linked to the giant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. This foreign influence is seen at Tikal, Uaxactun, Río Azul and ElZapote, all in the Petén Department of Guatemala. At Tikal this was initiated by the king YaxNuunAyiinI, from there it spread to his vassal cities. In the 5th century, this strongly Teotihuacan-linked imagery was abandoned by YaxNuunAyiinI's son SiyajChanK'awiilII, who reintroduced imagery associated with the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands. Minor references to Teotihuacan continued, for example {{in the form of}} Teotihuacan war emblems. His Stela31 was originally erected in 445 but was later broken from its butt and was found buried in the city centre, almost directly above his tomb. It depicts the crowning of SiyajChanK'awiilII, with his father hovering above him as a supernatural being and is executed in traditional Maya style. On the sides of the stela are carved two portraits of his father in a non-Maya style, dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior, bearing the central Mexican atlatl spear-thrower not adopted by the Maya, and carrying a shield adorned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the Mexican god Tlaloc. The reverse of the stela bears a lengthy hieroglyphic inscription detailing the history of Tikal, including the Teotihuacan invasion that established Yax Nuun Ayiin I and his dynasty.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the lake, {{there are a number}} of large fountains. The Quixote Fountain is surrounded by four benches covered in tile with images of Don Quixote. To the side of this plaza, there are two columns. On the right there is a figure of Quixote <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Salvador Dalí and on the other side, there is a depiction of Sancho Panza <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Diego Rivera. Both statues were made of bronze by José María Fernández Urbina. The Fuente de las Ranas (Fountain of the Frogs) was created in the 1920s, by Miguel Alessio Robles in Seville, Spain. The Nezahualcoyotl Fountain was inaugurated in 1956. It measures 1,250m2 and surrounds a statue of the Aztec ruler nine meters tall in black stone.|$|E
25|$|A cut is a cross-batted shot {{played at}} a short-pitched ball, placing it wide on the off side. The batsman makes {{contact with the}} ball as it draws {{alongside}} or passes him and therefore requires virtually no effort on his part as he uses the bowler's pace to divert the ball. A square cut is a shot hit into the off side at near to 90 degrees from the wicket (towards point). A late cut is played as or after the ball passes the batsman's body and is hit towards third man. The cut shot is typically played off the back foot, but is also sometimes played off the front foot against slower bowling. The cut should be played <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the bat rolling over the ball to face the ground thus pushing the ball downwards. A mistimed cut with an open-faced bat (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the bat facing the bowler) will generally lead to the ball rising in the air, giving {{a chance for the}} batsman to be caught.|$|E

The wide strip window {{to the first floor}} terrace has two baby piloti to support and stiffen the wall above. Although these piloti are in a similar plane to the larger columns below a false perspective when viewed from outside the house gives the impression that they are further into the house than they actually are.|$|E

Before long, public panic comes as JGSDF-marked gunships attack in several bridges in Tokyo Bay, various communication centers and SV2 headquarters, coupled by the release of a supposed deadly gas after Special Assault Team snipers shoot down an auto-piloted blimp that was responsible for jamming all electronics in the Greater Tokyo Area.|$|E

500|$|A variant {{form of the}} legend, and {{the only}} one in which the pig-faced woman is not {{connected}} with a great fortune, told of a Christian man who converted to Judaism. In this version, the first child born to him after his conversion was a girl <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a pig. Some years later, the father realised that his daughter's appearance was a divine punishment, and re-converted to Christianity along with his pig-faced daughter. At the moment of the daughter's baptism, the holy water washed her pig-like features away, revealing a normal human face. The story was alleged to be represented by a sculpture in [...] "one of the grand old cathedrals of Belgium", but no evidence for such a sculpture has been found.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that William Elliot, a young baronet, called to visit a [...] "great lady" [...] at the house in Grosvenor Square in which the Pig-faced Lady {{was believed to be}} staying. Taken into the drawing room, he was confronted by a fashionably dressed woman <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a pig. Elliot [...] "could not refrain from uttering a shout of horror, and rushed to the door in a manner the reverse of polite". The Pig-faced Lady rushed at Elliot as he left and bit him {{on the back of the}} neck; it was claimed that he was badly injured in the attack, requiring treatment by eminent surgeon Sir Cæsar Hawkins. A popular print entitled Beware the pig-sty! depicted the supposed attack on Elliot.|$|E
500|$|Cruttwell's {{relations}} with his colleagues and {{students have been}} the subject of contradictory reports. [...] Waugh's biographer, Selena Hastings, describes him as of [...] "unprepossessing" [...] appearance, [...] "good-hearted but difficult", inclined to misogyny, brusque and sometimes offensive towards his male colleagues. Waugh's description is of someone [...] "tall, almost loutish, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a petulant baby", of indistinct speech, who [...] "smoked a pipe which was attached to his blubber-lips by a thread of slime". Stannard records that Waugh's student contemporary Christopher Hollis, found nothing particularly remarkable about Cruttwell. [...] "Like Waugh", says Stannard, [...] "Cruttwell played up his eccentricities and had an uncharitable sense of humour". Ellis's 2004 biographical sketch suggests that much of Cruttwell's rebarbative manner, may have been the result of simple shyness.|$|E

500|$|The first {{actor to}} be cast for Alien vs. Predator was Lance Henriksen, {{who played the}} {{character}} Bishop in Aliens and Alien 3. Although the Alien movies are set 150 years in the future, Anderson wanted to keep continuity with the series by including a familiar actor. Henriksen plays billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland, a character that ties in with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. According to Anderson, Weyland becomes known for {{the discovery of the}} pyramid, and as a result the Weyland-Yutani Corporation models the Bishop android in the Alien films after him; [...] "when the Bishop android is created in 150 years time, it's created <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the creator.

That year, he also {{starred in the}} dual roles of the villainous King Louis XIV and his secret, sympathetic twin brother Philippe in Randall Wallace's The Man in the Iron Mask, based on the same-titled 1939 film. Despite receiving a rather mixed to negative response, the film became a box office success, grossing US$180 million internationally. Though DiCaprio's performance was generally well-received, with Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman writing that [...] "the shockingly androgynous DiCaprio looks barely {{old enough to be}} playing anyone with hormones, but he's a fluid and instinctive actor, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a mischievous angel," [...] he was awarded a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple for both incarnations the following year.|$|E
500|$|Despite Homer's {{embodiment}} of American culture, his influence {{has spread to}} other parts of the world. In 2003, Matt Groening revealed that his father, after whom Homer was named, was Canadian, and said that this made Homer himself a Canadian. The character was later made an honorary citizen of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, because Homer Groening was believed to be from there, although sources say the senior Groening was actually born in the province of Saskatchewan. In 2007, an image of Homer was painted next to the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, England as part of a promotion for The Simpsons Movie. This caused outrage among local neopagans who performed [...] "rain magic" [...] to try to get it washed away. In 2008, a defaced Spanish euro coin was found in Avilés, Spain <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Homer replacing the effigy of King Juan Carlos I.|$|E
