A healing abutment {{passes through the}} mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it.

5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of {{the county}} is covered by the lowest/most local form of English local government, the civil parish, <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> town or parish council (a city council in the {{instance}} of Wells) or a parish meeting; some parishes group together, with a single council or meeting for the group.

5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E

5|$|The busway follows {{roughly the}} Torrens River valley, but with {{smoother}} curves. This {{means that it}} crosses the river quite often, <b>with</b> <b>either</b> <b>a</b> park or a few houses on a point surrounded by the river and busway. This occurs a total of eight times before the busway reaches Klemzig Interchange {{on the north side}} of the river. The busway crosses the river again soon after Klemzig and passes Lochiel Park and part of the suburbs of Campbelltown and Paradise to its north between the busway and the river before reaching Paradise Interchange.|$|E
