5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> the distance between the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E

5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to the differential gear, which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> ignited the oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy. The mission that ended in its destruction was its first mission.|$|E

5|$|By 6000 BC, {{the early}} {{inhabitants}} of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants, {{a process that}} {{eventually led to the}} establishment of sedentary agricultural societies. The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and squashes. All Mesoamerican cultures used Stone Age technology; after c. 1000 AD copper, silver and gold were worked. Mesoamerica lacked draft animals, did not use the <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.|$|E

When she sees more omens she begins to get off, but sees Julie {{entering}} the car and decides to stay. Wendy notices Kevin {{sitting in the back}} of the car. The train derails, and everyone aboard shortly dies; Julie is hit by a stray <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> Kevin is crushed between the train and the tunnel wall. Wendy survives the crash, but is hit by another train. This turns out to be another premonition, and they attempt to stop the train. The screen goes black, followed by the sound of screeching metal.|$|E
5|$|Making for the harbour mouth, the British ship's bow {{and stern}} {{alternately}} rose and plunged into the incoming waves; the propeller at times was spinning in air, requiring a careful hand on the throttle to keep the shaft from running away to destruction. Green seas were boarding the vessel and running {{the length of the}} deck. There were ten men on the <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> more below handling relieving tackle on the tiller to assist in maintaining control of the rudder. Taking two hours to travel four cables, the cruiser finally escaped the anchorage into the open sea, an achievement not known to Calliopes crew for some time, as sea spray and spume had reduced visibility to nothing.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day 1997, the Commission {{announced}} it would support the Link with £32 million of funding, 42% of the project cost.

5|$|The Sukhoi Su-33 (-33; NATO {{reporting}} name: Flanker-D) is an all-weather carrier-based twin-engine {{air superiority}} fighter designed by Sukhoi and manufactured by Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association, {{derived from the}} Su-27 and initially known as the Su-27K. Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure, folding wings and stabilators, all for carrier operations. The Su-33 has canards and its wings are larger than the Su-27 for increased lift. The Su-33 has upgraded engines and a twin nose <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> is air refuelable.|$|E
5|$|The bookwheel (also written book <b>wheel</b> <b>and</b> {{sometimes}} called a reading wheel) {{is a type}} of rotating bookcase designed to allow one person to read a variety of heavy books in one location with ease. The books are rotated vertically similar to the motion of a water wheel, as opposed to rotating on a flat table surface. The design for the bookwheel originally appeared in a 16th-century illustration by Agostino Ramelli, at a time when large books posed practical problems for readers. Ramelli's design influenced other engineers and, though now obsolete, inspires modern artists and historians.|$|E
50|$|Steam rollers, on {{the other}} hand, had smooth rear <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> a roller at the front. The roller {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} adjacent wide cylinders supported at both ends. This replaced the separate <b>wheels</b> <b>and</b> axle of a traction engine.|$|R

5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front <b>wheel,</b> <b>and</b> its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E
5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} version debuted on September 10, 1984, and {{was launched}} {{in response to the}} success of the syndicated version of <b>Wheel</b> <b>and</b> the installation of electronic trivia games in pubs and bars.
