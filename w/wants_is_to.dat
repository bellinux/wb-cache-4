Two months earlier, series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey revealed Jenna's plot to Entertainment Weekly, but did not divulged Franco's name. In an April 2010 interview with Zap2it, Carlock revealed that [...] "one of the things" [...] the staff looked forward to in the fourth season was Jenna's storyline here, and said her [...] "emotional realization" [...] that she wants more than a fake relationship with Franco was [...] "a cool turn for that character after three years of thinking that all she <b>wants</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have her picture in the paper and have her hair look good." ...|$|E
500|$|Anarky's {{introduction}} {{during the}} late 1980s {{was part of a}} larger shift among supervillains in the Batman franchise of the time. While many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned, and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership, some were introduced to challenge readers to [...] "question the whole bad/good guy divide." [...] Falling into [...] "the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast. In a review of the Anarky miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an [...] "anti-villain", as opposed to [...] "antihero", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: [...] "In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the Punisher, an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but what he really <b>wants</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> save the world... and maybe he's right." ...|$|E

500|$|Many of D'Angelo's peers {{have noted}} {{the success of the}} [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video as a {{contributing}} factor to his period of absence from the music scene and solo work, as well as his legal controversies and drinking issues following the tour. A columnist for SoulBounce.com has cited the video as the [...] "jump-the-shark moment" [...] for D'Angelo, and stated [...] "It was so provocative and polarizing that no one could recover from it, least of all him". Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson, who served as producer for Voodoo and musical director for [...] "The Voodoo Tour", discussed the music video's impact on D'Angelo in a 2003 interview with music journalist Touré, stating [...] "he <b>wants</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get fat. He doesn’t want his braider braiding every nook and cranny of his hair. He doesn’t wanna have to have ripples in his stomach. He doesn’t want the pressure of being 'Untitled' the video".

500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more. What Naz <b>wants</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be like everyone around her {{and to be able to}} pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness; she likes to get her own way.|$|E

Downton said by 1976 the vast majority of students viewed Rawat [...] "as their spiritual teacher, guide and inspiration". Quoting a student he had studied, Downton said a typical view was that [...] "the only thing he (Rawat) <b>wants</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> see people living happily and harmoniously together". Downton concluded that the students had changed in a positive way, [...] "more peaceful, loving, confident and appreciative of life".|$|E

2500|$|A rift {{develops}} and widens between Dan and Laura as they firmly {{disagree on}} the question of an implant. Dan's hearing parents favor the surgery because it would help them communicate better with their grandson, as they never learned much sign language, living far away. Laura's deaf parents are strongly opposed, especially her father, a fierce advocate of Deaf Pride and an author on the subject. Soon, the larger issues of Deaf Pride and the overall ethics of cochlear implants become the focus of the argument, as implants are viewed to have a potentially detrimental effect on Deaf culture. Laura's father, Max, says, [...] "The majority always thinks each minority wants to be like them", as he doesn't consider deafness to be a disability. Dan, who feels his father-in-law never accepted him, sees this attitude as deaf prejudice against him and all hearing people, when all Dan <b>wants</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> give his son a fuller life and a better future.|$|E
