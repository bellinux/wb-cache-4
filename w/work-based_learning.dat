The European Qualifications Framework calls for a shift towards learning outcomes in primary and secondary schools throughout the EU. Students are expected to learn skills that they will need when they complete their education. It also calls for lessons to have a stronger link to employment through <b>work-based</b> <b>learning.</b> <b>Work-based</b> <b>learning</b> for students should also lead to recognition of vocational training for these students.

40|$|Scotland and England {{now have}} systems of work-related higher {{education}} which differ {{from each other}} in important respects. While Scotland embarks on a process of modernising its existing system of Higher National Certificates and Diplomas, in England there has been a decisive shift away from this form of provision towards Foundation Degrees. Meanwhile, providers in both countries are being encouraged to engage ever more closely with employers. This article draws on empirical work with programme organisers to explore {{the nature and extent of}} <b>work-based</b> and work-related <b>learning</b> that can be found within these two systems. Despite the contrasting national structures, we identify considerable continuity between practices in the two countries and also considerable variability in the forms of <b>work-based</b> or work-related <b>learning</b> which can be found within each of them.

40|$|Much of the {{emphasis}} on the learning of subject leaders in secondary schools is placed on what Eraut (2000) terms 'organised formal learning events'. This article attempts to redress the balance by focusing on the somewhat neglected area of their informal learning about the role, which is predominantly based in the workplace. It is argued that informal learning consists of three components: implicit learning, learning through experience and non-taught or deliberative learning (following Eraut, 2004). Such forms of learning can be underpinned by theoretical notions of cognitive, affective and behavioural developments. A model of <b>work-based</b> informal <b>learning</b> is proposed that also tries to incorporate the memories of relevant past and current events. It is hoped that this model might be useful as a framework for the future analysis of the learning of subject leaders...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} that VET assessors have the confidence and capabilities to use their professional judgement in providing recognition of prior learning (RPL), to move beyond concerns with compliance and draw on their creativity. “Compliance to Creativity ” was a <b>work-based</b> action <b>learning</b> project conducted from April-September 2008 {{for a group of}} 14 leading assessors in Queensland. It was designed to assist experienced assessors to build professional judgement as part of their own practice and that of their colleagues, particularly in relation to RPL. The overall finding from that program is that it is possible for leading VET assessors – through a structured capability building program – to significantly increase their confidence and enhance their capabilities with regard to the conduct of RPL, as well as help their colleagues to increase their confidence and capabilities with regard to RPL. The research also provided insights into RPL practice and skills, mentoring and professional judgment...|$|R
40|$|The {{rhetoric of}} {{partnership}} is ubiquitous {{in the current}} policy context. In education, partnerships take a number of forms among which is ‘interorganizational collaboration’ (IOC), defined as a partnership between institutions/organizations aimed at developing synergistic solutions to complex problems. But policy {{has a tendency to}} veneer, obscuring its enactment. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to examine what such partnerships look like on the ground. Here we present an empirical analysis which aims to produce knowledge about the working of such collaborative groups and to provide insights into leadership within such partnerships. Drawing on communicative constitution of organizations (CCO) operationalised within a schema for understanding the emergence of collective identity in IOC, we undertake an analysis of meetings held by a working group comprising academics and local authority staff set up to develop masters level <b>work-based</b> professional <b>learning</b> for teachers. We ask, how do professionals working within different contexts create a collective identity that supports decision making, and what are the implications for leadership...|$|R
40|$|The {{rationale}} for the study is to enhance {{our understanding of how}} young people learn and engage with vocational subjects within the lower secondary years of compulsory education. The concept of pre-vocational education has recently emerged to describe the initial transitional phase of preparing young people for employment in specific occupational areas in the UK. Although there has been extensive research undertaken in <b>work-based</b> apprenticeship <b>learning,</b> very little research has emerged in pre-vocational education among 14 - 16 year olds in schools. The research undertakes such an enquiry based upon a case study of North Lanarkshire secondary schools. This local authority has been selected as it {{has one of the highest}} rates of young people participating in pre-vocational education in secondary education and has been identified by a recent OECD report as a potential exemplar of best practice in this field. However, concerns remain regarding how to integrate the pre-vocational curriculum with the academic curriculum, whether pre-vocational courses can engage high achievers and, more specifically, how effectively the subject is taught within schools...|$|R

40|$|Simulation {{offers an}} {{important}} context for clinical education, providing a structured, safe and supportive environment bridging {{the classroom and}} the clinic. Two trends in the simulation community appear to be developing uncritically and without adequate evaluation. First, there is a fascination with seductive high-fidelity simulation realized through sophisticated technology. Second, simulation has increasingly appropriated learning in the psychological domain, such as communication skills, under the rationale of 'integration'. Developments in simulation activities have largely been made in a theoretical vacuum and where theory is invoked it is learning theory rather than theory of simulation. This paper introduces theories of simulation from cultural studies as a critical balance to {{the claims of the}} simulation community. <b>Work-based</b> and simulation-based <b>learning</b> could engage in a new dialogue for an effective clinical education...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} on-line learning, role-play and reflection within a <b>work-based</b> professional <b>learning</b> course for Further Education (FE) lecturers at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland and discusses whether knowledge, both tacit and explicit, is transferred among group participants, encouraging professional insight into the issues discussed. The activity forms part of a programme entitled “The Teaching Qualification Further Education ” (TQFE) which is designed for lecturers wishing to re-skill or bring their knowledge bases and practices up-to-date. The students undertake a tripartite arrangement involving themselves, {{the university and the}} workplace. We examine the results of an investigation into the experience of both learners and tutors on an on-line workshop involving an anonymous, synchronous role-play activity and continuous reflection on current thoughts and beliefs in respect of quality in education. Feedback was gathered via on-line comments, semi-structured telephone and face-to-face interviews, and on-line questionnaires. In total, sixty-six lecturers from four colleges, together with four e-moderators took part. The results show that participants begin their studies with pre-conceived notions of both the issue to be discussed and of on-line learning environments in general but by sharing information and knowledge, attitudes to both the topic area and the learning environment can be altered. This includes the transfer of both tacit and explicit knowledge from participants from different subject areas. The examination also revealed issues relating to the potential for inequality and over dominance of individual participation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to {{investigate}} the development of reflective capacity during <b>work-based</b> placement <b>learning</b> and its relationship to student final-year academic performance. Its objectives were to enquire into: 1. 	the nature of the reflective capacity brought by business studies and accounting undergraduates to their work-based placement or their final-year studies 2. 	the elements within the work-based placement that support, encourage or inhibit the development of a reflective capacity 3. 	how the reflective capacity brought by undergraduates from their work-based placement is related to their academic performance in their final year of undergraduate study. The project comprised two strands of research. The first strand evaluated a questionnaire for reflective thinking (QRT) designed to quantitatively measure aspects and extent of reflective thinking (Kember et al., 2000). This relates to research objectives (1) and (3) above. The questionnaire was administered to a cohort of students (n= 260) {{at the beginning and end}} of their work-based placement, and to a cohort of final-year students (n= 800) at the beginning and end of the academic year. The second strand of research involved an enquiry into the nature of students’ reflective capacity, using interviews to explore their ways of knowing and their experiences during their work-based placement. This relates to research objectives (1), (2) and (3) above. Interviews were conducted with placement students (n= 11) at the commencement and in the latter stages of their work-based placements, and with final-year students (n= 6) who had previously completed a placement...|$|R
