5|$|The {{launch of}} the first <b>weather</b> <b>satellite,</b> TIROS-I, in 1960, {{introduced}} new forecasting techniques that remain important to tropical cyclone forecasting to the present. In the 1970s, buoys were introduced to improve the resolution of surface measurements, which until that point, were not available at all over sea surfaces.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} {{afternoon}} hours, forecasters at both the SPC and the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Norman, Oklahoma, realized that a major event was likely to take place based solely on observational data from radar and <b>weather</b> <b>satellite</b> imagery and balloon soundings, as the computer models remained uncooperative in helping meteorologists determine where the greatest threat of severe storms would occur.|$|E
5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of a wake depression. The most direct is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of mesoscale networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On <b>weather</b> <b>satellite</b> and weather radar imagery, wake lows and heat bursts normally occur on the rear side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity data from a WSR-88D doppler radar, high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low.|$|E

5|$|WFO Boise {{operates}} 24 hours a day, 365 days a {{year and}} provides weather forecasts, warnings, aviation forecast and local statements for Southeast Oregon and Southwest Idaho. There is one WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar upgraded to dual polarization on August 30, 2012 improving the accuracy and identification of precipitation types and precipitation estimates. The office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS II) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of <b>weather,</b> <b>satellite,</b> and computer model data by forecasters. The office also maintains eight Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) around the area. NWS Boise employs 18 meteorologist of which two are dedicated Fire Weather Forecasters and Incident Meteorologists and one hydrologist. There are also 7 support staff member that provide technical, administrative and IT support.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two days, however, the system became much more organized. Early on August21, the National Hurricane Center had {{initiated}} advisories on Tropical Depression Eight-E. After the existence of banding features was noted, the intensity was increased to 40mph (65km/h), indicating that the system had intensified into a tropical storm, which was named Fausto by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Although no further strengthening initially occurred, Fausto began to intensify after a burst in convection early on August22. Rapid deepening began to occur thereafter, and the NHC noted that Fausto exhibited a classic-type banding feature and {{also noted that the}} outflow was increasing. The large size and widespread convection closely resembled a system that would become a major hurricane, Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. The associated banding features began to wrap completely around the system, and evidence of a developing eye was seen via <b>weather</b> <b>satellite.</b> Simultaneously, satellite estimates made via the Dvorak technique indicated that intensity of Fausto was 75mph (120km/h), and as a result, the NHC upgraded it to a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A {{dispatch}} {{from the}} Associated Press to Mexico City reported that 20,000 citizens from villages in Durango, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco evacuated {{due to the}} threat of flooding and high winds from Naomi. The damage from Naomi in Mexico was moderate, although no monetary figures have ever been released. The Associated Press dispatch also reported that Naomi was responsible for knocking out communications over a large area in Mazatlán as well as downing power lines and damaging houses. At least 2000 people were reported homeless in Durango due to the hurricane. The hurricane also caused damage to Highway 15 between Mazatlán and Tepic. Although the highway reopened soon afterward, some areas that were struck by the hurricane were still rough. Naomi's most notable impact in Mexico involved the Lázaro Cárdenas Dam on the Nazas River, which was not complete by the time the hurricane hit. The dam, upriver from Gómez Palacio and Torreón, was feared to break down from the water being built up behind it, influenced by the hurricane. The two options were to either open the dam, saving Torreón by inundating Gómez Palacio, or risk inundating both towns by keeping the dam closed. The decision was made harder by the fact that, if the dam was released and no rain fell to refill the basin behind the dam, the farms would have insufficient water for agricultural growth. Photography from the Environmental Science Services Administration's Automatic Picture Transmission based on the ESSA-6 <b>weather</b> <b>satellite</b> showed that the clouds from Naomi responsible for the rain had almost moved over the area near the dam. Based on the images, the authorities decided to gamble on the dam to successfully hold up, and it managed to hold back the waters without breaking. The hurricane caused four drowning deaths and $16 million in damage in Sinaloa.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of <b>weather,</b> <b>satellite,</b> and computer model data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook, river forecast products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and dense fog. There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation {{of his or her own}} sector. Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks, coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters.|$|E

25|$|William Herschel, {{previously}} a clarinet player, of Bath discovered {{infrared radiation}} on 11 February 1800, {{and the planet}} Uranus in March 1781; he had made important improvements to the reflecting telescope by increasing the mirror diameter. Herschel then built a 20-ft reflecting telescope and invented the star count, working out that the Milky Way was a disc, which he called a grindstone, and the Milky Way was a galaxy but that {{that was all the}} universe contained; he had noticed other nebulas but did not recognise what these were; only when the Hooker telescope was built sufficiently large-enough in California in 1924, did Edwin Hubble realise that these nebulas (Andromeda Galaxy) were other galaxies. The Herschel Space Observatory was launched by ESA in March 2009 to map the Milky Way. Sir Arthur C. Clarke of Minehead invented the idea of artificial satellites; he sent a letter to Harry Wexler who then developed the first <b>weather</b> <b>satellite</b> TIROS-1. Sir Arthur Eddington of Weston-super-Mare was the first to realise that nuclear fusion powered the Sun; previously the age of Sun was thought to be only 20 million years old, which he knew had to be older than that; at the 1920 British Association meeting he said that the Sun converted hydrogen into helium, but he did not know how, and that mass was lost; nuclear fission was only considered in 1933. James Bradley was an important astronomer from Gloucestershire, who discovered the aberration of light.|$|E

500|$|Outflow, in meteorology, is {{air that}} flows {{outwards}} from a storm system. [...] It {{is associated with}} ridging, or anticyclonic flow. [...] In the low levels of the troposphere, outflow radiates from thunderstorms {{in the form of}} a wedge of rain-cooled air, which is visible as a thin rope-like cloud on <b>weather</b> <b>satellite</b> imagery or a fine line on weather radar imagery. [...] Low-level outflow boundaries can disrupt the center of small tropical cyclones. [...] However, outflow aloft is essential for the strengthening of a tropical cyclone. [...] If this outflow is undercut, the tropical cyclone weakens. [...] If two tropical cyclones are in proximity, the upper level outflow from the system to the west can limit the development of the system to the east.|$|E
500|$|The RMW is {{traditionally}} measured by reconnaissance {{aircraft in the}} Atlantic basin.

[...] Using <b>weather</b> <b>satellite</b> data, the distance between the coldest cloud top temperature and the warmest temperatature within the eye, in infrared satellite imagery, is one method of determining RMW. [...] The reason why this method has merit is that the strongest winds within tropical cyclones tend to be located under the deepest convection, which is seen on satellite imagery as the coldest cloud tops. [...] Use of velocity data from Doppler weather radar {{can also be used to}} determine this quantity, both for tornadoes and tropical cyclones near the coast.|$|E
500|$|During mid-June1985, {{the monsoon}} trough in the Western Pacific retreated eastward to near Guam, {{spawning}} several areas of low pressure. At 00:00UTC on June17, a tropical disturbance embedded within the monsoon trough {{was detected by}} meteorologists on <b>weather</b> <b>satellite</b> imagery about [...] southwest of the island of Ponape. Although the disturbance's surface circulation was initially ill-defined, interaction with an upper-level low (ULL) to the southeast of Guam associated with a broader tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) enhanced development and thus the low was slow to develop. Moving west-northwest south of a ridge, the disturbance passed [...] south-southeast of the Truk Atoll early on June18. Following an increase of thunderstorm activity associated with the disturbance in both coverage and organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system at noon the same day.|$|E
