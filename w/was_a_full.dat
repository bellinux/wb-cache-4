5|$|That evening, the {{witnesses}} gathered {{to discuss what}} was to be done. United States laws were not applicable west of the Continental Divide (in what was then Mexican territory) and wagon trains often dispensed their own justice. But George Donner, the party's leader, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> day ahead of the main wagon train with his family. Snyder had been seen to hit James Reed, and some claimed that he had also hit Margret Reed, but Snyder had been popular and Reed was not. Keseberg suggested that Reed should be hanged, but an eventual compromise allowed Reed to leave the camp without his family, who were {{to be taken care of}} by the others. Reed departed alone the next morning, unarmed, but his daughter Virginia rode ahead and secretly provided him with a rifle and food.|$|E
5|$|With the {{retirement}} of Hassett following the 1953 England tour, the Australian captaincy was open for competition. No international cricket was scheduled until 1954–55, so there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> domestic season in 1953–54 for players to stake their claims. Morris started strongly with consecutive centuries against Queensland and South Australia, {{but was unable to}} maintain his form, passing fifty only twice in his remaining eight innings. He ended with 487 runs at 54.11 as New South Wales won the Sheffield Shield under Miller's leadership. Nevertheless, the Australian selectors indicated that they were considering Morris as a captaincy option by making him captain of Morris' XI, which played Hassett's XI in a testimonial match. Morris' XI won by 121 runs.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen's next tournament was the Pearl Spring chess tournament on 19–30 October in Nanjing, China, against Anand, Topalov, Vugar Gashimov, Wang Yue, and Étienne Bacrot. This was {{the only}} tournament in 2010 to feature Anand, Carlsen and Topalov, {{at the time the}} top three players in the world, and was the first tournament in history to feature three players rated at least 2800. With early wins over Bacrot, Wang Yue, and Topalov with white, Carlsen took the early lead, {{extending}} his winning streak with white in Nanjing to eight. This streak was halted by a draw to Anand in round seven, but in the penultimate round Carlsen secured first place by defeating Topalov with black. This was his second victory in the tournament over the former world No. 1; his final score of 7/10 (with a PR of 2903) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> point ahead of runner-up Anand.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea's biggest winning {{scoreline}} in {{a competitive}} match is 13–0, achieved against Jeunesse Hautcharage in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971. The club's biggest top-flight win was an 8–0 victory against Wigan Athletic in 2010, which was matched in 2012 against Aston Villa. Chelsea's biggest loss was an 8–1 reverse against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1953. Officially, Chelsea's highest home attendance is 82,905 for a First Division match against Arsenal on 12 October 1935. However, an estimated crowd of over 100,000 attended a friendly match against Soviet team Dynamo Moscow on 13 November 1945. The modernisation of Stamford Bridge during the 1990s {{and the introduction of}} all-seater stands mean that neither record will be broken for the foreseeable future. The current legal capacity of Stamford Bridge is 41,663. Every starting player in Chelsea's 57 games of the 2013–14 season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> international – a new club record.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> {{reading of}} the one-act version of the play. Despite an {{unfinished}} script and a performance by amateur actors, it evoked a strong response from the audience. Later that year, Stephen Waldschmidt, an artistic associate of Burnt Thicket Theatre, asked to read the script of She Has a Name, and later {{said he could not}} put it down. He was initially reluctant to attach himself to the play because of the immensity and ugliness of the issues therein, but he ultimately worked with Kooman to expand it into a full-length play with an extra hour of material by the end of 2010. The result is a play that can be performed in 90 minutes but may last up to two hours. Burnt Thicket Theatre served as the play's initial production company.|$|E

5|$|Smith also {{purchased}} and raced Thoroughbred horses {{under the name}} Pleasant Valley Stable. His racing colors during the early 1890s were royal-purple and canary yellow. Smith's brother, Bill, became his principal horse trainer during the 1890s and early 1900s. One of his most successful horses was a two-year-old bay colt named King Cadmus. Smith purchased King Cadmus as a yearling in 1890 for $4,000 at the stable dispersal sale of the late August Belmont. The colt was a son of Kingfisher and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> brother to another popular racehorse named King Crab. The horse only won two races in his entire racing career, but Smith won $195,000 from Cadmus' two victories. The first win occurred on September 3, 1891 at Sheepshead Bay Race Track and resulted in Smith winning approximately $115,000, which was the largest payout from a horse race recorded in the US at that time. Cadmus' other win occurred at Morris Park Racetrack in 1892 with Smith netting another $80,000. King Cadmus was a fast runner {{but he had a}} vicious temperament, seriously injuring several of Smith's employees, in addition to weak legs and was sold as a three-year-old in 1892.|$|E
5|$|The fifth contest <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Full</b> Metal Mayhem {{match for}} a future match on Impact! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables {{side-by-side}} and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table {{at the top of}} the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, he flipped over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the envelope to win the match.|$|E

5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a mansard roof with steeply pitched gabled dormers. Projecting from the roofline are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with finial work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of lintel designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different than it does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns. The square projecting porch bay {{was connected to the}} ground via 12 stone stairs. In the southeast corner of the house <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> three-story projecting tower set at a 45° angle {{to the rest of the}} front facade.|$|E
5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E
