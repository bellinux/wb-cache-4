25|$|Critical {{comments}} on these speculations appeared early on. But as psychiatric historian Jan Armbruster (University of Greifswald) judged, {{they were not}} sufficiently convincing, {{such as in the}} case of journalist Ottmar Katz, author of a biography of Hitler's personal physician, Theodor Morell (1982). Katz suggested that Karl Kroner might have had personal reasons to report some untruths: living as a Jewish refugee in Reykjavik and forced to earn his life as a blue-collar worker, Kroner possibly hoped that the U.S. authorities would not only acknowledge him as a key witness but also help him to reestablish his medical practice. A comprehensive plausibility test was finally performed by the Berlin psychiatrist and psychotherapist Peter Theiss-Abendroth in 2008. In 2009, Armbruster carried this analysis forward, dismantled the hypotheses of Hitler’s hysteria diagnosis and hypnotherapy completely, and showed in detail how the story of Hitler’s alleged treatment by Forster became progressively elaborate and detailed between 1943 and 2006, not due to the evaluation of historical documents, but to continuous addition of narrative embellishments. Furthermore, Armbruster’s <b>work</b> <b>offers</b> the to date most comprehensive critique of the methodological weaknesses of many Hitler pathographies.|$|E
500|$|Opus Dei {{was founded}} by a Catholic priest, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, on 2 October 1928 in Madrid, Spain. According to Escrivá, on that day he {{experienced}} a vision in which he [...] "saw Opus Dei". He gave the organization the name [...] "Opus Dei", which in Latin means [...] "Work of God", in order to underscore {{the belief that the}} organization was not his (Escrivá's) work, but was rather God's work. Throughout his life, Escrivá held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character. Escrivá summarized Opus Dei's mission as a way of helping ordinary Christians [...] "to understand that their life... is a way of holiness and evangelization... And to those who grasp this ideal of holiness, the <b>Work</b> <b>offers</b> the spiritual assistance and training they need to put it into practice." ...|$|E
500|$|Terry-Thomas {{undertook}} {{his final}} film role in 1980 in Febbre a 40!, a German–Italian co-production that was [...] "nondescript and barely screened", according to Robert Ross, {{and did not}} even have a theatrical release in its two domestic markets. He continued {{his involvement in the}} film industry, where he funded three films during the early 1980s (noted by Ross to be [...] "destined from the outset for B-picture status or straight-to-video exposure"); he commented that [...] "I have made a loss of one hundred per cent". In 1982, with his condition worsening, Terry-Thomas featured in two episodes of the BBC series The Human Brain, which examined his condition; his frank interview brought much public awareness of the disease and raised £32,000 for the Parkinson's Disease Society. Privately, he was becoming more depressed; his London flat had been sold to provide badly-needed funds, and his <b>work</b> <b>offers</b> were decreasing.|$|E

500|$|The work is {{considered}} the most authoritative guide on filmmaking in North Korea. However, the real extent of its influence is doubted. According to Johannes Schönherr, the <b>work</b> <b>offers</b> little new to North Korean cinema, {{and many of the}} ideas presented are unoriginal and obvious, particularly to the specialist audience of professional filmmakers Kim is writing for. Films from before and after the publication of the treatise are remarkably similar, suggesting that it had little impact on North Korean film industry in practice. Many traits of contemporary North Korean cinema, such as repetitiveness, slow editing style and old theatrical acting, go against the teachings of On the Art of the Cinema. Whatever change there was in North Korean cinema, can be attributed to political and economic pressures. Instead of contributing anything new, the work reformulates Kim Il-sung's ideas about the importance of film to art and as a propaganda tool. Rather than the theoretical breakthrough it is taught as, it is an account of Kim Jong-il's personal experiences in the film industry and an attempt to thwart the [...] "sloppiness and thoughtlessness" [...] he had encountered.|$|E
500|$|On Boxing Day 1781, Grimaldi {{took the}} part of Little Clown in the {{pantomime}} The Triumph of Mirth; or, Harlequin's Wedding at Drury Lane. It was a success for him personally, and the pantomime enjoyed an extended run until March 1782. [...] As {{a result of his}} performance, he received further <b>work</b> <b>offers</b> from the management and became an established juvenile performer at Drury Lane. At the same time, he was a prolific performer at Sadler's Wells where he played a host of minor roles, including monkeys, imps, fairies and demons. The Drury Lane season ran every year from September to late spring, with Sadler's Wells playing from 15 April to the second week in October. Though the two theatres staged similar productions, they appealed to different audiences: Drury Lane to the wealthy classes of society and Sadler's Wells to the boisterous working class. Although Grimaldi's stage career was flourishing, Giuseppe enrolled him at Mr Ford's Academy, a boarding school in Putney, which educated the children of theatrical performers. Although Grimaldi struggled with reading and writing, he showed a talent for art, as evidenced by some of his drawings that survive in the Harvard Theatre Collection.|$|E

2500|$|Haiti {{has always}} been a {{literary}} nation that has produced poetry, novels, and plays of international recognition. The French colonial experience established the French language as the venue of culture and prestige, and since then it has dominated the literary circles and the literary production. However, since the eighteenth century there has been a sustained effort to write in Haitian Creole. The recognition of Creole as an official language has led to an expansion of novels, poems, and plays in Creole. In 1975, [...] Franketienne was the first to break with the French tradition in fiction with the publication of Dezafi, the first novel written entirely in Haitian Creole. The <b>work</b> <b>offers</b> a poetic picture of Haitian life.|$|E

2500|$|She {{returned}} to Milan after her contract in Messina had expired, to resume her instruction by Lamperti. Additional <b>work</b> <b>offers</b> began to pour in. She soon accepted {{the role of}} Gilda in Rigoletto, performing it in Cento. Further roles followed in Florence and Malta, with parts in La sonnambula, Lucia di Lammermoor, Robert le diable, The Barber of Seville and L'Africaine. [...] After spending the winter of 1870–1871 performing in Malta, she auditioned for Frederick Gye, the manager of Covent Garden in London. He was impressed by her talent and signed her to a five-year contract. She was scheduled to make her London debut {{in the spring of}} 1872. Before her London contract began, she {{returned to}} Italy to study with Lamperti at Lake Como, and then appeared at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence, giving one last series of nine performances in ten days in the title role of Ambroise Thomas's Mignon, a part she studied with the composer in Paris prior to her making her debut in the role.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{philosophical}} {{work was}} influenced by Simone Weil (from whom she borrows the concept of 'attention'), and by Plato, under whose banner she claimed to fight. In re-animating Plato, she gives force {{to the reality of}} the Good, and to a sense of the moral life as a pilgrimage from illusion to reality. [...] From this perspective, Murdoch's <b>work</b> <b>offers</b> perceptive criticism of Kant, Sartre and Wittgenstein ('early' and 'late'). [...] Her most central parable, which appears in The Sovereignty of Good, asks us (in Nussbaum's succinct account), [...] "to imagine a mother-in-law, M, who has contempt for D, her daughter-in-law. M sees D as common, cheap, low. Since M is a self-controlled Englishwoman, she behaves (so Murdoch stipulates) with perfect graciousness all the while, and no hint of her real view surfaces in her acts. But she realizes, too, that her feelings and thoughts are unworthy, and likely to be generated by jealousy and an excessively keen desire to hang on to her son. So she sets herself a moral task: she will change her view of D, making it more accurate, less marred by selfishness. She gives herself exercises in vision: where she is inclined to say 'coarse,' she will say, and see, 'spontaneous.' Where she is inclined to say 'common,' she will say, and see, 'fresh and naive.' As time goes on, the new images supplant the old. Eventually M does not have to make such an effort to control her actions: they flow naturally from the way she has come to see D." [...] This is how M cultivates a pattern of behavior that leads her to view D [...] "justly or lovingly". [...] The parable is partly meant to show (against Oxford contemporaries including R. M. Hare and Stuart Hampshire) the importance of the 'inner' life to moral action. [...] Seeing another aright can depend on overcoming jealousy, and discoveries about the world involve inner work.|$|E
