5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been her face.|$|E
5|$|While the Mamluks were {{in power}} from the 13th century to the 16th century, the area of Fustat {{was used as a}} rubbish dump, though it still {{maintained}} a population of thousands, with the primary crafts being those of pottery and trash-collecting. The layers of garbage accumulated over hundreds of years, and gradually the population decreased, leaving <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been a thriving city as an effective wasteland.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} been reintroduced to the gorge. White-tailed deer were {{imported}} from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been a thriving population. The current population of deer in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced beginning in 1906, after the lumberman had {{moved out of the}} area. The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite the fears of anglers, their diet is only 5percent trout.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} Playford's tenure, the LCL {{had brought}} younger, more {{progressive}} members into its ranks. The Hall Government continued many of the social reforms that the Walsh/Dunstan governments had initiated; most of these at the instigation of Hall or his Attorney-General, Robin Millhouse. Abortion was partially legalised, and planning for the Festival Centre began. The conservative and rural factions of the League, notably in the Legislative Council dominated by the landed gentry, were bitterly opposed to some reforms, and more than once Hall was forced to rely on Labor support to see bills passed. The LCL began to break apart; <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been a united party was now factionalised—four distinct groups {{across the political spectrum}} appeared within the party. The economy of South Australia began to pick up under Hall, returning to full employment. During the term in opposition, Des Corcoran became Dunstan's deputy, and the pair worked together well despite any rift that may have been caused by the struggle to succeed Walsh.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of the newer wealth and its tastes on design and living was still felt along the Hudson most in the changed approach to the pleasure grounds around the estates. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been used for gardening and ornamental farms was now used for recreation, {{and some of the}} earliest golf courses, tennis courts and country clubs were built on the country seats.|$|E
25|$|In June 1929, the Copiaus {{formed a}} new troupe, La Compagnie des Quinze, led by Michel Saint-Denis. They {{returned}} to Paris where they performed Noé ("Noah"), a play by André Obey, {{under the direction}} of Michel St-Denis. From this point on, Copeau's direct influence over <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been the École du Vieux-Colombier ended, although his influence on a personal level would remain strong.|$|E
25|$|<b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> {{been seen}} as the {{backbone}} of the Navy's future surface fleet with a planned production run of 32, has since been replaced by destroyer production reverting to the Arleigh Burke-class after ordering three Zumwalts. In April 2016, the U.S. Naval Institute stated the total cost of the three Zumwalt ships is about $22.5 billion with research and development costs, which is an average of $7.5 billion per ship.|$|E

25|$|The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki {{was founded}} in 1925 during the premiership of Alexandros Papanastassiou and was legislated under Law 3341/14-6-25. It was the second Greek {{university}} to be founded after the University of Athens, which was established in 1837.

25|$|As {{in other}} major American {{cities in the}} postwar era, {{construction}} of an extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used electric streetcar line {{along the length of}} Woodward Avenue was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds.|$|E
25|$|In the 11th century, the Normans {{occupied}} the Lombard and Byzantine possessions in Southern Italy, ending the six century old presence of both {{powers in the}} peninsula. The independent city-states were also subdued. During the same century, the Normans also ended Muslim rule in Sicily. Norman rule in <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been Byzantine territory naturally angered Byzantium, which in 1155 made a last attempt under the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos to reassert its authority in Southern Italy. But the attempt failed, and in 1158 the Byzantines left Italy.|$|E
50|$|The renowned Spanish defences {{were not}} <b>what</b> they <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been, and Pointis conquered both fortresses which defended Cartagena {{relatively}} easily, losing only sixty men.

25|$|The {{foundation}} of Northwestern University is traceable {{to a meeting}} on May 31, 1850 of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been known as the Northwest Territory. On January 28, 1851, the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North-Western University, making it the first chartered university in Illinois. The school's nine founders, {{all of whom were}} Methodists (three of them ministers), knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting. Although they affiliated the university with the Methodist Episcopal Church, they were committed to non-sectarian admissions, believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory.|$|E
25|$|On 31 December 1831 Robinson and {{his group}} of about 14 black envoys {{negotiated}} the surrender of 28 members of the Mairremmener people, an amalgam of Oyster Bay and Big River tribes. The tiny group of 16 men, nine women and a child, led by Tongerlongter and Montpeliater, was {{all that remained of}} <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been one of the island's most powerful clans and much of Hobart Town's population lined the streets as Robinson walked with them through the main street towards Government House. They were sent to the Wybalenna settlement on Flinders Island, joining another 40 Aboriginal people who had previously been captured, although another 20 interned on the island had earlier died. By late May many more, including Kickerterpoller and Umarrah, had also contracted influenza and died.|$|E
25|$|The Fort Belknap Indian Reservation {{was created}} in 1888 in Montana. It was created from <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been a much larger area of land to be set aside for tribes. The 1888 {{agreement}} neglected to mention any water rights that were reserved for the reservation {{in relation to the}} Milk River. Soon there came a huge demand for water by non-Indian settlers which was an issue for the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation. As non-Indian settlers began moving closer to the Fort Belknap Reservation, the settlers claimed rights to the water. The settlers did things such as build dams and reservoirs which prevented the reservation from receiving water needed for agricultural purposes. The settlers used the terms of the Appropriative water system to support their actions claiming that they had appropriated the water before the American Indians living on the reservation had put the water to beneficial use.|$|E
50|$|By 2009, however, Hizb-e Wahdat was so {{fragmented}} and divided {{that the political}} weight it carried in the country bore little resemblance to <b>what</b> it <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been.

25|$|In Brunei Sultanate, {{many of the}} Muslim {{subjects}} of the Sultan were converts from local Dayak groups. Acculturation had also taken place in Sarawak and Northern Borneo (modern day Sabah), where Brunei Sultanate and by the 18th century the Sulu Sultanate were collecting products for China and other markets, and establishing a fairly loose, river based governmental presence. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Brunei hierarchy, being given Malay titles such as Datuk, Temenggong and Orang Kaya. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been independent villages were gradually built into wider units, and their leaders co-opted into {{the hierarchy of the}} polity. A colonial writing about Sarawak, observed that many non-Malays would be amazed to learn {{the degree to which the}} present Malay population derives from the local native sources, and among the latter are Sea (Iban) and Land Dayaks (Bidayuh). In northeastern Borneo, the Bulungan Malays appear to be of Kayan origin. Further down the east coast, the Paser polity had extended its influence into the Barito-speaking Dayak, and some of these people became Muslim and were eventually referred to as 'Paser Malays'. In southern Borneo, the Malay-speaking Sultanate of Banjar had been pushing inland since the 17th century, bringing Dayaks into its Muslim culture. In the west, the development of such sultanates of Sambas, Sukadana and Landak tells a similar tale of recruitment among Dayak people.|$|E
25|$|With the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, along the intracity frontier, Potsdamer Platz now found itself physically divided in two. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been a busy intersection had become totally desolate. With the clearance of most of the remaining bomb-damaged buildings on both sides (on the eastern side, this was done chiefly to give border guards a clear view of would-be escapees and an uninterrupted line of fire), little was left in an area of dozens of hectares. Further demolitions occurred up until 1976 when the Haus Vaterland finally disappeared. After that, only two buildings in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz still stood– one complete, the other in a half-ruined fragmented form: the Weinhaus Huth's steel skeleton had enabled the building to withstand the pounding of World War II virtually undamaged, and it stood out starkly amid a great levelled wasteland, although now occupied only by groups of squatters. A short distance away stood portions of the former Hotel Esplanade, including the Kaisersaal, used at various times as a much scaled-down hotel, cinema, nightclub and occasional film-set (scenes from Cabaret were shot there). Apart from these, no other buildings remained. Below ground, the U-Bahn section through Potsdamer Platz had closed entirely; although the S-Bahn line itself remained open, it suffered from a quirk of geography in that it briefly passed through East German territory en route from one part of West Berlin to another. Consequently, Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station became the most infamous of several Geisterbahnhofe (ghost stations), through which trains ran without stopping, its previously bustling platforms now decrepit, sealed off from the outside world, and patrolled by armed guards.|$|E
