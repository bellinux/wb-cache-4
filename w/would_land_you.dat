60|$|Fergusson, our Edinburgh poet, Burns's model, {{once saw}} a {{butterfly}} at the Town Cross; {{and the sight}} inspired him with a worthless little ode. This painted countryman, the dandy of the rose garden, looked far abroad in such a humming neighbourhood; and you can fancy what moral considerations a youthful poet would supply. But the incident, in a fanciful sort of way, is characteristic of the place. Into no other city does {{the sight of the}} country enter so far; if you do not meet a butterfly, you shall certainly catch a glimpse of far-away trees upon your walk; and the place is full of theatre tricks in the way of scenery. You peep under an arch, you descend stairs that look as if they <b>would</b> <b>land</b> <b>you</b> in a cellar, you turn to the back window of a grimy tenement in a lane:--and behold! you are face-to-face with distant and bright prospects. You turn a corner, and there is the sun going down into the Highland hills. You look down an alley, and see ships tacking for the Baltic.|$|E
60|$|The {{time was}} when Liverpool was {{practically}} the sole {{port of entry}} for our human cargoes, indentured apprentices of the beautiful, the historical. With the almost immediate transference of the original transatlantic steamship interests from Bristol, Liverpool became {{the only place where}} you could arrive. American lines, long erased from the seas, and the Inman line, the Cunard line, the White Star line, and the rest, <b>would</b> <b>land</b> <b>you</b> nowhere else. Then heretical steamers began to land you at Glasgow; worse schismatics carried you to Southampton; there were heterodox craft that touched at Plymouth, and now great swelling agnostics bring you to London itself. Still, Liverpool remains the greatest port of entry for our probationers, who are bound out to the hotels and railroad companies of all Europe till they have morally paid back their fare. The superstition that if you go in a Cunarder you can sleep on both ears is no longer so exclusive as it once was; yet the Cunarder continues an ark of safety for the timid and despairing, and the cooking is so much better {{than it used to be}} that if in contravention of the old Cunard rule against a passenger's being carried overboard you do go down, you may be reasonably sure of having eaten something that the wallowing sea-monsters will like in you.|$|E
60|$|I saw I hadn't got {{the hang}} of the steering, and so couldn't rightly tell where I {{was going to bring}} up when I started. I went afoot the rest of the day, and let my wings hang. Early next morning I went to a private place to have some practice. I got up on a pretty high rock, and got a good start, and went {{swooping}} down, aiming for a bush a little over three hundred yards off; but I couldn't seem to calculate for the wind, which was about two points abaft my beam. I could see I was going considerable to looard of the bush, so I worked my starboard wing slow and went ahead strong on the port one, but it wouldn't answer; I could see I was going to broach to, so I slowed down on both, and lit. I went back to the rock and took another chance at it. I aimed two or three points to starboard of the bush--yes, more than that--enough so as to make it nearly a head-wind. I done well enough, but made pretty poor time. I could see, plain enough, that on a head-wind, wings was a mistake. I could see that a body could sail pretty close to the wind, but he couldn't go in the wind's eye. I could see that if I wanted to go a-visiting any distance from home, and the wind was ahead, I might have to wait days, maybe, for a change; and I could see, too, that these things could not be any use at all in a gale; if you tried to run before the wind, you would make a mess of it, for there isn't anyway to shorten sail--like reefing, you know--you have to take it ALL in--shut your feathers down flat to your sides. That <b>would</b> <b>LAND</b> <b>you,</b> of course. You could lay to, with your head to the wind--that is the best you could do, and right hard work you'd find it, too. If you tried any other game, you would founder, sure.|$|E

6000|$|Your {{review of}} my book is very {{handsome}} and friendly and commands my liveliest gratitude. Of course your graceful strictures seem to yourself more valid than they do to me. The little book was a tolerably deliberate and meditated performance, and I {{should be prepared to}} do battle for most of the convictions expressed. It is quite true I use the word provincial too many times--I hated myself for't, even while I did it (just as I overdo the epithet [...] "dusky.") But I don't at all agree f with you in thinking that [...] "if it is not provincial for an Englishman to be English, a Frenchman French, etc., so it is not provincial for an American to be American." [...] So it is not provincial for a Russian, an Australian, a Portuguese, a Dane, a Laplander, to savour of their respective countries: that would be where the argument <b>would</b> <b>land</b> <b>you.</b> I think it is extremely provincial for a Russian to be very Russian, a Portuguese very Portuguese; {{for the simple reason that}} certain national types are essentially and intrinsically provincial. I sympathize even less with your protest against the idea that it takes an old civilization to set a novelist in motion--a proposition that seems to me so true as to be a truism. It is on manners, customs, usages, habits, forms, upon all these things matured and established, that a novelist lives--they are the very stuff his work is made of; and in saying that in the absence of those [...] "dreary and worn-out paraphernalia" [...] which I enumerate as being wanting in American society, [...] "we have simply the whole of human life left," [...] you beg (to my sense) the question. I should say we had just so much less of it as these same [...] "paraphernalia" [...] represent, and I think they represent an enormous quantity of it. I shall feel refuted only when we have produced (setting the present high company--yourself and me--for obvious reasons apart) a gentleman who strikes me as a novelist--as belonging to the company of Balzac and Thackeray. Of course, in the absence of this godsend, it is but a harmless amusement that we should reason about it, and maintain that if right were right he should already be here. I will freely admit that such a genius will get on only by agreeing with your view of the case--to do something great he must feel as you feel about it. But then I doubt whether such a genius--a man of the faculty of Balzac and Thackeray--could agree with you! When he does I will lie flat on my stomach and do him homage--in the very centre of the contributor's club, or on the threshold of the magazine, or in any public place you may appoint!--But I didn't mean to wrangle with you--I meant only to thank you and to express my sense of how happily you turn those things.--I am greatly amused at your picture of the contributing blood-hounds whom you are holding in check. I wish immensely that you would let them fly at me--though there is no reason, certainly, that the decent public should be bespattered, periodically, with my gore. However my tender (or rather my very tough) flesh is prescient already of the Higginsonian fangs. Happy man, to be going, like that, to see your plays acted. It is a sensation I am dying (though not as yet trying) to cultivate. What a tremendous quantity of work you must get through in these years! I am impatient for the next Atlantic. What is your Cornhill novel about? I am to precede it with a poorish story in three numbers--a tale purely American, the writing of which made me feel acutely the want of the [...] "paraphernalia." [...] I must add, however (to return for a moment to this), that I applaud and esteem you highly for not feeling it; i.e. the want. You are certainly right--magnificently and heroically right--to do so, and on the day you make your readers--I mean the readers who know and appreciate the paraphernalia--do the same, you will be the American Balzac. That's a great mission--go in for it! Wherever you go, receive, and distribute among your wife and children, the blessing of yours ever, ...|$|E
2500|$|Mephisto (Doug Bayne) (aka James Wenham) {{may or may}} {{not have}} been a {{security}} guard at one time or another, but it is certain that he did take a three-week training course in security guarding, and has retained some of the knowledge from that course. [...] According to the Double the Fist website, he is on the run from multiple taxation agencies. [...] He was at one time temporarily possessed by an Aztec demigod, and at another time the leader of an army of medieval re-enactors.
