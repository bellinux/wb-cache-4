500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "This episode will strike a chord with anyone that's ever tried {{to fit in with}} the crowd [...] Lisa gets to show the many facets of her character, and there's a superb slapstick sequence as Homer tries to dispose of a firework." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times praised the episode and said: [...] "The episode is quite simply my favourite Lisa episode regardless of season. From calm to cool and fiercely aggressive, we've rarely seen Lisa so enticing as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>here,</b> and the episode's many elements including the side stories for the other family members culminate in one of the finest this season has to offer." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he likes how it addresses Bart's resentment of Lisa's popularity. [...] "Granted, it makes [...] a little too mean, but it's entertaining", he added. Jacobson went on to say: [...] "Marge gets the best moment again, as I love watching her non-violent approach to the bumper cars." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best parts of the episode to be the scenes that feature Milhouse, particularly his yearbook message to Lisa and the scene with the Mystery Date board game. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A.|$|E

"He might, I say," [...] {{continued}} the teacher, [...] "justly be punished, but I {{am not going}} to punish him; for if I should, I am afraid that it would only make him a little more careful hereafter, not to commit this sin when I could possibly be within hearing, instead of persuading him, as I wish to, to avoid such a sin, in future, altogether. I am satisfied that that boy would be far happier, even in this world, if he would make it a principle always to do his duty, and never, in any case, to do wrong. And then when I think how soon he, and all of us will be in another world, where we shall all be judged for what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>here,</b> I feel strongly desirous of persuading him to abandon entirely this practice.

It scraps its obsolete steam engines and dynamos; but it won't scrap its old prejudices and its old moralities and its old religions and its old political constitutions. What's the result?

60|$|To {{bring this}} {{description}} of the elaboration and development of social, economic and political ideas {{right down to the}} discussions of the present day, would be to introduce issues altogether too controversial for the scope and intentions of this book. But regarding these things, as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>here,</b> from the vast perspectives of the student of world history, we are bound to recognize that this reconstruction of these directive ideas in the human mind is still an unfinished task--we cannot even estimate yet how unfinished the task may be. Certain common beliefs do seem to be emerging, and their influence is very perceptible upon the political events and public acts of to-day; but at present they are not clear enough nor convincing enough to compel men definitely and systematically towards their realization. {378} Men's acts waver between tradition and the new, and on the whole they rather gravitate towards the traditional. Yet, compared with the thought of even a brief lifetime ago, {{there does seem to be}} an outline shaping itself of a new order in human affairs. It is a sketchy outline, vanishing into vagueness at this point and that, {379} and fluctuating in detail and formulæ, yet it grows steadfastly clearer, and its main lines change less and less.|$|E
