5|$|Lead {{encephalopathy}} is {{a medical}} emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, even those that receive the best treatment. The mortality rate for people who develop cerebral involvement is about 25%, and of those <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> who had lead encephalopathy symptoms by the time chelation therapy was begun, about 40% have permanent neurological problems such as cerebral palsy.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is by prompt {{neurosurgery}} or radiologically guided interventions. Medications such as labetalol may {{be required}} to lower the blood pressure until repair can occur. Efforts to treat fevers are also recommended. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is frequently used to prevent vasospasm. Routine use medications to prevent further seizures is of unclear benefit. Nearly half of people with a SAH due to an underlying aneurysm die within 30 days and about a third <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> have ongoing problems. 10–15 percent die before reaching a hospital.|$|E

5|$|Generally, if {{the patient}} is treated and survives then a full {{recovery}} is expected. Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Larter starred as Clear Rivers, one of {{the main}} {{characters}} in the teen supernatural horror film Final Destination (2000). Also starring Devon Sawa and Kerr Smith, the movie's premise followed several teenagers <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> a plane crash but are stalked and killed by death itself. Final Destination made US$112 million by the end of its theatrical run. In 2001, she appeared in the comedy Legally Blonde with Reese Witherspoon. She played Brooke Taylor Windham, a widow accused of her husband's murder. The film earned the top spot with US$20 million in its opening weekend and ended up grossing $141 million worldwide. With US$96 million of it total gross deriving from domestic markets, Legally Blonde is Larter's highest-grossing film domestically.|$|E
5|$|ProtoGalaxy is {{presented}} from a 2.5D perspective; the 2D playing field employs 3D graphics. ProtoGalaxy incorporates {{elements of a}} variety of gaming genres, such as adventure, arcade, shooter, puzzle, and role-playing genres. In the game's back-story, a species of powerful, unknown extraterrestrials enters the Milky Way with the intention of enslaving its inhabitants. The player characters, of which there may be up to four at a time, follow a storyline by which they must defend Earth from an alien threat and restore human civilization, rebuilding for the sake of those humans <b>who</b> <b>survive.</b>|$|E

5|$|In acute poisoning, typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute poisoning can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin. Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E
5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E

25|$|Those <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> {{often have}} ongoing muscular and joint pain, liver inflammation, {{decreased}} hearing, {{and may have}} continued tiredness, continued weakness, decreased appetite, and difficulty returning to pre-illness weight. Problems with vision may develop.|$|E
25|$|Other {{critics argue}} that the {{immunity}} granted by vaccines is only temporary and requires boosters, whereas those <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> the disease become permanently immune. As discussed below, the philosophies of some alternative medicine practitioners are incompatible {{with the idea that}} vaccines are effective.|$|E
25|$|Patients <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> a 'V-fib arrest' and {{who make}} a good {{recovery}} from this are often considered for implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, which can quickly deliver this same life-saving defibrillation should another episode of ventricular fibrillation occur outside a hospital environment.|$|E

25|$|Reye {{syndrome}} is a rapidly progressive encephalopathy. Symptoms may include vomiting, personality changes, confusion, seizures, {{and loss of}} consciousness. Even though liver toxicity typically occurs, yellowish skin usually does not. Death occurs in 20–40% of those affected and {{about a third of}} those <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> are left with a significant degree of brain damage.|$|E
25|$|The organoarsenical {{melarsoprol}} (Arsobal) {{developed in}} the 1940s is effective for patients with second-stage sleeping sickness. However, 3–10% of those injected have reactive encephalopathy (convulsions, progressive coma, or psychotic reactions), and 10–70% of such cases result in death; it can cause brain damage in those <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> the encephalopathy. However, due to its effectiveness, melarsoprol is still used today. Resistance to melarsoprol is increasing, and combination therapy with nifurtimox is currently under research.|$|E
25|$|Post-polio {{syndrome}} {{occurs in}} approximately 25 to 50 {{percent of people}} <b>who</b> <b>survive</b> a poliomyelitis infection. On average, it occurs 30–35 years afterwards; however, delays of between 8–71 years have been recorded. The disease occurs sooner in persons with more severe initial infection. Other factors that {{increase the risk of}} postpolio syndrome include increasing length of time since acute poliovirus infection, presence of permanent residual impairment after recovery from the acute illness, and being female.|$|E
