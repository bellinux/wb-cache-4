Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is she going to give birth? <b>What</b> <b>happens</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E
