25|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{privately owned}} diesel {{locomotives}} operating on BR tracks, railway enthusiasts {{did not have to}} <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> after the final withdrawal of the class to see a Deltic back on the mainline. Following participation in the hastily arranged 'Farewell to the Deltics' open day at British Rail Engineering Limited's Doncaster Works on 27 February 1982, 55 002 left Doncaster under its own power and ran back up the ECML to the National Railway Museum light engine; it was to be some years before a Deltic was officially allowed to run again on the mainline.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of brain death {{needs to be}} rigorous, {{in order to be}} certain that the condition is irreversible. Legal criteria vary, but in general they require neurological examinations by two independent physicians. The exams must show complete and irreversible absence of brain function (brain stem function in UK), and may include two isoelectric (flat-line) EEGs 24hours apart (less in other countries where it is accepted that if the cause of the dysfunction is a clear physical trauma {{there is no need to}} <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> to establish irreversibility). The patient should have a normal temperature and be free of drugs that can suppress brain activity if the diagnosis is to be made on EEG criteria.|$|E
500|$|Whitlam {{took office}} with a {{majority}} in the House of Representatives, but without control of the Senate (elected in the 1967 and 1970 half-elections). The Senate at that time consisted of ten members from each of the six states, elected by proportional representation. The ALP parliamentary caucus chose the ministers, with the party leader only having the power to assign portfolios. A caucus meeting could not be held until after the final results came in on 15 December. In the meantime, McMahon would remain caretaker prime minister. Whitlam, however, was unwilling to <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> <b>long.</b> [...] On 5 December, with Labor's win beyond doubt even though counting was still underway, Whitlam had the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, swear him in as prime minister and Labor's deputy leader, Lance Barnard, as deputy prime minister. The two men held 27 portfolios during the two weeks before a full cabinet could be determined.|$|E
50|$|Having {{kept their}} fans <b>waiting</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> {{for a new}} album, Siddharta rewarded them with a free {{cultural}} event - an opening concert at the Ljubljana Castle. It was {{at the same time}} the first rock concert ever to have taken place in the castle courtyard, the event thus placing a new milestone on the band's path of achievements.|$|R

5000|$|Although Benton was an {{original}} character, {{according to an}} interview La Salle gave in 1997, he was cast late in the role, after the first season had already started filming. He recalled, [...] "I was surprisingly calm. When casting <b>waits</b> <b>that</b> <b>long,</b> they're basically <b>waiting</b> {{for someone to come}} in and take the role. I was ready and completely focused. I came into the office with a stethoscope and surgical greens I had left over from previous role in The Human Factor. When I left, I wanted them to say 'That's Dr. Benton'". Within three days of his audition, La Salle was offered the role of Dr. Benton.|$|R
500|$|Kruger {{was already}} an {{accomplished}} frontiersman, horseman and guerrilla fighter. In {{addition to his}} native Dutch he could speak basic English and several African languages, some fluently. He had shot a lion {{for the first time}} when he was a boy—in old age he recalled being 14, but Meintjes suggests he may have been as young as 11. During his many hunting excursions he was nearly killed on several occasions. In 1845, while he was hunting rhinoceros along the Steelpoort River, his four-pounder elephant gun exploded in his hands and blew off most of his left thumb. Kruger wrapped the wound in a handkerchief and retreated to camp, where he treated it with turpentine. He refused calls to have the hand amputated by a doctor, and instead cut off the remains of the injured thumb himself with a pocketknife. When gangrenous marks appeared up to his shoulder, he placed the hand in the stomach of a freshly-killed goat, a traditional Boer remedy. He considered this a success—"when it came to the turn of the second goat, my hand was already easier and the danger much less." [...] The wound took more than six months to heal, but he did not <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> to start hunting again.|$|E
2500|$|Henderson {{bounced back}} from his inauspicious start in the UFC with a victory over Rousimar Palhares at UFC 88, winning by {{unanimous}} decision.

2500|$|At the 1972 {{election}} Whitlam defeated McMahon {{and became}} Prime Minister. This created a potentially awkward situation since Whitlam and Hasluck had bitterly resented {{one another for}} years. In a celebrated incident in the House of Representatives in 1965, Whitlam had thrown {{a glass of water}} at Hasluck after Hasluck said: [...] "You are one of the filthiest objects ever to come into this chamber". Improbably enough in view of this, the Governor-General and the PM treated each other with complete civility that soon became genuine mutual respect. They had no difficulties in their formal dealings. An indication of the change which had taken place occurred soon after Whitlam's victory. Normal practice called for McMahon to stay on as caretaker Prime Minister until Labor could choose a full ministry at its first caucus meeting. [...] However, Whitlam was unwilling to <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> <b>long,</b> and asked Hasluck to have Whitlam and his deputy leader, Lance Barnard, sworn in as an interim two-man government once Labor's victory was beyond doubt. [...] Hasluck promptly agreed, and Whitlam and Barnard held 27 portfolios between them until the full Labor ministry was sworn in.|$|E
5000|$|Popsugar of Buzzsugar gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{highlighting}} <b>that</b> she can't <b>wait</b> {{for the show}} to come back after its hiatus.

I don't know how I'm going to deal with the show's hiatus for two long months, let alone <b>waiting</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> to find out what was coming for Elena. Or, who Alaric is; did he kill Logan to protect Jenna, eliminate a problem-causing newborn, or something more insidious?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In a June 2016 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Stefani expressed uncertainty {{with the future}} of No Doubt. [...] "I don't know what's {{going to happen with}} No Doubt. When Tony [...] and I are connected creatively, it's magic. But I think we've grown apart as far as what kind of music we want to make. I was really drained and burned out when we recorded that album [...] And I had a lot of guilt: 'I have to do it.' That's not the right setting to make music. There's some really great writing on that record. But the production felt really conflicted. It was sad how we all <b>waited</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> to put something out and it didn't get heard." ...|$|R

This {{was at the end of}} 2006 she was asked by phone to report to the Vogelweh Community Center main office at Vogelweh Facility of the Kaiserslautern Military Community. The administrator at that time said there was a two-year waiting list for music & vocal instructions and asked Nikki Hornsby to help at the community center for USA military men, women in service and their families. She believed <b>waiting</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> was unacceptable for USA Military overseas and made the time to provide one to one instructions with her own Nikki Hornsby beginning acoustic guitar and vocal method.|$|R

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the difficulties to properly diagnose and treat cancer during pregnancy, the alternative methods are either to perform a Cesarean section when the child is viable in order to begin a more aggressive cancer treatment, or, if the cancer is malignant enough that the mother is unlikely to be able to <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> <b>long,</b> to perform an abortion in order to treat the cancer.|$|E
