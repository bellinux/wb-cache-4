In a typical day he would wake at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which {{he would have a}} meal. Following the meal he would take a walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home he <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> two cups of tea, and go to bed at midnight.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> only Champagne wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E
5|$|In the December 11, 1892 Sunday paper, Dunne wrote another dialect column, {{this time}} {{set in the}} upscale Dearborn Street saloon of Colonel Malachi McNeary (in all columns but the first spelled McNeery). That barkeeper was based on James McGarry, owner of a saloon near Chicago's {{newspaper}} district; Dunne and other journalists <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> there and write their stories. Beginning in the second McNeery column, the listener for his monologues is Johnny McKenna, a real-life figure, who was a Republican in a mostly Democratic Irish community, and who often received government jobs as a token of bipartisanship. The World's Columbian Exposition was the major event of 1893 in Chicago, and McNeery {{was used as a}} mouthpiece for Dunne's commentary on the events and sights of the fair. For example, McNeery views a meeting of the fair's Board of Lady Managers, chaired by Bertha Palmer, who in the column proves incapable of stopping an argument between the members.|$|E

5|$|Amanita muscaria {{was widely}} {{used as an}} entheogen {{by many of the}} {{indigenous}} peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of A.muscaria use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of A.muscaria was not practised by these peoples. In western Siberia, the use of A.muscaria was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, A.muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously. In eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> his urine. This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the A.muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Abin the Levite, {{the son of}} Rabbi Judah the Prince, {{taught that}} the Israelites became wealthy from the plague of blood. If an Egyptian and an Israelite were in a house {{where there was a}} barrel full of water, and the Egyptian went to fill a pitcher from the barrel, the Egyptian would find that it {{contained}} blood, while the Israelite <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> water from the same barrel. When the Egyptian asked the Israelite to give the Egyptian some water with the Israelite's own hand, it still became blood. Even if the Egyptian said to the Israelite that they should both drink from one vessel, the Israelite <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> water, but the Egyptian <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> blood. It was only when the Egyptian bought water from the Israelite for money that the Egyptian was able to drink water. And this is how the Israelites became rich.|$|E

25|$|Whitley was a {{longtime}} alcoholic, who began drinking {{early in his}} career at bluegrass gigs, long before he was legally allowed to drink alcohol. Many times, he had attempted to overcome his alcoholism, but failed; and his pre-existing depression made it more challenging for him to quit. Moreover, Whitley preferred to drink alone, making it difficult for anyone to detect that he had a problem. According to Lorrie Morgan, she tried to conceal all alcoholic beverages from him at the home they shared, even going to the extent of binding their legs together before going to bed to make it impossible for Whitley to awaken {{in the middle of the}} night to consume a drink without her knowledge - only to discover that he <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> various items such as perfume and nail polish remover to get intoxicated.|$|E

25|$|As a young boy, Swift took little {{interest}} in his studies and consequently left the nearby country school after only eight years. During that period he was employed {{in a number of}} jobs, finally finding full-time work in his elder brother Noble's butcher shop at the age of fourteen. Two years later, in 1855, he opened his own cattle and pork butchering business with the help of one of his uncles who loaned him $400. Swift purchased livestock at the market in Brighton and drove them to Eastham, a ten-day journey. A shrewd businessman, he purportedly followed the somewhat common practice of denying his herds water during the last miles of the trip so that they <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> large quantities of liquid once they reached their final destination, effectively boosting their weights. Swift married Annie Maria Higgins of North Eastham in 1861. Over the years Annie gave birth to a total of eleven children, nine of whom reached adulthood. In 1862, Swift and his new bride opened a small butcher shop and slaughterhouse. Seven years later Gustavus and Annie moved the family to Brighton (near Boston), where in 1872 Swift became partner in a new venture, Hathaway and Swift. Swift and partner James A. Hathaway (a renowned Boston meat dealer) initially relocated the company to Albany, then almost immediately thereafter to Buffalo.|$|E
25|$|Galitsky's {{followers}} sing his praise. Skula and Yeroshka are {{now working}} as gudok-players. They entertain the followers and all sing of how Galitsky and his men abducted a young woman and how she pleaded {{to be allowed to}} return to her father without being dishonoured. The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have the prettiest maidens with him all night (Galitsky's Song). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his sister would be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, saying how she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers. The gudok players and the prince's followers mock the women. They wonder what might happen if Yaroslavna hears of what happens, but then realise she would be helpless with all her men gone to war. They sing of how they are all drunkards and are supported by Galitsky. The men decide to go to the town square to declare Galitsky the Prince of Putivl, leaving just the two drunk musicians behind.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Sunday began speaking in churches and at YMCAs.|$|E

500|$|Family {{members of}} the {{deceased}} would then reunite in the family home where they <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> more rum and carry out a ritual of purification (faly ranom-bohangy). [...] Lemon or lime leaves and two other herbs were soaked {{in a bowl of}} water, and a family member whose parents were still living would be chosen to sprinkle it on the deceased's possessions, enabling them to be redistributed and reused. The door by which the corpse had been removed was then locked for eight days, during which time the family was required to fast. After completion of this fasting period, the family underwent a purification ritual (afana) and the second door was unlocked. Another feast was observed to formally end the period of community purification. The home of the deceased was then allowed to fall into ruin.|$|E

To achieve her desired sound, she chose to work with multiple songwriters, including singer-songwriter Chloe Angelides. In an interview with Time, Gomez stated that for her, the track was not inspired by a single person, but instead about her experiences with drinking and social awkwardness, saying: [...] "I would hang out with people and they <b>would</b> <b>drink</b> and they’re so fun, {{then the next day}} it would be weird." [...] "Sober" [...] was initially conceived during a late-night conversation between the singer and Angelides in a hotel hallway, where the pair exchanged their own personal stories on the topic.

500|$|For {{the first}} eight chapters, 12 Days centers on Jackie Yuen, a 29-year-old part Cantonese and part Korean editor. After {{the death of her}} former lover, the Korean American school nurse Noah Yoon, she decides to drink her ashes over twelve days in {{beverages}} as a way of coping with her grief. Nicholas [...] "Nick" [...] Yoon, Noah's younger half brother, steals some of Noah's ashes for her to use, and soon joins her in mourning. She reminisces on how she met her and became involved in a lesbian relationship; however, Noah ended their relationship to marry a man to appease her father, and died returning from her honeymoon in a car accident a month ago. As Jackie continues her ritual, she begins to feel ill and eventually faints. Nick takes her to the hospital, where she recovers. On New Year's Day, she parts from Nick and returns to her apartment to find that he has taken the engagement ring she had wanted to give Noah, and unknown to her, he mixes it in with the remaining ashes. 12 Days concludes with [...] "Chapter 0", set before the events {{in the rest of the}} comic: Noah finds Nick studying for exams, and they briefly discuss Artemisia II of Caria, an ancient Greek queen who drank the ashes of her husband.
