25|$|After Sigismund III {{was elected}} in 1587, Elizabeth's {{intelligence}} service gave notice that an ambassador was in transit and that the deputation was one of amity. On 23 July 1587, the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of London to arrange housing for the diplomat, preferably with a merchant prominent in the Baltic trade. To ensure Elizabeth would not find fault with the preparations, the Lord Mayor was to report the arrangements made. Two days later a Polish envoy, Paweł Działyński, arrived at the palace in Greenwich. Brought to the reception hall, he found Elizabeth sitting on the throne under the canopy of state with all her nobles in attendance. The ambassador presented his credentials, and kissed the Queen's hand extended to him―a gesture of royal favour. Działyński then strode to {{the centre of the}} chamber without any forewarning of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to say, and, instead of the oration of a legate that everyone anticipated, he couched in respectful words to flatter the monarch being addressed and spoke as a herald. In Latin, he hectored, admonished and criticized the queen, and declared an ultimatum of capitulation to terms or hostile action.|$|E
500|$|Campbell {{began the}} 2010–11 season in goalscoring form in pre-season, scoring four {{goals in a}} {{friendly}} against Hull, and goals against Leicester City and Brighton & Hove Albion. Having forced his way into manager Steve Bruce's plans, he started the opening match of the new Premier League season, playing the full 90 minutes against Birmingham at the Stadium of Light in a 2–2 draw. He also played the full 90 minutes in Sunderland's next league outing against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. However, he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in Sunderland's 1–0 win against Manchester City on 29 August 2010, which sidelined him for an expected six months. Steve Bruce said [...] "It's a tragedy. But Fraizer will be back. He's a larger-than-life character. He {{was just starting to}} show <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>about.</b> But make no mistake he'll be back and he'll be firing again." [...] regarding the injury.|$|E
500|$|Faced {{with two}} adversaries, Maria {{initially}} tried {{to negotiate with}} Michael VIII the succession of her son Michael Asen but the Byzantine emperor insisted on an unconditional surrender. Much {{to the surprise of}} the Byzantines, Maria then entered in negotiations with Ivaylo and offered him her hand and the Bulgarian crown on the condition that he would guarantee the rights of Michael Asen as his sole successor. Contemporary chronicler George Pachymeres accuses Maria of [...] "ignoring the moral duty to her late husband" [...] but in fact her decision was driven by her hatred towards her uncle Michael VIII, whom she considered a heretic, as well as by her desire to hang on to power. At first, Ivaylo was reluctant to accept the proposal claiming that Maria was offering <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to take by force but eventually conceded [...] "because of the peace and to avoid bloodshed in a civil war". However, Ivaylo {{made it clear that he}} was the one giving clemency, not the one receiving it.|$|E

500|$|Isaacson {{completed}} forty-five sorties with Bomber Command, {{when the}} likelihood of surviving an operational tour of thirty missions was never more than 50% and, at times, much less. Promoted to acting flight lieutenant, he was chosen in May 1943 to captain Lancaster Q-for-Queenie on a landmark flight from England to Australia across the Pacific Ocean, and then from Melbourne to New Zealand and back, non-stop in both directions. He was awarded the Air Force Cross on 27August 1943 for this mission, the citation noting that it was [...] "the first occasion on which an aircraft has flown to Australia by this route and the direct flights between Melbourne and New Zealand are the first of their kind". The Lancaster was brought to Australia {{so that it could}} serve as a template for local production of the type, but this never took place and it was instead used for exhibition flights to encourage purchase of war bonds. On 22October 1943 Isaacson flew Q-for-Queenie under the Sydney Harbour Bridge, flouting a 1931 regulation that prohibited such activity; the Lancaster remains the largest aircraft to have been flown under the bridge. Isaacson gave his crew no warning of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to do and when asked later why he did it, replied [...] "Because it was there". It was, however, reported {{at the time that he}} undertook the stunt to support the war loan effort for which he and his crew were actively fundraising.|$|E
2500|$|In Dublin in 1952 Erwin Schrödinger gave {{a lecture}} in which {{at one point}} he jocularly warned his {{audience}} that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to say might [...] "seem lunatic". It was that, when his Nobel equations seem to be describing several different histories, they are [...] "not alternatives but all really happen simultaneously". This is the earliest known reference to the Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{was noted}} for his dreadlocks hair style, but he shaved them off {{during a trip}} to Australia. His shyness made Williams appear {{somewhat}} of an odd ball. [...] "Ricky's just a different guy", former Saints receiver Joe Horn explained. [...] "People he wanted to deal with, he did. And people he wanted to have nothing to do with, he didn't. No one could understand that. I don't think guys in the locker room could grasp {{that he wanted to be}} to himself – you know, quiet. If you didn't understand him and didn't know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>about,</b> it always kept people in suspense." [...] Besides keeping to himself, Williams was known for conducting post-game interviews with his helmet on (complete with tinted visor) and avoiding eye contact. Williams was later diagnosed with clinical depression and social anxiety disorder.|$|E

2500|$|Russell Crowe as Javert, {{a police}} {{inspector}} dedicating {{his life to}} imprisoning Valjean once again. Before being cast as Javert, Crowe was initially dissatisfied with the character. On his way to Europe for a friend's wedding, Crowe came to London and met with producer Cameron Mackintosh. On meeting with Tom Hooper, he told the director about his concerns about playing Javert, and after meeting with him, Crowe was [...] "determined {{to be involved in}} the project and play Javert. I think it had something to do with Tom's passion for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to undertake, and he clearly understood the problems and he clearly understood the challenge." [...] On visiting Victor Hugo's home in Paris, Crowe said, [...] " [...] told me about [...] Vidocq, a man who had been both a prisoner and a policeman, the man credited with inventing undercover police work when he established the Brigade de Surete." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 24, 2002 in {{downtown}} Minneapolis, Minnesota, Moss was driving and {{was preparing to}} make an illegal turn. A traffic control officer (Amy Zaccardi), noticing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to do, {{stood in front of}} his 2002 Lexus car, ordering him to stop. Eyewitness accounts of the event differ at this point, but Moss did not comply with the officer's order, and she was bumped by his vehicle and fell to the ground. Moss was arrested, and a search of his vehicle revealed a joint amounting to less than a gram of marijuana in his ashtray. Initially charged with felony Suspicion of Assault with a Deadly Weapon and a misdemeanor marijuana possession, Moss spent the night in jail and was released the following morning. [...] Moss pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor traffic violation and was ordered to pay a $1,200 fine and perform 40 hours of community service. While the criminal charges were thus disposed of, the civil lawsuit filed by the traffic control officer brought a substantial penalty fine [...] "in the low to mid six figures". [...] Moss claimed that the joint was not his, and that he had let friends use his car prior to the accident.|$|E
2500|$|Ferguson {{argued that}} the 93 counts {{he was charged with}} were related to the year 1993, and had it been 1925 he would have been charged with only 25 counts. He {{admitted}} bringing the gun onto the train, but claimed that he fell asleep, and another man grabbed his gun and began firing. He also argued that a mysterious man named Mr. Su had information concerning a conspiracy against him. He also found another man who was willing to testify that the government implanted a computer chip in Ferguson's brain, but at the last minute decided not to call him to the stand. This individual, Raul Diaz, was a parapsychologist from Manhattan and claimed during a press conference on the courthouse steps to have witnessed an Oriental man press a chip into Ferguson's head prior to the attack. According to Diaz, the Oriental man told him to behold <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to do prior to pushing the button. [...] "He was lasered out by a remote-control device," [...] Diaz told reporters outside the courtroom. [...] "He was zapped, just like that, right out of the twilight zone" [...] and was [...] "commanded to go up and down the aisle shooting people." ...|$|E
