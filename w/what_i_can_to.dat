500|$|The album artwork for Irresistible {{was shot}} by Alberto Tolot in April 2001. The front sleeve cover shows Simpson, wearing heavy makeup and with blond hair, dressed in a semi-transparent shirt, raising it a bit to expose her navel. Simpson said [...] "God gave me my body, you know. I'm just doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> make it look good." [...] Later in an {{interview}} with the Orlando Sentinel, she said that the album art was [...] "a sign of confidence". However, the cover received negative attention from many critics, including the conservative Christian publication Plugged In, which was a strong supporter of Simpson and her virgin image, and Sweet Kisses. They stated, [...] "If anything, Irresistible copes with temptation by yielding to it which, in conjunction with Simpson's general immodesty, models a dubious sexual ethic." [...] Canadian music magazine Chart also gave a negative response, writing [...] "it takes more than wearing see-through clothes, with airbrushed, non-existent nipples, to show that you have matured." [...] A few critics criticized the art for being digitally edited, while others commented on Simpson's similarity to Spears. The Japanese version of the album has the same front sleeve artwork as that of [...] "Irresistible" [...] single.|$|E

Manson added that only [...] "The Trick Is to Keep Breathing" [...] had something that was out of her life, being inspired by her friend Ruthie Trouble. [...] "Medication" [...] came about from a frightful, isolating experience with the US medical system. The song, Manson explained, is [...] "a reflection on past ills in a way ... about taking blame on yourself for things that you had no control of at the time, and finally pushing off and realizing that this was not my fault. It wasn't all my fault. There's a huge relief and release that comes from that".|$|E
