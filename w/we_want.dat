5|$|If <b>we</b> <b>want</b> more fish, {{we should}} shift that {{person who has}} a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E

5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated.

And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to emphasise.|$|E

The episode competed with game seven of the 2016 NBA Finals. It had a 3.9 rating in the 18-49 demographic, the highest-rated show on cable television that night.

5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey if <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone {{has a duty to}} not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
