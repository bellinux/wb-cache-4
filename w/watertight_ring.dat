50|$|Soon, the King of the Merman tribe {{arrives and}} demands the mermaid sword in {{exchange}} for Shizuka, who was mistaken to be the mermaid princess because she was wearing the royal tiara. Doraemon creates a fake with Nobita's toy inflated sword and gives it to the mermen. They get Shizuka in return. Once the King of the Merman realize that the sword is not genuine, his troops begin to attack the mermaid castle. Sophia prays to the mermaid god, who reveals {{the location of the}} mermaid sword. However, the merman king steals the sword and uses it to wreak havoc by creating an underwater tornado. Doraemon lands in the <b>watertight</b> <b>ring</b> that they were using the day before. After he locates everybody else, he uses a surfing board to spray the merman king with a special gas, allowing him to see the simulated water.|$|E
