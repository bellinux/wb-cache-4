40|$|We {{investigate}} the single-photon propagation in the one-dimensional <b>waveguide</b> <b>coupled</b> to $N$ two-level atoms.

40|$|We {{describe}} a general analytical {{framework of a}} nanoplasmonic cavity-emitter system interacting with a dielectric photonic waveguide. Taking into account emitter quenching and dephasing, our model directly reveals the single photon extraction efficiency, η, {{as well as the}} indistinguishability, I, of photons coupled into the waveguide mode. Rather than minimizing the cavity modal volume, our analysis predicts an optimum modal volume to maximize η that balances <b>waveguide</b> <b>coupling</b> and spontaneous emission rate enhancement. Surprisingly, our model predicts that near-unity indistinguishability is possible, but this requires a much smaller modal volume, implying a fundamental performance trade-off between high η and I at room temperature. Finally, we show that maximizing η I requires that the system has to be driven in the weak coupling regime because quenching effects and decreased <b>waveguide</b> <b>coupling</b> drastically reduce η in the strong coupling regime...|$|E
