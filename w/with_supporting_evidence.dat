40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the exclusion of}} veterans with combat PTSD (CPTSD) from eligibility for the Purple Heart (PH).

The proposed alteration in terminology may enable eligibility of posttraumatic combat veterans’ for the Purple Heart, and consequently mitigate the stigma of their wounds, help to deconstruct their misrecognition as inferior to physiologically wounded, increase their willingness to seek aid, and improve their chances to heal...|$|R
50|$|James, on August 19, 1771 married Margaret, {{daughter}} of Chief Justice Allen of Pennsylvania. Five children of this marriage survived him: Charles Stephen, {{who served in}} the Royal Navy; Margaret, who wed Sir Jukes Granville Clifton, Bart.; Ann and Susan, who never married, and James, Lieutenant-Colonel in the First Dragoon Guard. None of the five had children. There are speculations <b>with</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>evidence</b> of tombstone inscriptions that De Lancey had a previous union with a connection of the Livingston family. Only her Christian name, Mary, is known. She died in 1770 leaving three children—John, James, and Mary.

50|$|The lithic {{assemblage}} {{in some of}} {{the late}} Pleistocene occupations at Shum Laka are unique {{in the presence of a}} quartz industry early than most other sites in the region. The presence of a microlithic quartz industry at Shum Laka, when combined <b>with</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>evidence</b> from other rockshelter and late Pleistocene sites in the Grasslands, is indicative of a more mobile population that exploited a variety of resources in the ecotonal landscape. This behavioral strategy is ascribed as an adaptation to common regional environmental changes during the late Pleistocene. It is well established that the late Pleistocene in northern Cameroon and the surrounding area was highly variable climatically. Particularly during the Last Glacial Maximum, refuge occupations by people would have been short-term and highly variable based on rapid, localized changes. Similar lithic assemblages and strategies as those found at Shum Laka have been delineated at other rockshelter sites in the area dating to the same period.|$|E
50|$|Iron was {{worked by}} about 500 BC, <b>with</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>evidence</b> {{coming from the}} Khorat Plateau, in modern-day Thailand. In Cambodia, some Iron Age {{settlements}} were found beneath Baksei Chamkrong and other Angkorian temples while circular earthworks were found beneath Lovea a few kilometres north-west of Angkor. Burials, much richer than other types of finds, testify to improvement of food availability and trade (even on long distances: in the 4th century BC trade relations with India were already opened) {{and the existence of}} a social structure and labour organisation.Also, among the artefacts from the Iron Age, glass beads are important evidence. Different kinds of glass beads recovered from several sites across Cambodia, such as the Phum Snay site in northwest and the Prohear site in southeast, show that there were two main trading networks at the time. The two networks were separated by time and space, which indicate that there was a shift from one network to the other at about 2nd-4th century AD, probably with changes in socio-political powers.|$|E

50|$|TRPV1 is {{activated}} by numerous agonists from natural sources. Agonists such as capsaicin and resiniferatoxin activate TRPV1 and, upon prolonged application, cause TRPV1 activity to decrease (desensitization), leading to alleviation of pain via the subsequent {{decrease in the}} TRPV1 mediated release of inflammatory molecules following exposures to noxious stimuli. Agonists can be applied locally to the painful area in various forms, generally as a patch or an ointment. Numerous capsaicin-containing creams are available over the counter, containing low concentrations of capsaicin (0.025 - 0.075%). It is debated whether these preparations actually lead to TRPV1 desensitization; {{it is possible that}} they act via counter-irritation. Novel preparations containing higher capsaicin concentration (up to 10%) are under clinical trials. 8% capsaicin patches have recently become available for clinical use, <b>with</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>evidence</b> demonstrating that a 30-minute treatment can provide up to 3 months analgesia by causing regression of TRPV1-containing neurons in the skin. Currently, these treatments must be re-administered on a regular (albeit infrequent) schedule in order to maintain their analgesic effects.|$|E
5000|$|While {{biochemistry}} {{indicates a}} strong chromosomal link {{between humans and}} other species, especially primates - our DNA of is a near-perfect match (98%) with the chimpanzee. Meanwhile, our behavioural profile is radically different from both primates and all other species. Humans are the single species dominating the biosphere. Neoteric Evolutionary Theory proposes a single mechanism {{in an attempt to}} reconcile the apparently contradictory evidence of close proximity and wide divergence of human and other species.The Recall Paradigm was first proposed in 2012 and later <b>with</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>evidence</b> from Darwin’s notebooks suggests that it is a unique ability in humans to recall events at will that led first to the manifest tools, those we assume preceded the type of stone implements of Lomekwi 3, and later to wholesale re-organisation of habitat now characteristic of, and serves to define, Homo sapiens.Neoteric theory does not propose a single ‘site’ for ‘recall’ ( [...] Tulving’s episodic memory) within human mental architecture. Nor can it support theories of brain cavity size or shape as evidence for the development of human intelligence; many humans with very small cranial volume produced exquisite, advanced tools, in particular Homo floresiensis.|$|E
