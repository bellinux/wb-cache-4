25|$|The neurobiological {{background}} for unihemispheric sleep is still unclear. In experiments on cats {{in which the}} connection between {{the left and the right}} halves of the brain stem has been severed, the brain hemispheres show periods of a desynchronized EEG, during which the two hemispheres can sleep independently of each other. In these cats, the state where one hemisphere slept NREM and the other <b>was</b> <b>awake,</b> as well as one hemisphere sleeping NREM with the other state sleeping REM were observed. Interestingly, the cats were never seen to sleep REM sleep with one hemisphere while the other hemisphere <b>was</b> <b>awake.</b> This is in accordance with the fact that REM sleep, as far as is currently known, does not occur unihemispherically.|$|E

25|$|One notable case {{led to a}} 26-minute {{film that}} PETA {{produced}} in 1984, Unnecessary Fuss. The film was based on 60 hours of researchers' footage obtained by the ALF during a raid on the University of Pennsylvania's head injury clinic. The footage showed researchers laughing at baboons as they inflicted brain damage on them with a hydraulic device intended to simulate whiplash. Laboratory animal veterinarian Larry Carbone writes that the researchers openly discussed how one baboon <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> before the head injury, despite protocols being in place for anesthesia. The ensuing publicity led to the suspension of funds from the university, the firing of its chief veterinarian, {{the closure of the}} lab, and a period of probation for the university.|$|E
25|$|Some Sunni {{scholars}} {{do believe}} in Raj’a, believing in the return of number of people such as Seven Sleepers synchronous {{with the appearance of}} the Mahdi. Jalaluddin Al-Sayuti wrote about the raj`a but in a different way from the Shiites. According to his book The Possibility of Seeing the Prophet and the Angels (Arabic: تنوير الحلك في إمكان رؤية النبي والملك,) Suyuti claims to have seen the Prophet Muhammad over 70 times while he <b>was</b> <b>awake.</b> According to him, in contrast to Shiite belief, the return of the Prophet Muhammad is not limited to a specific time in the future. Al-Sayuti did not mention if any other religious figures will return after death before the resurrection. According to Abu 'Abdullah Al-Qurtubi, raj`a is understood as the lack of physical presence of a prophet, who marks his apparent death by absence in the physical world but will reappear, from time to time, to those who are pure in heart. The Maliki scholar Ibn al-Arabi, known for his exegesis of the Sunan al-Tirmidhi, stated that seeing and hearing the prophets while awake is possible for the pure believer.|$|E

500|$|The {{moment that}} Cupid and Psyche are {{revealed}} {{is an example}} of [...] "Keatsian intensity" [...] as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in between in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version of the Psyche myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to see them at all or if he was dreaming. This inability of the narrator to know if he <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including [...] "Ode on Indolence", [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to be in love with Psyche, representing the mind.|$|E
500|$|Moran {{cared for}} Poe at the for-profit Washington College Hospital on Broadway and Fayette Street. He was denied any {{visitors}} and was confined in a prison-like room with barred windows {{in a section}} of the building reserved for drunk people. Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name [...] "Reynolds" [...] on the night before his death, though no one has ever been able to identify the person to whom he referred. One possibility is that he was recalling an encounter with Jeremiah N. Reynolds, a newspaper editor and explorer who may have inspired the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. Another possibility is Henry R. Reynolds, one of the judges overseeing the Fourth Ward Polls at Ryan's Tavern, who may have met Poe on Election Day. Poe may have instead been calling for [...] "Herring", as the author had an uncle-in-law in Baltimore named Henry Herring. In later testimonies Moran avoided reference to Reynolds but mentioned a visit by a [...] "Misses Herring". He also claimed he attempted to cheer up Poe during {{one of the few times}} Poe <b>was</b> <b>awake.</b> When Moran told his patient that he would soon be enjoying the company of friends, Poe allegedly replied that [...] "the best thing his friend could do would be to blow out his brains with a pistol".|$|E

Randall protests, maintaining that he <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> and consequently unable to snore, while his wife was actually asleep. Eventually they travel to a Sleep Clinic in order to monitor their behaviors and determine for certain who is right.|$|E

Schenck and his men were driven back through the house to their entry windows. One by one, they climbed back to the barges which, in the rough river, had drifted away from the walls, making it necessary for many of the men to swim. Many of the soldiers missed the barges, the current sweeping them away.|$|E
2500|$|The school's outdoor {{program was}} news on several occasions. This {{incident}} {{took place at}} St. John's Cathedral Boys' School in Selkirk, Manitoba and {{was the basis for}} an article in the Canadian edition of Reader's Digest [...] "Drama in Real Life". [...] In 1976, Ted Milligan collapsed with hypothermia two miles from the school while on a voluntary training run for the [...] "Interschool Snowshoe Race" [...] held annually between the Manitoba and Alberta schools. The day started out warm, but at sunset, the temperature dropped rapidly. Milligan's clothes were soaked with sweat, and he chilled. Initially he was thought dead, with no detectable pulse by the school's nurse. He was unresponsive to resuscitation efforts. At the Selkirk Hospital, doctors heated up the ER and wisely placed an ice pack on his head to prevent thermal shock to his brain. In time, he was revived and <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> and alert the following morning.|$|E
2500|$|Karen Silkwood {{died in a}} car {{accident}} on November 13, 1974, while on her way to talk with a Times reporter about the safety violations at the Crescent plant. [...] Alerted to suspicious aspects of the accident, Mazzocchi permitted the use of OCAW funds to hire a former police officer-turned-private investigator to examine the accident scene and Silkwood's car. [...] After the investigator found evidence that Silkwood's car may have been forced off the road and that Silkwood <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> when the crash occurred (rather than asleep at the wheel as Oklahoma state police had concluded), Mazzocchi asked the Attorney General William B. Saxbe on November 19, 1974, to investigate Silkwood's death. [...] Mazzocchi also released a statement to the press, prematurely as it turned out: The private investigator's report had not yet been written, and the press release exposed the investigator to harassment and press mis-reporting which severely muddled OCAW's case that Silkwood may have been murdered. When the AEC concluded that Silkwood had not been contaminated accidentally, Mazzocchi was pleased with the result. He was not pleased when the AEC refused any attempt to try to discover how she had been poisoned. The Attorney General closed the investigation into Silkwood's death on April 30, 1975, saying {{there was no evidence of}} foul play.|$|E

[...] He would spend most games asleep in the dugout, leaving game {{strategy}} in the hands of his coaches. [...] Whenever he <b>was</b> <b>awake,</b> he often made strange calls that the players and coaches usually disregarded. He would also call for players from decades earlier to pinch-hit; in the 1940s it was not uncommon for him to yell [...] "Baker!" [...] or [...] "Foxx!" [...] – sluggers he had sold off decades before. Most ominous of all, the crowds at Shibe Park were so small that the other AL teams could not even begin to cover their travel expenses, leading the other owners to complain that the gates at Shibe Park were too small to justify the trip.

2500|$|Originally, the {{annulment}} of vows {{was performed}} on Rosh Hashana, the New Year, ten days before Yom Kippur. The Talmud (Nedarim 23b) says, [...] "Who wished to cancel his vows of a whole year should arise on Rosh Hashanah and announce, 'All vows that I will pledge {{in the coming year}} shall be annulled.'" [...] There is, in fact, a ritual for this that is supposed to take place the day before Rosh Hashana (because one does not do such chores on a holy day), known as Hatarat nedarim (Annulment of vows), wherein the individual presents himself before a tribunal of three and recites a Hebrew formula, very different from that of Kol Nidrei, asking for annulment of every vow or pledge or prohibition that he swore [...] "while I <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> or dreaming", [...] "whether they were matters relating to money, or to the body, or to the soul".... And the tribunal responds by reciting three times, [...] "May everything be permitted you, may everything be forgiven you, may everything be allowed you. There does not exist any vow, oath, ... or curse. But there does exist pardon, forgiveness, and atonement." [...] And the individual then concludes with a brief statement that [...] "I cancel from this time onward all vows and all oaths ... that I will accept upon myself, whether while awake or in a dream .... from this moment I preemptively regret them and declare of all of them they shall be utterly null and void...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviews {{following}} {{months after}} publication contained limited positive {{appraisal of the}} poem. William Roberts's review, for the August 1816 British Review, was more positive than previous analysis but with no detail about the work: [...] "passing over the two other poems which are bound together with 'Christabel', called 'The Fragment of Kubla Khan', and 'The Pains of Sleep'; in which, however, there are some playful thoughts and fanciful imagery, which we would gladly have extracted if our room would have allowed it." [...] The next review came in the January 1817 Monthly Review, with the anonymous reviewer questioning: [...] "Allowing every possible accuracy to the statement of Mr. Coleridge, we would yet ask him whether this extraordinary fragment was not rather the effect of rapid and instant composition after he <b>was</b> <b>awake,</b> than of memory immediately recording that which he dreamt when asleep? By what process of consciousness could he distinguish between such composition and such reminiscence? Impressed as his mind was with his interesting dream, and habituated as he is ... to the momentary production of verse, will he venture to assert {{that he did not}} compose, and that he did remember, the lines before us?" [...] The review then concluded, [...] "His 'psychological curiosity', as he terms it, depends in no slight degree on the establishment of the previous fact which we have mentioned: but the poem itself is below criticism. We would dismiss it with some portentous words of Sir Kenelm Digby, in his observations on Browne's religio Medici: 'I have much ado to believe what he speaketh confidently; that he is more beholding to Morpheus for learned and rational as well as pleasing dreams, than to Mercury for smart and facetious conceptions'." ...|$|E

When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she <b>was</b> <b>awake</b> and felt a draft, she would ask me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E
