40|$|Many {{organizations}} adopt {{information technologies}} to make intelligent decisions during operations. Time-series data plays {{a crucial role}} in supporting such decision making processes. Though current studies on time-series based decision making provide reasonably well results, the anomaly detection essence underling most of the scenarios and the plenitude of unlabeled data are largely overlooked and left unexplored.

Heavy metal pollution situation is more serious increasingly, water birds whose life history is in wetlands {{are at high risk}} both lethal and sub-lethal effects, as their body burdens increase. It is costly and time-consuming to determine environmental quality by examining concentrations of metals in very many organisms, thus indicator species and indicator tissues must be selected.

Software-defined networking (SDN) has attracted a great attention both in industry and academia {{since the beginning of the}} decade. This attention keeps undiminished. Security-related aspects of software-defined networking have only been considered more recently. Opinions differ widely. The main objective of the seminar was to discuss the various contrary facets of SDN security. The seminar continued the series of Dagstuhl events Network Attack Detection and Defense held in 2008, 2012, and 2014. The objectives of the seminar were threefold, namely (1) to discuss the security challenges of SDN, (2) to debate strategies to monitor and protect SDN-enabled networks, and (3) to propose methods and strategies to leverage on the flexibility brought by SDN for designing new security mechanisms. At the seminar, which brought together participants from academia and industry, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> and disadvantages of using software-defined networks from the security point of view.

40|$|Awake {{surgery is}} a {{surgical}} procedure applied {{to people with}} brain tumors. Patients are kept awake during surgery to perform language tasks during electrical stimulation of cortico-subcortical brain structures. When the application of electrical pulses to the brain repeatedly triggers errors, this is taken as {{an indication that the}} area is critically involved in the language skills probed by the task, and therefore should not be removed, as this would result in postoperative language deficits. In this thesis, we focused on the role of production tasks using finite verbs and the evaluation of their ability to assess language processing in comparison with the current gold standard (i. e., object naming). As a preliminary step in the development of novel, controlled object and verb production tasks, we critically reviewed the literature. We discussed published studies that proposed intraoperative tasks requiring the production of verbs in isolation and in sentences, and we graphically represented the stimulation sites and error types that were reported in each study. Subsequently, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> and disadvantages of each from a cognitive neuroscience and neurolinguistic perspective. With this information in mind, we constructed and validated two naming tasks for native speakers of Italian undergoing awake surgery – an object naming task and a finite verb production task. We administered the finite verb production task and other picture naming tasks to subjects with post-stroke aphasia, and established that a task that uses finite verbs shows a strong correlation with communicative abilities in daily life. Also, we introduced and compared our standardized finite verb task in the operating theater and compared it with an object naming task. Our tests are currently and successfully used in different surgery wards in Italy and overseas. This work can be extended to other neurological populations such as stroke, dementias, and epilepsy. ...|$|E
40|$|In 2006 - 2007, Ball State University Libraries {{received}} a Library Services Technology Act (LSTA) grant to digitize 204 oral history interviews from Archives and Special Collections {{and create the}} Middletown Digital Oral History Collection. The collections chosen for digitization provide research material on populations that were neglected in the seminal studies conducted by sociologists Robert and Helen Lynd. Their publications, Middletown: A Study in American Culture (1929) and Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflict (1937), used Muncie as “Middletown,” a representative American community and researchers have continued to return to study Muncie as “Middletown. ” These neglected populations include African Americans, Jewish, Catholic and working class residents of Muncie, Indiana. Over the last thirty years, this lack of documentation on these groups has motivated historians to conduct oral histories with these communities. The Middletown Digital Oral History Collection offers a model for using digital content management systems {{to provide access to}} oral history interviews that might otherwise be hidden to researchers, inaccessible due to distance, or lost due to the fragility of the recording medium.

40|$|A {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} (RCT) is {{the gold standard}} to evaluate the intended effects of drugs. In such trials a drug can be compared with a placebo or with another active compound for the same indication. RCTs {{can be used to}} demonstrate that a drug is superior to placebo or an active comparator (superiority trial) or that a drug is not worse than an active comparator (non-inferiority (NI) trial). NI trials {{can be used in a}} situation when a new drug is expected to have a similar efficacy as its comparator but may offer other advantages over the existing drug such as a more convinient method of administration (for example oral drugs versus parenteral route) or has less side effects. The objective of this thesis was to look deeper into the challenges of the methodology of NI trials, and the role of regulatory guidelines in it. From a methodological perspective, NI trials have special challenges in design and analysis that can influence proper interpretation of its result. First, there are different methods to determine the limit where we can say that the drug is not worse than its active comparator (NI margin). Second, there is a difficulty in interpreting NI trials because of their lack of ability to distinguish an effective drug from an ineffective drug i. e. assay sensitivity, without relying on evidence outside the trial. Third, the validity of the historical data that were used to base the NI margin on, i. e. constancy assumption sometimes is questionable. In the thesis, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> and disadvantages of NI trials based on ethical, methodological and regulatory arguments. We suggest that the non-inferiority aim of showing efficacy of a drug in NI trials should be studied together with aims directed at showing superiority of aspects of the drug over its active comparator e. g. on side effects, or ease of use of drugs. Furthermore, these other study aims should be studied in a scientific sound way (e. g. with adequate statistical power). When these conditions have been met we think it is not unethical to perform NI trials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) and antisense strategies provide experimental therapeutic {{agents for}} numerous diseases, including polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders caused by CAG repeat expansion. We compared {{the potential of}} different oligonucleotide-based strategies for silencing the genes responsible for several polyQ diseases, including Huntington's disease and two spinocerebellar ataxias, type 1 and type 3. The strategies included nonallele-selective gene silencing, gene replacement, allele-selective SNP targeting and CAG repeat targeting. Results Using the patient-derived cell culture models of polyQ diseases, we tested various siRNAs, and antisense reagents and assessed their silencing efficiency and allele selectivity. We showed considerable allele discrimination by several SNP targeting siRNAs based on a weak G-G or G-U pairing with normal allele and strong G-C pairing with mutant allele {{at the site of}} RISC-induced cleavage. Among the CAG repeat targeting reagents the strongest allele discrimination is achieved by miRNA-like functioning reagents that bind to their targets and inhibit their translation without substantial target cleavage. Also, morpholino analog performs well in mutant and normal allele discrimination but its efficient delivery to cells at low effective concentration still remains a challenge. Conclusions Using three cellular models of polyQ diseases and the same experimental setup we directly compared the performance of different oligonucleotide-based treatment strategies that are currently under development. Based on the results obtained by us and others <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> and drawbacks of these strategies considering them from several different perspectives. The strategy aimed at nonallele-selective inhibiting of causative gene expression by targeting specific sequence of the implicated gene is the easiest to implement but relevant benefits are still uncertain. The gene replacement strategy that combines the nonallele-selective gene silencing with the expression of the exogenous normal allele is a logical extension of the former and it deserves to be explored further. Both allele-selective RNAi approaches challenge cellular RNA interference machinery to show its ability to discriminate between similar sequences differing in either single base substitutions or repeated sequence length. Although both approaches perform well in allele discrimination most of our efforts are focused on repeat targeting due to its potentially higher universality. </p...|$|E
