40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the use of}} <b>wonder</b> in the TV-series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage (1980). Popular {{science has}} been studied extensively (e. g. Broks 2006; Leane 2007; Perrault 2013), and <b>wonder</b> has been studied moderately (e. g. Daston & Park 1998; Fuller 2006; Vasalou 2015). However, {{there are very few}} studies of <b>wonder</b> in popular science. This paper explores how and why <b>wonder</b> is used in Cosmos, with the wider aim of understanding uses of <b>wonder</b> in popular science. The studies that discuss <b>wonder</b> in popular science (Fahnestock 1986; Perrault 2013) argue that <b>wonder</b> is used to enthuse the audience about science, but they do not discuss why <b>wonder</b> has this ability, nor whether <b>wonder</b> has other functions. This paper argues that Fuller's (2006) psychological and evolutionary account of <b>wonder</b> can elucidate why <b>wonder</b> has the ability to enthuse; it discerns three senses of ‘wonder’ (related to objects, emotions and attitudes); and it discusses other functions of <b>wonder</b> (existential, aesthetic and ethical). Due to the centrality of astrobiological questions in Cosmos, this paper also highlights the relation of these questions to the senses and functions of <b>wonder</b> in Cosmos...|$|R

40|$|To <b>wonder</b> {{is a gift}} of the romanticist in particular. <b>Wonder</b> seeks explanation. If reason doesn’t provide that, {{imagination}} {{provides a}} way out. One imagines a transcendental world of which the God-idea may become the central point and the explanatory model of that that invoked <b>wonder.</b> The God-idea implies <b>wonder,</b> <b>wonder</b> that live exists, that things exist at all. <b>Wonder</b> promotes religiosity—i. c., {{the need to provide}} life with a vertical dimension—and religiosity facilitates, in its turn, <b>wonder.</b> Thus the circle is closed: romanticism, <b>wonder,</b> imagination, religiosity, <b>wonder.</b> A circle providing life with an important bonus, i. e., sense, meaning with a supernatural signature. This augments the chance that hope will be preserved, even as dark clouds begin to hover above one’s life...|$|R

Once built, this wonder provides an initial bonus of units or resources, while continuing to provide a benefit to the player's civilization. This initial bonus becomes larger, depending on which age is being advanced to. Since the wonder is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, which affects the speed of advancement. <b>Wonders</b> that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt.|$|E
