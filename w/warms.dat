5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the Tibetan Plateau has {{experienced}} pronounced <b>warming,</b> yet {{the extent to}} which <b>warming</b> will affect alpine ecosystems depends on how <b>warming</b> interacts with other influential global change factors, such as nitrogen (N) deposition.

5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere.

The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E

5|$|Wildfire {{intensity}} increases during daytime hours. For example, burn {{rates of}} smoldering logs {{are up to}} five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds.

Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.|$|E
40|$|Climate {{variability}} {{is expected}} to increase in future but there exist very few experimental studies that apply different <b>warming</b> regimes on plant communities over several years.

5|$|A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, <b>warms</b> and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This {{produces}} a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due {{to the effects of}} solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E
5|$|The Andes play {{a crucial}} role in {{determining}} the climate of Patagonia because their north–south orientation creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean. Since the predominant wind is from the west and most air masses come from the Pacific Ocean, the Andes cause these air masses to ascend, cooling adiabatically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, resulting in abundant precipitation, while in much of the Argentine side, the air <b>warms</b> adiabatically and becomes drier as it descends. As a result, the Andes create an extensive rain-shadow in much of Argentine Patagonia, causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52oS, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain shadow effect in Tierra del Fuego Province, allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of a {{thunderstorm}} is the cumulus stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as cumulus clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which <b>warms</b> the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an updraft {{through the process of}} convection (hence the term convective precipitation). This process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|Global <b>warming</b> and its {{importance}} are controversial. While {{a variety of}} estimates exists about the likelihood of global <b>warming</b> and the economic cost, financial market information can provide an objective assessment of expected losses due to global <b>warming.</b> We consider a Merton-type asset pricing model in which asset prices {{are affected by the}} changes in investment opportunities caused by global <b>warming.</b> In this setting, in theory global <b>warming</b> has a negative risk premium and most assets have negative loadings on the global <b>warming</b> factor. Financial assets in sectors that are more sensitive to global <b>warming</b> have more strongly negative loadings. Empirically, utilizing a variant of Campbell and Diebold‟s (2005) weather forecasting model in conjunction with Vassalou‟s (2003) approach for extracting financial market “news”, we obtain the global <b>warming</b> factor.
