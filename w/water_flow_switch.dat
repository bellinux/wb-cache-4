40|$|The {{following}} {{report is}} {{a fire and}} life safety investigation into a new facility. The planned facility is a new Student Center at Taft Community College. The prescriptive requirements as set forth by the most up to date codes and standards chosen for the project are met. The building has been properly classified with respect to occupancy and construction type. Appropriate design for interior partitions and exterior walls have been identified. Interior finish requirements are elaborated so that adherence to these guidelines is made clear. The fire sprinkler system has an adequate supply {{of water from the}} municipal water supply alone to meet the calculated demand of the design area. A fire alarm system is proposed, but the proposed design does not make full use of the benefits of such a system due to reliance on fire sprinklers as a primary means of automatic detection. A third fire system proposed is a kitchen fire suppression system which will be dependent upon the competencies of the installing contractor in meeting the system manufacturer guidelines. Egress components are adequately sized and arranged, and occupant densities throughout the proposed floor plan allow for the fastest occupant movement based on the referenced literature. A performance based analysis has been conducted. Tenability was addressed with regards to visibility, exposure to carbon monoxide, temperature, and flashover conditions. Two design fire scenarios from the 2015 NFPA 101 : Life Safety Code were chosen. The first involved Design Fire Scenario 1, which was modeled as a trash bag fire in an office. Results of this study found that the ASET exceeded RSET. ASET was set by tenability criteria for visibility while RSET was found using hydraulic calculation methods for the compartment where the fire was located. The second fire scenario involved Design Fire Scenario 6, which was modeled by burning bookcases located in a bookstore. ASET exceeded RSET for this study as well. ASET was set by visibility criteria while RSET was set by a full building egress time calculation based on hydraulic calculation methods. Recommendations for improving life safety at the Student Center include: (1) monitoring special events to ensure that neither decorations nor implements impede the means of egress or introduce materials which present a severe fire hazard; (2) resizing an exit within the Bookstore to match a second exit so that occupants can clearly identify this exit as an alternate means of egress; (3) monitoring for any changes in how areas in the Student Center are used to ensure adequacy of exits and egress components; (4) Adding redundancy for the fire sprinkler <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>switch</b> to fire alarm monitor module connection...|$|E
50|$|Invented in Brazil in the 1930s {{and used}} {{frequently}} since the 1940s, the electric shower {{is a home}} appliance often seen in South American countries due to the higher costs of gas distribution. Earlier models were made of chromed copper or brass, which were expensive, but since 1970, units made of injected plastics are popular due to low prices {{similar to that of}} a hair dryer. Electric showers have a simple electric system, working like a coffee maker, but with a larger <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> A <b>flow</b> <b>switch</b> turns on the device when <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> through it. Once the water is stopped, the device turns off automatically. An ordinary electric shower often has three heat settings: low (2.5 kW), high (5.5 kW) or cold (0 W) to use when a central heater system is available or in hot seasons.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{a volume}} of fluid (VOF) model was {{employed}} for microfluidic switch design. The VOF model validity in predicting the interface between fluid streams with different viscosities co-flowing in a microchannel was first verified by experimental observation. It was then extended to microfluidic <b>flow</b> <b>switch</b> design. Two specific <b>flow</b> <b>switches,</b> one with a guided fluid to one of five desired outlet ports, and another with a guided fluid flows into one, two, or three outlet ports equally distributed along the outlet channel of a Y-shaped channel. The <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> was achieved by controlling the flow rate ratios between tested and buffer fluids. The numerical {{results showed that the}} VOF model could successfully predict the <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> phenomena in these <b>flow</b> <b>switches.</b> The numerical results also showed that the flow rate ratio required for <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> depends on the viscosity ratio between the tested and buffer fluids.

40|$|Introduction One of the {{principal}} design considerations in a <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> network {{is the definition of}} a <b>flow.</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>switching</b> uses a network of connection oriented <b>switches</b> that allow <b>flows</b> to be cut-through on their own connection. The granularity of a flow can vary over a wide range from the very fine, for example an individual application level transaction, to the very coarse, such as the aggregated traffic on the next hop between adjacent routing nodes. There are technical trade-offs to be considered together with the constraints of current technology when addressing the question of the appropriate level of aggregation. It appears that all the levels of aggregation have their place in <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> and that the aggregation level should be a parameter available to network designers for optimization. <b>Flows</b> and <b>flow</b> <b>switching</b> networks <b>Flow</b> <b>switching</b> networks are characterized by the combination of conventional store-and-forward routi...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{thromboxane}} B 2 and the stable prostaglandin endoperoxide analogs (15 Z) -hydroxy - 9 α - 11 α - (epoxymethano) prosta - 5 Z, 13 E - dienoic acid (U 44069) and (15 Z) -hydroxy - 11 α, 9 α-(epoxymethano) prosta- 5 Z, 13 E-dienoic acid (U 46619) were tested on <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> across the toad urinary bladder. In {{the presence of}} indomethacin or meclofenamic acid, inhibitors of prostaglandin and thromboxane A 2 synthesis, thromboxane B 2 stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in a dose-dependent manner. U 44069 (1 μM) stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> from 3. 6 ± 0. 8 to 12. 4 ± 1. 2 mg/min per 10 cm 2 hemibladder surface area, while U 46619 (1 μM) stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> from 2. 8 ± 1. 0 to 21. 8 ± 2. 0 mg/min per 10 cm 2. The prostaglandin endoperoxide/thromboxane A 2 antagonist trans- 13 -azaprostanoic acid, an inhibitor of vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow,</b> inhibited thromboxane B 2 - and U 46619 -stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in a dose-dependent manner. The inactive cis- 13 -azaprostanoic acid did not inhibit vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in untreated hemibladders and {{had no effect on}} U 46619 -stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in indomethacin or meclofenamic acid pretreated hemibladders. U 46619 (1 μM) enhanced vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in indomethacin pretreated hemibladders, producing a significant parallel shift (P < 0. 001) in the dose-response relationship to submaximal concentrations of vasopressin (0. 1 - 0. 6 mU/ml), while not affecting <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> stimulated by supramaximal concentrations of vasopressin (10 mU/ml). trans- 13 -Azaprostanoic acid abolished the potentiating effects of U 46619 on vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> These results show that thromboxane A 2 -like compounds stimulate <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in the toad urinary bladder...|$|R
40|$|A lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) {{is applied}} to {{problems}} of dispersion in two-dimensional <b>water</b> <b>flows.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is modelled by shallow water equations. A two-distribution lattice Boltzmann equation algorithm is presented to solve the pollutant transport problem {{within the framework of}} shallow <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> One distribution models the shallow <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> The other distribution models the pollutant transport. Flow characteristics and concentration profiles of dispersive species are obtained at various flow regimes. For fast <b>water</b> <b>flow,</b> the concentration profiles are highly affected by the flow advection and become completely different from those at slow <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> Numerical results are presented for pollutant transport in bounded and open channel flows. The proposed LBM is also used to simulate a pollution event in the Strait of Gibraltar.

30|$|In {{traditional}} {{analysis of}} slope stability, overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is not taken into account. As is well known, {{the depth of}} overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is only several centimeters or millimeters, which may have little effect on a stable slope with a large safety factor; however, for a slope in the limiting equilibrium condition, the effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> should not be ignored. This is because the overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> with only several centimeters or millimeters may cause the so-called stable slope to become an unstable slope. Especially, in landslide hazard assessment, not considering the effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> may result in an incorrect assessment and lead to serious damage in the so-called safety area, which is obtained by landslide hazard assessment without consideration {{of the effect of}} overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> on the stability. Thus, {{in order to avoid the}} aforementioned accidents, the effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> should be taken into account in slope stability analysis.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} analyse the {{relationship}} of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> depth with rainfall intensity, the overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in Figure  3 is scaled up in Figure  2.

In Figure  3, the time for overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> to begin to generate t* is given for different rainfall intensities. The figure shows that the larger the rainfall intensity, the higher the overland flow depth. The depth of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> increases with increase rainfall duration time and then becomes nearly constant. Here, the depth of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is quite small, several centimeters or millimeters, and the result is in accordance with the actual case.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Conventional fault {{detection}} and diagnosis in water chillers needs <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> measurements to calculate system load. However, {{the measurement of}} <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> meters usually fluctuates greatly, and high accuracy flow meters are very expensive. In this paper, a novel modelling method using a new reference model for {{fault detection}} and diagnosis in water chillers was developed, and the real evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate {{was replaced by a}} pseudo evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate that was equal to the designed evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate or the average evaporator flow rate under stable operation conditions. The new-developed reference model was validated by the data sets from ASHRAE 1043 -RP. The validation results showed that the new developed reference model has good prediction accuracy and clear diagnosis rules, which can be used for fault detection and diagnosis in water chillers in the absence of <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> measurements.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{endogenous}} kallikrein-kinin system's {{role as a}} modulator of vasopressin action in the toad urinary bladder. Kalli-krein inhibition by aprotinin, which results in decreased kinin production, significantly increased both vasopressin and 8 -Br-cyclic (c) AMP-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> Kinin potentiation by the kininase II inhibitor captopril (SQ 14225) significantly decreased vasopressin and 8 -Br-cAMP-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> In contrast to <b>water</b> <b>flow,</b> vasopressin-stimulated urea permeability was decreased by aprotinin and increased by captopril.
