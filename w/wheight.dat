40|$|Com o objetivo de verificar se o uso da pilocarpina produz diferença na velocidade da regeneração hepática empreendemos um estudo experimental. Sabe-se que em ratos salivectomizados a regeneração do fígado fica diminuída. Sabe-se também que a pilocarpina aumenta a salivação destes animais. Na primeira etapa determinamos a dose de pilocarpina a ser utilizada. Na segunda etapa do projeto foram {{realizadas}} as hepatectomias ressecando em média 52, 8 % do fígado. Nossos resultados demonstraram que a pilocarpina diminui a perda de peso corporal total ao final de 48 horas pós hepatectomia parcial (p= 0, 55) e também diminui o edema hepático durante sua regeneração (p= 0, 11), mas observamos um peso maior do fígado em regeneração no grupo controle no primeiro dia (p= 0, 016). We {{performed an}} experimental {{study with the}} purpose to verify if the use of pilocarpine produces {{a difference in the}} velocity of the hepatic regeneration. It’s known that in salivectomized rats the regeneration of the liver gets decreased. It’s also known that the pilocarpine increases the salivation of this animals. In the first phase we determined the dose of pilocarpine to be used. In {{the second phase of the}} project we realized the hepactomies, parching 52, 8 % of the liver on average. Our results demonstrated that the pilocarpine decreases the total loss of body <b>wheight</b> at the end of 48 hours after partial hepactomies (p= 0, 55) and also decreases the hepatic edema during its regeneration (p= 0, 11), but we observed a greater <b>wheight</b> of the liver in regeneration in the control group in the first day (p= 0, 016) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} of {{loads and}} traffic {{speed of the}} railways requires a better infrastructure, in order to enable the operation in optimal condition and less traffic interruptions due to maintenance actions. At the same time, the natural resources for the material generally used in the sub-ballast layer, namely the granite are limited, {{taking into account that}} the requirements in terms of stiffness and wearing resistance are very high. The bituminous mixtures can represent a good alternative to this traditional material. They enable the decreasing of sub-ballast thickness, better impermeability, better behaviour under the lorry traffic during construction and an improvement of the infrastructure stiffness and its continuity along the railway that results in less maintenance works. In this study two different structures are compared, one with granular material and the other one with bituminous material as sub-ballast layers. Falling <b>Wheight</b> Deflectometer (FWD) tests were performed in order to establish the structural model. The back-calculation was made using both linear elastic and finite difference method.

40|$|Background and Objective: Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common endocrine diseases. It affects 5 - 8 % of Iranian population and nearly 177 million people worldwide. The disease predisposes to multiple microvascular complications such as neuropathy; retinopathy and nephropathy. Of these; neuropathy is the most common complication. 7 % at the time of diagnosis and 50 % in the patients with 25 years history of disease suffer from neuropathy. Neuropathy can lead to sensory disturbances; foot ulceration; cellulitis; steomyelitis; gangren and amputation. Some people with diabetes experience painful neuropathy leading to impairment of daily function. Autonomic dysfunction is another debilitating complication of the diabetic neuropathy. In this study the relationship between diabetic neuropathy and a number of risk factors was evaluated. Subjects and Methods: 150 patients with type 2 diabetes randomly referred to diabetic clinic of Golestan hospital; Ahvaz, based on Michigan Neuropathic Diabetic Scoring and the nerve conduction study were divided into two groups with and without neuropathy and their relationship with risk factors was evaluated. Result: From 150 patients with diabetes; 39 patients experienced neuropathy and prevalence of neuropathy was 26 %. in the study of neuropathy and various risk factors; significant correlation between neuropathy and Age(p<o. oo 6); duration of disease(p< 0. 001); BMI(p< 0. 05) and MNDS(p< 0. 001) was ststistically remarkable.
