5|$|A bet on {{the game}} between the {{governors}} of Kansas and Virginia was resolved when Virginia Governor Tim Kaine sent a Virginia smoked ham to the Kansas state capitol. Had Virginia Tech won, Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> Kaine an assortment of Kansas beef.|$|E
5|$|During the season, the Rangers were {{interested}} in acquiring Vancouver Canucks forward Pavel Bure. It was reported that Canucks general manager Brian Burke had requested Malhotra {{to be involved in}} a trade that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> him along with Niklas Sundstrom, Dan Cloutier and the Rangers' first-round pick in the 1999 draft in exchange for Bure. However, Rangers general manager Neil Smith refused to include Malhotra and the deal never materialized.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E

5|$|On June 21, 2007, the Athletics {{designated}} him for assignment. A trade {{completed the}} next day, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> Bradley to the Kansas City Royals for Leo Núñez was voided by the Royals {{because he had}} sustained an oblique injury in his last game as an Athletic. He was then traded to the San Diego Padres on June 29, with cash, in exchange for Andrew Brown; {{it was the second}} time those two players had been traded for each other.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Line was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route. The plan <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> Blue Line trains to Huntington, with Yellow Line trains serving Franconia–Springfield. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars {{at the time of}} the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, the Blue Line operated to Huntington on July 4, as part of Metro's special Independence Day service pattern.|$|E
5|$|Cuba was {{of special}} {{importance}} to Southern Democrats, who believed their {{economic and political}} interests would be best served by the admission of another slave state to the Union. The existence of slavery in Cuba, the island's plantation economy based on sugar, and its geographical location predisposed it to Southern influence; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of Southern slaveholders, whose way of life was under fire from Northern abolitionists. Whereas immigration to Northern industrial centers had resulted in Northern control of the population-based House of Representatives, Southern politicians sought to maintain the fragile {{balance of power in}} the Senate, where each state received equal representation. As slavery-free Western states were admitted, Southern politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next slave state. If Cuba were admitted to the Union as a single state, the island <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> two senators and up to nine representatives to Washington.|$|E

5|$|Peter Emmerson, a {{historian}} and {{supporter of the}} desertion theory, asks why Wilson <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> three of his men away at such a precarious moment. JP Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night, when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises {{that it would not}} be out of the ordinary for the major to do so again. In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him. The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and Borrow asked Gooding to go too. Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding.|$|E
5|$|Seattle Seahawks linebacker Mike Curtis {{blocked a}} field goal that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> the game into overtime, guaranteeing a Seahawk victory in what was billed as the “expansion bowl” meeting between two winless, first-year teams. The Buccaneers outgained the Seahawks, 285 yards to 253, but the {{officials}} outgained both, with 310 yards in penalties. The 35 penalties (accepted, 41 were thrown by the officials) were two short of the 25-year-old league record. Each team was penalized for holding eight times. Defensive tackle Pat Toomay complained that “the officials made us look {{like a bunch of}} idiots”. Dan Ryczek was the only Buccaneer lineman not to be called for holding. Tampa Bay running back Louis Carter, stuffed at the goal line, threw the ball to Morris Owens, who dived into the end zone for the first Buccaneer passing touchdown. A tackle by Seahawk punter Rick Engles prevented a touchdown return by Danny Reece that would have won the game for the Buccaneers. An earlier field goal try was blocked by Lyle Blackwood. The game ended with Dave Brown being helped from the field after being hit in the eye by the final penalty flag.|$|E

25|$|A much-publicized {{example for}} this was Devean George, who vetoed his {{inclusion}} into a larger trade during the 2007–08 season that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> him from the Dallas Mavericks to the New Jersey Nets.|$|E
25|$|On the NBA's trade {{deadline}} on February 24, 2011, numerous sports news outlets, including ESPN, {{reported that}} the Pacers had agreed to a three-team trade that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> Josh McRoberts to the Memphis Grizzlies and Brandon Rush to the New Orleans Hornets, while the Pacers would have received O. J. Mayo from the Grizzlies in return, and the Hornets <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> an unidentified player to the Grizzlies. However, the trading period expired at 3:00pm EST, and the trade paperwork did not reach the NBA's main offices for approval until 3:02pm. Thus, the trade was canceled and all aforementioned players remained with their original teams.|$|E
25|$|On November 26, 2011, the Bulldogs lost {{to rival}} Centreville in which Centreville blocked Westfield's {{field goal with}} a minute left. The field goal <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> the game into overtime. This was Centreville's first victory over Westfield since 2001.|$|E

25|$|One {{trade that}} was not {{finalized}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> Mike Lowell and approximately $9 million in cash to the Rangers and the Red Sox would have received AAA catcher Max Ramírez. The trade was cancelled after a physical discovered an injury to Lowell's thumb that would require surgery.|$|E
25|$|Strom's {{final game}} was Game 4 of the 1990 NBA Finals between the Detroit Pistons and Portland Trail Blazers played June 12, 1990 {{in a game}} that saw Strom {{correctly}} wave off Trail Blazers Danny Young's half-court heave that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> the game into OT, had it come before the buzzer.|$|E
25|$|During the {{off season}} the Yankees {{expressed}} interest in trading Burnett. Burnett reportedly invoked his no-trade clause to block a deal that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> him to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for Bobby Abreu. On February 18, the Yankees agreed to trade Burnett to the Pittsburgh Pirates for minor leaguers Exicardo Cayones and Diego Moreno, and to pay $20 million of the remaining $33 million on his contract.|$|E

25|$|At the 1986 Masters, Norman {{started with}} the lead until he double-bogeyed the 10th hole. After making four {{consecutive}} birdies on holes 14 to 17, Norman was tied with Jack Nicklaus going to the 18th. Norman missed a par putt on the 18th that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> the two into a sudden death playoff. At the 1986 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, Norman again led after 54 holes. However, Norman faltered on the final day, finishing with a final round 75 placing him six strokes behind the winner, Raymond Floyd.|$|E
25|$|The Army contributed nine {{infantry}} regiments {{that were}} carried in thirteen transports. An additional 600 or so soldiers were sent aboard the tinclads to defend them, if necessary, from Rebel boarding parties {{that could be}} expected in an operation so deep in enemy territory. Grant <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> more troops, but a shortage of available transports prevented him from doing so. The troops {{were a part of}} the XIII Corps, under the command of Brigadier General Leonard F. Ross. Later, they would be reinforced by a column led by Brigadier General Isaac F. Quinby, who ranked Ross.|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} of the Thera volcano provides a possible time marker for the region. A large eruption, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>sent</b> {{a plume of}} ash directly over Anatolia and filled the sea in the area with floating pumice. This pumice appeared in Egypt, apparently via trade. Current excavations in the Levant may also add to the timeline. The exact date of the volcanic eruption {{has been the subject}} of strong debate, with dates ranging between 1628 and 1520 BCE. Radiocarbon dating has placed it at between 1627BCE and 1600BCE with a 95% degree of probability. Archaeologist Kevin Walsh, accepting the radiocarbon dating, suggests a possible date of 1628 and believes this to be the most debated event in Mediterranean archaeology.|$|E
