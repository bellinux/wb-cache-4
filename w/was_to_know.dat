All technical know-how was at her fingertips: harmonic transposition, the figured bass, score reading, organ registration, instrumental techniques, structural analyses, the school fugue and the free fugue, the Greek modes and Gregorian chant.|$|E
25|$|In the 11th century, {{there were}} three conquests and some Anglo-Saxon people would live through it: one in the {{aftermath}} of the conquest of Cnut in 1016; the second after the unsuccessful attempt of battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066; the third after that of William of Normandy in 1066. The consequences of each conquest can only be assessed with hindsight. In 1016, no-one <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that whatever cultural ramifications were felt then, they would be subsumed half a century later; and in 1066 there was nothing to predict that the effects of William's conquest would be any greater or more lasting than those of Cnut's.|$|E

They would take turns watching the women and, as Marlon recalled, [...] "learned everything there <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about ladies". During other residencies, the siblings would perform Joe Tex's [...] "Skinny Legs and All". Joseph Jackson would instruct a young Michael to make his way into the audience, crawl under tables, lift up ladies' skirts and peek at their panties as part of the performance. Though embarrassed by the task, Jackson feigned enjoyment as he knew the audience loved the routine.|$|E

500|$|In July 1840 he {{attempted}} to fuse his desire to make money with his politics by founding a magazine called the Revue Parisienne, funded by his friend Armand Dutacq. Having already worked in the publishing industry, Balzac believed he had learned all there <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about the trade. [...] "hat gigantic machine known as journalism", he wrote, [...] "is {{as simple as a}} roasting spit turned by a poodle." [...] Balzac planned to publish his own fiction in the Revue Parisienne, in part to challenge the popularity of the roman-feuilleton serial format. Dutacq, however, stopped funding the project in September, after only three issues, and Balzac's final foray into the world of publishing came to an end.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Nagel first {{characterized}} {{the problem of}} qualia for physicalistic monism in his article, [...] "What {{is it like to}} be a bat?". Nagel argued that even if we knew everything there <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> from a third-person, scientific perspective about a bat's sonar system, we still wouldn't know {{what it is like to}} be a bat. However, others argue that qualia are consequent of the same neurological processes that engender the bat's mind, and will be fully understood as the science develops.|$|E

2500|$|He {{noted that}} {{it had never been}} his {{intention}} to abolish Talmudic studies altogether, nor had he ever said that there was no need of the [...] "Halakot" [...] of Rabbi Isaac Alfasi, for he himself had lectured to his pupils on the Gemara and, at their request, upon Alfasi's work (Responsa, No. 140). However, he did state that for the masses {{there was no need for}} Talmud study as the Mishne Torah along with the written Torah would suffice (Introduction to the Mishne Torah). He also stated that in-depth study of Talmudic discussions was [...] "a waste of time" [...] for the sole purpose of study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how to practice the law (Letter to Joseph ben Judah).|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century, {{modifications}} to syllogism were incorporated {{to deal with}} disjunctive ("A or B") and conditional ("if A then B") statements. [...] Kant famously claimed, in Logic (1800), that logic was the one completed science, and that Aristotelian logic more or less included everything about logic there <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> (This work is not necessarily representative of Kant's mature philosophy, which is often regarded as an innovation to logic itself.) Though there were alternative systems of logic such as Avicennian logic or Indian logic elsewhere, Kant's opinion stood unchallenged in the West until 1879 when Frege published his Begriffsschrift (Concept Script). [...] This introduced a calculus, a method of representing categorical statements (and statements that are not provided for in syllogism as well) {{by the use of}} quantifiers and variables.|$|E
2500|$|Drawn by {{the relief}} work {{organised}} by the revolutionaries in August–September 1913, {{in collaboration with}} the Ramakrishna Mission during the flood on the Damodar in the districts of Burdwan, Midnapore and Hooghli, Bhupen met there some of the stalwart collaborators of Jatin Mukherjee. Arun Chandra Guha wrote : [...] "The police had somehow information that behind the facade of relief work, Jatin and other workers were forging a powerful revolutionary organisation." [...] Bhupen <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> later that during the flood relief, at Kalinagar in Medinipur, Atulkrishna Ghosh, Amarendra Chatterjee, Jadugopal Mukherjee and others brought together, under the moral and spiritual caution of Bagha Jatin, the various branches and sub-groups of the secret societies in order to create the rising Jugantar, which was more a concerted movement than a party.|$|E
2500|$|Dimitra Kessenides, {{writing for}} Bloomberg News Weekly, {{identified}} the 'filter-bubble' problem as a recurrent and long-standing issue at Wikipedia. As Kessenides states: [...] "If {{the only way}} to get an article about the developing world published on Wikipedia <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> a former board member, it was hard to imagine how a random editor in Johannesburg or Bangalore would have any hope... This so-called filter-bubble problem, coined by Eli Pariser, co-founder of the viral video site Upworthy, is the idea that the internet can contribute to the insularity of certain communities. Filter bubbles have been blamed for the spread of misinformation during the 2016 presidential election and for the failure of pundits in the U.K. to anticipate Brexit... Wikipedia's filter-bubble problem is a particularly acute threat for an organization whose stated mission is 'to empower and engage people around the world.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|For the First Test against New Zealand Snow {{was told}} by the {{chairman}} of the selectors Alec Bedser that he was dropped so that they could watch Alan Ward in a Test match, but Illingworth rang {{in the middle of the}} Essex vs Sussex match to tell Snow straight that he was dropped for disobeying his orders in the Test. Snow was particularly annoyed as a television firm had arranged to film him at Lord's to make a fifteen-minute programme with John Betjeman about his poem Lords' Test, which was now cancelled. [...] The immediate recipients of Snow's wrath were Essex (6/20) and Hampshire (5/29 & 5/51) to give Sussex their first two wins of the season. He and Illingworth sorted out their differences and [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> exactly where I stood with him as did every other player who came under his captaincy". He was recalled for the Second and Third Tests, which were won easily, but Snow took only 3 wickets (51.33), but by dint of being out only once that summer he averaged 50.00 with the bat. In 1969–71 Snow would make 276 runs (34.50) in Tests, so could be regarded as an all-rounder.|$|E
