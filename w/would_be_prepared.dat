5|$|Among the {{northern}} Polynesian people, Vega {{was known as}} whetu o te tau, the year star. For a period of history it marked the start of their new year when the ground <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for planting. Eventually this function became denoted by the Pleiades.|$|E
5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> either way.|$|E
5|$|Bethesda's Todd Howard first {{confirmed}} during E3 2008 that downloadable content (DLC) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for the Xbox 360 and Windows {{versions of}} Fallout 3. There are five DLCs: Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt, Broken Steel, Point Lookout, and Mothership Zeta, released in that order. Of the five, Broken Steel {{has the largest}} effect on the game, altering the ending and allowing the player to continue playing past {{the end of the}} main quest line.|$|E

50|$|On July 3, Skarf {{announced}} that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> visiting Singapore to hold a one-day restaurant food event. Skarf themselves <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>preparing</b> the food that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sold for that day and stated that the earnings from the event will be donated to charity.

5|$|In 1919, local {{politicians}} {{proposed that the}} line be built administratively {{as part of the}} Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government. Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need for standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for standard gauge.|$|E
5|$|Morton and {{his colleagues}} {{anticipated}} that copies {{of the new book}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> quickly. However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV returned from a trip to Australia where he realized that some changes should be made to the written Tongan language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with Tongan grammar. For a year, he studied the language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945. The Tongan version of the Book of Mormon was published in April 1946.|$|E
5|$|The John Bull had {{remained}} on static display for another 15 years, but the locomotive's significance {{as one of}} the oldest locomotives in existence, or its use on the first railroad in New Jersey, was not very plainly noted in the display's literature. As 1981 and the locomotive's 150th birthday approached, the Smithsonian started discussions on how best to commemorate the locomotive's age and significance. There was very little question that special publications and exhibits <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared,</b> but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit could still be so much more than that.|$|E
50|$|Later, in 1955, {{there was}} another crisis {{involving}} the possible invasion of Taiwan by Communist China. Marine Banshees were chosen for secret overflights of areas where the Communist Chinese <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>preparing</b> such an invasion. Unlike the purposed photo-flights over the Soviet Union in 1952, these missions were escorted by other Marine Banshee fighters based in South Korea. Twenty-seven missions took place without incident.|$|R

5|$|The {{decision}} immediately put 14,528 Avro employees, as well {{as nearly}} 15,000 other employees in the Avro supply chain of outside suppliers, out of work. Declassified records show Avro management was caught unprepared by the suddenness of the announcement by the government; while executives were aware that the program was in jeopardy, they expected it to continue until the March review. It was widely believed during this lead-up to the review, the first Arrow MkII, RL-206, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for an attempt at both world speed and altitude records.|$|E
5|$|By early 1101, Henry's {{new regime}} was {{established}} and functioning, {{but many of}} the Anglo-Norman elite still supported Robert, or <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to switch sides if Henry's elder brother appeared likely to gain power in England. In February, Flambard escaped from the Tower of London and crossed the Channel to Normandy, where he injected fresh direction and energy to Robert's attempts to mobilise an invasion force. By July, Robert had formed an army and a fleet, ready to move against Henry in England. Raising the stakes in the conflict, Henry seized Flambard's lands and, with the support of Anselm, Flambard was removed from his position as bishop. Henry held court in April and June, where the nobility renewed their oaths of allegiance to him, but their support still appeared partial and shaky.|$|E
5|$|In French medieval cuisine, banquets {{were common}} among the aristocracy. Multiple courses <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared,</b> but {{served in a}} style called service en confusion, or all at once. Food was {{generally}} eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, {{and it was not}} until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.|$|E

5|$|In July 1999, Nader {{was let go}} from All My Children due to {{budgetary}} considerations, however, {{he later}} returned in May 2000. The following year, the actor's arrest brought him and the character {{to the center of}} a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists, as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of People and Entertainment Tonight, among other media outlets. As a result, Nader was let go again by the soap opera, with an official statement saying they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues. The role was temporarily recast with actor Anthony Addabbo, who was negatively received by viewers, and let go shortly after his debut. Nader later stated in an interview that ABC had informed him that they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back {{due to a lack of}} storyline. In 2004, Nader's suit was subsequently thrown out. In May 2013, after a twelve-year absence from All My Children, Nader was announced to be reprising the role, with his return airing on June 12, 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Arthur's arrival, Nova Scotia Power prepared and collected resources {{in case of}} power outages and other impacts in the region. Numerous weekend events were called off throughout the Canadian Maritimes, including the Stan Rogers Folk Festival. Multiple boat-owners and fisherman took extra precautions by battening down hatches and tying extra lines to wharves to keep ships and boats from coming loose in the storm. Environment Canada officials issued high wind warnings in addition to earlier tropical storm warnings for the Maritimes and considered imposing rainfall warnings for western portions of Prince Edward Island as well. Province-managed parks in Nova Scotia, including beaches and camping grounds, were shut down prior to Arthur's arrival, and several airlines waived transfer fees. Officials in Moncton stated that city personnel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to respond to potential issues caused by Arthur, such as flooding or fallen trees, while the Canadian Red Cross readied volunteers in case {{of the need for}} emergency assistance. The Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station took precautionary measures against the storm, with Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission employees deployed to the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} threatened another dissolution if {{the bill}} for the Parliament Act were not passed, and followed through on their threat when opposition in the Lords did not diminish. The general election of December produced little change from January. The calling of a second dissolution of parliament now {{seems to have been}} contrary to the wishes of Edward VII. Edward had died in May 1910 while the crisis was still in progress. His successor, George V, was asked if he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to create sufficient peers, which he would only do if the matter arose. This would have meant creating over 400 new Liberal peers. The King did, however, demand that the bill would have to be rejected at least once by the Lords before his intervention. Two amendments made by the Lords were rejected by the Commons, and opposition to the bill showed little sign of reducing. This led Asquith to declare the King's intention to overcome the majority in the House of Lords by creating sufficient new peers. The bill was finally passed in the Lords by 131 votes to 114 votes, a majority of 17. This reflected a large number of abstentions.|$|E
50|$|Servette {{announced}} that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>preparing</b> for the 2012-13 season with friendly matches against Thun, Shakhtar Donetsk, Yverdon-Sport, Étoile Carouge, Lausanne-Sport and Porto. In the transfer market, Servette sold Stéphane Nater and Carlos Saleiro, while Ishmael Yartey and Roderick Miranda were recalled to Benfica from their loan spells. Servette bolstered its ranks by signing Geoffrey Tréand, Alexandre Pasche, Christopher Mfuyi, Kevin Gissi, Simone Grippo, Mike Gomes, and Samir Ramizi. Servette also brought in Genséric Kusunga, Steven Lang, and Kelvin on loan for the season.|$|R
50|$|In February 2017, {{after his}} {{performances}} for both Chennaiyin in the Indian Super League and DSK Shivajians in the I-League, India head coach Stephen Constantine called Lalrinzuala {{up to the}} senior team. He <b>would</b> <b>be</b> part of the 31 player preparatory camp that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>preparing</b> for India's first AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Myanmar and their friendly against Cambodia.

Commentators said that fear of a minority government was a factor in the government's strong showing, which appears to have resulted from a swing to Labor in the last week of the campaign.|$|E
