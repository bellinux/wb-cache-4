40|$|Alternative {{globalisation}} activists, who {{are opposed}} to cultural uniformity, promote respect for difference as one of their main values. In order to blend this appreciation of diversity with the various factions of the movement, activists have created a new ideal convergence model: the <b>Social</b> <b>Forums.</b> Three main characteristics apply: an inclusive atmosphere with respect for diversity, the organisation of “open spaces” and the non-deliberative nature of meetings. Though activists aim to live by these principles, the model remains no less ideal, because this way of acting it out expresses the values of alternative globalisation utopias and is impossible to recreate in real-world meetings, which as a result both of the behaviour of the parties involved and of structural limitations inherent to the model. Rather than an organisation that encompasses all factions of the alternative globalisation movement, <b>World</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forums</b> provide platforms for debate and flexible coordination allowing activists to work together in an environment respectful of differences. However, certain aspects of the expansion of these <b>World</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forums</b> – their increasing size, the growing burden of their organisation, their institutionalisation or internal shortcomings in their democratic process – may pose a threat...|$|R

40|$|Local {{manifestations of}} Occupy Wall Street (OWS) have emerged {{around the world}} with enthusiasm for the {{participatory}} style used in Zuccotti Park (New York). However, less {{attention has been paid to}} earlier lessons about the limits of these techniques for building diverse and sustainable movements. Much of the discussion in the United States ignores how OWS is connected to the long-term and global struggle against corporate-led globalization. Also, models of consensus practiced in many OWS sites have become reified to the verge of fetishization. Activists in the U. S. have yet to effectively incorporate many lessons from global justice activism, including the need for a global analysis and strategy as well as greater sensitivity to how consensus practices can exclude people most harmed by the structures the movement opposes. This essay draws from our involvement in Occupy Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) and in the U. S. and <b>World</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forums</b> (WSF) to compare the participatory democratic practices in each setting and identify lessons about organizing broad coalitions against capitalist globalization.

25|$|Porto Alegre was {{the seat}} of the <b>World</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2010. As the second largest city in {{southern}} Brazil, it is an important industrial center in the area. It is also a center for gaúcho (the popular name for natives of the state) history and culture, famous for its churrasco (barbecue) and chimarrão (a strong and hot tea prepared from erva mate). Important Brazilian universities, such as Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Universidade Federal de Ciências da Saúde de Porto Alegre (UFCSPA) and Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS) are there. In 2000, the literacy rate was 97%. The high quality of life is one of the city's main features.|$|E
25|$|The fifth <b>World</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> 2005 {{was held}} in Porto Alegre, Brazil between 26 January and 31 January.

40|$|Drawing on {{empirical}} {{research on the}} alter-globalization movement conducted between 1999 and 2010 and on interview and field work on the indignados and Occupy Wall Street movements, this paper will analyze the forms of emerging forms of global citizenship {{that are at the}} core of the two main trends of the movement. On one side, actors of the “way of reason” seek to combine a legitimacy based on the quality of arguments (Habermas) with the promotion of active citizenship. It results in a structural tension between the necessary delegation to experts and the promotion of citizens’ participation. On the other side, activists of the « way of subjectivity » focus on “lived experience”. Contrarily to expertise, lived experience can’t be delegated (McDonald, 2006). Activists have thus experimented forms of direct democracy. While often innovative, they nevertheless face important limits. Both of these trends develop important mechanisms of a counter-democracy (Rosanvallon). While many activists develop their culture of politics in opposition to representative democracy, this paper will conceptualize forms of legitimacy based on representation, arguments and direct participation as complementary. Taken together, they offer concrete ways forward for a multi-dimensional approach to a complex and multi-level democratic system. After underlining the tensions and cross-fertilization between these two trends in the <b>world</b> <b>social</b> <b>forums</b> and the alter-globalization movement, this paper will suggest evolutions, continuities and ruptures of these two logics of action among the indignados/occupiers mobilizations. The paper will draw on case studies, interviews and observations in the United States (2 nd US <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> & Occupy Wall Street) and London as well as qualitative data collected at the <b>World</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forums</b> and in Mexico, France, Belgium and Spain...|$|R

The overriding question in this paper concerns the ways mainstream media of very different societieshave re-constructed the global and local issues addressed by the Forums. Of the four market-oriented economies, Communist China and Post-Socialist Russia stand out as being almost silent about the WSF, favouring economic globalization - seemingly at odds with cultural globalization.

25|$|The first <b>World</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> {{was held}} from 25 January to 30 January 2001 in Porto Alegre, Brazil, {{organized}} by many groups including the French Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens (ATTAC). The WSF was sponsored, in part, by the Porto Alegre government, {{led by the}} Brazilian Worker's Party (PT). The town was experimenting with an innovative model for local government which combined the traditional representative institutions with the participation of open assemblies of the people. 12,000 people attended from around the world. At the time, Brazil was also {{in a moment of}} transformation that later would lead to the electoral victory of the PT candidate Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. This first meeting was focused on gathering anti-globalization activists {{from all over the world}} to talk and organize amongst one another, while subsequent meetings have been more focused on specific ways to counter neoliberalism.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>World</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> (WSF) in Mumbai (21 January 2004), he lent {{his support}} to the {{alternative}} globalisation movement. Addressing the forum at its concluding session, he praised the WSF for demanding freedom in its most comprehensive form, and was happy that people had assembled under an important idea, rather than for narrow political ends; after reflecting on corporations displacing governments in various countries, and on how Mahatma Gandhi had fought British colonisers non-violently with {{the strength of the}} masses, he predicted that vocal masses the world over would successfully fight by non-violent means the capturing of the world's resources by a few corporations in the name of globalisation. He urged the people to struggle against power corporates and militarism and fight those aspects of globalisation which were against the interests of the people; he hailed people's power as a renascent factor of international politics.|$|E
25|$|The fourth WSF {{was held}} in Mumbai, India, from 16 January to 21 January 2004. It was {{the first meeting of}} the <b>World</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forum</b> held outside Brazil and its success has {{encouraged}} the WSF to expand in scope across the global South. Some credit it with inspiring the Asian Social Forum held in November of that year. The attendance was expected to be 75,000 and it shot over by thousands. The cultural diversity was one notable aspect of the forum. A notable decision that was taken was the stand on free software. One of the key speakers at the WSF 2004 was Joseph Stiglitz. In contrast to earlier meetings, which had focused more on Euro-centric political intellectualism, the 2004 meeting included marches, as well as colorful and lively demonstrations. Indian activists were also very active in using this time to educate others about the issues of caste, class and religious conflict in India, with particular focus on the plight of the Dalit, sometimes referred to as the 'untouchables' in Indian society.|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainability}} {{question is}} embedded in the political economy of neo-liberal modernisation; a relentless drive for economic growth, which rolls over the borders of once sovereign states. EU enlargement is a testament to it. And this transnational corporate push, helped along by so called advanced democracies in the North and their financial institutions- IMF, World Bank, and WTO, makes us all members- de facto- of a single global society. Our lives now, from Italian housewives to Chinese factory girls, from Aboriginal Australians to New York art dealers, are increasingly interdependent, and the circle of our citizen responsibility grows. So I’d like to begin by acknowledging the <b>World</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forums,</b> originating in Port...|$|R
