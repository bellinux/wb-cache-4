40|$|Background A {{clinical}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the intra and inter-rater reliability of digital scanning and the neutral suspension casting technique to measure six foot parameters. The neutral suspension casting technique is a commonly utilised method for obtaining a negative impression of the foot prior to orthotic fabrication. Digital scanning offers an alternative to the traditional plaster of Paris techniques. Methods Twenty one healthy participants volunteered {{to take part in the}} study. Six casts and six digital scans were obtained from each participant by two raters of differing clinical experience. The foot parameters chosen for investigation were cast length (mm), forefoot <b>width</b> (<b>mm),</b> rearfoot <b>width</b> (<b>mm),</b> medial arch height (mm), lateral arch height (mm) and forefoot to rearfoot alignment (degrees). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to determine the intra and inter-rater reliability. Measurement error was assessed through the calculation of the standard error of the measurement (SEM) and smallest real difference (SRD). Results ICC values for all foot parameters using digital scanning ranged between 0. 81 - 0. 99 for both intra and inter-rater reliability. For neutral suspension casting technique inter-rater reliability values ranged from 0. 57 - 0. 99 and intra-rater reliability values ranging from 0. 36 - 0. 99 for rater 1 and 0. 49 - 0. 99 for rater 2.

40|$|The {{causes of}} lower treelines in the Intermountain West {{are not entirely}} understood. Little is known about how conifer trees adjust their {{structural}} morphology at lower treeline as they experience increased drought-conditions with decreasing elevation. We hypothesized that as elevation decreases, hydraulic transport capability decreases, because trees design their xylem structure more for safety against cavitation rather than for transport efficiency under drier conditions. To test this hypothesis, branch samples were collected from Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) along an elevation gradient from 1700 m elevation to 2100 m elevation. Cross sections were then sliced off of the Douglas-fir tree branches and placed onto microscope slides. The cross sections were then imaged with a confocal microscope and uploaded to an image analysis program (ImageJ). Using ImageJ, the number of growth rings, ring <b>width</b> (<b>mm),</b> number of trachieds, trachied area (mm), and trachied density were determined for each cross section. We found that Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir make adjustments in various hydraulic and morphological parameters at the branch-level with decreasing elevation. Branches at lower treeline had structural characteristics that suggested greater resistance to hydraulic dysfunction created by increasing xylem tension, but also exhibit trade-offs in decreased water transport efficiency. These elevation gradients had a clear effect on branch hydraulic transport ability and morphological traits...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the width of the {{temporomandibular}} (TM) joint capsule and the thickness of the masseter muscle (MM), with high resolution ultrasound in patients without TM-joint-associated diseases. MethodsFrom April 8, 2011 to June 10, 2011, 42 patients without TM disorders were recruited and examined with a real-time 12 -MHz linear-array scanner. The maximum thickness of capsular width of the TM joint was measured in the closed mouth position. The thickness of MM was also measured at both rest and maximum contraction. ResultsA total of 84 joints were included. The mean (± standard deviation) TM joint capsular width was 1. 9  ±  0. 4  mm; MM thickness at rest was 9. 0  ±  1. 9  mm; and MM thickness during occlusion on maximal force was 11. 8  ±  2. 8  mm with an increased ratio of 33  ±  25 %. No significant differences were found with regard to the laterality in TM joint capsular <b>width,</b> <b>MM</b> thickness at rest and during maximal occlusion, or augmented MM thickness ratio. There was no difference in the increased ratio of MM between sex, however, the MM thickness at rest and during maximal occlusion was greater in male than in female patients.

40|$|In carabid beetles, {{physiological}} and behavioural characteristics reflect specific habitat demands {{and there is}} a strong correlation between body form and habit in species with different life style. In this study, we compared the morphometry and compound eye characteristics of three species of the genus Siagona: S. jenissoni, S. dejeani and S. europaea. These carabids have a stenotopic lifestyle in Mediterranean clayey soils, inhabiting the ground fissure system formed during the dry season. All species have a Mediterranean distribution and are nocturnal olfactory hunters, and are strict ant predators. For morphometric measurements, we considered body length (mm), wing length (mm), antenna length (mm), head <b>width</b> (<b>mm),</b> trochanter length (mm), number of ommatidia, eye surface area (mm 2), ommatidia density (number of ommatidia/mm 2 of eye surface area), head height (mm), thorax height (mm) and abdomen height (mm). The data revealed intersexual and interspecific differences. The three species differ in relative length of the antennae, density and number of ommatidia and relative trochanter length. Significant differences occurred in wing sizes, which are well developed in S. europaea, the only species capable of flight. When eye size is compared with other ground beetles of various lifestyles, Siagona shows pronounced “microphthalmy” an adaptation to subterranean life in clayey crevices of tropical and subtropical climates with a marked dry season...|$|E
40|$|The {{lesser kestrel}} is {{recognized}} as âLeast Concernâ in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List since 2011. So far, all available diet studies on the lesser kestrel were conducted in its European range or in partial African breeding and nonbreeding range. In particular, {{little is known about}} the feeding behavior of this small falcon in Asian ranges. Thus, this study can be considered as the first to examine the diet composition of the central Asian breeding populations of lesser kestrels. This study aims to provide some information about the diet composition of this species among Asian populations through biological and ecological investigations. Pellets (nÂ = 762) dropped by lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) were collected during their breeding season from nine to 10 colony sites in Ikh Nart, between June and September of 2009 and 2010, and analyzed. A total of 1, 484 prey items were identified in the pellets collected. After a measure of their weight (g) and length and <b>width</b> (<b>mm),</b> we carefully examined each pellet and separated all prey remains using tweezers. Our results indicated that insects (including orthopterans and coleopterans) were dominant in lesser kestrelâs diets. We found that the lesser kestrelâs diet mainly consisted of insects (69. 7 %), lizards (17. 4 %), small mammals (10 %), small birds (2 %), and other food (1 %).

40|$|A {{study of}} quality traits of duck and goose eggs {{selected}} from {{different areas of}} Oyo metropolis, Southern Guinea Zone of Nigeria was investigated. A total number of 480 eggs (240 each of duck and goose eggs) {{were used for the}} study and 20 each of the species eggs were taken for measurement on weekly bases. Data were obtained on quality traits such as egg weight (g), egg length (mm), egg <b>width</b> (<b>mm),</b> shell weight (g), shell thickness, yolk weight (g), yolk length (mm), yolk height (mm), yolk circumference (mm), yolk index, albumen weight (g), albumen height (mm), albumen index and haugh unit. Significant (P< 0. 05) effect was observed between the quality traits measured and the eggs from duck and goose. Duck eggs were better for egg weight (70. 45 g), egg length (62. 34 mm), shell weight (7. 80 g), shell thickness (0. 49) and shell index (67. 35) than the goose eggs. Most of the internal quality traits were also in favoured of ducks eggs for yolk weight (30. 50 g), yolk length (54. 88 mm), yolk circumference (6. 66 mm), yolk index (33. 89), albumen index (7. 89) and haugh unit (73. 24) than the goose eggs while only albumen height was better for goose eggs of value 4. 49 mm. It can be concluded that there are significant variability in most of quality traits observed which favoured the duck eggs than eggs from goose...|$|E
