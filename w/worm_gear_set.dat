In order to substitute for the bronze, {{a new kind of}} antifriction composite material of polymer-matrix, ZW- 1 material has been successfully developed. Compared with <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of bronze, <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material has made <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission possess many advantageous properties. In order to bring the excellent properties of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material into play and substitute for bronze, the test for anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material under static load has been made. A simple test-bed is designed. The test has been carried out under static load. The test of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> with ZW- 1 and nylon materials, different teeth numbers、tooth width and tooth forms is made. The test findings show that in the test conditions the invalidation of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is radial fracture in gear rim. Applying stress transmission theory and micrographic analysis, fracture mechanism of ZW- 1 material is found out, namely degumming on the interface between fiber and polymer. Anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material is twenty three times as much as that of bronze worm gear(Q/ZB 125 - 73). Archimedes <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> has the same anti-fracture capacity as arc tooth <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material. Macrographic analysis shows that load concentration and contact stress concentration of bolt hole caused by bending bolt are significant factors which affect invalidation of <b>worm</b> <b>gear.</b> The test result shows an important fact that overlapping coefficient of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is much higher than that of calculating in theory, for small modulo of elasticity has a good effect upon the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear...</b>|$|R

40|$|For people {{bound to}} a wheelchair, {{the ability to}} elevate one 2 ̆ 7 s legs {{is as much a}} comfort concern as it is a health concern. The {{elevation}} of one 2 ̆ 7 s legs changes the user 2 ̆ 7 s sitting position, thereby increasing their comfort level {{while at the same time}} increasing circulation, ultimately aiding in the prevention of pressure sores and lower extremity swelling. Unfortunately, the motion of current legrests on manual wheelchairs does not accurately match the motion of the user 2 ̆ 7 s lower leg. This mismatch of motion causes the legrest to push up on the leg, shortening it while applying torque to the hip. An elevating/articulating wheelchair legrest that consisted of a planar sixbar linkage coupled with a <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> was designed and manufactured to address the shortcomings of standard elevating legrests. The legrest prototype elevates and articulates simultaneously from a single user interface, allowing the user 2 ̆ 7 s leg to be straight in the elevated position. The prototype design was evaluated by a potential user, his nurse, and the Director of Rehabilitation Engineering at the Massachusetts Hospital School. The collective response from this evaluation was very favorable. The design was successful in meeting the design specifications.

The drive of this project was to develop a 0 g mechanism which would provide a senior citizen or an individual with limited upper body strength, with the ability to cut through branches that would otherwise pose challenging. The design would allow the end user to cut a branch by simply pulling a trigger. A branch cutting attachment was designed to attach to the front of a DeWALT cordless impact gun. This attachment will convert the rotational torque and motion from the impact gun into a shearing motion which can be utilized by a set of cutting blades to cut through the branches. This conversion came through a <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> that simultaneously changes the rotational direction of motion and increases the output torque of the impact gun through the gear set. The cutter was constructed from lightweight aluminum to keep the weight down as it is a hand held tool and was also designed to be easily attached and detached from the impact gun for ease of use. The design incorporated off the shelf blades so that in the event a blade was damaged during use a new blade was easy to obtain. Through testing {{it was found that the}} cutting attachment performed well on a variety of tree branch types and sizes up to 1 - 1 / 8 ”.

40|$|Transmission {{error is}} a measure of the {{positioning}} accuracy of a gear system. This has been widely documented in gearing for many years as the source of problems in noise and vibration. It is a result of errors in the contact conditions which affect the driven gear with respect to the rotation of the driver gear. This research aims to present a better understanding of the basic kinematics of worm gear systems by identifying the significant influences which determine the contact conditions. A literature review of existing theory is described which determines the major areas considered in worm gear contact analysis. Formulae are derived which quantify the effect of component parameter variation on contact. An investigation of the design, manufacture, and operating processes is recorded which identifies error sources relative to the theoretical contact condition. A computer program is developed which calculates contact characteristics such as worm and wheel component form, transmission error and contact marking pattern for a given design including any contact error sources. Computer calculations are validated by comparing direct measurements of these characteristics from several manufactured gear sets with synthesised results produced using the design information, machine settings and error sources detected during production. The behaviour of these gear sets during operation under a torque load has been investigated experimentally. Measured transmission error data from a test rig is used to develop a basic model of worm gear deformation under load. This model has been added to the computer program to improve and extend the analysis capability. The test rig has also been used to investigate the effect of initial wear on contact characteristics. The good correlation between calculated and experimental results shows that the characteristics of a <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> can be predicted once all elements of the design and manufacture are known. The results also validate the software as a useful design tool for academic and industrial applications. Important conclusions are drawn on design techniques, the manufacturing process, and the effects of operating under load. Further areas of investigation are identified which offer future research an opportunity to expand upon these conclusions...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> drives usually show run-in capable {{material}} pairing. In {{most cases}} the worm is made of case hardened steel and the worm wheel of copper-tin alloy. This choice of material leads to an effective avoidance of the appearance of scuffing. The wear of the worm wheel, which is desirable in the running-in phase, limits, along with the known load carrying capacities of other gear types, the life expectancy of the <b>gear</b> <b>set.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to optimize the copper-tin alloys of the worm wheel with respect to the wear properties. Extensive tests on <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> drives with different copper-tin alloys allow statements concerning the effects of varying the different material parameters to the wear behaviour. The result is a wear optimized worm wheel material and an extended load carrying capacity calculation. Furthered load carrying capacity calculation makes a contribution which forms the existing calculation procedure more accurately. The derivation of a statistical evaluation procedure for the test results leads to a wear life expectancy with a specification of an appearance probability. The physical based wear parameter allows the prediction of the wear behaviour of copper-tin alloys using the material properties. Detailed measurements of the power losses in the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> drives make possible the calculation of the tooth coefficient of friction of the various material pairing. The introduced order- and purchase regulations guarantee, that in the future, the optimized bronze can be reproduced and supplied. (orig.)
