40|$|Organic {{chemistry}} applications on digital microfluidic devices often involve reagents {{that are}} volatile or sensitive {{and must be}} introduced to the chip immediately before use. We present a new technique for automated, on-demand loading of ∼ 1 μL droplets from large (∼ 1 mL), sealed, off-chip reservoirs to a digital microfluidic chip {{in order to address}} this challenge. Unlike aqueous liquids which generally are non-wetting to the hydrophobic surface and must be actively drawn into the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chip by electrode activation, organic liquids tend to be wetting and can spontaneously flood the chip, and hence require a retracting force for controlled liquid delivery. Using a combination of compressed inert gas and gravity to exert driving and retracting forces on the liquid, the simple loading technique enables precise loading of droplets of both wetting and non-wetting liquids in a reliable manner. A key feature from a practical point of view is that all of the <b>wetted</b> <b>parts</b> are inexpensive and potentially disposable, thus avoiding cross-contamination in chemical and biochemical applications. We provide a theoretical treatment of the underlying physics, discuss the effect of geometry and liquid properties on its performance, and show repeatable reagent loading using the technique.

40|$|A {{corrosion}} study involving high-alloy {{materials and}} concentrated hydrofluoric acid (HF) {{was conducted in}} support of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Conversion Project (CP). The purpose of the test was to obtain a greater understanding of the corrosion rates of materials of construction currently used in the CP vs those of proposed replacement parts. Results of the study will help formulate a change-out schedule for CP parts. The CP will convert slightly less than 40 kg of {sup 233 }U from a gas (UF{sub 6 }) sorbed on sodium fluoride pellets to a more stable oxide (U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 }). One by-product of the conversion is the formation of concentrated HF. Six moles of highly corrosive HF are produced for each mole of UF{sub 6 } converted. This acid is particularly corrosive to most metals, elastomers, and silica-containing materials. A common impurity found in {sup 233 }U is {sup 232 }U. This impurity isotope has several daughters that make the handling of the {sup 233 }U difficult. Traps of {sup 233 }U may have radiation fields of up to 400 R at contact, a situation that makes the process of changing valves or working on the CP more challenging. It is also for this reason that a comprehensive part change-out schedule must be established. Laboratory experiments involving the repeated transfer of HF through 1 / 2 -in. metal tubing and valves have proven difficult due to the corrosivity of the HF upon contact with all <b>wetted</b> <b>parts.</b> Each batch of HF is approximately 1. 5 L of 33 wt% HF and is transferred most often as a vapor under vacuum and at temperatures of up to 250 C. Materials used in the HF side of the CP include Hastelloy C- 276 and Monel 400 tubing, Haynes 230 and alloy C- 276 vessels, and alloy 400 valve bodies with Inconel (alloy 600) bellows. The chemical compositions of the metals discussed in this report are displayed in Table 1. Of particular concern are the almost 30 vendor-supplied UG valves that have the potential for exposure to HF. These valves have been proven to have a finite life due to failure, most often at the bellows flange ring. It was discovered that the entire bellows assembly was not all alloy 600 but that alloy 600 bellows had been welded to a stainless steel alloy 316 (SS- 316) flange ring. A previous study documents and addresses this problem. 1 The fabricators of the valves immediately corrected the problem and began fabricating all <b>wetted</b> <b>parts</b> of the bellows assembly from alloy 600. At the same time, the fabricators began to make alloy C- 276 valve bodies and stem tips available for sale. This material is known to be superior to the alloy 400 valve bodies and stem tips of the standard UG valves that had already been installed in the CP. A decision was made to purchase alloy C- 276 bodies and stem tips and to change out those alloy 400 components that had already been installed. Due to the enormity of this task (both in terms of time and money), it was desirable to determine the longevity of alloy C- 276 vs alloy 400 components in a side-by-side comparison. Also of interest was the question of how long the new (all-alloy 600) bellows would last in comparison with the original alloy 600 /SS- 316 bellows. A basic HF corrosion test was proposed to compare corrosion rates of several high-alloy materials. Because much of the alloy 400 in the system had been gold plated, some gold-plated alloy 400 coupons were included. Due to time and funding limitations, actual CP variables such as temperature and pressure were not duplicated. Instead, a simple partial-immersion test at ambient temperature was conducted. The purpose of this test was to gain information on the rate of corrosion of different alloys in the CP and to attempt to derive some idea of their expected lifetimes in the operating environment...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the first}} part the {{interfacial}} wetting behaviour of binary liquid mixtures at their liquid-vapor interface is classified. The criteria {{with respect to the}} atomic interactions between the two species are whether the Hamaker constant of that interface fulfills either the sufficient conditions for the absence of a wetting transition, or the necessary conditions for critical wetting, or the necessary conditions either for being wet already at low temperatures or for undergoing a first-order wetting transition upon approaching the critical end point along the triple line. Based on the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model and on the Percus-Yevick theory we scan the parameter space which determines the structure of the bulk phase diagrams. By analyzing the absolute values of the Hamaker constant particular attention is paid to interfacial wetting induced by tricritical points. In addition a comparison of the predictions of the Percus-Yevick theory for the bulk phase diagrams and the number densities of the fluid bulk phases with experimental and simulation data as well as with different theoretical approaches is given. In the second part we analyze the behavior of the line tension at the wetting transition of a fluid on a solid substrate. Using a non-local approach depending only on interaction potentials within the microscopic density functional theory for inhomogeneous fluids and in a local approximation the interface profiles between the non-wetted and the <b>wetted</b> <b>parts</b> of a partial wetted system are calculated for both the cases of first-order wetting transitions and critical wetting transitions. By dividing the density functional for the grand canonical free energy into bulk, surface and line contributions one is able to estimate the microscopic expression for the physical line tension of this system. We insert the obtained interface profiles into the line contribution and calculate numerical values for the line tension, which can be compared for the non-local and local approach. (orig.)

40|$|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is {{considered}} a technology which can help ease the emissions {{associated with the use}} of fossil fuels for energy and industrial processes. In Qatar, rapid industrial expansion has established a need for CCS. Here, saline aquifers represent a potential sink for geologically storing the associated CO 2 emissions. CCS is an important component of meeting carbon emission targets; CO 2 storage in the carbonate reservoirs of the Middle East and elsewhere will become increasingly important. CO 2 can also be used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which consequently brings an economic benefit. However, we know little about how CO 2 behaves when it is mixed with reservoir fluids (hydrocarbons, water, brines) or with carbonate rocks; so we need more research in this area. In particular, the injection of CO 2 into these reservoirs/aquifers depends crucially on the viscosity of the fluids involved. Hence the focus of this research has been on determining experimentally the viscosity and density of aqueous fluids with dissolved CO 2. This thesis details the design, construction, testing and utilisation of a new experimental apparatus for performing measurements at high pressure and high temperature (HPHT). Measurements were made at temperatures between (274. 15 and 448. 15) K, and at pressures up to 100 MPa in the single-phase compressed liquid region. The vibrating-wire technique was used for viscosity determination, with simultaneous measurements of density by means of a vibrating-tube densimeter. <b>Wetted</b> <b>parts</b> were made from Hastelloy-C 276 and Pt-Ir alloy, chosen to resist corrosion. Measurements were first performed on the system (water + CO 2). Following this, mixtures of salt solutions with dissolved CO 2 were measured and the results correlated in useful models which allowed for comparison with literature data where this was possible. Salts investigated include NaCl(aq), CaCl 2 (aq), each at two different concentrations, and lastly, a synthetic Qatari reservoir brine. A correlation based on the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation for viscosity is presented which represents all the data to within ± 3...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} reports {{work performed}} at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{that resulted in a}} major accomplishment by demonstrating the proof-of-concept of the use of a proton exchange membrane or PEM-type electrochemical cell to produce hydrogen via SO{sub 2 }-depolarized water electrolysis. For the first time sulfur dioxide dissolved in liquid sulfuric acid was used to depolarize water electrolysis in a modern PEM cell. The use of such a cell represents a major step in achieving the ultimate goal of an economical hydrogen production process based on the Hybrid Sulfur (HyS) Cycle. The HyS Process is a hybrid thermochemical cycle that may be used in conjunction with advanced nuclear reactors or centralized solar receivers to produce hydrogen by water-splitting. Like all other sulfur-based cycles, HyS utilizes the high temperature thermal decomposition of sulfuric acid to produce oxygen. The unique aspect of HyS is the generation of hydrogen in a water electrolyzer that is operated under conditions where dissolved sulfur dioxide depolarizes the anodic reaction, resulting in substantial voltage reduction. Sulfur dioxide is oxidized at the anode, producing sulfuric acid, that is sent to the acid decomposition portion of the cycle. The focus of this work was to conduct single cell electrolyzer tests in order to prove the concept of SO{sub 2 }-depolarization and to determine how the results can be used to evaluate the performance of key components of the HyS Process. A test facility for conducting SO{sub 2 }-depolarized electrolyzer (SDE) testing was designed, constructed and commissioned. The maximum cell current is 50 amperes, which is equivalent to a hydrogen production rate of approximately 20 liters per hour. The test facility was designed for operation at room temperature with pressures up to 2 bar. Feed to the anode of the electrolyzer can be water, sulfuric acid of various concentrations, or sulfuric acid containing dissolved sulfur dioxide. Provisions are included to allow variation of the operating pressure in the range of 1 to 2 bar. Hydrogen generated at the cathode of the cell can be collected for the purpose of flow measurement and composition analysis. The test facility proved to be easy to operate, versatile, and reliable. Two slightly different SDE's were designed, procured and tested. The first electrolyzer was based on a commercially available PEM water electrolyzer manufactured by Proton Energy Systems, Inc. (PES). The PES electrolyzer was built with Hastelloy B and Teflon <b>wetted</b> <b>parts,</b> a PEM electrolyte, and porous titanium electrodes. The second electrolyzer was assembled for SRNL by the University of South Carolina (USC). It was constructed with platinized carbon cloth electrodes, a Nafion 115 PEM electrolyte, carbon paper flow fields, and solid graphite back plates. Proof-of-concept testing was performed on each electrolyzer at near-ambient pressure and room temperature under various feed conditions. SDE operation was evidenced by hydrogen production at the cathode and sulfuric acid production at the anode (witnessed by the absence of oxygen generation) and with cell voltages substantially less than the theoretical reversible voltage for simple water electrolysis (1. 23 V). Cell performance at low currents equaled or exceeded that achieved in the two-compartment cells built by Westinghouse Electric Corporation during the original development of the HyS Process. Performance at higher currents was less efficient due to mass transfer and hydraulic issues {{associated with the use of}} cells not optimized for liquid feed. Test results were analyzed to determine performance trends, improvement needs, and long-term SDE potential. The PES cell failed after several days of operation due to internal corrosion of the titanium electrodes in the presence of sulfuric acid. Although it was anticipated that the titanium would react in the presence of acid, the rapid deterioration of the electrodes was unexpected. The USC cell was constructed of carbon-based components and had excellent corrosion resistance. However, it was a modified design originally based on gaseous reactants, and it had poor mass transfer characteristics when using liquid sulfuric acid feed with dissolved sulfur dioxide. This resulted in substantially increased polarization losses at higher current densities. Future work will focus on operation at higher temperature and pressure, as well as improved cell designs specifically considering the unique flow conditions for SDE operation...|$|E
