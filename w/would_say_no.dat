500|$|On graduation, Ching-teng enrolls at the National Chiao Tung University. Chia-Yi, {{who did not}} do well on the {{admission}} exam because she was ill on that day, only manages to enter the National Taipei University of Education with her mediocre test results. Depressed and upset, she is consoled by Ching-teng, who calls her long-distance almost every night from the university. During the winter holiday season that year, the two go on their first [...] "date", during which Ching-teng asks Chia-yi if she loves him. However, fearing she <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>no,</b> he decides that he would rather not hear her answer (it is revealed later that her reply would have been [...] "yes"). Ching-teng later organizes a fight night and invites Chia-yi to watch, hoping to impress her with his [...] "strength". On the contrary, Chia-yi finds it childish for Ching-teng to injure himself for no reason. This upsets Ching-teng, sparking a quarrel that causes the two to break up.|$|E

[...] Would such effects as the twin paradox exist if the framework of fixed stars and distant galaxies were not there? [...] Most physicists <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>no.</b> Our ultimate definition of an inertial frame may indeed be that it is a frame having zero acceleration with respect to the matter of the universe at large.")." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 27 August 2006, Nasrallah denied in an {{interview}} with New TV that the capture of the two soldiers was the cause of the war. It only advanced a long planned war for a few months. But he added: [...] "If there was even a 1 percent chance that the July 11 capturing operation would have led to a war like the one that happened, would you have done it? I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>no,</b> absolutely not, for humanitarian, moral, social, security, military, and political reasons. [...] What happened is not an issue of a reaction to a capturing operation… what happened was already planned for. The fact that it happened in July has averted a situation {{that would have been a}} lot worse, had the war been launched in October." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Justice Stephen Breyer {{asked if}} [...] "Congress passes a law {{and it says}} it's a very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by {{building}} a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where {{we will have the}} regular worship in the Puritan religion. Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?" [...] Clement responded [...] "I say no. I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>no,</b> no." [...] Because in his reading of Flast, [...] "You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to go outside the Government." [...] Breyer than asked if [...] "All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, {{we are going to have}} a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?" [...] Clement answered [...] "I think the bottom line is that there would not be taxpayer standing. Plenty of people could probably challenge that [...]" ...|$|E

[...] In an interview with the New York Post, he elaborated, [...] "I got hired as a day player and it turned into a week, and then a month and so on. I was just rolling with it—I mean, who <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> to that?" [...] Mike performed in the glee club's production numbers, but was given very little dialogue, staying mostly [...] "in the background, doing some facial expressions." [...] Shum noted, [...] "It wasn’t until I came on the [...] tour and had this crazy reaction from the audience, and the producers were like, 'Wow, how do they know him? Mike is a senior in the third season of the show. Glee co-creator Ryan Murphy has stated that, due to graduation, [...] "more characters are leaving than are staying" [...] {{at the end of the}} season.

6000|$|Mr. Mason at {{the present}} moment said nothing further, and when Dockwrath pressed him to {{continue}} the conversation in whispers, he distinctly said that he <b>would</b> rather <b>say</b> <b>no</b> more upon the subject just then.
