Two different shaped waveforms, ramp-up and ramp-down waveforms both with relaxation time were applied to investigate the electrodeposition behaviour <b>of</b> <b>Ni-SiC</b> and to validate the {{equivalent circuit}} model. It was found that under the same average and peak current density, the shape of current waveform has {{significant effect on the}} electrodeposition behaviour. A higher instantaneous peak current for charge transfer was obtained by the ramp-up waveform, which results in finer grain size and enhanced hardness of the composites.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{behavior and}} surface morphology <b>of</b> <b>Ni-SiC</b> composite coatings produced by electrodeposition {{with the aid}} of magnetic field were studied. The results of the electrochemical analysis including polarization resistance and potentiodynamic polarization curves showed that a magnetic field of 0. 1 T could significantly improve the corrosion resistance of the composite. The electrochemical impedance spectra revealed that a passive layer was formed on the surface <b>of</b> the <b>Ni-SiC</b> coating with the magnetic field. The microstructures <b>of</b> electrodeposited <b>Ni-SiC</b> composite coatings were also examined. More SiC particles were found to be incorporated into the coating with the presence of magnetic field, which was considered {{to be one of the}} reasons for the enhancement of corrosion resistance as SiC particles were reported to be corrosion inhibitors.

40|$|Micron and submicron-sized SiC-particles (5 and 0. 3 mum respectively) were codeposited with nickel from a Watts electrolyte. The Ni-SiC {{composite}} coatings {{showed a}} better corrosion resistance in a 0. 6 M NaCl solution than nickel electrodeposited {{under the same}} conditions. The corrosion rate <b>of</b> <b>Ni-SiC</b> decreases by two orders of magnitude with respect to pure Ni coatings. This improved corrosion resistance is quite independent of the size and amount of embedded particles, except for the smallest SiC-particles investigated. In that case, the pitting corrosion potential shifts to more noble values indicating a notable reduction of the localized corrosion susceptibility. This improved corrosion resistance <b>of</b> <b>Ni-SiC</b> coatings containing submicrometric SiC-particles is linked {{to a change in}} grain morphology and texture of the coatings. That morphology evolves from columnar grains to small and equiaxed grains. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Nickel based {{composite}} coatings {{have attracted}} {{a lot of}} interest particularly for wear resistant and corrosion resistant applications. Among the various composite coatings <b>Ni-SiC</b> is <b>of</b> special interest as it is commercially used as wear resistant coating in rotary and reciprocating engines. However, at temperatures above 450 oC SiC reacts with the nickel matrix to form brittle nickel silicide which deteriorates the performance <b>of</b> the <b>Ni-SiC</b> coating. Oxide particle reinforced nickel composite coatings can be an alternate to Ni-SiC coating as the distributed phase- oxides are thermally more stable compared to carbides. In the present study, mullite (3 Al 2 O 3. 2 SiO 2) particles have been reinforced in nickel matrix. The advantages <b>of</b> mullite <b>include</b> low thermal conductivity, excellent creep resistance, high-temperature strength, and good chemical stability. The electrodeposition conditions were optimized to obtain maximum particle incorporation. The thermal stability of electrodeposited Ni-mullite coating in terms of microhardness was studied at temperatures upto 800 oC and compared with Ni-SiC coating. The hardness value of as plated electroforms was similar for both Ni-mullite and Ni-SiC coating (400 Hk). A marginal decrease in the microhardness of Ni-mullite coating occurred at temperatures of 600 oC while, significant reduction was observed beyond 400 oC for Ni-SiC coating. Thus, the incorporation of mullite particles in nickel matrix improves its thermal stability to a temperature of 600 oC. The tribological studies showed that the wear volume loss for Ni-mullite coating is 2. 38 X 10 - 5 mm 3 /m while, that <b>of</b> <b>Ni-SiC</b> coating is 9. 58 X 10 - 5 mm 3 /m under identical testing conditions. The corrosion studies using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance studies showed that the corrosion resistance of Ni-mullite coating is better than that <b>of</b> <b>Ni-SiC</b> coating. Thus, from the above studies it can be concluded that Ni-mullite has better wear and corrosion resistance compared to Ni-SiC coating in other words it is a multifunctional coatin...|$|R

In this study, the effect of electrochemical bath parameters such as bath temperature, current density and SiC loading were varied and effect of this variation on the coating thickness and tensile strength <b>of</b> <b>Ni-SiC</b> composite coating was studied.

The experimental results also showed that, the tensile strength of the composite coating containing SiC the is significantly higher than pure Ni coating and the tensile strength increases {{with an increase in}} the percentage of SiC particles in Ni-SiC coatings.

40|$|Electrodeposited Ni–SiC {{composite}} coating is {{the most}} widely used engineering coating. Ni–SiC coating is bestowed with higher wear resistance and microhardness compared to plain nickel. In this study, the feasibility of using sodium hexametaphosphate as a dispersant in the electrodeposition <b>of</b> <b>Ni–SiC</b> composite coating has been investigated. The effect of sodium hexametaphosphate and probe sonication on the microhardness, microstructure and wear resistance <b>of</b> the electrodeposited <b>Ni–SiC</b> composite coating has been studied. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the coatings showed the absence of Na and P elements from sodium hexametaphosphate in the bath. Ni–SiC coating deposited using probe sonication followed by the addition of sodium hexametaphosphate exhibited microhardness as high as 680 HK. The microstructure of the coatings varied with probe sonication and SHMP addition and Ni–SiC–PS–SHMP coating possessed lowest roughness. This study has revealed that a synergistic combination of probe sonication of the electrolyte bath containing particles followed by sodium hexametaphosphate addition enhances the co-deposition of finer SiC particles and thereby enhances the coating properties like microhardness and wear resistance...|$|R
