5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light <b>was,</b> <b>we</b> have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line <b>was,</b> <b>we</b> weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|Early {{discussions on}} {{building}} a dedicated polar exploration ship for the British government had considered replicating Fridtjof Nansen's purpose-built ship Fram but that vessel was {{designed specifically for}} working through the pack ice of the Arctic, while the British ship would have to cross {{thousands of miles of}} open ocean before reaching the Antarctic so a more conventional design was chosen. In charge of her overall design <b>was</b> <b>W.E.</b> Smith, one of the senior naval architects at the Admiralty, while the ship's engine, boilers and other machinery were designed by Fleet Engineer Philip Marrack.|$|E

Finally, he was an excellent Emperor: a competent, conscientious and hard-working administrator and an inspired picker of men, whose appointments to military, naval, ecclesiastical, civil and academic posts were both imaginative and successful.

500|$|A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh, was {{released}} by Apple Corps that year, followed by a concert film in 1972. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: [...] "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems... they still got plenty... {{even though it was}} a drop in the ocean. The main thing <b>was,</b> <b>we</b> spread the word and helped get the war ended." [...] The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid.|$|E

The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922, and {{the family moved to}} Whittier, California. In an area with many Quakers, Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station. Richard's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 at the age of seven after a short illness. At the age of twelve, a spot was found on Richard's lung, and, with a family history of tuberculosis, he was forbidden to play sports. Eventually, the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia.|$|E
500|$|Terrance Dicks {{has felt}} that Moonbase 3 was {{ultimately}} a failure: [...] "The trouble <b>was</b> <b>we</b> built a too restrictive format for ourselves" [...] {{and that the}} series [...] "lacked a sense of wonder and outrageousness". [...] Academic Peter Wright has said about Moonbase 3 that its [...] "appeal to realism resulted in a disquieting sense of claustrophobia and isolation that undermined the optimism of its premise and captured the general mood of insularity felt (and often desired) in Britain in the early 1970s". [...] Moonbase 3, although not directly influential, {{can be seen as}} an antecedent of similar realistic, near-future, British space series such as Star Cops and Space Island One.|$|E

In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre <b>was.</b> <b>We</b> got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, as we call it now." ...|$|E
500|$|The album did not chart {{as well in}} the United States as its predecessor, peaking {{at number}} 148 on the Billboard 200. It was, however, the band's first album to chart on the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number 45. Many of the songs on Leave Home were not {{considered}} by Mickey Leigh to be [...] "radio–friendly" [...] because [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was about Intoxicative inhalant. Joey relates: [...] "We thought we had a lotta songs that should've been hits. If you grew up in the sixties, things would just get played and be hits right off the bat. So we thought since our music was doin' something unique that everyone would pick up on that. What really happened <b>was</b> <b>we</b> were so alien that no one wanted to touch us.

During the tour supporting their third album, The Real Thing, Faith No More recorded their only live album, , and released their first number one single, [...] "Epic". Their fourth studio album Angel Dust was released in 1992 with their final two number-one singles, [...] "Midlife Crisis", and the Lionel Richie cover [...] "Easy", not included on the initial release of the album. Following the tour supporting Angel Dust and the departure of long-time guitarist Jim Martin Faith No More released their fifth studio album, King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime, in 1995.

500|$|In live performance, loudness—an [...] "onslaught of sound," [...] in {{sociologist}} Deena Weinstein's description—is considered vital. In {{his book}} Metalheads, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as [...] "the sensory equivalent of war." [...] Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and The Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, [...] "All we knew <b>was</b> <b>we</b> wanted more power." [...] A 1977 {{review of a}} Motörhead concert noted how [...] "excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact." [...] Weinstein makes the case that {{in the same way}} that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to [...] "sweep the listener into the sound" [...] and to provide a [...] "shot of youthful vitality".|$|E
500|$|X Japan are {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam, with the name itself believed to have been derived from their slogan [...] "Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock". In 2011, Yoshiki briefly described their early years and the movement's development, saying [...] "when we started the band, the problem <b>was</b> <b>we</b> didn’t belong anywhere. Because we were playing very heavy music, we were wearing tons of make-up and crazy outfits. So we couldn’t belong anywhere", [...] " [...] that eventually became visual kei." [...] He added [...] "But visual kei is more like a spirit, it’s not a music style or, you know... I think it is a freedom about describing myself, a freedom to express myself, that’s what I believe visual kei is." [...] Upon former guitarist hide's death in 1998, less than a year after the band broke up, Billboards Steve McClure declared it [...] "the end of an era", explaining [...] "X were the first generation of visual kei bands For the next generation of bands, it's like: That's it.

500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem <b>was</b> <b>we</b> didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man.

500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started <b>was</b> <b>we</b> couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E
500|$|RLI patrols were {{intensified}} further {{over the}} following days, with 3 Commando being brought in to assist around Sipolilo. 13 Troop, 3 Commando, under Sergeant Phil Raath, encountered the 10 cadres at a kraal near Bakasa, north of Sipolilo, on 31 January, and killed one; the other nine fled. Later that day a patrol led by Corporal Dennis Croukamp captured Phinias Majuru, the ZIPRA Director of Operations. [...] "It was only a week later after the patrol was over that we learnt who it <b>was</b> <b>we</b> had captured," [...] Croukamp writes. [...] "It was Joshua Nkomo's Chief of Operations. The equivalent of a very senior staff officer, {{he was in the}} country trying to determine why ZIPRA was being so unsuccessful and {{he was on his way}} back with recommendations, clipboard and all." [...] The remaining ZIPRA fighters scattered and escaped the area {{over the following}} week, the Rhodesian Security Forces losing track of each one. On 9 February 1970 local security force presence was reduced to police, one helicopter and one RLI Commando. A member of Gang 3 was arrested by the Portuguese in Mozambique the next day, but without further developments over the next month, Operation Birch shut down on 5 March 1970. Two more members of Gang 4 were detained by police in Mukumbura township on 21 March, and three days later the Portuguese killed one and captured another. The final account for Operation Birch, which had countered the last ZIPRA incursion for six years, was seven cadres killed, thirteen captured and two outstanding. [...] "From 1970 onward, ZAPU played no part in the terrorist war," [...] writes Lieutenant-Colonel R. E. H. Lockley. [...] "They were in a state of disarray following their decisive defeats within Rhodesia, so they took the opportunity of consolidating their position by sending their terrorists outside the country on extended courses to Russia, Cuba and North Korea. This situation with ZAPU continued until 1976. ... There were no incursions in 1970 worthy of note." ...|$|E
