5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> and depleted riparian zones. Approximately 53percent of riparian zones in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
25|$|The Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan was {{sponsored}} by the United States and agreed by the technical experts of the Arab League and Israel. The U.S.A funded the Israeli and Jordanian <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> projects, when they pledged to abide by the plan's allocations. President Nasser too, assured the U.S.A, that the Arabs would not exceed the plan's water quotas. However, in the early 1960s the Arab League funded a Syrian <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> project that would have denied Israel use of a major portion of its water allocation. The resulting armed clashes are called the War over Water.|$|E

40|$|Many countries/areas are {{experiencing}} or may soon experience water scarcity owing to rapid population growth, urbanization and/or climate change. Currently, almost {{one-fifth of the}} world’s population (1. 2 billion) live in areas of physical <b>water</b> scarcity. <b>Water</b> <b>diversions</b> have become a commonplace solution proposed by governments for alleviation of physical water scarcity. Thus far, more than 80 major projects are completed or under construction globally, including the world’s largest diversion: South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) in China. Negative effects associated with <b>water</b> <b>diversions,</b> such as habitat loss and transfer of pollutants, have been recognized. However, it has been largely overlooked that “invasion highways” are created when <b>water</b> <b>diversions</b> link biogeographic regions. These “invasion highways” can facilitate spread of an array of non-native species. Although previous experiences have provided clear warnings regarding spread of non-native invasive species through artificial waterways, these lessons have been largely ignored by governments when resolving water scarcity problems. Here we use SNWTP, which will likely facilitate spread of invasive golden mussels, {{as well as many}} known examples of non-native invasive species spread through artificial waterways in other water systems, to call on governments to formally establish policy and seek management solutions to considering spread of non-native species when planning <b>water</b> <b>diversions...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>diversions</b> in California, used {{primarily}} for agricultural, municipal, and industrial applications, {{have been considered}} a possi-ble culprit in the decline of many California fishes. In 1991, the Cali-fornia Department of Fish and Game (DFG) initiated a study using the Global Positioning System (GPS) to inventory <b>water</b> <b>diversions.</b> The initial focus was on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta) and the Suisun Marsh, then continued to the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River Basin, The inventory was to find, quantify, describe, and categorize diversions along waterways where Califor-nia fish may be affected by <b>water</b> <b>diversions.</b> As of April 1997, 3, 356 diversions have been located and mapped in a Geographical Infor-mation System (GIS). Approximately 98. 5 % of the diversions identi-fied were either unscreened or screened insufficiently to prevent fish entrainment. The GPS data were post-processed to provide a hori-zontal accuracy of ± 5 meters. The information was primarily col-lected by visual inspection of diversions on the stream bank. Information is maintained in a Microsoft Access database...|$|R

25|$|Since 1913, the Owens River {{had been}} {{diverted}} to Los Angeles, causing {{the ruin of}} the valley's economy. By the 1920s, so much water was diverted from the Owens Valley that agriculture became difficult. This led to the farmers trying to destroy the aqueduct in 1924. Los Angeles prevailed and kept the water flowing. By 1926, Owens Lake {{at the bottom of}} Owens Valley was completely dry due to <b>water</b> <b>diversion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Construction on Glen Canyon Dam {{began with}} a {{demolition}} blast keyed by {{the push of a}} button by President Dwight D. Eisenhower at his desk in the Oval Office on October 1, 1956. The first blast started clearing tunnels for <b>water</b> <b>diversion.</b> On February 11, 1959, water was diverted through the tunnels so dam construction could begin. Later that year, the bridge was completed, allowing trucks to deliver equipment and materials for the dam, and also for the new town of Page, Arizona.|$|E
25|$|The Sundarbans area {{is one of}} {{the most}} densely {{populated}} in the world, and the population is increasing. As a result, half of this ecoregion's mangrove forests have been cut down to supply fuelwood and other natural resources. Despite the intense and large-scale exploitation, this still {{is one of the}} largest contiguous areas of mangroves in the world. Another threat comes from deforestation and <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> from the rivers inland, which causes far more silt to be brought to the estuary, clogging up the waterways.|$|E

25|$|The <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> {{plan for}} the Draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes was {{accompanied}} by a series of propaganda articles by the Iraqi regime directed against the Ma'dan, and the wetlands were systematically converted into a desert, forcing the residents out of their settlements in the region. The western Hammar Marshes and the Qurnah or Central Marshes became completely desiccated, while the eastern Hawizeh Marshes dramatically shrank. Furthermore, villages in the marshes were attacked and burnt down and there were reports of the water being deliberately poisoned.|$|E
25|$|The {{pilot bore}} was leased to the City of Denver {{for use as}} a water tunnel to divert water east from the Colorado River Basin under the Continental Divide to the urban areas of the eastern slope.

25|$|In 1974, David Gaines {{started to}} study the biology of Mono Lake. In 1975, while at Stanford, he started to get others {{interested}} in the ecosystem of Mono Lake. This led to a 1977 report on the ecosystem of Mono Lake that highlighted dangers caused by the <b>water</b> <b>diversion.</b> In 1978, the Mono Lake Committee was formed to protect Mono Lake. The Committee (and the National Audubon Society) sued LADWP in 1979, arguing that the diversions violated the public trust doctrine, which states that navigable bodies of water must be managed {{for the benefit of}} all people. The litigation reached the California Supreme Court by 1983, which ruled in favor of the Committee. Further litigation was initiated in 1984, which claimed that LADWP did not comply with the state fishery protection laws.|$|E
25|$|Those in {{opposition}} of dam removal state that demolishing O'Shaughnessy Dam {{would take away}} a valuable source of clean, renewable hydroelectric power in the Kirkwood and Moccasin powerhouses; even if measures such as seasonal <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> into the powerhouses were employed, it would only make up {{for a fraction of}} the original power production. The remaining deficit would likely have to be replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. The removal of the dam would be extremely costly, at least $3–10 billion, and the transport of the demolished material away from the dam site along the narrow, winding Hetch Hetchy Road would be a logistical nightmare with possible environmental impacts. Most importantly, San Francisco would lose its source of high-quality mountain water, and would have to depend on lower-quality water from other reservoirs – which would require costly filtration and re-engineering of the aqueduct system – to meet its needs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an element}} of truth to Dayan's claim, but it is {{important}} to note that Israel regarded the de-militarized zones in the north as part of their sovereign territory and reserved the right to cultivate them—a right that the Syrians consistently resisted with force. Syria also worked to benefit from the Jordan river before it flowed into Israel, aiming to get use of it as a water source; Syria also actively supported Palestinian resistance movements against Israel. Israel occasionally exploited incidents in the de-militarized zones to strike at the Syrian <b>water</b> <b>diversion</b> project and to punish the Syrians for their support of the Palestinian resistance. Dayan's remarks must also be taken in context of the fact that he was a member of the opposition at the time. His attitude toward the Syrians changed dramatically once he became defense minister. Indeed, on June 8, 1967, Dayan bypassed both the Prime Minister and the Chief of staff in ordering the Israeli army to attack and capture the Golan.|$|E
