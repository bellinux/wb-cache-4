5|$|As of 2017, Nobel Prizes {{have been}} awarded to 844 men, 48 women (Marie Curie won it twice), and 27 organizations. Sixteen women have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Peace Prize, {{fourteen}} have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Literature, twelve have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Physiology or Medicine, four have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Chemistry, two have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Physics and one, Elinor Ostrom, has <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The {{first woman to}} win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel. Curie is also the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes. The most Nobel Prizes awarded to women {{in a single year}} was in 2009, when five women became laureates. The most recent women to be awarded a Nobel Prize were Tu Youyou and Svetlana Alexievich (2015).|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, {{there have}} been 13 Nobel laureates {{affiliated}} with the City University of New York (CUNY). CUNY considers any laureate who attended one of its senior colleges as an affiliated laureate. Arthur Kornberg, who graduated from the City College of New York, a senior college of CUNY, in 1937, was the first CUNY laureate, winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959. Herbert A. Hauptman and Jerome Karle, both of whom graduated from the City College in 1937 with Kornberg, jointly <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Chemistry in 1985, the only CUNY laureates to do so. Six CUNY laureates have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Physiology or Medicine, {{more than any other}} category. Ten of the CUNY laureates graduated from the City College, two laureates, Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Gertrude B. Elion, graduated from Hunter College, another CUNY senior college, and one laureate, Stanley Cohen, graduated from Brooklyn College, one of CUNY's senior colleges, in 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Aziz Sancar, a Turkish {{professor}} at the University of North Carolina, <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Chemistry Prize along with Tomas Lindahl and Paul Modrich, for their work on how cells repair damaged DNA. Other notable Turkish scientists include physician Hulusi Behçet who discovered Behçet's disease, and mathematician Cahit Arf who defined the Arf invariant.|$|E
5|$|The first protein to be sequenced was insulin, by Frederick Sanger, in 1949. Sanger {{correctly}} {{determined the}} {{amino acid sequence}} of insulin, thus conclusively demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched chains, colloids, or cyclols. He <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize for this achievement in 1958.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Ijaz {{launched}} a Distinguished Visitors Colloquium Series under the Physics department's sponsorship that brought world-renowned physicists to the Blacksburg campus {{for nearly a}} decade. Visiting scholars included Salam, Sheldon Glashow, and Nobel physics laureates Hans Bethe, Robert Hofstadter, Eugene Wigner and Richard Feynman. Noted Chinese physicist Luke W.

5|$|Pontecorvo's 1945 paper {{credits the}} idea using carbon {{tetrachloride}} (CCl4) to the French physicist Jules Guéron. Experiments were conducted at Chalk River using the NRX as a neutrino source, but were unsuccessful, and were abandoned in 1949, after Pontecorvo had left. The experiment was unsuccessful because, unknown at the time, nuclear reactors produced antineutrinos instead of neutrinos. In {{what is now}} known as the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment, Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan detected antineutrinos in 1955, for which they <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Physics in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The {{catalytic}} subunit α {{of protein}} kinase A {{is a key}} regulatory enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PRKACA gene. They named this new enzyme the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and proceeded to purify and characterize this new enzyme. Fischer and Krebs <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1992 for this discovery and their continued work on kinases, and their counterparts the protein phosphatases. Today, this cAMP-dependent protein kinase is more simply noted as PKA.|$|E
5|$|The tetroxide and {{a related}} {{compound}} potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis, despite being very poisonous. For the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, which uses osmate for {{the conversion of}} a double bond into a vicinal diol, Karl Barry Sharpless <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Chemistry in 2001. OsO4 is very expensive for this use, so KMnO4 is often used instead, even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent.|$|E
5|$|Twelve U.S. {{citizens}} have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Prize in Literature, most recently Bob Dylan in 2016. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named {{among the most}} influential writers of the 20th century. Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.|$|E
