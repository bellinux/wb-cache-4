5|$|In 2003, the Steelers {{played the}} Philadelphia Eagles in a preseason game {{to commemorate the}} 60th anniversary of the Steagles team, when the two merged {{as a result of}} player {{shortages}} caused by World War II. Steelers president Dan Rooney had initially considered wearing a throwback uniform for the game, but decided against it because the merged team wore the Eagles uniforms, and the Steelers didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the Eagles' colors. Instead, the team had the south end zone painted in plain diagonal white lines, which were common in NFL endzones until the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, an Australian-based company OnTilt Designs Pty Ltd won a multi-year {{contract}} {{to become the}} official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design {{would return to the}} tradition of the 1970s and 1980s where the bracelet was a heavy piece of unadorned metal. American jewelry designer Steve Soffa was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets. The goal was to create a bracelet that somebody would actually <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> every day. In 2011, OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the WSOP Circuit rings.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Noten participated among 40 (21 in final) Dutch {{artists and}} {{designers}} in a tiara design competition honouring the marriage between Maxima Zorreguieta and the Dutch crown prince Willem-Alexander. Noten's {{design of a}} shiny chromed polo helmet with a clip-on tiara won first prize. The jury {{referred to it as}} a 'cheeky' design. Noten intended the tiara, with small portraits of all Dutch queens positioned as guardian angels on top, to be used in church during the wedding ceremony. Afterwards the princess could combine the tiara with the helmet to protect herself against paparazzi when she ventured into the city of Amsterdam (or if she felt confident enough her husband might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the helmet).|$|E
500|$|At first, Schwimmer did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the afro wig and {{mustache}} {{because he}} thought he would look like Gabe Kaplan in Welcome Back, Kotter (a similarity referenced in the episode). He relented because it enabled him to [...] "tap into a part of himself that was very vulnerable and shy" [...] and incorporate it into his performance. An early script draft featured a scene in the prom video in which an episode of All My Children is on in the background. The scene was intended to feature the character [...] "Bryce", played by Gunther (as revealed in [...] "The One Where Eddie Won't Go").|$|E
500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page. I broke down every time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1996 movie That Thing You Do! touches {{briefly on}} the phenomenon, with the Wonders making an {{appearance}} in a fictional beach party movie, Weekend at Party Pier. A 2001 episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch ("Beach Blanket Bizarro") also paid {{homage to the}} series, with Avalon appearing as himself. Avalon and Funicello starred in Paramount Pictures Back to the Beach in 1987, playing off their original roles and subsequent careers. Kelly Killoren Bensimon wrote in The Bikini Book, [...] "It was really all about Annette Funicello. If {{the girl next door}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a bikini, then everybody <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> a bikini. We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a bad Bond girl.

2500|$|In January 1994, Minogue married actor Julian McMahon, {{whom she}} met in 1991 {{while working on}} the {{television}} series Home and Away. McMahon {{is the son of}} the former Prime Minister of Australia Sir William McMahon. Minogue and McMahon were married for less than two years and divorced in 1995. In October 1995, Minogue posed nude in the Australian edition of Playboy. Commenting on the reason she posed nude, Minogue said she [...] "just had a marriage break-up. Most women go to the hairdressers – I did Playboy. I chose the photographer, the location, what I did or didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> and everything else about the pictures. I found it a really liberating, empowering experience". The edition featuring Minogue sold out in under four days and became one of the best-selling editions in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|While the 1874 {{correspondent}} described Worth as [...] "not {{a man to}} {{be afraid}} of if one has a liberal exchequer", it was implied that the couturier was not afraid to dictate to clients what they should wear: [...] "Yet Mr Worth declares he has any amount of trouble with women – that they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> colours that don't become them and a superabundance of trimming that is far from good taste". It appears Worth had the charm or gravitas to overcome his clients' requests for the wrong colour or trimming. His son Jean Philippe later recalled: [...] "His practised eye discerned the color and style of robe that would most completely enhance a woman's charm, and with complete serenity she might leave the matter to him and give her mind to the contemplation of home affairs, her children and philanthropies".|$|E
2500|$|Sienna Miller's {{relationship}} with – and, for a time, engagement to – actor Jude Law, {{after they had}} starred together in the 2004 film, Alfie, kept both her and her style of dress in the media headlines during 2004–05. In December 2004, Vogue featured Miller on its front cover and described her as [...] "the girl of the year". Later, the ending of her {{relationship with}} Law (which resumed temporarily in 2009–10) seemed to signal that boho too was past its peak. In fact, as early as May 2005 the Sunday Times Style magazine had declared that [...] "overexposed" [...] white peasant skirts were [...] "going down" [...] and had advised adherents of boho to [...] "update your boho mojo" [...] by mixing the look with metallic items (anticipating so-called [...] "boho-rock" [...] in 2006) or with layers. By the end of 2005, Miller herself, who claimed later that her boho look was not very original – [...] "I think I'd {{just come back from}} traveling or something" [...] – had adopted other styles of dress and her shorter, bobbed hairstyle – ironically a feature of bohemian fashion in the quarter century before World War II – helped to define a new trend in 2007. She was quoted in Vogue as saying [...] "no more boho chic ... I feel less hippie. I just don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> anything floaty or coin-belty ever again. No more gilets ...". Even so, in 2008, Miller reflected that ...|$|E
25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world it remains {{socially}} disapproved for men <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> clothes traditionally associated with women.

2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E
