5|$|First the {{machines}} {{will do a}} lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if <b>we</b> <b>manage</b> it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} example, if a null {{hypothesis}} {{is assumed to}} follow the standard normal distribution N(0,1), then the rejection of this null hypothesis can either mean (i) the mean is not zero, or (ii) the variance is not unity, or (iii) the distribution is not normal, {{depending on the type}} of test performed. However, supposing <b>we</b> <b>manage</b> to reject the zero mean hypothesis, even if we know the distribution is normal and variance is unity, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero value we should adopt as the new mean.|$|E
500|$|On 12 June 2017, Buffon {{announced}} that the 2017–18 season would likely be his last with the club. Regarding the likelihood of his retirement {{at the end of}} the season, he commented: [...] "I'm 99.9 percent certain of that. I'm going to have one final, intense season, rich in big moments, and then it will be time to say enough is enough. We've just left one small possibility open with the [...] president , and that is if <b>we</b> <b>manage</b> to win the Champions League I will carry on playing one more year to try to win the Club World Cup and other trophies.". On 4 August, Buffon was named one of the three finalists for the Goalkeeper of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League season award, along with Manuel Neuer and Jan Oblak. On 15 August, Buffon was also listed as one of the three finalists for the 2017 UEFA Best Player of the Year Award, along with Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. On 19 August, Buffon made history by saving the first Serie A penalty awarded via VAR in a 3–0 home win over Cagliari in the club's opening league match of the season. On 24 August, he was named the best goalkeeper of the 2016–17 Champions League season, and placed third in the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award, with 109 votes. On 23 October, Buffon won the inaugural 2017 Best FIFA Goalkeeper award, and was named to the FIFPro World XI for the third time in his career; he was also nominated for the 2017 Best FIFA Men's Player Award, finishing in fourth place in the voting.|$|E

2500|$|Earlier {{claims of}} the Taliban were refuted by Qari Malang, the {{representative}} of the Western Nuristan Taliban. He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. [...] "We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded. We regret these killings and strongly assert {{that this is not the}} work of the Taliban who will never do harm to genuine aid workers… as soon as <b>we</b> <b>manage</b> to apprehend those responsible for this act, we shall subject them to whatever punishment our laws prescribe." ...|$|E
2500|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{suggests that the}} nocebo effect of acupuncture is clinically relevant and {{that the rate of}} adverse events may be a gauge of the nocebo effect. According to the 2014 Miller's Anesthesia book, [...] "when compared with placebo, acupuncture treatment has proven efficacy for relieving pain". A 2012 meta-analysis conducted by the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration found [...] "relatively modest" [...] efficiency of acupuncture (in comparison to sham) for the treatment of four different types of chronic pain (back and neck pain, knee osteoarthritis, chronic headache, and shoulder pain) and on that basis concluded that it [...] "is more than a placebo" [...] and a reasonable referral option. Commenting on this meta-analysis, both Edzard Ernst and David Colquhoun said the results were of negligible clinical significance. Edzard Ernst later stated that [...] "I fear that, once <b>we</b> <b>manage</b> to eliminate this bias [...] … we might find that the effects of acupuncture exclusively are a placebo response." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Wu generals {{wanted to}} respond to the enemy's taunts, Lu Xun said, [...] "This must be a trick. We should observe first." [...] Earlier on, when the Shu army first arrived at Yiling, the Wu generals wanted to attack the enemy, but Lu Xun objected and said, [...] "Liu Bei is leading an army east to attack us and his army's morale is very high. Besides, his forces are based in high and mountainous terrain, so it's {{difficult}} for us to attack them. Even if <b>we</b> <b>manage</b> to win, we can't completely defeat them. If we suffer any setback, our morale will be greatly affected and this isn't a small issue. Now, we should raise our troops' morale and make plans while waiting for changes in the situation. If we're on plains and flat ground, we should be worrying about sustaining heavy losses in skirmishes and charges. However, since the enemy is on mountainous terrain, they can't carry out an all-out assault because they're sandwiched between wood and rocks. We should take advantage of this weakness of theirs." [...] The Wu generals did not understand Lu Xun's reasoning and thought that he feared the enemy so they were very disgruntled with him.|$|E

2500|$|Guo Huai then ordered Chen Tai to lead {{troops to}} attack a Shu unit led by Xu Zhi, and Deng Ai to lead another force to attack the fortresses at Qushan and cut off their food and water supplies. Ju An and Li Xin led their men to taunt Deng Ai to attack them, but Deng Ai ignored them. As time passed, the two fortresses {{gradually}} ran out of supplies. Jiang Wei led his troops from Mount Niutou (牛頭山; west of present-day Zhaohua District, Guangyuan, Sichuan) to reinforce the fortresses. They encountered Chen Tai and his troops along the way. Chen Tai said, [...] "The Art of War says {{that the best way}} to win a battle is to win without fighting. If <b>we</b> <b>manage</b> to occupy Mount Niutou, Jiang Wei's return route will be sealed off and he can be easily captured by us." [...] He then ordered his troops to build forts to resist Jiang Wei's forces but refrain from engaging the enemy. At the same time, he also wrote to Guo Huai and requested his help in attacking Mount Niutou. Guo Huai did so and led his troops across the Tao River in preparation for attacking Mount Niutou.|$|E
