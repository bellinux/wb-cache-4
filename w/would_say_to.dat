500|$|The ride {{experience}} was different in its earlier years. Passengers would enter under {{the middle of}} the coaster's lift. After entering an eerie space soundtrack played. The first room was [...] "Mission Control". Black lights lit the room. Travel posters and a rocket diagram were on the side walls. Two airport loading gates were seen next to two TV monitors (showing the head of the company [...] "The Dispatch Master" [...] or random space pilots) and were on either side of a desk in the middle. An employee sitting at the desk <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the riders that the loading gates on were both malfunctioning and the riders had to be rerouted through the [...] "service rooms" [...] of the hangar. Walking into the next room deemed [...] "Rocket Recovery", guests would see a [...] "rocket locator" [...] robot named [...] "Dave" [...] working up on a platform at a terminal trying to contact the companies rockets (one according to him crashed outside of Akron). Walking down another hallway, guests could glance at crates inside of a warehouse within the building. After the short hallway, guests entered the [...] "Repair Bay". A room showcasing a [...] "binocular security camera" [...] robot named [...] "Franc" [...] looking around the room (he was later removed). There were also suspended conveyor baskets carrying various items, a high voltage generator, pneumatic robotic arms [...] "repairing" [...] a rocket, and a security scanner that flashed [...] "REJECT" [...] after scanning guests.A small room outside the Repair Bay had the company's logo subtlety broken to reveal the ride's true name. Entering the [...] "Launch Area" [...] rockets moved from behind a curtain without passengers. After ten people loaded on a rocket the ride began. The rocket moved out on a block section where an [...] "on-board computer" [...] welcomed you and started the [...] "automatic launch sequence". Two spinning laser light spheres projected a star field around the rocket as it climbed the lift. Upon reaching the top your computer takes notice of nearby [...] "space pirates" [...] and begins to perform abrasive maneuvers. As riders went through the coaster, they would see exploding rockets, meteors, laser projections, and a satellite that shot lasers. Your on-board computer shouts [...] "I'm losing control, I'm losing control!" [...] before an Alaskan landscape came into view and the rockets entered the brake run. Riders entered the unloading station where they were greeted by an employee that yells [...] "WELCOME TO ALASKA!" [...] The riders disembarked their vehicle and exited on the left.|$|E
