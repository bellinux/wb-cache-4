5|$|The stegosaurians {{were widely}} {{distributed}} geographically {{in the late}} Jurassic. Palaeontologists believe it would have eaten plants such as mosses, ferns, horsetails, cycads, and conifers or fruits. Grazing on grasses, seen in many modern mammalian herbivores, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> for Stegosaurus, as grasses did not evolve until late into the Cretaceous Period, long after Stegosaurus had become extinct.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Ace, Cascade Games was infamous for their Cassette 50 (1983) game {{compilation}} that featured simplistic and subpar games. Stevens points out that without the income from the compilation, the project <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible.</b> The developers estimate the production cost of Ace at £40k. Following {{the release of}} Ace, Cascade moved into mainstream AAA game development. Wilhelmy says that Cascade boasted over a million GBP in turnover over the following years. The company produced two sequels, Ace 2 (1987) and ACE 2088 (1989), and various other games before closing down in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games {{were held}} in Cardiff. The event was (to date) the biggest {{sporting}} event ever held in Wales; however, it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> without the financial support given by the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club. Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on {{what had been the}} greyhound track. It {{would turn out to be}} the last time that South Africa would participate in the Games until 1994. South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth Games in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Meråker saw in {{industrial}} boom {{due to the}} railway. There was already a copper mine and smelters at Kopperå, and they saw the railway as a possibility to change from locally produced charcoal to imported coke. A pulp mill opened in 1887, but burned down in 1912. The most important industry was the carbide factory that opened in Kopperå in 1900—Meraker Smelteverk. Though located close to the hydroelectricity sources in Meråker, the import and export of raw and finished materials <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> without the railway. A port for the plant was built at Muruvik in 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of the Space Exploration Center's Inquiry Room was influenced by Sylvia Anderson, who {{in her role as}} producer supervised design aspects and wanted the light-blue uniforms of the SEC officials to be vividly contrasted with a tangerine and black duotone backdrop. Director David Lane recalls that the Inquiry Room scene depicted a panel made up of 20 puppets, an achievement which <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> in one of the Thunderbirds television episodes due to the smaller budget.|$|E
5|$|If Sedna {{formed in}} its current location, the Sun's {{original}} protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75AU into space. Also, Sedna's initial orbit must have been approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies into a whole <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible,</b> because the large relative velocities between planetesimals {{would have been too}} disruptive. Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed.|$|E

5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} {{predominantly}} live from Studio 1 of the BBC's Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. The episodes were rehearsed from Tuesday to Saturday, usually at the Mary Wood Settlement in Tavistock Place, London, with camera rehearsals {{in the morning}} and afternoon of transmission. Not every scene was live; a significant amount of material was on 35 mm film and inserted during the performance. Most filming involved scenes set on location or those too technically complex or expansive to achieve live. The latter were shot at Ealing Studios, acquired by the BBC in 1955, where Cartier worked with the cinematographer A. A. Englander. Pre-filming was also used to show the passage of time in the second episode; the archaeological dig at Ealing was shown to have dug deeper into the ground than the equivalent set at Riverside, enabling a sense of time having elapsed that <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> in an all-live production.|$|E
5|$|From the {{introduction}} of Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) funding in 1965 until the mid-2000s, Wedgemere station remained essentially static. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required transit agencies to make certain stations handicapped accessible. A number of high-ridership stations on the MBTA Commuter Rail system were upgraded, but due to its relatively low ridership — less than 600 riders per day as of 2009 — Wedgemere was not chosen as a key station for upgrades. Wedgemere had older low-level platforms, and access from the street was via stairs only. Beginning in 2008, a local family lobbied the MBTA to make the station accessible; in July 2009, the Federal Transit Administration granted the MBTA permission to build mini-high platforms. (Full-length high level platforms <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> because the Lowell Line is a designated freight corridor; full-length platforms cause operational difficulties with freight trains. Wedgemere does not have room for a dedicated freight passing track like Anderson RTC.) In February 2010, the MBTA announced that $2 million in federal stimulus funds had been allotted to the project, part of a grant that also funded construction of the John W. Olver Transit Center and repairs to the Red Line tunnels between Harvard and Alewife. The work was then intended to be finished {{by the end of}} 2010.|$|E

Numerous wrecks also trace their origins to the military build-up of the state during both World War II and the Cold War.|$|E
