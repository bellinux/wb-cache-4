25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E
500|$|Despite their lasting {{influence}} on modern music, the band {{has attempted to}} disassociate themselves {{with many of the}} bands they inspired. Following the band's reformation, guitarist Jim Suptic undertook an interview with website Drowned in Sound, in which he said, [...] "The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like glam rock now. <b>We</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> Bamboozle fests this year and we felt really out of place... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologise." [...] He went on to say they were grateful for the acknowledgements they have received, though explaining [...] "the problem is most of [...] aren't very good." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> last two weeks of the tour. I decided I would play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{recording}} made at Carfax Tower in Oxford {{provided the}} bell chimes heard {{at the end}} of [...] "Strange Ones". These chimes were only heard on the I Should Coco version, not on Supergrass is 10, because on the I Should Coco album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, [...] "Sitting Up Straight", which was not included in Supergrass is 10. [...] "Strange Ones" [...] was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the [...] "throwaway song" [...] on the B-side to [...] "Caught by the Fuzz". Another song on the album with the same theme, [...] "I'd Like To Know", was inspired by listening to [...] "Strange Ones" [...] played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, [...] "One of the highlights of this album was recording 'Sofa (Of My Lethargy)'.... I remember everybody got in the live room and had an instrument, including Sam [...] on bass, a friend of his on hammond organ and <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> rest, all live, one take.... We made I Should Coco so fast because we wanted to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!" [...] In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered [...] "writing that song [...] in my living room on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through it and just did it on 4 track".|$|E
2500|$|After {{forming in}} 1978, {{the members of}} UB40 made an {{agreement}} {{to spend the next}} year doing nothing more than learning their instruments and practising their songs until they felt they were good enough. Saxophonist Brian Travers said, [...] "We commandeered a cellar and started rehearsing every day, nine till five. Our first experiences of playing an instrument started together, and we'd humiliate each other over mistakes. But we were very serious about our music. It was a year before we played our first gig. It was in an upper room at the 'Hare and Hounds' [...] in Kings Heath, Birmingham. <b>We</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> whole of Signing Off because they were the only songs we knew." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bret Harris, {{author of}} Ella, Ella, Ella, criticised Campese's {{positional}} play at full-back, and praised New Zealand's backs, in particular All Black centre Steve Pokere, for their tactical kicking. In My Game Your Game Campese defended his 'general play', but highlighted this Test as his 'first bitter experience' playing rugby union at Test match level: [...] "My first bitter experience was in 1983, when <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> All Blacks at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a one-off Bledisloe Cup game. My general play was fine, {{but we had}} gone into the game without a recognised goal-kicker. Our regular fullback Roger Gould was injured and yours truly was given the job. None out of four was the end result and the All Blacks won the Test 18–8, despite Australia scoring two tries to one. The press had a great time with that one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't {{know how to do}} that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>The</b> Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Chicago game, 1,000 {{students}} {{gathered at}} the Athens Theater in Ann Arbor where they listened to a play-by-play account of the game as it was transmitted by telegraph from Chicago.

Men threw their hats and coats at one another and hugged and danced in the aisles for fully ten minutes." [...] After the game, the crowd marched through the streets to President James B. Angell's home. [...] President Angell greeted the crowd with a broad smile and said, [...] "I congratulate you on the success of the Michigan team in Chicago this afternoon. [...] It is a great victory, and we owe much to the men who have won the laurels of our victory from the brow of our sister institution of learning. [...] It has been said that I am opposed to the game, but I wish to say that I, too, used to play in college. [...] In those days, however, <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> Herschberger game, and used to kick the ball instead of the man.

2500|$|In 1990, DeVille made Victory Mixture, {{a tribute}} album of classic New Orleans soul and R which he {{recorded}} {{with some of}} the songs' original composers. The album was recorded without the use of overdubbing or sound editing with the goal of capturing the spirit of the original recordings.I got all the original guys to come back in, like Earl King, Dr. John and Eddie Bo. Allen Toussaint played side piano. I brought in the rhythm section of The Meters on a couple of cuts. We call it the [...] "little" [...] record. It's funny, because I was just trying to get them money, the writers of the songs, 'cause they all got ripped off in the 1950s and 1960s. They were all fascinated, and Dr. John (who had played on DeVille's 1978 album Return to Magenta and who DeVille knew from his association with Doc Pomus) convinced them that they wouldn't get ripped off by this northern white boy. That's when I crossed over to being a local here in New Orleans. We were all pleased with it. It's recorded the way it was originally done back then. It's live with no overdubs anywhere, no digital, no editing. <b>We</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> song several times and just picked the best take, the one that was the most natural. It's on Fnac/Orleans Records. I'm really proud of that one. Victory Mixture was recorded for a small independent label, Orleans Records, which licensed it to Sky Ranch (Fnac Music) in France. [...] "It sold over 100,000 units in Europe very quicklyour first gold disc," [...] said Carlo Ditta, founder of Orleans Records and the producer of Victory Mixture.|$|E

6000|$|... "David Ramsay, his Majesty's clock-maker, {{had been}} {{informed}} {{that there was}} a great quantity of treasure buried in the cloister of Westminster Abbey.

The Dean gave him liberty to search after it, with this proviso, that if any was discovered, his church should have a share of it. Davy Ramsay finds out one John Scott, who pretended the use of the Mosaical rods, to assist him herein. [Footnote: The same now called, I believe, the Divining Rod, and applied to the discovery of water not obvious to the eye.] I was desired to join with him, unto which I consented. One winter's night, Davy Ramsay, with several gentlemen, myself, and Scott, entered the cloisters. <b>We</b> <b>played</b> <b>the</b> hazel rods round about the cloisters.

He had his malice still; he was false as ever; and, the occasion being gone that made his strength, he sat there impotent; he was still the viper, but now spent his venom on a file. Two more thoughts occurred to me while yet we sat at breakfast: the first, that he was abashed - I had almost said, distressed - to find his wickedness quite unavailing; the second, that perhaps my lord was in the right, and we did amiss to fly from our dismasted enemy.
