5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} the {{fraternity}} boys, {{and one of them}} tells her information that leads to her suspecting a boy named Chip. Keith and Harmony flirt, and Harmony shows a good amount of true romantic interest in Keith. Logan’s family has been donating $10,000 a month to “Aaron’s Kids”, which Veronica learns is not actually a charity. Veronica talks to Chip, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he was with another girl, who admits it while saying that she’ll never say so openly. Veronica turns her suspicion on Dick. After doing more digging, Veronica says that the money is going to Logan’s illegitimate brother, Charlie Stone. Parker insults Veronica for supposedly working with the fraternity. Keith catches Harmony’s husband kissing another woman. After talking to one of the other rape victims, Veronica discusses Claire with a slightly offbeat clerk, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Claire went in with a guy. Logan meets Charlie (Matt Czuchry), and they connect over surfing. However, Veronica notices some inconsistencies at Charlie’s private school job.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the scenes}} in Southeast Asia takes place near a karaoke club, and depicts groups of girls, {{apparently}} {{ranging in age from}} early to late teens, offering sexual services to customers. Benjamin Nolot interviews a police officer, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the bar's owner recently bought eight other similar clubs and controls around 2,000 girls. Another Southeast Asian scene shows Nolot and his crew chasing an American man out of a town where he was trying to purchase sex with a child.|$|E
5|$|The reforms {{implemented}} by Djedkare are generally assessed negatively in modern Egyptology as his policy of decentralization created a virtual feudal system that transferred much {{power to the}} high and provincial administrations. Some Egyptologists such as Naguib Kanawati argue that this contributed heavily {{to the collapse of}} the Egyptian state during the First Intermediate Period, c. 200 years later. These conclusions are rejected by Nigel Strudwick, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> in spite of Djedkare's reforms, Ancient Egyptian officials never amassed enough power to rival that of the king.|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} said that Darwinian evolution conflicts with theistic religion. Those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> such things often {{have in mind}} claims that are peripheral to theistic religion, for example, the claim that God created the earth about 6, 000 years ago or the claim that God directly created each species. I {{have no interest in}} the thesis that Darwinian evolution conflicts with these peripheral claims. I do have an interest, however, in the thesis that Darwinian evolution conflicts with claims that are central to theistic religion. Among those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Darwinian evolution conflicts with claims central to theistic religion, we find those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it is incompatible with them and those <b>who</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> although there is no incompatibility, evolution nevertheless provides significant evidence against them. In this essay, I will focus on the second group. 1 More narrowly, I will focus on Paul Draper’s argument for this conclusion. ...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the threat}} of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself, showing the {{television}} viewers only the portion of his face that looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he knew who Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives {{that he is the}} superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.|$|E
5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the}} hospital and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines {{what it would be like}} if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E
5|$|Keith interrogates Aaron {{and threatens}} him. Veronica and Clarence go into Amelia's boyfriend's room and Clarence dangles him off a window ledge, {{but he knows}} nothing. Weevil and Logan get into a fight at school, partly because of Logan's bail and partly because Logan has just bought Weevil's grandmother's house and kicked her out. Veronica is {{contacted}} by Amelia's friend, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the killer is actually a man named Carlos. Clarence decides to track down Carlos, {{despite the fact that}} he is a diplomat's son. Veronica lies to Abel Koontz about Amelia's fate to spare his feelings before his death. Keith goes inside the police station evidence room to examine the remains of the bus that mysteriously went off a cliff and finds the remains of a rat.|$|E

5|$|Later, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are met by Phoebe Green, an {{investigator}} from London's Metropolitan Police and Mulder's former lover from Oxford University. Green explains that a serial arsonist is targeting the British aristocracy, burning his victims alive while leaving {{no trace of}} evidence. The only links between the crimes are the suspect's love letters to the victims' wives. His latest target is Sir Malcolm Marsden, who is visiting Cape Cod for protection after escaping an attack by the killer. Mulder and Scully visit a pyrotechnics expert <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> only rocket fuel can burn hot enough to destroy evidence of its origins.|$|E
5|$|Martial's {{mention of}} gift-giving is {{repeated}} in the account by Dio, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Titus would throw wooden balls into the crowd from his seat in the box {{at the north end}} of the arena. These balls were inscribed with a description of a gift, either food, clothing, slaves, pack animals, horse, cattle, or gold or silver vessels. Anybody who caught one could hand over the ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return. This was not unusual: Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same, giving 1,000 birds daily, as well as food parcels, and vouchers for various extravagant gifts.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{anonymously}} {{receives a}} tape cassette of Grissom's 911 call. He {{tries to take}} the case, only to learn that another FBI agent, Alex Krycek, has opened it first. Deciding to leave Krycek out of the loop, Mulder calls Scully (Gillian Anderson) and asks her to conduct Grissom's autopsy. Mulder then heads to Grissom's clinic in Stamford, Connecticut, where he is confronted by an angered Krycek. The two travel back to Quantico to see Scully, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Grissom's body {{showed no signs of}} a fire, but yet seems to have biologically believed it was burning.|$|E

5|$|Skinner {{sees the}} old woman looking at him on a city street. However, when he pursues {{the old woman}}, he instead finds Sharon. The agents talk to Sharon, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the {{marriage}} failed because of Skinner's emotional distance. Scully learns that Skinner had been receiving treatment for a sleep disorder, in which he apparently had dreams about being suffocated in bed by an old woman. She fears that Skinner may have unwittingly killed Sayles in his sleep. However, Mulder believes that Skinner may be having visions of a succubus, a female demon, with the mention of similar symptoms of people's bad dreams they've experienced.|$|E
5|$|Veronica goes to Dean O’Dell {{and asks}} for an exchange: Veronica tells him that his son spray-painted his car, and he will hire Weevil. Veronica talks to the {{gambling}} owner, who acts strangely. Veronica tracks his car before removing the tracker later. Veronica talks to Trish, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Kurt left for Kansas. Weevil starts his new job as a Hearst janitor. Piz gets a job on a campus radio show, where he interviews both the feminists and the fraternity boys. In {{the middle of the}} show, the feminists get a text that says that Claire, the girl who the fraternity boys pointed out, was raped. Veronica and Logan reconcile their relationship and kiss.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Dick about his {{relationship}} with Betina. Veronica talks to one of Betina’s friends, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Dick mistreated her, and Betina’s goal was for Dick to get her pregnant so she could get him in trouble. Veronica asks Keith about whether or not he has resumed a relationship with Rebecca, and Veronica gets into Stanford University. Veronica is pushed into second place at the Kane scholarship after Angie. Rebecca denies having a relationship with Keith, while Angie also gets into Stanford. Wallace points out Rhonda’s sister to Veronica, but she doesn’t give Veronica any information. Veronica asks Keith to dig into the financial records of the bus crash victims. Veronica learns that none of the families had very much money, except for Rhonda’s family, who got a $2 million bailout from Woody (Steve Guttenberg).|$|E

5|$|When Lucas Goodwin shoots Underwood {{during a}} {{campaign}} event, Meechum trades fire with the assassin, {{and both are}} killed instantly. Meechum's death {{is one of the}} tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill she is sponsoring, and Underwood has him buried in Arlington National Cemetery, a rare privilege for a Secret Service agent, though Meechum may have been eligible, in his own right, as {{a former member of the}} US Military who served in Afghanistan. When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum's hand tracing has been painted over, he expresses grief and regret at the loss to Claire, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Meechum was one of the few people who truly understood them.|$|E
5|$|When Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} Iowa {{and meet the}} Morrises, Mulder observes Kevin writing down binary code {{on a piece of}} paper; Kevin claims they are coming from static on a {{television}} screen. After submitting Kevin's code for analysis, the agents meet with the local sheriff, who tells them that Ruby was a juvenile delinquent who likely ran away. They also meet a young woman, Tessa, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Ruby had gotten pregnant and was planning to run away with her boyfriend, Greg Randall. The agents are unable to find Greg at the bar where he works; however, his boss tells them about UFO activity at Lake Okobogee.|$|E
5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E

5|$|After {{two people}} find Chip Diller (David Tom), the {{president}} of the Pig Sigma fraternity, passed out, Veronica gets hired as a photographer for the Hearst newspaper. Logan (Jason Dohring) requests that Veronica stop looking into the serial rapist case, but she denies and they fight. The Hearst board of trustees is going {{to decide whether or not}} to shut down the fraternities, but an important member, Selma Rose, goes missing in the middle of the party. Dean O’Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) immediately believes that she’s gone missing, asking Veronica and Keith to help. Veronica speaks to one of the feminist Lilith House girls, while Keith speaks to Selma’s husband. Veronica poses as a reporter to get news from Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) on the case. Veronica speaks to Dick (Ryan Hansen), <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Chip Diller had a Roman numeral easter egg implanted in his anus, and Veronica suspects the Lilith House girls.|$|E
5|$|During her {{short-lived}} presidency, a {{truck with}} nuclear energy goes missing and puts D.C. into lock-down, a scheme devised by {{several members of}} Frank's cabinet and Conway's campaign. During the emergency, Claire is visited by diplomat Jane Davis (Patricia Clarkson), <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> she can track down a leader of ICO for the Underwoods. Claire is also faced {{with a series of}} diplomatic crises: Russian soldiers have also taken over an American base, and the Russians and Chinese are vying for possession of a boat in Antarctica that has a stowaway American working for the Russians. After making a deal with the Chinese, Claire orders for the boat to be destroyed so that neither the Chinese nor the Russians can get what is on board. Around this time, Claire agrees to an open election in Ohio for not only the President, but also the Vice President, in order to avoid a possible Conway-Underwood administration.|$|E
5|$|In a {{checkout}} line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{discuss her}} relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will mean for them. They then see someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake debit card. Weevil injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E
