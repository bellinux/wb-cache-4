Our recent study in [4], ten-wire EDS {{was applied to}} 100 mm-square polycrystalline SiC material. Applying this technology to ingot slicing, an appropriate process technology for cylindrical shaped SiC materials which {{are the same as}} an actual ingot is required. The slicing of cylindrical shaped SiC using conventional multi-wire EDS causes the increase of sori, or <b>wire</b> <b>break</b> with unstable machining process since wasteful machining power is not controlled as a function of machining length. To resolve this problem, we applied the machining energy control method which varies machining power with machining position. Using proposed method, ten-simultaneous slicing of cylindrical shaped SiC material is obtained with 80 µm/min in machining speed. The sori of machined surface is 34 µm, and TV 5 is 28 µm as a result.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The {{fabrication}} of stable gold monoatomic chains suspended between two gold electrodes {{is one of}} the milestones in nanoscience and technology, since miniaturization of the electronic components {{is one of the}} great importance in development and improvement of new devices in nanoelectronic. Monoatomic chain nanowires show unusual mechanical and electronic properties such as quantized conductance and much stiff bonds compare to the ones in bulk. Ohnishi et al. [1], has visualized the monoatomic chains by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). At the same time, Yanson et al [2], have produced the monoatomic chains and they measured its conductance. In the bond length measurement of monoatomic chains, unusually long interatomic lengths have been observed compare to interatomic distances in the bulk and dimer. In order to understand the nature of bonding and unusual structural properties, in this thesis, mechanical and electronic properties of metal chain nanowires are investigated from first principles by using pseudopotential plane wave calculations. Six different metals (Au, Ag, Al, Cu, Pt and Na) are studied in detail. All metals under study show two wire structure which are linear and zigzag structure. Au, Al and Pt show two different zigzag structure. All the wires are metallic. Relative stabilities are investigated by calculating the tension corresponding to apply force to keep the wire at a specific length. Au and Pt have bigger breaking force at breaking point relative to other metallic wires. In this thesis, effect of H, H 2 and C impurities on mechanical and electronic properties of Au monoatomic chains are also studied. In wires with H and C impurities, wire under tension break from Au-Au bond away from the impurity. However, <b>wire</b> <b>break</b> from Au-H bond in H 2 system. Except from Au-H system, wire become insulator when it contain C or H 2 impurities. Before breaking, Au-impurity-Au bond length is in the range of long interatomic distance observed in experiment. So, the presence of an impurity can explain the observed long interatomic distances. However, changing of bond lengths and breaking bond during the stretching of wire depends on the type of impurity. If one stretch the Au-H system, all bond lengths increase in the same amount before breaking. However in Au-C system, Au-Au bond length away from the C impurity increase much more than other bonds. It is shown that absorption of impurity atoms modify the stiffness of the bonds in the wire. This related to the charge transfer from Au to impurity (for H and C). In H and C systems, <b>wire</b> <b>break</b> from Au-Au bond away from the impurity. However in H 2 system, <b>wire</b> <b>break</b> from Au-H bond. Çakır, DenizM. S...|$|E
40|$|A PC-based {{system has}} been {{developed}} for quality control and visualization of expendable bathy thermograph (XBT) data archived at the Indian Oceanographic Data Centre. The system, coded in Visual C++, is user interactive and runs on Windows- 95 platform. Quality control module of the system incorporates various quality norms/checks and has two levels; inventory and data levels. Inventory level checks are applied for land–sea position, speed of the vessel, invalid date/time, duplicates and station sounding. Station sounding check is performed based on the ETOPO bathymetry file having 50 50 spatial resolution. Although the QCS is developed for quality control and visualization of the XBT data, {{it could be used}} for inventory level quality checks of any general oceanographic data. Data quality module involves tests for XBT-specific errors such as surface transient, temperature inversions, fall rate and depth reversal. This level also involves visual inspection of the profiles for identifying and correcting/flagging of features caused by wire stretch, <b>wire</b> <b>break,</b> bowing and nub in the mixed layer. Provision is given to compare individual XBT profiles with neighboring stations and also with 18 18 monthly climatologies. Quality flags are assigned for each inventory and depth fields. Since data exchange (national and international), under the IODE system, stipulates standard quality flags, the Integrated Global Ocean Observing System recommended flags are applied in the system. Station having data with erroneous or doubtful flags are sent to error bin, which can be accessed by privileged users for possible correction and subsequent modifications in the data base.

40|$|The {{safety of}} {{suspension}} bridges {{depends on its}} main cables which are constructed of thousands of high strength steel wires radially clamped together at certain locations along the cable. After many years of service, these cables are showing signs of serious distress with many wires corroded and even broken inside. A new methodology to determine the reliability and safety of this structure is suggested in this research work. A three dimensional random field simulation is {{used to determine the}} remaining tensile strength in the cable. The key idea is to determine how an individual <b>wire</b> <b>break</b> affects the load transfer to the surrounding wires. This local damage eventually causes a global reduction in the load carrying capacity of the cable, up to a complete failure. A Monte Carlo technique is used to generate realizations of the wires' strength within a finite element model. Among the major contributions of the thesis is a novel technique for modeling the contact-friction mechanism between thousands of wires that account for load recovery in broken wires due to friction induced by radial clamps. The idea is to place elasto-plastic springs at the contact points between wires. These springs have varying parameters depending on their proximity to the clamping loads and are assigned according to the Boussinesq's solution to a point load in half space. While traditional contact algorithms have difficulties converging on this problem, this technique converges in few iterations. Moreover, parallelization of the problem enables a full stochastic analysis to determine the effect of corrosion uncertainty on the cable's failure load. This method represents a dramatic improvement compared to the current inspection methods that are unreliable and expensive...|$|E

In {{this phase of the}} research effort, the feasibility of developing a passive surveillance system for identification of ruptures in tendon wires was evaluated and verified. The concept offers high potential for greatly increasing effectiveness of presently-utilized periodic tendon condition surveillance programs. A one-tenth scale ring model of the Palo Verde nuclear containment structure was built inside the Structural Laboratory. Dynamic scaling (similitude) relationships were used to relate measured sensor responses recorded during controlled wire breakages to the expected prototype containment tendon response. Strong and recognizable signatures were detected by the accelerometers used.

40|$|Existing shock sensors for car {{protection}} {{using the}} sensitive elements (SE) of piezoelectric, microphone and electromagnetic types and the analogue circuitry of signal processing, {{have a number}} of essential shortcomings: - piezoelectric sensitive elements have no characteristics repeatability that complicates their use in mass production; - microphone sensors are structurally complicated and demand difficult information signal processing; - sensitive elements of electromagnetic sensors demand individual control (a specified clearance to be set between a magnet and the coil). Use of analogue elements (resistors, capacitors) in the amplifier and filter circuits reduces temporary and temperature stability of characteristics. An adjustment of the sensor operating zones via variable resistors on a printed circuit is extremely inconvenient and doesn't allow to change quickly the sensor sensitivity depending on an external situation (for example, to increase quickly an operating zone of the sensor with an alarm system of a key fob when securing a car in the country or in the woods, or to reduce it in the street with heavy traffic streams). An analogue circuit–based sensor design disables its automatic adaptation to such external impacts as a rain, a stream passing by cars, etc. The article considers how to solve some of above problems while designing the two-zone digital shock sensors with a SE of electromagnetic type. It shows the SE design developed by the authors as a module containing the coil and a magnet, secured on the coil axis in a silicone extension. The circuitry solution and algorithms of signals processing allowed authors to realize a remote control of the prevention and alarm zones (with 16 gradation of sensitivity). The algorithm of self-adaptation to the repeating external impacts is proposed. The developed method to form the basic levels of digital comparators for each gradation of sensitivity enables the sensor to have the straight-line adjusting characteristic. The developed shock sensor is implemented as stock-produced items included in the car alarm systems of the trademark “Excellent” (made by JSC Magic Ring Ltd.). Operating experience (about 40 thousand pieces realized now) allows a proper adjustment of sensors to be possible on cars with any body type. A sufficient level of the sensor sensitivity proves it. The reliability of sensors is confirmed by failures statistics in use (0, 08 %). Failures are, usually, caused by the SE coil <b>wire</b> <b>break</b> in a soldering point of the coil leads to the printed circuit. However a number of shortcomings are also revealed. Experimental data processing of a test batch of sensors has shown that existing SE of electromagnetic type have the frequency of free vibrations f  80  5 Hz and a decay constant of transient under shock   0, 2 s. At these parameters a SE pass-band makes only f  1, 5 Hz, and the sensor responses only to the shock front, rather than to the secondary vibrations of a body. It is an essential drawback of the narrow-band sensors. The experiments conducted on test batch of sensors (10 samples) have shown essentially different sensitivities of sensors under shock {{in the direction of the}} sensitivity axis and perpendicular to it. This difference reaches 4 - 6 gradations of sensitivity. It means that when mounting a sensor on the particular car the orientation of sensitivity axis of the sensor will be of crucial importance that is also a shortcoming. It is shown that overcoming the specified drawbacks is hardly because of the improvement of sensitive elements suspension of electromagnetic sensors. Three-axial accelerometers implemented using MEMS technologies seem to be the most perspective application here. </p...|$|E

50|$|Using {{diamond wire}} for cutting {{does have the}} problem of being less robust (snapping when fatigued, bent, jammed or tangling) than solid cutting blades and {{possibly}} more dangerous because when the <b>wire</b> <b>breaks</b> it can whip. Because of the unique nature of DWC, most saws are expensive and are tailor made to handle Diamond Wire. Commercial saws that utilize solid blades can be augmented with diamond dust blades and thus may be more economical to operate in some areas. Another problem is when the diamond <b>wire</b> <b>breaks</b> in say, {{the middle of a}} 3000 ft reel leaving two 1500 ft reels of wire, thus requiring up to twice the saw direction change cycles to do the same cut and wearing out the wire saw and remaining diamond wire quicker. If the diamond <b>wire</b> <b>breaks</b> more towards an end, these shorter pieces (500 ft or less) of wire are practically unusable and are commonly disposed of due to the hundreds of feet required to thread the saw, leaving little wire to use for process cutting. Because the diamond abrasive is mechanically attached to the wire, the wire loses cutting effectiveness after a few cuts because most of the abrasive is worn off the wire. This means that the last cut may take much longer than the first cut making production timing less predictable. Diamond wire lasts around six cuts then either breaks in several places or is functionally worn out. The longevity greatly depends on the material cut and the number of slices per cut. Quality control of smaller diameter diamond wire also greatly affects wire life and getting a bad batch is not unknown.|$|R
