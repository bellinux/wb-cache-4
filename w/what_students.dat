5|$|The United States Academic Decathlon {{publishes a}} variety of study {{materials}} for the objective events, the profits from which support the program. The Resource Guides and the Basic Guides constitute {{the majority of the}} USAD corpus. An art reproduction booklet and music CD contain a particular year's relevant pieces and are issued separately from the Resource Guides. Study guides are also published and contain detailed topical outlines for each objective subject. These outlines specifically indicate which topics will require independent research beyond the material included in the Resource Guides. USAD also offered Research Guides until 2010, which outlined the basics of <b>what</b> <b>students</b> ought to research. However, in the 2010–2011 competition season, USAD announced that it would be eliminating independent research-based questions from the competitions.|$|E

The test is intended to assess students' readiness for college. The SAT was originally designed to not be aligned with high school curricula, but several adjustments were made for the version of the SAT introduced in 2016, and College Board president, David Coleman, has said that he also wanted to make the test reflect more closely <b>what</b> <b>students</b> learned in high school.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>student</b> attitudes are toward using social media in the classroom and if those attitudes influenced how they perceive instructors using social media in the classroom. Implementing a mixed method approach, this study conducted focus groups to gain an in-depth understanding of <b>what</b> <b>student</b> attitudes were and why they held those ideas. A survey was then distributed to the students’ in a Midwestern University to see if there was a relationship between students attitudes and their perceptions of instructors who use social media. Results showed that students do hold a positive attitude toward using social media if the participation was voluntary. The survey results showed only certain items (such as voluntariness and proficiency) moderately correlated with the perception of the instructor.

25|$|The {{option of}} {{completing}} a work term abroad {{is also a}} possibility through the University of Ottawa’s co-op program. Although {{there may not be}} as many job opportunities abroad directly presented, the opportunity still remains. However, most of the work terms abroad are discovered by students themselves, outside the co-op program. Typically, the requirements remain the same as for the co-op program itself. In certain cases, additional features may be considered. If one is considering working abroad there are information sessions held to further inform students at the University of Ottawa on work term abroad possibilities. The sessions outline <b>what</b> <b>students</b> should expect, various costs of living abroad, and the challenges they may come across. Furthermore, if a student chooses to pursue a work term abroad, the University of Ottawa’s co-op program offers further assistance right up to the departure date in order to ensure student success. Services offered may include meeting with a professional development specialist in order to compose a job-finding strategy, learn various success strategies, and work towards having everything ready before the departure date. In addition, training can be offered to help prepare students with an idea of what to expect, necessary documents, and further information on the work they will be completing and the country students may be traveling to.|$|E

2500|$|Uncritical use of {{standardized}} test scores to evaluate teacher and school performance is inappropriate, because the students' scores are influenced by three things: <b>what</b> <b>students</b> learn in school, <b>what</b> <b>students</b> learn outside of school, and the students' innate intelligence. The school only has control over one of these three factors. Value-added modeling has been proposed {{to cope with this}} criticism by statistically controlling for innate ability and out-of-school contextual factors. In a value-added system of interpreting test scores, analysts estimate an expected score for each student, based on factors such as the student's own previous test scores, primary language, or socioeconomic status. [...] The difference between the student's expected score and actual score is presumed to be due primarily to the teacher's efforts.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are three}} metrics {{by which the}} best {{performing}} countries in the TIMMS (the [...] "A+ countries") are measured: focus, coherence, and rigor. Focus {{is defined as the}} number of topics covered in each grade; the idea is that the fewer topics covered in each grade, the more focus can be given to each topic. The definition of coherence is adhering to a sequence of topics covered that follows the natural progression or logical structure of mathematics. The CCSSM was compared to both the current state standards and the A+ country standards. With the most number of topics covered on average, the current state standards had the lowest focus. The Common Core Standards aim to fix this discrepancy by helping educators focus on <b>what</b> <b>students</b> need to learn instead of becoming distracted by extraneous topics. They encourage educational materials to go from covering a vast array of topics in a shallow manner to a few topics in much more depth.|$|E

Two main forms of sex education are taught in American schools: comprehensive and [...] abstinence-only. A 2002 {{study conducted by the}} Kaiser Family Foundation found that 58% of secondary school principals describe their sex education curriculum as comprehensive, while 34% said their school's main message was abstinence-only. The difference between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject in the U.S. Some studies have shown abstinence-only programs to have no positive effects. Other studies have shown specific programs to result in more than 2/3 of students maintaining that they will remain abstinent until marriage months after completing such a program; such virginity pledges, however, are statistically ineffective, and over 95% of Americans do, in fact, have sex before marriage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of interior scenes {{for the film}} were shot in the former Hughes Aircraft soundstages at Playa Vista. From June2–4, the production filmed an action sequence at the Bethlehem Steel site in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which was used to represent a portion of Shanghai. Afterwards, they shot at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The crew moved to Philadelphia on June9, where they shot at a defunct PECO Richmond power station, the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, the Eastern State Penitentiary, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia City Hall, Rittenhouse Square, historic Chancellor Street (which represents a street near Place de la Concorde in Paris), and Wanamaker's. The production moved to Princeton University on June22. Filming there angered some students at the University of Pennsylvania, believing Bay had chosen to reshoot scenes at Princeton and script Princeton's name in the film. One shot that was filmed in the University of Pennsylvania was the party scene, filmed at <b>what</b> <b>students</b> call [...] "The Castle". [...] "The Castle" [...] {{is home to the}} prestigious Psi Upsilon Fraternity.

2500|$|At times, various vice Rectors of the Josephinum (the apostolic {{delegate}} to the United States was the nominal rector) would feel under the gun {{to clamp down on}} the student's access to [...] "worldly literature." [...] One such episode occurred after a visit of Bishop Joseph Mark McShea of Allentown, PA that led to a new vice Rector, Ralph Thompson, and some strict new rules, among them a [...] "book policy" [...] that limited <b>what</b> <b>students</b> could read. [...] Beyond spiritual and classroom books, students had to have a permission slip signed by a professor for any book in their college rooms. [...] One college student went to see Fick and asked him to sign a slip for John Dos Passos' trilogy [...] "USA" [...] and with great sadness Fick told him that while he was greatly pleased that this student wanted to read such a great work of American literature in three volumes, he didn't want his signature on a permission slip for such an author given the repressive atmosphere then in place at the Josephinum. [...] Fick sadly told the student to wait until summer, buy the book and read it during the vacation period. [...] Former Fick students who appreciated Fick's love of literature can only imagine what it took out of him to thus deny a student who wanted to read a good book. [...] This experience in censorship and mild repression had a profound influence on some students who never forgot what a powerful institution can do to an individual's spirit and went on to fight various institutions throughout their lives remembering Fick's resignation to powers over which a young English teacher had little influence.|$|E

In this age of rapidly changing contemporary operating environments facing the United States Army, soldiers need up-to-date curriculum in a timely and flexible package with access from remote locations worldwide. This study offered analysis and results from the students’ viewpoints of distance education at the USACGSC. The main research question was: <b>What</b> are <b>student</b> preferences for the delivery of the USACGSC distance education curriculum? To answer this research question, sub-questions needed to be answered. These sub-questions were: (1) <b>What</b> are <b>student</b> preferences for course material delivery? (2) <b>What</b> are <b>student</b> preferences for instructional methods? (3) <b>What</b> are <b>student</b> preferences for collaboration with other <b>students?</b> And (4) <b>What</b> are <b>student</b> preferences for research? The survey data were used to answer the research question and the sub-questions.
