40|$|Seismic waterguns produce {{acoustic}} energy {{that has the}} potential to affect aquatic organisms. This study examined the effects of exposure to a 1, 966. 4 cm³ <b>watergun</b> array (two units) on the abundance, behavior, and spatial distribution of Asian carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) and native fish species (i. e., bigmouth buffalo, Ictiobus cyprinellus; black buffalo, Ictiobus niger; channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus; flathead catfish, Pylodictis olivaris; freshwater drum, Aplodinotus grunniens; gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum; smallmouth buffalo, Ictiobus bubalus). Waterguns were deployed, approximately centered and perpendicular to the shoreline, in a channel that connects the Illinois River to a set of backwater gravel pits. To evaluate the effect of waterguns, six mobile side-looking split-beam hydroacoustic surveys were conducted at fixed times over a period of 12 days, during and between replicated <b>watergun</b> firing periods. Acoustic data collected over a five day period before placement of the waterguns were used as a control. Proximity to the waterguns of the first detected Asian carp while the <b>watergun</b> array was operational (52. 95 ± 7. 41 m, mean ± SE) was not different relative to when turned off (36. 53 ± 6. 08). In contrast, the closest detected native fish were farther from the waterguns while firing (32. 38 ± 3. 32 m) compared to when they were off (15. 04 ± 1. 6 m). The waterguns did not affect the abundance of acoustically detected Asian carp within the survey area, but the abundance of native fish was reduced during the firing treatment (115. 82 ± 10. 19) compared to both the control (203. 46 ± 12. 12) and off treatment (175. 84 ± 12. 16). The cumulative abundance of Asian carp relative to distance from the waterguns, examined at 50 m intervals up to 480 m bi-directionally away from the waterguns, was sporadically different (i. e., reduced abundance while the waterguns were firing) between treatments (i. e., at the 250, 300, 350, and 480 m intervals). In contrast, there was a significantly lower cumulative abundance of native fish during the firing treatment at every distance interval tested. The spatial distributions, relative to distance away from the waterguns, of both fish groups were affected by the firing of the waterguns. During active operation of the waterguns, there were proportionally less targets of both fish groups detected within a 50 m radius. While firing, there were proportionally more native fish farther than 400 m away {{on either side of the}} waterguns, and a larger proportion of Asian carp farther than 400 m from the waterguns on the northern side of the channel (i. e., closer to the Illinois River main channel). Asian carp and native fish were both more likely to be detected closer to the HMS pits when the waterguns were turned off. The <b>watergun</b> array did not influence the directional movement of detected Asian carp. In contrast, native fish were less likely to swim towards the IL River while the waterguns were firing versus not firing. The size distributions of both Asian carp and native fish species that remained in the survey area did not change across <b>watergun</b> treatments. It is concluded that the seismic <b>watergun</b> array examined in this study had a greater impact on native fish species than on Asian carp. Due to the lowered abundance, but not complete suppression of fish, it is suggested that the <b>watergun</b> array (as tested) is not suitable as a barrier for areas where absolute exclusion of fish is desired. The results from the spatial distribution analyses suggest the tested <b>watergun</b> array could be more suitable as a herding tool to facilitate removals of large fish aggregations. Caution should be taken to the extrapolation to other fish species and to fish exposed to seismic waterguns in different environments (i. e., deeper water, reduced shoreline interaction) or exposure to a larger array of waterguns...|$|E

The performance of the downsized MSV was tested for maximum sound level, frequency characteristic, horizontal directivity, and vertical directivity of the sound field generated from the downsized MSV in Suruga Bay about 100 km away from Tokyo. The sound source level and the frequency characteristic were equal to or higher than the estimated specification between 3 Hz and 300 Hz. The intensities of the generated sound fields observed at vertical and horizontal directions were equivalent to each other, which indicate that the generated sound field could be regarded almost omnidirectional. A trial seismic survey using a short streamer was also conducted and a shot gather was acquired with several different conditions in sweep frequency bands and in sweep lengths.

40|$|Very {{high-frequency}} marine multichannel seismic reflection data {{generated by}} small-volume air- or <b>waterguns</b> allow detailed, high-resolution studies of sedimentary {{structures of the}} order of one to few metres wavelength. The high-frequency content, however, requires (1) a very exact knowledge of the source and receiver positions, and (2) the development of data processing methods which take this exact geometry into account. Static corrections are crucial for the quality of very high-frequency stacked data because static shifts caused by variations of the source and streamer depths are {{of the order of}} half to one dominant wavelength, so that they can lead to destructive interference during stacking of CDP sorted traces. As common surface-consistent residual static correction methods developed for land seismic data require fixed shot and receiver locations two simple and fast techniques have been developed for marine seismic data with moving sources and receivers to correct such static shifts. The first method – called CDP static correction method – is based on a simultaneous recording of Parasound sediment echosounder and multichannel seismic reflection data. It compares the depth information derived from the first arrivals of both data sets to calculate static correction time shifts for each seismic channel relative to the Parasound water depths. The second method – called average static correction method – utilises the fact that the streamer depth is mainly controlled by bird units, which keep the streamer in a predefined depth at certain increments but do not prevent the streamer from being slightly buoyant in-between. In case of calm weather conditions these streamer bendings mainly contribute to the overall static time shifts, whereas depth variations of the source are negligible. Hence, mean static correction time shifts are calculated for each channel by averaging the depth values determined at each geophone group position for several subsequent shots. Application of both methods to data of a high-resolution seismic survey of channel-levee systems on the Bengal Fan shows that the quality of the stacked section can be improved significantly compared to stacking results achieved without preceding static corrections. The optimised records show sedimentary features in great detail, that are not visible without static corrections. Limitations only result from the sea floor topography. The CDP static correction method generally provides more coherent reflections than the average static correction method but can only be applied in areas with rather flat sea floor, where no diffraction hyperbolae occur. In contrast, the average static correction method can also be used in regions with rough morphology, but the coherency of reflections is slightly reduced compared to the results of the CDP static correction method. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The Center for Marine Resources and Environmental Technology {{has been}} {{developing}} a new method to improve the resolution of high-resolution seismic profiling. To achieve this the source signature is recorded and the reflected data are sampled {{at a very high}} rate. In addition a certain amount of post processing is performed. During September 1999 a series of seismic profiles were acquired in the Gulf of Mexico using a 15 in³ <b>watergun</b> towed at the surface and a short single-channel hydrophone array towed about 250 m below the surface. The profiles were digitized at a rate of 80 000 samples per second; the length of each record was 4 s. Two different processes were applied to the data: deterministic deconvolution and phase conjugation. Both have the effect of compressing each reflected wavelet into a short pulse that is symmetrical about a central lobe. The ratio of compression obtained by applying deterministic deconvolution on the source signature pulse was about 300; it was about 160 when applying phase conjugation. This produced a resolution of about 6 cm by the deconvolution process and about 10 cm by using phase conjugation. The deconvolution process however is more subject to noise so the better result in this experiment was found to be provided by phase conjugation...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} {{sedimentation}} and current {{activities at the}} northeastern flank of Walvis Ridge is investigated by a correlation of multichannel seismic data collected during R/V Meteor Cruise M 49 / 1 in early 2001 with borehole measurements of Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) Leg 208. During Meteor Cruise M 49 / 1 multi-frequency seismic data were collected using two different seismic sources, in a quasi simultaneous mode {{in order to get}} best possible penetration and resolution of the sub-surface structures. Walvis Ridge divides the southeastern Atlantic Ocean into two basins, the Angola Basin to the north and the Cape Basin to the south. It is well known as an impassable barrier for bottom waters which separates Antarctic Bottom Waters (AABW) widely distributed in the Cape Basin from North Atlantic Depth Waters (NADW) in the Angola Basin. The sediments of the northeastern flank of Walvis Ridge are characterized by mostly undisturbed sequences of Cenozoic sediments, with varying thickness of ~ 150 m {{at the edge of the}} Angola Basin and ~ 450 m at the axis of the ridge. A correlation of seismic data with borehole data was accomplished by calculating synthetic seismograms using GRA density measurements of the cores and an averaged velocity model. This 'simple' event modeling allows to assign ages to the seismic reflectors and to identify key horizons/boundaries like the E/O and the K/T boundaries as well as the ELMO event and deposits of the PETM, representing Cenozoic climatic events. The seismic pattern of these target horizons shows similar properties at the different sites indicating their regional distribution. A special static correction in addition to standard seismic processing steps resulted in high quality high resolution deep sea <b>Watergun</b> images. A comparison between the seismic images and the magnetic core measurements of Leg 208 proofs that <b>Watergun</b> data allows imaging of sub-meter sediment layers like the PETM or the ELMO event. In contrast to the lower resolution GI-Gun data, the critical transitions occur as single horizons, separated from each other by continuous lower amplitude reflector packages on the <b>Watergun</b> data. Several significant seismic reflectors, whose ages were determined using the stratigraphy of Leg 208, can be traced across the entire survey area. The reflectors represent the paleoseafloor of the study area under consideration of the subsidence though neglecting possible tectonic events as they are unknown for this region in the last 60 Ma. Gridding of these horizons leads to a model of the paleoseafloor, which shows that the rate of subsidence of the Angola Basin almost equals the increasing thickness of the sediment column. In addition the model indicates the development of a channel structure across the ridge in the southeast of the study area between 28 Ã Â°S and 30 Ã Â°S, which is possibly connected to an exchange of AABW and NADW between Cape Basin and Angola Basin. Determining the age of this channel by using Leg 208 stratigraphy suggests that current activities have increased since the Middle Miocene. Southwest of the area drilled during ODP-Leg 208, the seismic profiles of Meteor Cruise M 49 / 1 cross a suggested flow path of AABW between Cape Basin and Angola Basin in a region called Walvis Kom. Walvis Kom is suitable for a bottom water transfer due to its channel like structure. AABW in the Cape Basin might be pushed into the flow path by the Coriolis Force and continues to flow into the Angola Basin. Several toplap structures, contourite-sheeted drifts and sedimentary waves indicate recent bottom water activities in the channel. A combination of bathymetry data and seismic data shows a reduction of the current cross-section along the flow path, which must result in an increasing current velocity explaining less deposition along the path way in direction to the Angola Basin. A simple age model, based on the stratigraphy of Leg 208 at the 28 Ã Â°S, determines the initiation of strong current activities during the Lower Miocene at ~ 16 Ma. Undisturbed sediment sequences above indicate decreasing current speeds after ~ 10 Ma during the Upper Miocene. In addition to the assumption that Walvis Ridge builds an impassable barrier for bottom waters with at least two leakages (Walvis Passage and Namib Col), our results suggest two more leakages across the ridge. The initiation of bottom water exchange trough these pathways started during the Miocene. The Miocene is known as an oceanographic dynamic period for the South Atlantic, where for example the Central American Seaway was closed and the recent thermohaline circulation of the South Atlantic developed...|$|E
40|$|Obtaining {{very high}} {{resolution}} seismic images of sediments near {{the sea floor}} in deep water is fraught with problems. The conventional approach has been to tow a subbottom profiler near the bottom but, if the water depth is a kilometre or more, vessel speed and manoeuverability are so restricted that it becomes more economical to mount the profiler on an autonomous underwater vehicle. Either way, the survey would be expensive. Moreover, in depths of a kilometre or more, source energy levels are so restricted that the depth of subbottom penetration {{is limited to a}} few tens of metres. A research program at the University of Mississippi has been investigating ways of improving seismic resolution while achieving significant penetration and has obtained some remarkable results in the Gulf of Mexico. Deploying a commercial <b>watergun</b> just {{below the surface of the}} water and towing a single-channel hydrophone array at a few hundred metres depth, the program has demonstrated that, in a thousand metres of water, sea-floor resolutions of tens of centimetres and penetration of hundreds of metres can be achieved.

40|$|Off the Durham coast, the Permian {{succession}} {{above the}} Coal Measures contains limestones and anhydrite bands with high seismic velocities and reflection coefficients. The consequent reduction in penetration of seismic energy {{makes it difficult}} to determine Coal Measures structure by the seismic reflection method. Seismic data sets acquired from this region by the National Coal Board in 1979 and 1982 are used to illustrate that satisfactory results are difficult to achieve. Synthetic seismograms, generated for a simplified geological section of the region, are also used to study various aspects of the overall problem of applying the seismic technique in the area. Standard and non-standard processing sequences are applied to the seismic data to enhance the quality of the stacked sections and the results are discussed. This processing showed that in the 1979 survey, in which a <b>watergun</b> source and a 600 m streamer were used, some penetration was achieved but Coal Measures resolution on the final sections is poor. The 1982 data set, shot along a segment of the 1979 line using a sleeve exploder source and a 150 m streamer, showed no Coal Measures after processing.

The data encompasses a total frequency bandwidth from 20 to 1500 Hz. The analogue signal detected by the deeptow streamer was transmitted via a 8000 m long cable before being digitised in the acquisition unit. The submersion depth was typically 500 m (offsets 850 - 900 m, vessel’s speed about 3 kt). Despite the geometrical corrections inherent to the deep-tow system, advantages of such records over surface-towed data are the improvement of resolution (both lateral and vertical) and enhanced signal/noise ratio, as is evidenced by comparing the simultaneously recorded deeptowed rs. surface-towed acoustics sections. Next to that, data with larger offset can emphasise the presence of shallow gas accumulations (AVO-effect). At present, data are being analysed in GEOMAR and RCMG. First results indicate that the continuity and reflection amplitude of the BSR is observed to decrease with increasing source frequency, a feature explained in terms of vertical and horizontal resolution. GI-gun data give the best quality records with continuous high-amplitude BSR features in the entire area. On the very-high-frequency sparker profiles, the commonly-expected BSR is often replaced by a series of enhanced reflections, thought to be caused by gas saturation. This suggests that (1) gas migration and accumulation is stratigraphically and lithologically controlled and (2) the BSR as evidenced on lowerfrequency data originates {{at the top of the}} free gas layer rather than at the base of the hydrate stability zone...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{and discuss the}} frequency-dependent {{behaviour}} of the acoustic characteristics of methane hydrate-bearing sediments in Lake Baikal, Siberia. Five different types of seismic sources (airgun-array, two types of single airguns, <b>watergun</b> and sparker) are used, encompassing a frequency bandwidth from 10 up to 1000 Hz. On low-frequency airgun-array data, {{the base of the}} hydrate stability zone (HSZ) is observed as a high-amplitude bottom-simulating reflection (BSR) with reversed polarity. The amplitude and continuity of the BSR decrease or even disappear on medium- to high-frequency data, a feature explained in terms of vertical and horizontal resolution. The increasing reflection amplitude of the BSR with increasing offset, the calculated reflection coefficient of the BSR and the occurrence of enhanced reflections below the BSR suggest the presence of free gas below the HSZ. The observation of some enhanced reflections extending above the BSR may be interpreted as an indication for free gas co-existing with hydrates within the HSZ. Amplitude blanking above the BSR is highly variable while the BSR itself appears to act as a low-pass frequency filter for medium- to high-frequency data. New single-channel airgun profiles provide the first seismic information across the Baikal Drilling Project (BDP- 97) deep drilling site, at which hydrate-bearing sediments were retrieved at about 200 m above the base of the local HSZ. At the drilling site there are no seismic characteristics indicative of the presence of hydrates. Combination of the drilling and seismic information has allowed us to make a rough estimation of the volume of hydrates and carbon stored in the sediments of Lake Baikal, which lead us to conclude that the Lake Baikal gas hydrate reservoirs do not form a prospective energy resource...|$|E

40|$|Abyssal mud waves (or {{fine-grained}} sediment waves) {{are often}} cited as evidence for deep current activity because subbottom profiles show that the wave form has migrated with time. The migration history of a fine-grained sediment wave on the Blake-Bahama Outer Ridge (ODP Site 1062) has been studied through the analysis of multiple ODP holes spaced across the wave. Additional information about wave migration patterns comes from 3. 5 -kHz records and <b>watergun</b> seismic profiles. These data suggest that wave migration has varied during the last not, vert, similar ~ 10 Myr, although the only sediments sampled are younger than 4. 8 Ma. Seismic profiles suggest wave migration was initiated about 8 - 10 Ma, and wave migration was pronounced from about 5 Ma to about 1 Ma (with an episode of wave reorganization about 4. 5 Ma). Analysis of ODP cores suggests that migration rates have been somewhat lower and more variable during the last 1 Myr. Intervals of no wave migration are observed for several time intervals and appear to characterize deglaciations, especially during the last 500 kyr. Comparisons between seismic profiles and the core record show {{that most of the}} seismic horizons correlate closely with time horizons, and thus that the seismic profiles give a reasonable representation of sediment wave migration. Models suggest that wave migration is more pronounced during periods of higher bottom current flow and less pronounced during periods of lower current flow. Thus the migration record is consistent with generally higher bottom flow speeds at this site prior to 1 Ma and lower bottom flow speeds after 1 Ma. The Mid-Pleistocene Transition from a dominant climatic periodicity of 40 kyr to a dominant climatic periodicity of 100 kyr starts at about this time, suggesting an overall reduction in bottom flow speed at this site coincident with changing climate patterns. These changes in flow speed could be related to changes in the depth of the Western Boundary Undercurrent as well as to changes in the speed of thermohaline circulation...|$|E

A disadvantage is the necessary application of detailed geometrical corrections. During the R. V. Belgica 16 / 00 expedition, several seismic profiles have been recorded with the JUMBO configuration in the Belgica Mound Province, offshore Western Ireland. Mound structures appear as nearly transparent patches with only very weak and chaotic internal reflections and diffractions. Their height varies from a few 10 to over 100 m. Some rise above the sea floor while others are buried features. Beneath the erosional base of the mounds, sediment deposition has a sigmoidal configuration with high reflection amplitude. At the sides of a mound structure, some enhanced reflections occur with reversed polarity. Encoded instantaneous frequency displays reveal a sharp decrease of frequency content at exactly the same sub-bottom depths, a feature typical for attenuation. Whether this is attributed to the presence of free gases is unclear. In general, the mound structures itself do not appear as a low-pass frequency filter at the used acquisition frequencies while no significant velocity effects (pull-up, pull-down) are observed beneath the buried mound features. Although the data quality of the deep-tow streamer is not perfect, first results look very promising. Compared to the signals recorded with the surface streamer; the lateral resolution of the deep-tow system is strongly enhanced. The elimination of swell effects furthermore is an important advantage for the overall data quality...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{presence}} of methane hydrates has been evidenced in Lake Baikal, Siberia, by means of seismic profiling, deep drilling and shallow coring. This is -up to now- the only reported occurrence of gas hydrates in a confined fresh-water basin. In this presentation, we discuss the frequency-dependent acoustic characteristics of the hydrate-bearing sediments, using 5 different types of reflection seismic data encompassing frequencies from 10 to 1000 Hz. On low-frequency airgun-array data, {{the base of the}} hydrate stability zone (HSZ) is observed as a single, high-amplitude, inverse-polarity reflection that often crosscuts the local stratigraphy. Amplitude and continuity of the BSR decrease or even disappear on higher-frequency data. On medium- to high-frequency data (e. g. <b>watergun)</b> the base of the HSZ is no longer expressed as a single reflector, but rather as a facies change between enhanced reflections below and blanked reflections above. The increasing reflection amplitude of the BSR with increasing offset (AVO-analysis), the high reflection coefficient of the BSR (- 40 % of lake floor reflection) and {{the presence}} of enhanced reflections beneath the BSR suggest {{the presence of}} free gas below the HSZ. The observation of some enhanced reflections extending into the HSZ could even indicate that free gas may co-exist with hydrates within the HSZ. Blanking of the reflection amplitudes above the BSR is variable. Instantaneous frequency analyses reveal a low-frequency shadow beneath the BSR. We also collected lake-bottom reflection/refraction data, using GEOMAR's "Ocean-Bottom Hydrophones". Several profiles were recorded with a medium-resolution single airgun with sufficient energy to penetrate below the HSZ. The velocity information obtained from these measurements shows a distinct low-velocity layer below the base of the HSZ. Above, several higher-velocity layers are recognised. Modelling of interval velocities in this zone indicate hydrate presence of 5 to 8 % of pore volume. We also acquired new medium-frequency, single-channel airgun data at the BDP- 1997 site (Baikal Drilling Project), providing the first acoustic images from this location. Hydrates (10 % pore volume) were retrieved from 121 and 160 m sub-bottom depth, but still about 200 m above the base of the local hydrate stability field. Remarkably, the seismic data at the drilling site show no indications for the presence of hydrates at the hydrate-recovery depths (no acoustic blanking, no BSR). These results were used to roughly estimate the amount of carbon stored in the Lake Baikal hydrate reservoirs, showing that most probably they do not form a future energy resource...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 79 - 83). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Approximately 5, 300 km of digitally recorded high-resolution, nested, single-channel, seismic-refection data (2. 46 m? <b>watergun,</b> 200 - 500 Hz Geopulse acoustic source, and a CHIRP 2 - 7 kHz subbottom profiler) and coincident sidescan-sonar data collected over the New York Bight Apex on the U. S. Atlantic inner continental shelf were analyzed to develop {{a better understanding of the}} Quaternary evolution of this inner continental shelf environment. Interpretation of the subbottom data reveals several internal reflectors, all of which are unconformities. The deepest reflector termed R 7, identified in this data is a regional angular unconforming truncating the underlying Cretaceous-Tertiary coastal plain sediments. Reflector R 7 was formed by multiple glacio-eustatic sea-level oscillations occurring during the Pleistocene. Incised into R 7 are two major channels, an ancestral Hudson Shelf Valley and a second unnamed channel 20 km east. The geometry of reflector R 7 has exerted the greatest control over the Quaternary evolution of the shelf by limiting the accommodation space available for sediment accumulation. Quaternary sediment thicknesses overlying R 7 range from 0 adjacent the New Jersey shoreline and over a relative bathymetric high south of Long Island to > 70 meters in the Hudson Shelf Valley thalweg. Six internal reflectors above R 7 have been identified within the Quaternary sediment deposit. Three of the reflectors (R 6, R 5 and R 4) are limited to the partially unfilled channel of the Hudson Shelf Valley and are likely the result of glacio-fluvial processes during emergent periods prior to the late Wisconsin glacial maximum. Smaller paleo-channels within the Quaternary section have been preserved north and east of the Hudson Shelf Valley. Where the Quaternary unit is thicker, channels downcut into one another, resulting in only partial preservation of the individual channels. Truncating the channels is internal reflector R 2, a laterally continuous reflector which has been interpreted as the Holocene marine flooding transgressive surface. The early Holocene facies above reflector R 2, termed unit U 2, ranges from 0 - 10 meters (on average < 3 meters). Above unit U 2 is the shallow reflector, R 1, which is discernable within a meter of the sea floor and represents late Holocene ephemeral sediments being eroded from older units and continuously reworked by modern marine processes...|$|E
40|$|The gas {{hydrates}} research Consortium (HRC), {{established and}} administered at the University if Mississippi's Center for Marine Research and Environmental Technology (CMRET) {{has been active}} on many fronts in FY 03. Extension of the original contract through March 2004, has allowed completion of many projects that were incomplete {{at the end of}} the original project period due, primarily, to severe weather and difficulties in rescheduling test cruises. The primary objective of the Consortium, to design and emplace a remote sea floor station for the monitoring of gas hydrates in the Gulf of Mexico by the year 2005 remains intact. However, the possibility of levering HRC research off of the Joint Industries Program (JIP) became a possibility that has demanded reevaluation of some of the fundamental assumptions of the station format. These provisions are discussed in Appendix A. Landmark achievements of FY 03 include: (1) Continuation of Consortium development with new researchers and additional areas of research contribution being incorporated into the project. During this period, NOAA's National Undersea Research Program's (NURP) National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology (NIUST) became a Consortium funding partner, joining DOE and Minerals Management Service (MMS); (2) Very successful annual and semiannual meetings in Oxford Mississippi in February and September, 2003; (3) Collection of piston cores from MC 798 in support of the effort to evaluate the site for possible monitoring station installation; (4) Completion of the site evaluation effort including reports of all localities in the northern Gulf of Mexico where hydrates have been documented or are strongly suspected to exist on the sea floor or in the shallow subsurface; (5) Collection and preliminary evaluation of vent gases and core samples of hydrate from sites in Green Canyon and Mississippi Canyon, northern Gulf of Mexico; (6) Monitoring of gas activity on the sea floor, acoustically and thermally; (7) Design, construction, and successful deployment of an in situ pore-water sampling device; (8) Improvements to the original Raman spectrometer (methane sensor); (9) Laboratory demonstration of the impact of bacterially-produced surfactants' rates of hydrate formation; (10) Construction and sea floor emplacement and testing [...] with both <b>watergun</b> and ship noise sources [...] of the prototypal vertical line array (VLA); (11) Initiation of studies of spatial controls on hydrates; (12) Compilation and analyses of seismic data, including mapping of surface anomalies; (13) Additional field verification (bottom samples recovered), in support of the site selection effort; (14) Collection and preliminary analyses of gas hydrates from new sites that exhibit variant structures; (15) Initial shear wave tests carried out in shallow water; (16) Isolation of microbes for potential medicinal products development; (17) Preliminary modeling of occurrences of gas hydrates...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of high-resolution <b>watergun</b> seismic profiles collected {{in support of}} DSDP Leg 85 drilling reveals sev eral major, regionally traceable reflectors that can be correlated over more than 360, 000 km 2 in the central equatorial Pacific. Synthetic seismograms generated from shipboard physical property measurements (carefully corrected to in situ values) for DSDP Site 574 show excellent agreement with the field records; the agreement suggests that the traveltime to-depth conversion is accurate and permits the precise (± 5 m) location of reflectors in the cored section. The reflectors can be dated (± 0. 5 Ma) as follows: Orange, 21. 5 to 22. 5 Ma; Yellow, 20. 5 to 21. 5 Ma; Lavender, 16 to 17 Ma; Red, 13. 5 to 14. 5 Ma; Purple, 11 to 12 Ma; Brown, 7 to 8 Ma; and Green, 3 to 4 Ma. Similar analyses at the other Leg 85 sites result in identical ages. The reflectors are thus time surfaces; this chapter relates them to major paleoceanographic events {{and changes in the}} relative sea-level curve. The Orange and Yellow reflectors are associated with a marked increase in δ 1 3 C, a major change in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages, the development of the deep Circum-Antarctic Current, and the establishment of steep thermal gradients between tropical and polar regions. This reorganization of the oceanic circulation system was probably a response to the opening of the Drake Passage, and it resulted in changes in the chemistry of tropical Pacific waters that caused the induration (and thus impedance contrasts) associated with these reflectors. The Lavender reflector is associated with a large carbonate minimum, the 2 ̆ 2 Chron 16 carbon shift, 2 ̆ 2 a widespread hiatus (NH 2), major eustatic sea-level fluctuations, and a significant increase in silica deposition in the Pacific. It is not associated with 18 O enrichment or climatic cooling. We conclude that this event represents an intensification in Antarc tic Bottom Water (AABW) circulation and the partitioning of silica between the Atlantic and the Pacific, caused by the introduction of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) in response to paleobathymetric and tectonic events. The Red re flector is associated with a subdued carbonate minimum, a widespread hiatus (NH 3), a sea-level drop, significant changes in microfossil assemblages, and a major increase in δ 1 8 that has been linked with the buildup of Antarctic ice. Detailed isotopic analyses reveal that this isotopic shift occurred within an interval of 30, 000 yr. and precisely at the depth of the Red reflector. The Purple reflector is associated with an extremely large carbonate minimum, a change in the style of carbonate deposition in the Pacific, a major lithologic boundary, a widespread hiatus (NH 4), an increase in the provincialism be tween low and high latitudes in all planktonic microfossil assemblages, an apparent fall in eustatic sea level, an enrich ment in δ 1 8, and a major North Atlantic reflector interpreted as representing an intensification of North Atlantic bot tom-water circulation. The Brown reflector is roughly associated with a small carbonate minimum, an enrichment in δ 1 8, the late Miocene 1 3 C depletion, a drop in the relative sea-level curve, and major faunal changes. The Green reflector is associated with a large carbonate minimum, an enrichment in δ 1 8, a major western North Atlantic erosional event, and a widespread eastern Atlantic seismic reflector. The bulk of evidence supports correlation with the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, but detailed isotopic analyses indicate that this isotopic event may be linked to the establishment of colder bottom waters without major ice-sheet development. Several types of reflectors have been identified. The reflectors in the older section result from diagenetic effects; the regionally correctable reflectors are associated with global events. In the younger (post- 18 Ma) section, local reflectors are characterized by velocity contrasts, whereas regional reflectors are associated with density contrasts caused by car bonate minima. Two modes of generation of carbonate minima (and thus of reflectors) spanning the equatorial Pacific are (1) the intensification of AABW without the concurrent intensification of NADW and so without fractionation of silica between the Atlantic and the Pacific; this mode results in the less extreme carbonate minima; and (2) the intensifi cation of AABW in response to the intensification of NADW; this mode results in extreme carbonate minima and a cor relation of equatorial Pacific reflectors with North Atlantic events...|$|E
40|$|Academic {{research}} in the Southern Ocean comprises both high-resolution reflection seismic surveys to study - for instance - the depositional history of fine-scale sedimentary structures and lower-resolution, deep-penetrating reflection and refraction seismic surveys to study - for instance - large scale crustal structures. These studies are usually embedded in research programs focussing on topics like the geodynamic evolution and the plate tectonic, paleoceanographic and climatic history of the Southern Ocean. Single airguns or airgun arrays of small size and volume and single- and multi-channel streamers are usually used as sound sources and receivers for high-resolution reflection seismic surveys, whereas airguns and airgun arrays of larger size and volume and ocean-bottom-hydrophones and seismometers and single- and multi-channel streamers are usually applied for lower-resolution, deep penetrating reflection and refraction seismic surveys. To ensure that these research activities do not affect marine wildlife and particularly marine mammals in the Southern Ocean adversely knowledge of the sound pressure field of the seismic sources is essential. Therefore, as an example, a broadband marine seismic source calibration study conducted with R/V Polarstern at the Heggernes Acoustic Range, Herdlefjord, Norway in October 2003 is presented here. The objectives were (1) to determine the spatial distribution of the sound pressure levels emitted by the airguns and airgun arrays available at the Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany in October 2003, (2) to determine the frequency bandwidth, the spectral peak level and the amplitude decay at higher frequencies, and the cumulative and total energy of the different source signatures, (3) to determine the theoretical, back-projected nominal source levels at 1 m distance from far-field measurements assuming a spherical amplitude spreading, (4) to determine radii, within which according to the presently applied thresholds and the current scientific knowledge marine mammals might possibly experience behavioral or physiological disturbance or physical injury due to the received sound pressure levels. Up to now thresholds defined by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), USA have often been used. According to these regulations received levels greater than 180 dBrms re 1 µPa might possibly cause hearing effects like temporary threshold shifts (TTS), and received levels greater than 160 dBrms re 1 µPa might possibly lead to behavioral disturbances like avoidance of the sound source for cetaceans. For underwater pinnipeds received levels are allowed to be 10 dBrms higher. Furthermore, recent studies on mid-frequency cetaceans like bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and white whales (Delphinapterus leucas) have shown {{that in addition to}} the (rms-) sound pressure level the signal duration and energy plays an important role whether and to what extent TTS is induced. Therefore, a dual criterion which takes both the maximum peak pressure level and the total energy flux level (= sound exposure level (SEL)) into account is recommended as improved, science-based mitigative tool, and a 90 % energy approach is recommended for the derivation of the signal duration. During the 2 nd meeting of the Marine Mammal Commission in 2004, the Noise Exposure Criteria Group introduced first levels for such a dual criterion which take the different characteristics of impulsive signals (e. g. seismic airguns) and quasi-monofrequency tones (e. g. sonars) into account, and defines that TTS is potentially induced if either a peak pressure of 224 dB re 1 µPa or a SEL of 183 dB re 1 µPa 2 s for impulsive signals or 195 dB re 1 µPa 2 s for quasi-monofrequency tones is exceeded. For underwater pinnipeds levels are defined to be 20 dB lower. To give a complete overview, here radii are presented for both the rms-level and the dual peak pressure and SEL-based criterion, using the presently known thresholds. It is worth to mention that the 195 dBSEL threshold for quasi-monofrequency tones is based on many consistent TTS measurements on bottlenose dolphins and white whales and is therefore rather well established, whereas the 224 dB 0 -pk and the 183 dBSEL threshold for impulsive signals presently relies on only one measured TTS induced in a white whale by a <b>watergun</b> signal and is therefore possibly subject to change in future, when additional data and/or new scientific knowledge is available. To determine the spatial distribution of the sound pressure levels during the calibration survey each airgun (array) was shot along a line of 2 - 3 km length running between 2 hydrophone chains with receivers in 35, 100, 198 and 263 m depth. A GI-Gun (2. 4 l), a G-Gun (8. 5 l) and a Bolt PAR CT 800 (32. 8 l) were deployed as single sources, and 3 GI-Guns (7. 4 l), 3 G-Guns (25. 6 l) and 8 VLF-Guns (24 l) as arrays. The measurements are complemented by a modeling approach for an 8 G-Gun (68. 2 l) and an 8 G-Gun+ 1 Bolt PAR CT 800 array (100. 1 l). The data analysis was based on the "SEG Standard for Specifying Marine Seismic Energy Sources" and includes a determination of the peak-to-peak, zero-to-peak and RMS-amplitudes, sound exposure levels and amplitude spectra as function of source-receiver distance. The amplitude vs distance graphs, analyzed for the 4 hydrophone depths, show the typical directivity of marine seismic sources. Due the destructive interference of the direct wave and the ghost reflection, amplitudes almost vanish close to the sea surface and are highest in several hundred meters depth ("Lloyd mirror effect"). A comparison between the amplitudes recorded during approach and departure reveals a shadowing effect of Polarsterns's hull. Amplitudes recorded at the same source-receiver distance are lower during approach than during departure indicating that the ship's hull deflects sound propagation forward the ship. Mitigation radii derived from the amplitude vs distance graphs of the deepest hydrophone for the 180 dBrms level vary between 200 - 600 m for the measured single airguns and between 300 - ~ 1300 m for the measured and modeled airgun arrays. Extrapolated source levels range from 224 - 239 dB 0 -pk re 1 µPa @ 1 m for the single airguns and from 232 - ~ 250 dB 0 -pk re 1 µPa @ 1 m for the airgun arrays. Spectral peak levels occur below 100 Hz, amount to 182 - 194 dB re 1 µPa/Hz @ 1 m and decrease by ~ 30 dB re 1 µPa/Hz within the 1 kHz range, and by ~ 50 - 60 dB re 1 µPa/Hz within the broadband range up to 96 kHz. A first modeling approach of source directivities based on the assumptions of deep water and a homogeneous water column shows slight differences between the amplitude decay curves of the single G-Gun signals recorded at the 2 deepest hydrophones and more pronounced discrepancies for the recordings at the 2 shallow hydrophones. One possible explanation for these discrepancies is a stratification of the water column. Further studies which replace the assumption of a homogenous water column by a depth-dependent sound velocity profile in the modeling approach are necessary here...|$|E
