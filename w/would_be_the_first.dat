5|$|Another {{finding of}} this study was that Aetosauroides lies outside Stagonolepididae. If this {{phylogeny}} is correct, Stagonolepididae and Aetosauria would not be equivalent groupings, and Aetosauroides <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> non-stagonolepidid aetosaur. The following cladogram simplified after an analysis presented by Julia B. Desojo, Martin D. Ezcurra and Edio E. Kischlat (2012).|$|E

The club's first silverware at Windsor arrived in the 1906–07 season, with the club lifting both the league title and the County Antrim Shield. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of a trio of league titles, with the 1907–08 and 1908–09 league titles to follow.|$|E

5|$|The {{documentary}} Crossfire Hurricane, {{directed by}} Brett Morgen, {{was released in}} October 2012. He conducted approximately fifty hours of interviews for the documentary, including extensive interviews with Wyman and Taylor.

5|$|As noon {{drew near}} with no sight of either Huger or Magruder, who were {{supposed}} to be manning the Confederate right flank, Lee replaced these two forces with the smaller units of Brig. Gens. Armistead and Wright, two of Huger's brigades that had reached the battlefield some time earlier. Huger and his other two brigades (under Brig. Gens. Ransom and Mahone) were still too far north of the scene. Despite the mishaps and disunity, Malvern Hill <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time during the Seven Days Battles that Lee managed to concentrate his force.|$|E
5|$|Conflicting reports {{initially}} made {{it impossible}} to determine who had made the first kill, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> North Korean plane shot down by the United Nations forces in the war. Later research indicated Hudson had successfully shot down the first aircraft. The exact timing of Hudson and Moran's victories remains unclear, and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, Little was awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E

His next tournament <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Grand Slam {{of the year at}} the 2011 Australian Open, where del Potro was defeated by 21st seed Marcos Baghdatis in the second round. As a result, del Potro slipped further down the rankings to No. 485.|$|E
5|$|Discovered by Alex Gordon as an unproduced {{screenplay}} by Hollywood writer Frank Quattrocchi, The Projected Man {{was directed by}} Ian Curteis; it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> theatrical film that he would direct. However, due to his lack of experience, he ran into several problems during filming. As the film fell behind schedule and the budget kept increasing, he was fired during the film's final stages. Producer John Croydon replaced him; however, Croydon remained uncredited as the producers {{did not wish to}} publicise the problems which had occurred on set.|$|E

Driving a Formula Pacific spec Ralt RT4 powered by a 1.6 litre Ford engine, Prost sat on pole for the race {{with a time of}} 39.18. He then led every lap to win what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of 3 Australian Grand Prix wins. He {{finished}} 15.32 seconds clear of Laffite, with 1981 AGP winner, young Brazilian driver Roberto Moreno finishing third.|$|E

5|$|In early 2009, McCann {{received}} a brief {{to create a}} new campaign for the latest entrant into the Halo series, a first-person shooter called Halo 3: ODST. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> game in the franchise not to feature the series' protagonist, the Master Chief. McCann returned with a pitch for a campaign in the same vein as Believe, aiming to humanize the soldiers featured in the Halo universe. The project was greenlit, and McCann brought back several collaborators from Believe to handle this new campaign, now given the working title of The Life.|$|E

During the early 1980s she established a prison-outreach program {{in the hope of}} attracting incarcerated individuals to Odinism, in doing so getting Odinism legal recognition as a religion from the state of Florida. In the prisons, the Odinist Fellowship organised four seasonal festivals a year that were marked with sumbel as well as commemorating Hitler's birthday.|$|E
5|$|In {{their history}} the Seattle Sounders FC have used three primary goalkeepers. US {{national}} team member and Seattle area native Kasey Keller was the goalkeeper for the team's first three seasons. In November 2011, {{just shy of}} his 42nd birthday, Keller retired. Austrian Michael Gspurning was brought in as Keller's replacement in 2012. After two seasons Gspurning and the Sounders FC front office were unable {{to come to an}} agreement on a contract and Gspurning was released. Toronto FC traded Stefan Frei to the Sounders in December 2013. Frei <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> choice goalkeeper for the Sounders from the 2014 season to present.|$|E

5|$|It was the Stones' {{first public}} concert in over two years, and was planned as an {{introduction}} of new guitarist, Mick Taylor, though circumstances inevitably changed {{following the death of}} former member Brian Jones two days earlier. The band rehearsed at the Beatles' studio in the basement of Savile Row, and Jagger and Richards came up with a 14-song set; the Hyde Park concert <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time many of the songs had been played before a public audience. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who had already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 2009, it was {{announced}} that the new album title would be In This Light and on This Evening and that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> band to play at the new O2 Academy Birmingham. Through producer Flood's heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production. Flood, who is famous for collaborating with electronic music influenced bands like U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers and Erasure, helped develop synthetic elements on the album, which resulted in a mixed reception from long-term fans as to the group's new direction.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2013, Marc Webb {{posted on}} Twitter that {{principal}} photography had begun {{and that the}} sequel was being shot on 35 mm film in the anamorphic format, instead of being filmed digitally as the preceding film was.
