5|$|After {{kicking off}} {{to start the}} game, Arizona got the ball first in the second half. Their first drive went three-and-out. After a 51-yard punt, Nevada took over at their own 11-yard line. They put {{together}} an 11-play, 89-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Cody Fajardo to Richy Turner. During the course of throwing the touchdown pass, Fajardo hurt his hand and was seen shaking it on his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone to celebrate the score. He returned for Nevada's next offensive drive. Arizona's next drive got them into Nevada territory, but an interception thrown by Matt Scott ended any hopes of scoring. Nevada took the field and drove 84 yards down the field on 15 plays. Near {{the end of the}} drive once Nevada was inside the 10-yard line, Fajardo ran the ball for a gain of three yards. During the course of the play, he took a hit to the head from an Arizona defender. He exited the game for one play, but subsequently returned on that drive and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown. Arizona was held scoreless in the quarter, and heading into the final quarter of regulation, Nevada possessed a 45-28 lead.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Yepremian {{increased}} Miami's lead to 19–14 with a 46-yard field goal. Later in the period, Oakland got the ball on their own 17-yard line. Stabler started the drive with an 11-yard completion to Biletnikoff. On the next play, he threw a pass to Cliff Branch at the Dolphins' 27-yard line. Branch made a spectacular diving catch and then got back up and ran {{the rest of the}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for a 72-yard touchdown reception, giving the Raiders a 21–19 lead with 4:37 left in the game. With 2:08 left to play, the Dolphins took a 26–21 lead with a 68-yard, 4-play drive that ended with Benny Malone's 23-yard touchdown run, evading four tackle attempts by Raider defenders on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone.|$|E

25|$|The lead {{changed hands}} once more with 4:07 {{to play in}} the third quarter, as Leinart hit tight end Dominique Byrd for two of his four catches and 21 of his 32yards in the next drive and set up the next score. Although USC had been stopped on a fourth-and-short attempt earlier in the game, it decided to gamble again on fourth-and-one from the 12, and this time White muscled it all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone to record his third rushing {{touchdown}} of the game and the 57th of his career. The achievement set a USC record.|$|E
25|$|The Bizon uses {{a simple}} {{straight}} blowback method of operation, an unlocked breech system reduces cost and build complexity. The Bizon's operating cycle {{is characterized by}} a very short recoil stroke, standard 9×18mm ammunition will only drive the bolt partially {{to the rear of the}} receiver and produces a cyclic rate of 700 rounds/min. High-impulse ammunition forces the bolt to travel all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the receiver, barely striking the receiver wall. A rate of fire of 650–680 rounds/min is the result. This has the effect of reducing perceived recoil and increasing controllability and hit probability.|$|E
25|$|Houston {{took the}} opening kickoff {{and drove to}} the Steelers 40-yard line, but were stopped there and Tony Zendejas missed a 55-yard field goal. Later in the quarter, Steelers rookie Jerry Olsavsky blocked a punt from Greg Montgomery and Pittsburgh {{recovered}} on the Oilers 23. Eventually facing fourth and 1 on the Houston 9-yard line, Steelers coach Chuck Noll decided to go for the first down. This paid off as running back Tim Worley took a pitch and ran all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone, evading linebacker Robert Lyles and plowing right through safety Bubba McDowell {{on the way to a}} 7–0 Steelers lead with 2:36 left in the first quarter.|$|E

25|$|The Patriots were {{severely}} depleted by injuries, playing without star {{running back}} Curtis Martin. Pro Bowl tight end Ben Coates {{was limited to}} just a few plays, while receiver Terry Glenn was out of the game a few minutes into the fourth quarter. On the third play of the game, rookie defensive back Chad Scott intercepted a pass from New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe and returned it 27 yards to the Steelers 38. Stewart then got the team to the Patriots 40-yard line, converting two third downs with 10-yard completions to Charles Johnson before taking the ball the rest of the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone on a 40-yard score, the longest touchdown run in Steelers playoff history at the time.|$|E
25|$|Minnesota {{took the}} second half kickoff and moved the ball all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone with a 1-yard {{touchdown}} run by Anderson, increasing their lead to 21-7. The Rams countered with a 33-yard field goal from Lansford, but in the fourth quarter, Wilson completed a 44-yard pass to Anthony Carter on the LA 5-yard line. On the next play, he threw a touchdown pass to tight end Carl Hilton, giving the team a 28-10 lead and essentially putting the game out of reach. The Rams managed one more touchdown with 1:11 {{left in the game}} on Everett's 11-yard pass to tight end Pete Holohan, but Browner recovered their onside kick attempt and the Vikings ran {{out the rest of the}} clock.|$|E
25|$|Byner {{ran for a}} 66-yard {{touchdown}} with 11:03 left in {{the third}} quarter, the longest play in Cleveland's postseason history, to give Cleveland a 21–3 lead. However, Miami then controlled the rest of the game. A 13-play 74-yard drive, aided by a 15-yard late hit penalty against Cleveland and a 15-yard reception by Mark Clayton, was capped by Marino's 6-yard touchdown pass to Nat Moore. Miami's defense quickly forced a punt, and Jeff Gossett's kick went just 26 yards to the Browns 49-yard line. From there it took just five plays to score on a 31-yard burst by Ron Davenport, who trucked right through Rodgers and linebacker Clarence Weathers on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone. Browns receiver Glen Young gave his team a chance to get their momentum back with a 35-yard kickoff return to the 42-yard line. But after a holding penalty wiped out a first down run, Cleveland could not recover and had to punt.|$|E
50|$|Teams {{would then}} make their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> River Plate Stadium for the race's final challenge.

25|$|The Chargers {{continued}} {{to cut away}} at the Raiders lead in the second half, driving 68 yards in 12 plays on their opening drive. Two dropped passes by Jefferson {{in the end zone}} spoiled their chances for a touchdown, but Rolf Benirschke kicked a 26-yard field goal, making the score 28-17. Their defense then forced a punt, which Mike Fuller returned 28 yards to the Raiders 41-yard line. From there, San Diego took the ball all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone, scoring on a 7-play drive that ended on Chuck Muncie's 6-yard touchdown run, cutting the deficit to 28–24. Oakland responded with a 68-yard drive, including a 22-yard completion from Plunkett to King, leading to Chris Bahr's 27-yard field goal to retake their 7-point lead. Then after a three and out, Matthews returned Partridge's next punt six yards to the Oakland 49, where the Raiders added a 33-yard field goal from Bahr to increase their lead to 34–24 with 9:46 left in the game.|$|E
25|$|On {{their first}} drive {{of the second}} quarter, Cleveland managed {{to tie the game}} with McDonald's 47-yard {{completion}} to Ricky Feacher setting up Matt Bahr's franchise playoff record 52-yard field goal. But Los Angeles quickly stormed back with an 88-yard scoring drive. Plunkett completed five passes on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone, including a pair of 24-yarders to Christensen and Branch, while Allen finished the drive a 2-yard touchdown run to give the Raiders a 10–3 lead. With 2:01 left in the half, Cleveland tied the game {{at the end of a}} 76-yard drive with McDonald's 43-yard touchdown pass to Feacher. But aided by Greg Pruitt's 40-yard kickoff return to the Raiders 40, Plunkett was able to get his team into scoring range, completing three passes for 26 yards and rushing for 11. Chris Bahr kicked a 37-yard field goal on the last play of the quarter, giving LA a 13–10 lead going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|Bradshaw threw a 2-yard {{touchdown}} pass to tight end Bennie Cunningham in the third quarter, and later a 9-yard {{touchdown pass}} to Stallworth that gave the Steelers a 28-17 lead three plays into the fourth quarter. But {{this would be the}} end of his success as he completed only three of his next 11 passes in the final quarter. The next time Pittsburgh had the ball, cornerback Jeff Allen intercepted Bradshaw's pass and returned it eight yards to the Steelers 29-yard line. Pittsburgh defensive back Mel Blount intercepted a pass in the end zone on the second play of the ensuing drive, but it was eliminated by a holding penalty on linebacker Jack Ham. Five plays later, Fouts cut the score to 28-24 with an 8-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Winslow. Following six consecutive handoffs by Bradshaw, San Diego got the ball back on their own 36-yard line due to a 20-yard punt by John Goodson with four minutes left in the game. Four runs by Muncie moved the ball 33 yards to a third and 7 situation on the Steelers 12-yard line. On the next play, Fouts connected with Winslow on a screen pass, and the tight end took it all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone for the game winning score with less than a minute left on the clock.|$|E

25|$|Houston got {{the ball}} first and on their opening play, they lost three yards on a screen pass. Once that was done, quarterback Warren Moon got them rolling all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone. Despite two fumbled snaps on the drive, he {{completed}} 8/10 passes for 64 yards, including a 24-yarder to Haywood Jeffires, on a 16-play, 80-yard drive that took 9:14 off the clock and ended with his 5-yard touchdown pass to receiver Ernest Givins. New York had to punt on their first possession, but {{got the ball}} back with great field position when defensive back Erik McMillan intercepted Moon's pass on the Oilers 39-yard line. The Jets then cashed in on their opportunity with a 9-play drive to score on Ken O'Brien's 10-yard touchdown pass to Al Toon, who made an athletic catch {{in the back of}} the end zone while barely managing to keep his feet in bounds. Later on, Houston defensive back Bo Orlando intercepted a long pass from O'Brien on the Oilers 25, and Moon led the team to a touchdown from there, completing passes to Drew Hill and Givins for 20 and 35 yards before Givins' 20-yard touchdown reception made the score 14–7 with 3:56 left in the half. New York ended up punting, but at the 1:10 mark, Houston's Al Del Greco missed a 46-yard field goal wide right. O'Brien then completed a pair of passes to Toon for 36 total yards on a drive to the Oilers 16-yard line where Raul Allegre kicked a 33-yard field goal to cut the score to 14–10 going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|Once again, Akers' {{kick and}} Ware's return placed the Giants in good field position, with Manning {{beginning}} the drive at the Giants' 36-yard line with 1:10 left. However, the drive began with two incomplete passes, {{and after a}} third-down sack by DT Trevor Laws put the Giants at their own 29-yard line, the Giants called a timeout as the play clock was about to expire on fourth down with 12 seconds left. Officials then ruled to reset the game clock to 0:14 as the Giants' punt team and the Eagles' punt return team came onto the field. The snap from long snapper Zak DeOssie to punter Matt Dodge was high, and Dodge hastily kicked a line drive punt to Jackson rather than kicking {{the ball out of}} bounds. Jackson received the ball at the Eagles' 35-yard line and immediately muffed the catch before picking the ball up and backpedaling to the 30-yard line. (This was later claimed by some to cause the Giants' coverage to collapse, ironically assisting Jackson.) Jackson ran through a group of Giants and made it to midfield before receiving a huge block by WR Jason Avant on DeOssie, leaving no one in front of Jackson on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zone (Avant actually gave himself a concussion on the block, and both players were left lying on the field {{for the rest of the}} play). Ware followed Jackson but could not catch him. After the clock hit 0:00, Jackson ran parallel to the goal line across most of the width of the field—according to Jackson after the game, because he wanted to be sure the clock had expired, though some observers believed it to be due to his showboating nature — before advancing into the end zone for the game-winning touchdown. With no flags on the field, Jackson threw the ball into the New Meadowlands stands in celebration as the team gathered around him near the end zone. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin was so livid he threw his play sheet and notes onto the ground and ran onto the field before Jackson even reached the end zone, yelling at Dodge for not punting the ball out of bounds. Per NFL rules, Akers came out to kick the extra point and the Eagles won the game 38–31.|$|E

After losing the year before, McMillin had promised that Centre would beat Harvard in 1921 (despite the Crimson's undefeated record since 1918). Before 43,000 fans, McMillin dashed 32 yards for the lone touchdown in a 6–0 Centre victory which ended Harvard's 25-game winning streak.

With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on 29 September but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he slid, his foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. [...] "I began to slide about five feet from the plate.
