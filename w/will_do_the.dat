5|$|Each {{district}} has fashion trends that affect gameplay. By wearing pins or clothing {{from the more}} popular brands in that district, items' effects will be improved; wearing the least fashionable items <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> opposite, and items from brands in between are not affected. However, the player can increase a brand's popularity in one district by repeatedly fighting battles in that district while wearing items of that brand. The player can enter shops to buy new pins, clothes, and food items that are gradually consumed during battles to improve the characters' basic attributes.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he looks into the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, who <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> {{unpleasant}} thing, the necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E

25|$|Many {{ceremonies and}} rituals of the Canadian Forces have a royal connection.

Canada has mounted the King's/Queen's Guard eight times since 1916, including Canadian Coronation Contingents for King George VI in May 1937 and for Queen Elizabeth II in May 1953. Also, whenever the sovereign or a member of her family is in Ottawa, they will lay a wreath at the National War Memorial (which itself was dedicated in 1939 by King George VI) and <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same if at a Canadian war monument overseas.|$|E
25|$|Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg {{replacer}} and Ener-G egg replacer, {{are available}} for cooking and baking.

Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fifth}} season opener, Max proposes to Naomi after leaving his bride-to-be {{standing}} at the altar. They elope and get married. When they return to Naomi's place to celebrate, Alec, Max's business partner tells Naomi that her and Max's relationship is a mistake. He tries multiple times to sabotage their relationship, but ultimately fails. Fed up of always fighting with Alec, Naomi asks Max to choose between her and Alec. While Max chooses her, which forces him to fire Alec from his company, their relationship becomes strained. Max and Naomi search for a replacement to Alec and when she sees the resume of Bryce Woodbridge, she tells Max to meet him as {{he seems to be}} the best candidate. However, after she discovers that Bryce is actually a woman, Naomi says she <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job. After an unsuccessful attempt at the job, she asks Bryce to reconsider their offer. Bryce accepts the position but manages to fire Max, which was set up by Alec. He later admits to Naomi that he is in love with Max, who in the meantime has left for a gamer conference in Iceland. Naomi finds out that he had been hiding at his parents' house. The couple seeks the help of a marriage counselor. Max explains he didn't want Naomi to run his life and the counselor says that Naomi lost herself. The pair later agrees to divorce and Max decides to go back to MIT. Naomi finds her and Annie's half brother, Mark Holland (Charlie Weber), a chef who owns a gourmet food truck. After he doesn't {{want anything to do with}} her, Naomi decides to host a band and food truck contest at CU and sabotages it to let Mark win.

According to one family tradition, a schoolteacher once expressed concern over Boone's education, but Boone's father said, [...] "Let the girls do the spelling and Dan <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> shooting." [...] Boone received some tutoring from family members, though his spelling remained unorthodox. The historian John Mack Faragher cautions that the folk image of Boone as semiliterate is misleading, and argues that he [...] "acquired a level of literacy that was the equal of most men of his times." [...] Boone regularly took reading material with him on his hunting expeditions—the Bible and Gulliver's Travels were favorites. He was often the only literate person in groups of frontiersmen. Boone would sometimes entertain his hunting companions by reading to them around the evening campfire.|$|E

500|$|Serong {{advanced}} {{rapidly in}} the years following the war. In November 1945 he was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General at the Directorate of Army Personnel Administration in Melbourne. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel in January 1947; the rank became substantive in October 1948. In May 1948 he was posted to Army Headquarters, Eastern Command, in Sydney as General Staff Officer 1. He joined the Directorate of Military Training at Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in January 1952. In 1954 Serong was tasked with redirecting Army training towards jungle warfare, in preparation for operations in South East Asia. As a colonel, he headed the Jungle Warfare Training Centre (JWTC), which had been recently re-established at Canungra, in south-east Queensland, from 1955 to 1957. The centre trained personnel for counter-insurgency operations during the Malayan Emergency against communist guerrillas fighting the security forces there. Under his direction the course at Canungra taught soldiers automatic responses and contact drills to cover the situations they might encounter in jungle warfare, emphasising instinctive shooting and patrolling, as well [...] "battle inoculation" [...] and physical conditioning. These skills underpinned the Australian Army's methods of dispersed patrolling in small groups moving quietly through the jungle, techniques utilised while fighting the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War, and later in Malaya and Vietnam. According to Serong [...] "...conventional soldiers think of the jungle as being full of lurking enemies. Under our system, we <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> lurking." [...] Officers were also trained in battle tactics at Canungra, and various research and development activities were undertaken.|$|E
