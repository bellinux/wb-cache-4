60|$|Here {{we turned}} up a little glen with a small burn or brook whimpering and dashing along it, making an {{occasional}} waterfall, and overhung in some places with mountain ash and <b>weeping</b> <b>birch.</b> We are now, said Scott, treading classic, or rather fairy ground. This is the haunted glen of Thomas the Rhymer, where {{he met with the}} queen of fairy land, and this the bogle burn, or goblin brook, along which she rode on her dapple-gray palfrey, with silver bells ringing at the bridle.|$|E

60|$|Our ramble {{this morning}} took us again up the Rhymer's Glen, and by Huntley Bank, and Huntley Wood, {{and the silver}} {{waterfall}} overhung with <b>weeping</b> <b>birches</b> and mountain ashes, those delicate and beautiful trees which grace the green shaws and burnsides of Scotland. The heather, too, that closely woven robe of Scottish landscape which covers the nakedness of its hills and mountains, tinted the neighborhood with soft and rich colors. As we ascended the glen, the prospects opened upon us; Melrose, with its towers and pinnacles, lay below; beyond were the Eildon hills, the Cowden Knowes, the Tweed, the Galla Water, and all the storied vicinity; the whole landscape varied by gleams of sunshine and driving showers.|$|R
60|$|But in a {{short time}} Edward began to {{conceive}} his meaning, when, issuing from the wood, he found himself on the banks of a large river or lake, where his conductor gave him to understand they must sit down for a little while. The moon, which now began to rise, showed obscurely the expanse of water which spread before them, and the shapeless and indistinct forms of mountains with which it seemed to be surrounded. The cool and yet mild air of the summer night refreshed Waverley after his rapid and toilsome walk; and the perfume which it wafted from the birch trees, [Footnote: It is not the <b>weeping</b> <b>birch,</b> the most common species in the Highlands, but the woolly-leaved Lowland birch, that is distinguished by this fragrance.] bathed in the evening dew, was exquisitely fragrant.|$|E
60|$|As {{we wound}} on our endless way, {{and the sun}} sank lower and lower behind us, {{the shadows of the}} evening began to creep round us. This was {{emphasized}} {{by the fact that the}} snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed Cszeks and slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me. For instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of <b>weeping</b> <b>birch,</b> their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves.|$|E

6000|$|Nevertheless, {{when we came}} to the arbor which {{commanded}} the finest view of the old castle, and saw its gray, ivy-clad walls, standing forth on a beautiful point, round which swept the brown, dimpling waves of the Clyde, the indescribable sweetness, sadness, wildness of the whole scene would make its voice heard in our hearts. [...] "Thy servants take pleasure in her dust, and favor the stones thereof," [...] said an old Hebrew poet, who must have felt the inexpressibly sad beauty of a ruin. All the splendid phantasmagoria of chivalry and feudalism, knights, ladies, banners, glittering arms, sweep before us; the cry of the battle, the noise of the captains, and the shouting; and then in contrast this deep stillness, that green, clinging ivy, the gentle, rippling river, those <b>weeping</b> <b>birches,</b> dipping in its soft waters--all these, in their quiet loveliness, speak of something more imperishable than brute force.|$|R

6000|$|When Meg Merrilies had {{attained}} these groves, {{through which}} the wintry sea-wind was now whistling hoarse and shrill, she seemed to pause a moment as if to recollect the way. 'We maun go the precise track,' she said, and continued to go forward, but rather in a zigzag and involved course than according to her former steady and direct line of motion. At length she guided them through the mazes of the wood to a little open glade of {{about a quarter of}} an acre, surrounded by trees and bushes, which made a wild and irregular boundary. Even in winter it was a sheltered and snugly sequestered spot; but when arrayed in the verdure of spring, the earth sending forth all its wild flowers, the shrubs spreading their waste of blossom around it, and the <b>weeping</b> <b>birches,</b> which towered over the underwood, drooping their long and leafy fibres to intercept the sun, it must have seemed a place for a youthful poet to study his earliest sonnet, or a pair of lovers to exchange their first mutual avowal of affection. Apparently it now awakened very different recollections. Bertram's brow, when he had looked round the spot, became gloomy and embarrassed. Meg, after uttering to herself, 'This is the very spot!' looked at him with a ghastly side-glance--'D'ye mind it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mysie {{suppressed}} her sobs, {{and with}} considerable difficulty muttered {{her desire to}} alight, and take her fortune by herself. Sir Piercie Shafton, too devoted a squire of dames to consider the most lowly as exempted from a respectful attention, independent of the claims which the Miller's maiden possessed over him, dismounted instantly from his horse, and received in his arms the poor girl, who still wept bitterly, and, when placed on the ground, seemed scarce able to support herself, or at least still clung, though, as it appeared, unconsciously, to the support he had afforded. He carried her to a <b>weeping</b> <b>birch</b> tree, which grew on the green-sward bank around which the road winded, and, placing her on the ground beneath it, exhorted her to compose herself. A strong touch of natural feeling struggled with, and half overcame, his acquired affectation, while he said, [...] "Credit me, most generous damsel, the service you have done to Piercie Shafton he would have deemed too dearly bought, had he foreseen it was to cost you these tears and singults. Show me the cause of your grief, and if I can do aught to remove it, believe that the rights you have acquired over me will make your commands sacred as those of an empress. Speak, then, fair Molinara, and command him whom fortune hath rendered at once your debtor and your champion. What are your orders?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{occupied}} a turf seat, placed under a <b>weeping</b> <b>birch</b> of unusual magnitude and age, as Judah is represented sitting under her palm-tree, {{with an air}} at once of majesty and of dejection. Her figure was tall, commanding, and but little bent by the infirmities of old age. Her dress, though that of a peasant, was uncommonly clean, forming in that particular a strong contrast to most of her rank, and was disposed with an attention to neatness, and even to taste, equally unusual. But it was her expression of countenance which chiefly struck the spectator, and induced most persons to address her {{with a degree of}} deference and civility very inconsistent with the miserable state of her dwelling, and which, nevertheless, she received with that easy composure which showed she felt it to be her due. She had once been beautiful, but her beauty had been of a bold and masculine cast, such as does not survive the bloom of youth; yet her features continued to express strong sense, deep reflection, and a character of sober pride, which, as we have already said of her dress, appeared to argue a conscious superiority to those of her own rank. It scarce seemed possible that a face, deprived of the advantage of sight, could have expressed character so strongly; but her eyes, which were almost totally closed, did not, by the display of their sightless orbs, mar the countenance to which they could add nothing. She seemed in a ruminating posture, soothed, perhaps, by the murmurs of the busy tribe around her to abstraction, though not to slumber.|$|E
6000|$|... [The weeping or {{pendulous}} {{growth of}} trees is strongly inherited in some cases, and, without any assignable reason, feebly in other cases. I have selected this character as {{an instance of}} capricious inheritance, because {{it is certainly not}} proper to the parent-species, and because, both sexes being borne on the same tree, both tend to transmit the same character. Even supposing {{that there may have been}} in some instances crossing with adjoining trees of the same species, it is not probable that all the seedlings would have been thus affected. At Moccas Court there is a famous weeping oak; many of its branches [...] "are 30 feet long, and no thicker in any part of this length than a common rope:" [...] this tree transmits its weeping character, in a greater or less degree, to all its seedlings; some of the young oaks being so flexible that they have to be supported by props; others not showing the weeping tendency till about twenty years old. (12/38. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 12 1836 page 368.) Mr. Rivers fertilised, as he informs me, the flowers of a new Belgian weeping thorn (Crataegus oxyacantha) with pollen from a crimson not-weeping variety, and three young trees, [...] "now six or seven years old, show a decided tendency to be pendulous, but as yet are not so much so as the mother-plant." [...] According to Mr. MacNab (12/39. Verlot 'La Product. des Varietes' 1865 page 94.), seedlings from a magnificent <b>weeping</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula alba), in the Botanic Garden at Edinburgh, grew for the first ten or fifteen years upright, but then all became weepers like their parent. A peach with pendulous branches, like those of the weeping willow, has been found capable of propagation by seed. (12/40. Bronn 'Geschichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 121. Mr. Meehan makes a similar statement in 'Proc. Nat. of Philadelphia' 1872 page 235.) Lastly, a weeping or rather a prostrate yew (Taxus baccata) was found in a hedge in Shropshire; it was a male, but one branch bore female flowers, and produced berries; these, being sown, produced seventeen trees all of which had exactly the same peculiar habit with the parent-tree. (12/41. Rev. W.A. Leighton 'Flora of Shropshire' page 497; and Charlesworth 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 1 1837 page 30. I possess prostrate trees produced from these seeds.) ...|$|E
