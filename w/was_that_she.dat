5|$|Pickford {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Adolph Zukor in June 1916. Among the agreements in the contract <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would now be producing her own films {{and they would be}} distributed through a special division of Paramount Pictures called Artcraft. Pickford made 13 films for Artcraft of which 11 survive complete.|$|E
5|$|The average SPAR {{officer was}} 29 years old, single, a college graduate, and had worked {{seven years in}} a {{professional}} or managerial position (in education or government) before entering the service. The average enlisted SPAR was 24 years old, single, a high school graduate, and had worked for over {{three years in a}} clerical or sales job before joining the service. The likelihood <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> came from the state of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, or California. The reasons for becoming a SPAR differed, but most likely it was patriotism, self-advancement, desire for travel and adventure, or the loss of a loved one in the war.|$|E
5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so it would be interesting to see what unfolded between them.|$|E

5000|$|The biggest myth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dumb. The second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fragile. The third <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> couldn't act. She was {{far from}} dumb, {{although}} she was not formally educated, {{and she was very}} sensitive about <b>that.</b> But <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very smart indeed - and very tough. She had to be both to beat the Hollywood studio system in the 1950s. ... The dumb blonde was a role - she was an actress, for heaven's sake! Such a good actress that no one now believes she was anything but what she portrayed on screen.|$|R
5000|$|Kim Jong-suk died in Pyongyang in 1949. The {{official}} story <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{died from}} [...] "the hardships she had endured {{during the years}} as a guerrilla fighter." [...] The unofficial story <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> died in childbirth while delivering a stillborn child. [...] Her death, however, is omitted from her official biography. Some say she died from tuberculosis, [...] and there <b>are</b> other stories <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> shot and bled to death.|$|R
5|$|Furious, already {{partially}} converted {{during the}} war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In {{an attempt to}} minimize air turbulence, she was given no superstructure or island. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> lacked a standard funnel; instead, her boiler uptakes ran {{along the sides of}} the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the flight deck, or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her half-sisters, Courageous and Glorious, began their conversions to aircraft carriers as Furious neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since Furious had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{precautions}} against further resistance, Darius sent {{soldiers to}} seize Intaphernes, {{along with his}} son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, {{but when he was}} brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could have another husband and another son, but she would always have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.|$|E
5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E

25|$|Two {{rumors about}} finalist Katharine McPhee {{circulated}} during early March {{and throughout the}} season. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was quitting the show and would not {{show up for the}} March 7th airing. The second was sparked by the loose fitting blouses she had been wearing, leading viewers to suspect she was pregnant. Katharine denied both rumors when interviewed by host Ryan Seacrest on the March 7th show.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1825, Larkins, {{which had}} sailed from Calcutta for England, {{had to return}} as she was leaky. The {{expectation}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{would have to go}} into dock. After Larkins was pulled out of the dock and had taken on part of her cargo, it was discovered that she was still taking on water. She therefore was pulled back into the dock to be coppered and sheathed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{source for}} The Tenant {{is the story}} of Mrs Collins, the wife of a local curate, who in November 1840 came to Anne's father Patrick Brontë seeking advice regarding her alcoholic husband's abusive conduct. Mr Brontë's counsel <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should leave her husband. Mrs Collins returned to Haworth in the spring of 1847, while Anne was writing The Tenant, and told how she had managed to build a new life for herself and her two children.|$|E

25|$|Many popular stories {{speculated that}} the reason for Lady Zhen's death <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had a secret affair with Cao Pi's younger brother, Cao Zhi, even though this {{speculation}} is not supported by evidence and is improbable. Some more fantastical accounts alleged that she had an affair with Cao Cao as well; one example of this {{can be found in the}} A New Account of the Tales of the World, in which Cao Cao started the Battle of Ye in 204 to obtain Lady Zhen.|$|E
25|$|Porcupine {{was rated}} a 24-gun ship and the {{original}} plan <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would mount that number of long 9-pounders on her main deck plus two 6-pounder guns on her forecastle. She also carried ten 24-pounder carronades on her quarter-deck and forecastle. By the time that Captain the Honorable Henry Duncan commissioned her in March 1807, the Admiralty had added two brass howitzers to her armament, while exchanging her 9-pounders for 32-pounder carronades. Her complement was increased by twenty to 175 officers, men and boys.|$|E
25|$|Although Tamm {{had left}} the show on {{relatively}} good terms and was willing to film a regeneration sequence {{for the start of}} Season 17, she was not invited to do so. It has frequently been mentioned that the real reason Tamm left the show after one year, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was pregnant. This is untrue, as often stated by Tamm herself over the years. The revelation is a myth that was started by former producer John Nathan-Turner. Various sources, including some online sites, mention that the reason she couldn't film a regeneration sequence, was because she was pregnant.|$|E

25|$|Laënnec {{was almost}} sunk on her maiden voyage when she {{collided}} with an English steam ship Penzance in the Bay of Biscay, sinking the fully laden steamer within minutes. Laënnec, also seriously damaged, was towed to Barry for repairs. One {{of the reasons}} for the incident <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not carrying enough sailing ballast on her voyage from the shipyard, and as a result her rudder was not completely submerged in water, significantly reducing the maneuverability of the ship. Towards the end of the nine-month voyage, while carrying potassium nitrate from Chile to Bremerhaven, Germany, a minor mutiny broke out when four crew members disobeyed orders from Captain Turbé.|$|E
25|$|Although Laughton's {{bisexuality}} {{has been}} corroborated by {{several of his}} contemporaries and is generally accepted by Hollywood historians, actress Maureen O'Hara, a friend and co-star of Laughton, has disputed the contention that his sexuality was the reason Laughton and Lanchester did not have children. O'Hara claimed Laughton {{told her that he}} had wanted children but that it had not been possible because of a botched abortion that Lanchester had early in her career of performing burlesque. In her autobiography, Lanchester acknowledged two abortions in her youth—one of the pregnancies purportedly by Laughton—although she didn't mention whether she had been rendered infertile. According to her biographer, Charles Higham, the reason she did not have children <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not want any.|$|E
25|$|It was in December 1983 {{announced}} {{from the}} Office of the Prime Minister of Canada that Trudeau had put forward Sauvé's name to Queen Elizabeth II as his recommendation on who should succeed Edward Schreyer as the Queen's representative. In the national media, the reception was generally positive, with Sauvé's elegance, refined nature, and bilingualism {{viewed as an}} asset to such a posting, despite speculation regarding her ability to remain non-partisan, {{as would be expected}} of the vicereine. However, by January 15, of the following year Sauvé resigned as an MP, and thus as speaker, and two days later she was hospitalised; rumours circulated that it was due to cancer, but the official story <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had contracted a respiratory virus, which was further complicated by an allergy to antibiotics.|$|E
