50|$|After World War II, {{the public}} was ready for totally new car designs, but the Big Three Detroit {{automakers}} had not developed any new models since 1941.

The similarly sized PAX tire was designated 245-680R460A, indicating the same 245 mm tread section, but a 680 mm overall diameter (a specification not in the conventional passenger car tire nomenclature), the R, meaning radial construction, a 460 mm <b>wheel</b> <b>seat</b> diameter (approximately 18.1 inches) and A for asymmetric, meaning that the wheel is asymmetric, or PAX system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The hollow {{design of}} a railway axle {{is one of the}} most {{effective}} methods to reduce the weight of an axle. However, the conventional hollow axle has the limitation of a lightweight design because it has the same bore diameter along the axial position. The new type of railway axle, the tapered inner surface railway axle, has a different inner diameter between the journal bearing seat and <b>wheel</b> <b>seat.</b> This design method is one way to increase the weight reduction possibility. The purpose of the present study is to establish and evaluate the design of the tapered inner surface railway axle. The case study and Finite Element Method(FEM) are applied to evaluate the strength of the lightweight railway axle according to the European Norm(EN 13103). Finally, the best design case for reducing th...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for {{the prediction of}} the press-fit curve in the assembly of a railway axle and wheel is described. It starts from friction measurements on samples taken directly from the two components. A new apparatus, adaptable to a common axial testing machine, was developed for this aim: it permits the contact pressure and sliding speed to be varied in order to change the lubrication condition of the contact surfaces. Two calculation models are then proposed to predict the press-fit curves. They take {{the results of the}} friction measurements as input data, together with the wheelset geometry, the design interference and the material characteristics. The first one is a finite element method (FEM) model, which is very accurate but difficult to use, which also allows the effect of the <b>wheel</b> <b>seat</b> chamfer and the oil injection grove to be assessed. The second one is a simpli®ed analytical model based on the theory of axisymmetric bodies, which works on an approximate wheel geometry; nevertheless, it gives results in good agreement with those of the FEM model and with the experimental press-fit curves of the examined wheelsets. Moreover, the simplfied model is very fast and easy to use, thus constituting a powerful and useful tool for the design of new wheelsets...|$|E
40|$|For the {{ultrasonic}} testing at the <b>wheel</b> <b>seat</b> of railway axles, quantitative {{investigation of the}} reflection and transmission phenomena at the axle-wheel interface is important. This paper describes {{the influence of the}} axle-wheel interface on the {{ultrasonic testing}} of a fatigue crack in a wheelset by applying the spring interface model. The normal and tangential stiffnesses were identified experimentally for an as-manufactured wheelset at the normal incidence, and the reflection coefficient for the shear-wave oblique incidence was calculated. A parametric study was performed to clarify the influence of these interfacial stiffnesses on the incident-angle dependence of the reflection coefficient. The calculated reflection coefficient at the incident angle of 45 ° qualitatively explained the relative echo-height decrease due to the presence of a wheel observed experimentally for a wheelset in fatigue loading by rotating bending. The quantitative difference between the experimental and calculated results was considered to be due to the reduction of the effective interference of shrink fit by the wear at the axle-wheel interface during the fatigue loading {{as well as by the}} applied bending moment. For the estimated relative echo-height decrease to agree with the experimental results, the interfacial stiffnesses were found to be smaller than the values identified for the as-manufactured wheelset by a factor of 0. 5 - 0. 7...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic {{testing of}} axles is an {{important}} issue with regard to the integrity assessment of railway vehicles. In this study, several aspects of the ultrasonic evaluation of fatigue cracks in an axle are examined experimentally. Namely, the effects of (i) the bending load applied to the axle, (ii) the presence of a wheel fitted to the axle and (iii) the nominal frequency and the type of an ultrasonic probe, on the measured ultrasonic echo height of a crack are examined. To this aim, two fatigue cracks of different depths were developed at the <b>wheel</b> <b>seat</b> of a miniature wheelset test piece by rotating bending, and were inspected using angle probes and grazing shear-horizontal-wave (SH-wave) probes under bending loads. The echo height of the cracks varied remarkably with the bending stress due to its crack opening/closing effect, accompanying some hysteresis. A possible reason for this is discussed qualitatively based on the ultrasonic wave transmission across the crack surfaces as well as the axle–wheel interface. The performances of different probes in detecting echo signals as well as estimating crack depths are compared and discussed. As a result, it is found that (i) the use of grazing SH-wave probes may be useful for crack detection, and (ii) the application of bending load to the wheelset will be advantageous in highlighting the echo signal. The observed effect of the nominal frequency of the probe on the echo-height level is examined in a qualitative manner. Finally, the applicability of the present results to full-sized axles is discussed...|$|E
