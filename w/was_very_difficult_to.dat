5|$|Hurricane Dean <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{forecast}} in {{its early}} stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays.|$|E
5|$|The old Sixth District was {{centered}} in southwestern and south-central Ohio around McEwen's hometown, Hillsboro. After redistricting, McEwen found himself {{running in a}} huge area stretching from Lebanon to Marietta. This new district <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> campaign in. It spilled across six media markets, meaning that McEwen had to buy ads in cities {{where most of the}} viewers couldn't vote in the district. It also lacked any large cities and possessed few unifying elements. His Democratic opponent was psychologist Ted Strickland, whom he had defeated in his initial run in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Gracie {{was a major}} {{hurricane}} {{that formed}} in September 1959, the strongest during the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season and the most intense to strike the United States since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. The system was first noted as an area of thunderstorms east of the Lesser Antilles which moved {{just north of the}} Greater Antilles, quickly intensifying into a hurricane on September 22. Gracie was a storm that <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> forecast, with its movement unpredictable. After five days of erratic motion, Gracie became a major hurricane which struck South Carolina, and weakened as it moved up the Appalachians, bringing much needed rain to a drought-plagued region. Much of the destruction related with Gracie was centered on Beaufort, South Carolina. Gracie became an extratropical cyclone on September 30 while moving through the Eastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Image Entertainment {{released}} {{the film in}} both the English and Italian versions on DVD on August 1, 2000. Kino {{released the}} film on Blu-ray and DVD on July 16, 2013. Kino's edition of the film was mastered in high definition from the 35mm negative with the Italian language dub and original soundtrack. Arrow Films released Black Sabbath on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013. Arrow's transfer of the Italian version was from an original 35mm internegative print transferred in Italy that had additional grading and restoration done in London. Arrow's version of the American version of Black Sabbath was made from an 35mm interpositive in California. Arrow noted the high definition master they received from Italy <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> restore as the master had issues with the image, sound and color quality and had the stories in the wrong order.|$|E
5|$|Kojima {{commented that}} the outside {{environment}} <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> create. He explained that the reason previous games were primarily set indoors is because the current consoles were not powerful enough to portray a true jungle environment. In contrast with urban environments, the jungle {{does not have a}} flat surface. The protagonist in Snake Eater has to cross uneven terrain, including rocks, dirt mounds, and treestumps. As a result, the collision engine used in previous installments could not be used, and a new one had to be built from scratch. Setting up the motion capture technology so players could walk over these mounds was a problem during development.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, West Texas was infested with outlaws, {{especially}} near the Rio Grande {{and the international}} border with Mexico. The center for criminal activity {{in the area around}} El Paso was a place known as Pirate Island, a 15,000-acre ait near the present-day town of Fabens that was created when the Rio Grande shifted its course. According to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the International Boundary Commission, the island is part of Texas, but its proximity to the international border meant that it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> police because criminals could easily cross the dry river bed and escape into Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{only time}} the {{guillotine}} {{was used in}} North America was in Saint-Pierre in the late 19th century. Joseph Néel was convicted of killing Mr Coupard on Île aux Chiens on 30 December 1888, and executed by guillotine on 24 August 1889. The guillotine had to be shipped from Martinique {{and it did not}} arrive in working order. It <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> get anyone to perform the execution; finally a recent immigrant was coaxed into doing the job. This event was the inspiration for the film The Widow of Saint-Pierre (La Veuve de Saint-Pierre) released in 2000. The guillotine is now in a museum in Saint-Pierre.|$|E
25|$|To {{choose an}} example that did not get much {{attention}} in the debate (because it was shared by both sides), the Solow-Swan model assumes a continuously-attained equilibrium with 'full employment' of all resources. Contrary to Keynesian economics, saving determines investment in these models (rather than vice versa). The fact that the critique was also stated entirely using exactly {{the same kind of}} unrealistic assumptions meant that it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> do anything but 'criticize' Solow and Swan. That is, Sraffian models were explicitly divorced from empirical reality. And, as is very common in debates, it was much easier to destroy neoclassical theory than to develop a full-scale alternative that can help us understand the world.|$|E
