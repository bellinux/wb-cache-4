5|$|Hurricane Hattie first posed {{a threat}} to the Yucatán Peninsula and British Honduras on October30 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> toward the area. Officials at the Miami Weather Bureau warned of the {{potential}} for high tides, strong winds, and torrential rainfall. The warnings allowed for extensive evacuations in high-risk areas. Most people in the capital, Belize City, were evacuated or moved to shelters, and a school was operated as a refuge. A hospital in the city was evacuated, and over 75% of the population of Stann Creek fled to safer locations. After Hattie made landfall, officials in Mexico ordered the closure of ports along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E
5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening, Mekkhala tracked northwestward {{and made}} landfall over Dolores, Eastern Samar of the Philippines at around 15:00 Philippine Standard Time (07:00UTC), where Typhoon Hagupit also made landfall the month before. Both the JMA and the JTWC downgraded Mekkhala to {{a tropical storm}} on January17, due to land interaction weakening the storm significantly. Mekkhala weakened further while crossing the Bicol Region on January 18, leading the JTWC to downgrade it to a tropical depression <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> northward and emerged into the Philippine Sea. Late on the same day, the JMA downgraded Mekkhala to a tropical depression, and shortly after the JTWC issued the final warning as strong wind shear exposed the LLCC. The tropical depression drifted northeastward and maintained its exposed low-level circulation east of Luzon, until the system was completely absorbed by a stationary front early on January 21.|$|E

5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but had gone in a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would be powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> out to not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap enough for an arcade game would not be powerful enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find {{that they had not}} solved that problem yet.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main trade routes {{used by the}} Manche Ch'ol; the first went north along the Mopan River to Chacchilan, then {{overland}} to Nojpetén. The second followed the Cancuén River to Yol, and there joined the Pasión River northwards, leaving the river <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> west and continuing overland to Nojpetén. Xocmo, on the Sacapulas River, was a trading port where the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ols met to trade cacao and annatto. Xocmo had a major fair, still taking place as late as 1676, where traders arrived from various colonial and independent settlements; these included Nojpetén and the towns of Cobán, San Agustín Lanquín and Sacapulas in colonial Verapaz. The Chols traded cacao and annatto into the encomienda towns of Verapaz in exchange for metal tools (particularly axes and machetes) and salt. Other products traded to the Manche by the Q'eqchi' of colonial Verapaz included cotton textiles and quetzal feathers. The Q'eqchi' used this trade to supply products demanded by their Spanish overlords under the repartimiento system. The Manche produced a number of products for trade, manufactured from resources in the southern Maya Mountains of Belize; these included blowguns, bows and arrows, finely sculpted greenstone axes, hammocks, manos and metates, pottery, and cane, {{all of which were}} traded across the southern Maya region.|$|E

25|$|The {{contract}} was cancelled in 1974 due to defence cuts {{in favour of}} work on Skyflash, but retained as a technology demonstration program. In 1977, eight test missiles were fired {{from the ground and}} from a Hawker Hunter F.6 (RAF serial XG210). The trials were successful, with one famous incident demonstrating the missile's maneuverability <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> into the Hunter's flight path immediately after launch and almost collided with it. In the same year, the British MOD chose the AIM-9L Sidewinder as its next short-range missile, but the SRAAM project was kept alive to provide a base for a future missile design.|$|E

25|$|Later, in a twist {{overlooked}} by most historians, Martin corresponded with Alexander McGillivray, {{the leader of}} the Creek Indians, who had Loyalist sentiments. In 1788 a letter from Martin to McGillivray was intercepted in which Martin professed to be interested in settling abroad. When the letter was discovered, the North Carolina General Assembly launched an investigation into Martin's conduct.

To further pressurize Luang Por Dhammajayo, the DSI also expanded its focus to branch centers of Wat Phra Dhammakaya. Branch centers in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chiangmai, Kanchanaburi, Loei, and Tak were investigated and charged with encroaching on nature reserves. On 21 November, this finally led to another two arrest warrants, totaling three, and plans {{were made by the}} Thai police, and the DSI to take Luang Por Dhammajayo into custody, through force if required.|$|E
25|$|The {{splitting}} of Army Group South {{enabled the}} launching of Operation Edelweiss and Operation Fischreiher, the two main thrusts of the Army Groups. Both groups had to achieve their objectives simultaneously, instead of consecutively.

This assistance was not needed and Kleist later complained that Fourth Panzer Army clogged the roads and {{that if they had}} carried on toward Stalingrad, they could have taken it in July. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> north again two weeks later, the Soviets had gathered enough forces together at Stalingrad to check its advance.|$|E
25|$|The {{moment when}} Argentine rock {{began as a}} {{distinct}} musical style {{can be traced to}} the mid-1960s, when several garage groups and aspiring musicians began composing songs and lyrics that related to local social and musical themes. Rock and roll itself, however, began in Argentina almost a decade before. During that time until the rise of Argentine rock, local groups recycled the hits of English-language rock & roll. Since then, Argentine rock started a continued and uninterrupted evolution through the 1970s and into the 1980s, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> into an international genre. It is widely considered one of the most prolific and successful forms of Rock en Español, and one of the most important non-English language forms of rock music in the world.|$|E

25|$|The route was to {{continue}} to the southeast, approaching an interchange with CR615 (Bordentown-South Amboy Turnpike). At that interchange, Route74 was to turn eastward again, reaching an interchange with the proposed US9 expressway. Also to be present at this interchange was the northern terminus of Route34 in Browntown. After crossing US9 and Route34, Route74 was {{to continue}} eastward into more rural portions of Middlesex County, interchanging with a spur which would head northward to Route35 in South Amboy. Route74 would parallel {{to the north of}} Route34 past the community of Cheesequake, crossing the southern line of Cheesequake State Park.

25|$|On 29 October 2015, the DSI {{stated that}} Supachai Srisuppa-aksorn, then {{chairman}} of the Klongchan Credit Union Cooperative (KCUC), had fraudulently authorized 878 cheques worth 11.37 billion baht, in which a portion totaling {{more than a billion}} baht was traced to Wat Phra Dhammakaya via donations. The problem had begun in April 2013, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> out that Supachai had borrowed too much money from the credit union for it to manage, and it had to freeze fifty thousand accounts, as well as postpone the payments to seventy-four creditors. The angered members held many protests and the credit union sued Supachai. The temple was implicated as well. In defense, spokespeople of Wat Phra Dhammakaya explained that Luang Por Dhammajayo was not aware that the donations were illegally obtained because the temple lacked the means to check for illegally obtained money.|$|E

25|$|Johnston {{withdrew his}} 60,000 men into the Richmond defenses.

Johnston's men burned most of the bridges over the Chickahominy and settled into strong defensive positions north and east of the city. McClellan positioned his 105,000-man army to focus on the northeast sector, for two reasons. First, the Pamunkey River, which ran roughly parallel to the Chickahominy, offered a line of communication that could enable McClellan to get around Johnston's left flank. Second, McClellan anticipated the arrival of McDowell's I Corps, scheduled to march south from Fredericksburg to reinforce his army, and thus needed to protect their avenue of approach.|$|E
25|$|After four hours, at midday, {{the sirens}} {{across the country}} sounded and Poland went back to work.

Meanwhile, Lech Wałęsa's advisors, such as Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Bronisław Geremek told the leader of Solidarity that the general strike, planned for March 30, would mean civil war and the risk was too high. Diplomats from Western countries were also aware of the tense situation in Poland; therefore, military attaches from the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany were ordered not to leave Poland.
