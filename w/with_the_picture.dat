5|$|The {{film was}} {{screened}} for the Office of War Information's Bureau of Motion Pictures on December 2, 1942. The Bureau's chief, Lowell Mellett, was unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> {{and found it}} heavy-handed. MGM promoted Spencer Tracy for an Academy Award for Best Actor {{but he was not}} nominated.|$|E
5|$|MGM lent Tracy to Twentieth Century-Fox for the Western film Broken Lance, {{his only}} {{appearance}} of 1954. The picture was well received. In 1955 Tracy turned down William Wyler's The Desperate Hours because {{he refused to}} take second-billing to Humphrey Bogart. Instead, Tracy appeared as a one-armed protagonist who faces the hostility {{of a small town}} in Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), a film directed by John Sturges. For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. He had personally been unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> and threatened to leave it during production. This behavior became a regular occurrence for the aging Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on Tribute to a Bad Man in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when the location shooting in Colorado gave him altitude sickness. The trouble caused by the picture fractured Tracy's relationship with MGM. In June 1955 he was the last remaining star of the studio's heyday, but with his contract up for renewal—Tracy opted to go independent {{for the first time in}} his movie career.|$|E

25|$|The {{front cover}} of the album's UK {{pressing}} depicts an artistic black-and-white Dada-esque chequered design featuring a nude woman, which resembled little regarding the music or the band. The back cover included photographs of each member {{in front of a}} wind machine, distorting their faces. The sleeve, designed and photographed by Laurence Sackman and co-ordinated by Graphreaks, was deemed inappropriate by the American record distributors, resulting in the sleeve for the American pressing replaced by a photograph of the band, by which time Howe had replaced Banks, though a picture of Banks remained on the back cover on both pressings. Howe has said it was rejected because it was sexist, and got angry at Atlantic for continually pressing the album <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of him on the front.

In 1937, Jouveau Dubreuil, an Indologist, also from France, purchased gem stone antiquities from local children, and also gathered some exposed on the site's surface. In particular, he found an intaglio carved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of a man. As a numismatist, he identified the intaglio as Augustus Caesar. He also found fine beads and gems.

500|$|In his book, Jackson {{attributed}} {{the changes in}} the structure of his face to puberty, a strict vegetarian diet, weight loss, a change in hair style and stage lighting. Jackson denied allegations that he had altered his eyes. By 1990, the full extent of Jackson's surgery was widely debated; those close to him estimated he had undergone ten operations on his face up to this point. In June 1992, the Daily Mirror ran a full front-page picture, allegedly of Jackson's face, which they described as [...] "hideously disfigured" [...] by plastic surgery. Jackson sued the tabloid, and, in 1998, they agreed to an out-of-court settlement with Jackson. At the High Court, the paper's former editor acknowledged that after meeting Jackson in person, he believed that Jackson was neither hideously disfigured nor scarred at all. A Daily Mirror solicitor maintained that the publication did not tamper <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b>|$|E
500|$|Philip and Mary Ann Hobel spent a {{long time}} seeking a {{distributor}} for Tender Mercies without any success. Duvall, who began to doubt the film would be widely released, was unable to help the Hobels because he was busy trying to find a distributor for Angelo My Love, a film he had written, directed and produced. Eventually, Universal Pictures agreed to distribute Tender Mercies. Test screenings for the film were held, which Beresford described as the most unusual he had ever experienced. The director said that the preview audiences appeared to be very engaged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> to the point the theaters were so silent, [...] "if you flicked a piece of paper on the floor, you could hear it fall." [...] However, the post-screening feedback was, in Beresford's words, [...] "absolutely disastrous." [...] As a result, Universal executives lost faith in the film and made little effort to promote it. Foote said of the studio, [...] "I don't know that they disliked the film, I just think they thought it was inconsequential and of no consequence at all. I guess they thought it would just get lost in the shuffle." [...] Others in the film industry were equally dismissive; one Paramount Pictures representative described the picture as [...] "like watching paint dry".|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} this decline in her career, Mukerji lost weight and underwent a complete makeover. In 2009, she collaborated for the ninth time with Yash Raj Films on Dil Bole Hadippa!, a romantic comedy opposite Shahid Kapoor. Mukerji had high expectations from the film in which she played a cricket-obsessed Punjabi village girl masquerading as a man; it was hugely hyped before release and had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Economic Times critic Gaurav Malani was disappointed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> and wrote, [...] "Rani Mukherjee {{comes up with a}} spirited performance but her mock sob-whine-whimper do not amuse anymore. Also after a point you dislike visualizing the charming actress as the moustached male player." [...] The film was Mukerji's fourth economic failure in a row. When questioned about her recent spate of flops with the Yash Raj Films banner, she stated, [...] "An actor is here to act and pick great roles and scripts. I was getting great roles from Yash Raj at that point, roles that any actor would give an arm to do. I stand by those films regardless of their fate". Later that year, she featured as a talent judge for the Sony Entertainment Television reality show Dance Premier League. She said that appearing on television would make her [...] "more accessible" [...] to the audiences and help her [...] "gain visibility" [...] when she was [...] "not doing too many films". Mukerji did not make any screen appearances in 2010.|$|E
