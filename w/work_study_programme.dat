Mental disability is classified from a view of causes, main signs and it is also mentioned classification of a disability by the MKN- 10. I mentioned a question of an education and pedagogical integration of mentally disabled people into an usual educational process in the next step. There are described presumptions (legislatives, family,personality of an integrated person) for realization of the integration. The integrated education makes a preparation for future occupation possible. Nevertheless, there are ways that are looked for, so that this part of population could be use in the job market. That is why exists programme of supported employment in the Czech Republic, which is an important activity in the integrated process. There are described development, basic principles and the whole process of the supported employment.

40|$|This article {{starts from}} the {{narrative}} {{turn in the}} humanities {{and the social sciences}} in general and social work in particular to explore the study of fictional narratives in social work education. Rhetoric is presented as an important perspective for social work by focusing on the work of the rhetorician and literary critic Kenneth Burke (1897 - 1993), specifically on his theory of dramatism. The dramatistic pentad is introduced as an analytical tool to study fictional narratives. In a case study, a play and a film by a Dutch-Flemish theatre collective are jointly analysed by students from the Master of Social <b>Work</b> and Welfare <b>Studies</b> <b>programme</b> at a Flemish university. This rhetorical perspective gives social work students the opportunity not only to study fictional narratives, but also to reflect upon their own practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyses}} the executive function (EF) skills of 369 students of primary education (n = 116), preschool education (n = 72), social pedagogy (n = 54), and biology (n = 128). It explores how the {{different groups of}} students use selected executive skills and whether there are any {{differences between the groups}} in this respect. Eleven EF skills were self-assessed using the Executive Skills Questionnaire for Students (Dawson & Guare, 2010). All of the groups of students experienced difficulties rarely to sometimes when using EF skills. The groups of students demonstrated similar use of EF skills for Response Inhibition, Working Memory, Emotional Control, Planning, Meta-Cognition, and Goal Persistence, whereas significant differences appeared in Sustained Attention, Task Initiation, Organisation, Time Management, and Flexibility. In cases where differences appeared, the primary education students stood out as having the fewest difficulties with EF skills, while the biology and social pedagogy students reported the most difficulties. Given that executive functioning is important for students’ academic achievement, their everyday functioning, and their future <b>work,</b> university <b>study</b> <b>programmes</b> should encourage the development of EF skills among students by offering knowledge about them and supporting their efficient use...|$|R

From the analysis of the 46 control tests or worksheets of teachers, derive conclusions, which errors occur when writing instructions and whether these errors depend on the level of education, number of years of <b>work</b> experience and <b>study</b> <b>programme</b> of the teachers. We found that the majority of teachers in the control tests or worksheets make two or more mistakes, so the majority of those are language errors. It was also found that class teachers make less mistakes than subject teachers and that those teachers {{with a high level of}} education make fewer mistakes compared to teachers with a post-secondary level and that class teachers with less work experience make fewer mistakes than class teachers with more work experience...|$|R
