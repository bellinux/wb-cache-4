2500|$|Kylie Christmas is Minogue's first Christmas studio {{album and}} her thirteenth overall studio album. Minogue {{previously}} released the Christmas track [...] "Santa Baby", which appeared on her 2000 single, [...] "Please Stay"; {{a recording of}} [...] "Let It Snow" [...] in 2010; and two Christmas extended plays in 2010, A Kylie Christmas and A Christmas Gift. Speaking with Idolator's Mike Wass, Minogue stated [...] "I always thought I would do a Christmas album, {{it was just a}} case of <b>when...</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> it to a couple of people on my team and they were saying, 'What {{do you want to do}} for the rest of the year? What do you want to do next?' I said, 'I'm thinking about a Christmas album, actually.' Some of that stems from last Christmas." [...] Minogue said that she had Christmas in Los Angeles, California in 2014, and her friend suggest recording a Christmas album; [...] "They just assumed I had done one, and when I said I hadn't done an entire album they just started, 'You've got to do it. It would be amazing. We just want to see your little outfits.'" [...] Kylie Christmas was recorded at Angel Studios and Sarm Music Village, and features a mix of both classical Christmas songs and new original material. American guitarist and producer Nile Rodgers and Minogue's sister Dannii Minogue were reported to be working on the album, while The Sun claimed she had recorded [...] "half of the album".|$|E
60|$|The old steward, {{at work in}} his pantry, {{grinned at}} me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> the matter.|$|E
60|$|I met Grace at {{the time}} appointed, and her look of concern {{increased}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> the creamery.|$|E
60|$|Saint. You appear exalted, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> those pit-falls of iniquity.|$|R
60|$|And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> {{this last}} fact, I must {{ask you to}} pause, and {{consider}} with me very solemnly what it means.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did he? Well now, the rascal {{invariably}} looks quite blank <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> Marizano's name, {{and shakes}} his head, {{as if he had}} never heard of it before." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Roylake's {{fascinating}} smile disappeared <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> the mill. She {{suddenly became}} a cold lady--I {{might even say}} a stiff lady.|$|E
6000|$|Is it needful to {{say that}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> what had {{occurred}} to Dr McTougall that amiable little man opened his eyes to their widest? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found my}} lady {{in her own}} sitting room. She started and looked annoyed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> that Sergeant Cuff wished to speak to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Mr. Korner," [...] said he, [...] "how did Richter come by that scar? He {{always gets}} red <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> it. He will never tell me." ...|$|R
60|$|I call my boyhood's home (and I {{feel like}} a Tenor in an English Opera <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> it) Dullborough. Most of us come from Dullborough who come from a country town.|$|R
6000|$|I see you sneer contemptuously <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> to you {{the word}} AUCTIONEER. [...] "Is this all," [...] you say, [...] "that this fellow brags and prates about? An {{auctioneer}} forsooth! {{he might as well}} have 'invented' chimney-sweeping!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{assure you}} that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> the glamour and mystery, I was never half so serious in my life. They are, after all, very real things." ...|$|E
6000|$|Leeches are not effective, really. Dr. Home, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> it to [...] him yesterday, said {{he would}} bleed him till he fainted if he had [...] charge of him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If yo'd 'eard {{that man}} cry <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> to 'im your unjust suspicions, you'd never have forgiven yourself. He told 'em at the meetin', an' they had prayers for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} the {{interest}} in the matter will be diminished, colonel, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> that the charge was executed at night, and that I was ignorant of {{the vicinity of the}} French until I rode into the middle of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Jethro bowed gravely. [...] "You {{encourage}} me to hope," [...] she said. [...] "I {{think you}} will place a favorable construction on my visit <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> my motive. <b>I</b> ask you to receive me, {{in the interests of}} Miss Emily Brown." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment {{and looked at his}} {{companion}} steadily. [...] "It's rather a curious thing that, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> suggested she might like a run over to Barrock-holme, she didn't seem to want to go. And there's another point that's puzzling me. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> the crescent or the pearls, why does she want to change the subject?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you’d ’eard {{that man}} cry <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> to ’im your unjust suspicions, you’d never have forgiven yourself. He told ’em at the meetin’, an’ they had prayers for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of Duke <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> it," [...] said Randy. [...] "You know he has his room in our building instead of with the other professors in Colonel Colby's residence." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I {{told him}} the whole circumstance, how my clothes had been left to dry in the galley, and how, later, I was nearly beaten by the cook <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't--I daren't--I forget myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> it." [...] She spoke {{loudly and}} almost fiercely, raised her clenched {{hand in the}} air, and shook it passionately; then, on a sudden, {{controlled}} herself again, and added, in tones lowered to a whisper [...] "Tell me which of them YOU know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{in those}} words, perhaps. However, {{the matter is}} easily settled. You bolted with Marian. I know that, and you know it. If the topic is disagreeable, say so, and it is easily avoided. If {{you want to talk}} about it, better not change the subject <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a six-roomer, {{exclusive}} of kitchens," [...] said Mr. Guppy, [...] "and {{in the opinion}} of my friends, a commodious tenement. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> my friends, <b>I</b> refer principally to my friend Jobling, who I believe has known me," [...] Mr. Guppy looked at him with a sentimental air, [...] "from boyhood's hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Smiling.) Even to me. I {{watched you}} closely <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> the letters. You gave {{yourself}} away. You knew I meant the letters stolen by Gherst from Starkweather's private files--the letters you intended using to-morrow.|$|E
60|$|Margaret's behaviour, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> to her Mr. Mannion's {{willingness}} to be useful to us both, rather increased than diminished the vague uncertainties which perplexed me, {{on the subject of}} accepting or rejecting his overtures.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing much," [...] John replied. [...] "She seemed {{surprised}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> your name. I asked her why, {{and she told}} me, or rather she hinted, that you and the prince are very great friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've met {{him once}} or twice, and I like him, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> him Tom smiles. He says it's unfortunate Mr. Vane can see {{only one thing}} at a time, and that the one which lies right in front of his eyes. For all that, he once owned that the man is likable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means, by no means," [...] said Mr. Prendergast, {{putting his}} hand out so as to detain her. [...] "I would much rather that she should remain, {{as it may be}} very likely that she may assist me in my inquiries. You will know who I am, no doubt, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> my name; Mr. Mollett will have {{mentioned}} me to you--I am Mr. Prendergast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When we {{take into}} consideration, Mr. Cleveland, the present {{aspect of the}} {{political}} world, when we call to mind the present situation of the two great political parties, {{you will not be}} surprised, <b>I</b> feel confident, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> that certain personages have thought that the season was at hand when a move might be made in the political world with very considerable effect--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's a laudable {{proceeding}} on {{the part}} of our aunt, at all events,' said Steerforth, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> it; 'and one deserving of all encouragement. Daisy, my advice is that you take kindly to Doctors' Commons.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fellow," [...] Lawrence continued, [...] "was a {{pleasant}} companion and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> why I was traveling {{agreed that the}} mountains were best for me. Told me about some friends of his whom the air had cured." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am telling}} you," [...] {{explained}} Robina, hurt. [...] "She {{was in the}} kitchen yesterday <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> to Harry's mother, who had looked in to help me wash up, that the kitchen chimney smoked: and then she said- -" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your ladyship {{may not be}} {{at first}} {{disposed}} to excuse this visit from one {{who has never been}} welcome to your ladyship"--which he don't complain of, for he is bound to confess that there never has been any particular reason on the face of things why he should be--"but <b>I</b> hope <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> my motives to your ladyship you will not find fault with me," [...] says Mr. Guppy.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{inevitable}} that the girl should soon refer to the ranger, and Redfield was as complimentary of him as she could wish. [...] "Ross hasn't a fault but one, and that's a negative one: he doesn't care a hang about getting on, as they say over in England. He's content just to do {{the duty of the}} moment. He made a good cow-puncher and a good soldier; but as for promotion, he laughs <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It rather puzzled {{me at the}} time,' said Mr Boffin, 'and {{it rather}} puzzled me and Mrs Boffin when we spoke of it afterwards, because (not to make a mystery of our belief) we have always {{believed}} a Secretary to {{be a piece of}} furniture, mostly of mahogany, lined with green baize or leather, with a lot of little drawers in it. Now, you won't think I take a liberty <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> that you certainly ain't THAT.' ...|$|R
