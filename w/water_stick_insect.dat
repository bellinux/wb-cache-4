40|$|International audienceThe more foreleg femur and claw {{movements}} that a <b>water</b> <b>stick</b> <b>insect,</b> Ranatra linearis, performs during the 4 -h period following a moult, the higher will be its subsequent strike efficiency. The {{amount of movement}} is influenced by external {{factors such as the}} presence of prey or light. The experiments reported here show that the absence of visual cues during the post-moult periods impairs subsequent performance, {{but not as much as}} the absence of both visual and mechanical cues. Perception of mechanical stimuli only during that period subsequently influences the accuracy of simple type strikes elicited when prey is near the forelegs; whereas perception of visual stimuli subsequently improves the accuracy of more complex predatory movements...|$|E
40|$|WOS:A 1983 RJ 48000014 International audience(1) To test {{some aspects}} of {{foraging}} theory, all stages of the <b>water</b> <b>stick</b> <b>insect</b> Ranatra linearis L. were presented with {{a full range of}} size classes of water fleas (Daphnia) different relative and absolute densities, under controlled conditions in the laboratory. (2) Selection proved to be density-dependent. First instar nymphs showed a preference for small Daphnia; after the first moult the choice changed and as the predators grew, preference for big Daphnia increased. Ranatra were selective, first when relative densities for the preferred size class were low, then when absolute densities were high. The was generally made before striking, but selection was reinforced before rostral exploration. Size of prey, size of predator and prey density influenced the duration of a meal. (3) Adults increased their selectivity during a test in the presence of high prey densities. Adults performed more complex predatory movements towards large prey items towards small ones, and more towards both size classes in low densities than in high ones...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{characteristics}} of an adequate perch {{site for the}} <b>water</b> <b>stick</b> <b>insect,</b> Ranatra linearis L. (Heteroptera: Nepidae) and variations of perch preference during post-embryonic development have been investigated. Under laboratory conditions adults preferred reeds (Calamagrostis epigeros and Phragmites communis) to the other plant species presented and avoided rushes (Juncus sp.). These results confirmed Waitzbauer's (1976) observations that showed that Ranatra preferred Phragmites communis over Utricularia vulgaris in the field. During development, preference for one type of plant changed first from Lemna to Elodea, then after the 4 th instar, from Elodea to reeds. Predator size in relation, to perch size {{did not appear to}} be the main factor influencing these changes of preference. Perch colour preference changed during development from green to brown. In addition, adults preferred vertical perches to horizontal ones, but approximately as many 1 st and 2 nd instar larvae were found on vertical perches as on horizontal ones. Renatra usually perched parallel to their support: in the majority of observations the longitudinal axis of the body formed an angle of between − 5 ° and + 15 ° with the vertical plane at all developmental stages...|$|E
50|$|Nepidae is {{a family}} of {{exclusively}} aquatic Heteropteran insects in the order Hemiptera. They are commonly called waterscorpions for their superficial resemblance to scorpions, due to their raptorial forelegs {{and the presence of}} a long slender process at the posterior end of the abdomen, resembling a tail. There are 14 genera in the family, in two subfamilies, Nepinae and Ranatrinae, and they can be found on all continents except Antarctica. Members of the genus Ranatra, the most widespread and speciose genus, are sometimes called needle bugs or <b>water</b> <b>stick</b> <b>insects</b> as they are more slender than Nepa.|$|R
40|$|The role {{of vision}} in distance, {{position}} and size discrimination in prey capture {{has been investigated}} in normal adult <b>water</b> <b>stick</b> <b>insects</b> {Ranatra linearis L. : Heteroptera) and in ones with one eye covered. Both monocular and intact Ranatra were able to discriminate between two targets subtending the same angle but presented at different distances. They usually chose the target nearer to their foreleg claws. Although monocular subjects undershot more often than controls, they could still estimate distance correctly. When presented with two different-sized targets at the same distance, both monocular and intact subjects usually preferred the larger target within a l°- 10 ° range, even though monocular animals chose the larger object less consistently. They were able to distinguish between two targets differing in size by only 1 °. Asymmetrical presentations of two identical targets {{stressed the importance of}} the central position. Intact animals always preferred the target nearer their midline. These data also revealed the unexpected ability of Ranatra to strike accurately at two targets or prey items simultaneously. When two identical targets were presented simultaneously and symmetrically, aims were directed at both targets, and one was grasped by each raptorial foreleg, thus indicating an absence of confusion...|$|R

40|$|An {{account is}} given of the karyotypes and male meiosis of the Water Scorpion Nepa cinerea Linnaeus, 1758 and the <b>Water</b> <b>Stick</b> <b>Insect</b> Ranatra linearis (Linnaeus, 1758) (Heteroptera, Nepomorpha, Nepidae). A number of {{different}} approaches and techniques were tried: the employment of {{both male and female}} gonads and mid-guts as the sources of chromosomes, squash and air-drying methods for chromosome preparations, C-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosome study. We found that N. cinerea had a karyotype comprising 14 pairs of autosomes and a multiple sex chromosome system, which is X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 Y (♂) / X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 X 3 X 3 X 4 X 4 (♀), whereas R. linearis had a karyotype comprising 19 pairs of autosomes and a multiple sex chromosome system X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 Y (♂) / X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 X 3 X 3 X 4 X 4 (♀). In both N. cinerea and R. linearis, the autosomes formed chiasmate bivalents in spermatogenesis, and the sex chromosome univalents divided during the first meiotic division and segregated during the second one suggesting thus a post-reductional type of behaviour. These results confirm and amplify those of Steopoe (1925, 1927, 1931, 1932) but are inconsistent with those of other researchers. C-banding appeared helpful in pairing up the autosomes for karyotype assembly; however in R. linearis the chromosomes were much more uniform in size and general appearance than in N. cinerea. FISH for 18 S ribosomal DNA (major rDNA) revealed hybridization signals on two of the five sex chromosomes in N. cinerea. In R. linearis, rDNA location was less obvious than in N. cinerea; however it is suggested to be similar. We have detected the presence of the canonical “insect” (TTAGG) n telomeric repeat in chromosomes of these species. This is the first application of C-banding and FISH in the family Nepidae...|$|E
