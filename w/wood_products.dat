40|$|Swedish <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> {{industry}} contributes {{significantly to}} {{the economy of the}} country. This industry adds more value to the sawn timber produced in order to manufacture different wooden products. Companies in Swedish <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> industry are presently seen as underdeveloped in terms of investments and developments in automation technologies. Automation technologies are seen by companies as a solution for improving productivity, product quality, manufacturing cost reduction and ultimately improving competitiveness. This has driven competing companies to pursue automation technologies that improve manufacturing processes. Literature in the <b>Wood</b> <b>product</b> industry field shows that there is need for extended automation technologies. The <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> industry has high degree of handcraft; for instance, some Swedish <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> manufacturers still have an essentially manual manufacturing process. This study seeks to understand the role of automation in the Swedish <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> industry and mainly focuses on the factors that drive and restrain companies in this industry to adopt and use automation technologies. An abductive research approach was applied, consisting of a literature review and multiple empirical case studies. The literature review was conducted to provide theoretical background on the general view of automation and the factors that affect adoption of new technologies in companies. The case studies were performed in collaboration with four <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> manufacturers within different business areas in order to analyse and compare similarities and differences in the factors that drive and restrain adoption of automation technologies. The findings imply that companies in the Swedish <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> industry face different factors that drive and restrain them from adopting automation technologies. The factors are both internal and external to the companies. Among the noticeable ones are the high product variety, lack of automation strategies, heterogeneous material property of wood, low competence levels regarding automation technologies, varying demands from the customers, and relationship with the suppliers of automation technologies. Regardles of the restraining factors faced by companies in the Swedish <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> industry, there is a great opportunity to improve their production systems in terms of automation technologies. There is now a growing treand in these companies to prioritise automation technologies as a competitive factor. This study contributes to the knowledge regarding the factors that drive and restrain the adoption of automation technologies and how companies could deal with such factors in the Swedish <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the current status of the wood {{material}} demand in Taiwan for the references of forestry policy-making, academic research and CO 2 sequestration estimation. By using the classification definition of the harvested <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> of FAO, the <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> groups were reclassified and estimated, including roundwood, sawnwood, wood based panels and pulp wood and wood chips. According to solid wood equivalent volume, the total wood material demand and consumption were estimated. In 2011, <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> demand is 5. 29 million m^ 3, the consumption is 5. 20 million m^ 3. However, the wood self-sufficiency rate is only 0. 45 %. The demand difference between solid wood equivalent volume and round wood equivalent volume is 3. 29 million m^ 3. 本研究之目的為分析台灣地區木質材料需求量之現況及其使用型態。本研究採用聯合國農糧署（FAO）所定義的伐後木質產品（Harvested Wood Product，HWP）分類方式，以材積當量為基礎，重新估算台灣地區木質材料包含原木、製材、木質人造板類及木漿材、木片之需求量與消費量，並比較原木當量與材積當量之差異，以提供政策制定、學術研究及林產品碳吸存量計算所需之參考。 2011 年木質材料需求量約為 529 萬m^ 3,消費量約為 520 萬m^ 3 ，木材自給率為 0. 45 %； 2011 年原木當量與材積當量之材積相差 329 萬m^ 3...|$|R

5|$|Damage {{and efforts}} to control the spread of emerald ash borer have {{affected}} businesses that sell ash trees or <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> property owners, and local or state governments. Quarantines can limit the transport of ash trees and products, but economic impacts are especially high for urban and residential areas due to treatment or removal costs and decreased land value from dying trees. Costs for managing these trees can fall upon homeowners or local municipalities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once is costly, so slowing down {{the rate at which}} trees die through removing known infested trees and treating trees with insecticides can allow local governments more time to plan, remove, and replace trees that would eventually die. This strategy saves money as it would cost $10.7 billion in urban areas of 25 states between 2009–2019, while removing and replacing all ash trees in these same areas at once would cost $25 billion. Some urban areas such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, have large amounts of ash with slightly more than 20% of their urban forest as ash.|$|E
5|$|In the 1910s, Omak {{was chosen}} as the {{location}} for a sawmill to expand economic growth. Omak Fruit Growers controlled the mill and a nearby orchard processing factory. The Biles-Coleman Lumber Company bought out the organization and built a sawmill outside municipal boundaries on the nearby Omak Mountain in 1924. A secondary sawmill was constructed in the Omak area. The company and their mills were purchased in 1975 by Crown Zellerbach and thus an associated organizationCavenham Forest Industriesacquired the mills. The company ultimately went bankrupt, and in response, employees purchased the mill for 45 million dollars and renamed it Omak <b>Wood</b> <b>Products</b> in an attempt to save their jobs. Omak Woods Products' payroll decreased to 480 in the early 1990s and later went bankrupt themselves, along with Quality Veneer, who later owned the property for 19 million dollars until 2000. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation later purchased the mill for 6.6 million dollars, having closed in 2009 because of low demand, ending over 130 jobs. As of 2013, there are proposals to reopen the mills during the summer season.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of recovering energy from bit:mass residues {{has attracted a}} lot of research interest due to the environmental problems associated with burning coal. Wood wastes generated from construction and demolition activities and other <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> wastes can be a good potential source of renewable energy. The present study was conducted by using Hong Kong as an example to assess the environmental sustainability of converting recycled wood wastes (from construction and demolition activities and other <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> wastes) to produce wood pellets for direct energy generation. The chemical and physical characteristics of different types of <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> wastes were tested. An attributional lifecycle assessment approach was used to assess and compare the environmental impacts and sustainability for heat generation from the pelletized bio-fuel and coal. The test results showed that the energy content, chemical compositions and the trace metal concentrations all met the relevant standards. The results also showed that significant impacts on health, ecosystem, climate change and resources damage can be potentially avoided by using wood pellets instead of coal for energy generation. The overall findings demonstrated that the proposed "energy recovery" approach for using wood pellets as a bio-fuel in Hong Kong is environmentally sustainable, which can provide an alternative route for managing <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> wastes with the added benefits of energy recovery, and may be more applicable in mega cities especially when city-based incineration is a concern.
