5|$|Like {{previous}} Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI {{consists of}} four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and {{the configuration of the}} gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.|$|E

5|$|Segments {{are further}} divided into work areas, {{indicated}} by brackets {{in the list}} above. Work {{is scheduled to begin}} in Segments 2 and 4 and proceed from north to south within each segment before moving on to Segments 1 and 3. The first work area <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities of South San Francisco and San Bruno. Within each work area, the first activity will be tree pruning and removal (scheduled duration, two months) followed by construction of the foundations for the overhead contact system poles (scheduled duration, three to five months). Once the foundations are complete, construction of the traction power substation (estimated at twelve months in duration) and pole and wire installation (estimated at three months) will work in parallel. Schedules have been announced for Segment 2, Work Areas 5 (South City/San Bruno), 4 (Millbrae/Burlingame), and 3 (San Mateo). Traction power substations have been confirmed for South San Francisco and Burlingame, with another traction power substation in the city of San Mateo at a site yet to be named.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this {{may not seem like}} a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E
