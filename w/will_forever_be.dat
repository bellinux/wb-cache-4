Vanderaerden, considered a sprinter, attacked on the Muur of Geraardsbergen and rounded off a 20km solo break. The race gained a place in cycling legend because a severe storm broke out in the second half of the race, with strong winds and torrential rainfall ravaging the peloton. Only 24 of 174 starters finished the race, the lowest number in modern times.|$|E
25|$|Brisbane – The {{first signs}} of a Collingwood/Brisbane rivalry {{originated}} in 1999, when Brisbane comprehensively beat the Magpies in the last ever AFL match at Victoria Park. In Round 8 2002 Collingwood beat Brisbane by three points in a tense match in front of 46,279 people at Colonial Stadium. This victory over the reigning premier took the Magpies to equal top of the league table (2nd on percentage) with Brisbane. The rivalry grew with the 2002 Grand Final when Brisbane beat Collingwood by nine points. The rivalry grew again in 2003 when the two clubs clashed on four occasions. The Lions defeated the Magpies at The Gabba in Round 4 before thrashing them in Heritage Round — Round 19 at the MCG. Collingwood then defeated Brisbane in the Qualifying Final with Alan Didak ensuring victory late in the final quarter, with two goals from the boundary line. The rivalry peaked in the 2003 Grand Final with Brisbane easily defeating Collingwood to win the premiership. The rivalry cooled off to a degree in the period following Brisbane's loss in the 2004 Grand Final due a sustained period of success at Collingwood {{and a string of}} poor seasons at Brisbane, however Dayne Beams recent defection to the Lions has seemingly reignited the rivalry. Despite Brisbane's string of poor seasons, the rivalry remains ignited due to many Collingwood supporters remaining bitter about the two grand final losses {{and the fact that the}} Brisbane Lions <b>will</b> <b>forever</b> <b>be</b> the last team to win a VFL/AFL match at Victoria Park.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, Elliott {{sold his}} team to Ray Evernham and began driving the No. 9 Dodge Dealers/UAW-sponsored Dodge Intrepid the {{following}} year. The team found success in his first race in the No. 9 Dodge, as Elliott won the pole for the 2001 Daytona 500 and finished in the Top 5, bringing home a 5th-place finish, though the race <b>will</b> <b>forever</b> <b>be</b> remembered {{for the death of}} fan favorite Dale Earnhardt. Elliott finished his first season with Evernham Motorsports with two poles, five Top 5's, and nine Top 10 finishes, and one win at the Pennzoil Freedom 400 at Homestead from the pole. This was his first win in over seven years. He finished 15th in the final points standings. In 2002, he won four poles and went to victory lane twice; those wins included the Pennsylvania 500 {{and one of the most}} dominant victories in the history of the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway a week later He finished 13th in the final points standings. His last win, in what became his final full-time season, came in 2003 at Rockingham. A week later, Elliott came within a lap of winning his final race as a full-time driver (he would have been the only retiring driver to do so) in the 2003 Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Elliott led 189 of 267 laps and was on his way to victory, but a cut tire on the final lap allowed Bobby Labonte to score the victory (his last and most recent win to date). He still finished the race and maintained his ninth-place position in the final points standings, his best points finish since finished eighth in the 1997 standings. A few weeks later, Elliott announced that he was relinquishing the No. 9 car to Kasey Kahne and switching to a part-time schedule driving R cars for Evernham.|$|E

[...] He <b>will</b> <b>forever</b> <b>be</b> known as [...] "Dollar Mark", thanks to Homer Davenport and many other columnists who drew him as a malevolent presence.

500|$|For {{almost a}} decade, the 1995 TV serial was {{considered}} [...] "so dominant, so universally adored, [...] it has {{lingered in the}} public consciousness as a cinematic standard". Comparing six Pride and Prejudice adaptations in 2005, the Daily Mirror gave 9/10 to the 1995 serial ("what may be the ultimate adaptation") and the 2005 film adaptation, leaving the other adaptations such as the 1940 film behind with six or fewer points. The 2005 film was [...] "obviously [...] daring or revisionist" [...] as the 1995 adaptation but the youth of the film's leads, Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, was mentioned favourably over the 1995 cast, as Jennifer Ehle had formerly been [...] "a little too 'heavy' for the role". The president of the Jane Austen Society of North America noted in an otherwise positive review that the casting of the 2005 leads was [...] "arguably a little more callow than Firth and Ehle" [...] and that [...] "Knightley is better looking than Lizzy should strictly be". The critical reception of MacFadyen's Darcy, whose casting had proven difficult because [...] "Colin Firth cast a very long shadow", ranged from praise to pleasant surprise and dislike. Several critics did not observe any significant impact of Macfadyen's Darcy in the following years. Garth Pearce of The Sunday Times noted in 2007 that [...] "Colin Firth <b>will</b> <b>forever</b> <b>be</b> remembered as the perfect Mr. Darcy", and Gene Seymour stated in a 2008 Newsday article that Firth was [...] "'universally acknowledged' as the definitive Mr. Darcy".|$|E
