40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a theory of}} shells of revolution. Staring with geometrical considerations, {{the expression of the}} strains is deduced. A particular form of the displacement field <b>is</b> <b>then</b> chosen, from which follow the shell strains and changes of curvature. The equilibrium equations <b>are</b> <b>then</b> deduced from a variational point of view. Constitutive equations <b>are</b> <b>then</b> stated and simplified owing to the powers of the parameter h/R. The problem of vibrations round an equilibrium state <b>is</b> <b>then</b> formulated, including the so-called stability terms. Inertia terms <b>are</b> <b>then</b> developed. IN order to treat asymmetrical vibrations, a Fourier development of the displacements is introduced, which allows a clear separation of the eigenmodes...|$|R
