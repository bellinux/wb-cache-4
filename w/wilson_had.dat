5|$|For the 2006–07 season, Danny Wilson was {{appointed}} the new manager, <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> previously managed Humphreys at Sheffield Wednesday. On 22 August 2006, Humphreys was dropped for Hartlepool's match against Hereford United. After making 230 consecutive appearances, {{this was the}} first time Humphreys had not played since October 2001. Shortly after that match, Humphreys joined Port Vale on a month's loan. This was the third time that Danny <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> loaned Humphreys out during his career, the only times Humphreys had ever been loaned out. Port Vale tried to extend Humphreys' loan deal by at least another month, but Hartlepool refused and Humphreys returned. Humphreys later stated that he had no intentions of leaving Hartlepool.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 Michael G. Wilson joined Albert R. Broccoli as co-producer at Eon. <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> first {{worked on}} a Bond {{production}} in February 1964 with the filming of Goldfinger. He had worked on every production since The Spy Who Loved Me, and had been executive producer on Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy.|$|E
5|$|On defense, the Falcons {{were led}} by Terry Maki, who had a total of 137tackles, {{including}} assists. Dwan <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> fiveinterceptions for the Falcons, and safety Scott Thomas had four. Altogether, the Falcons allowed an average of 148rushing yards and 167passing yards per game.

50|$|Since {{making his}} debut, <b>Wilson</b> <b>has</b> bulked up {{considerably}} {{and is now}} regarded as a promising front row forward. <b>Wilson</b> also <b>has</b> a good ability to accelerate, and after a successful début season in the 1st team in which {{he played in the}} National League Grand Final, <b>Wilson</b> <b>has</b> been offered a 12-month Super League contract.|$|R
5|$|Aside from pro wrestling, <b>Wilson</b> <b>has</b> been on {{the cover}} of several magazines, {{including}} FHM and Playboy (for which she posed twice), and considered to be a sex symbol. Torrie <b>Wilson</b> <b>has</b> also made a guest appearance in the TV show Baywatch.|$|R
5|$|Several other {{journeys}} {{were completed}} during Scott's absence. Royds and Bernacchi travelled for 31days on the Barrier in a SE direction, observing its uniformly flat character and making further magnetic readings. Another party had explored the Koettlitz Glacier to the south-west, and <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> travelled to Cape Crozier {{to observe the}} emperor penguin colony at close quarters.|$|E
5|$|Action {{was taken}} against Landy's {{professional}} {{practice as a}} result of the Beach Boys' and Wilson family's struggles for control. A former nurse and girlfriend of Wilson's brought Landy to the state's attention in 1984, and they were then aided by journals written by songwriter Gary Usher during a ten-month collaboration with Wilson. These journals depicted Wilson as a virtual captive dominated by Landy, who was determined to fulfill his show business ambitions through Wilson. By this time, <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> become Landy's only patient.|$|E
5|$|At a Sunday {{church service}} in mid-December, in what Marshall {{believed}} {{was an attempt}} by other officials {{to force him to}} assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was still living.|$|E

5|$|First on the {{schedule}} were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas {{on the site of}} a derelict hotel which Michael G. <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of The Spy Who Loved Me. In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.|$|E
5|$|Harding's Socialist {{opponent}} in the 1920 election, Eugene Debs, was serving a ten-year sentence in the Atlanta Penitentiary for speaking against the war. <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> refused to pardon him before leaving office. Daugherty met with Debs, and was deeply impressed. There was opposition from veterans, including the American Legion, and also from Florence Harding. The president did not feel he could release Debs until the war was officially over, but once the peace treaties were signed commuted Debs' sentence on December 23, 1921. At Harding's request, Debs visited the president at the White House before going home to Indiana.|$|E
5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E

5|$|In July 1918, Graves was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 8th Division, which was then based at Palo Alto, California, and scheduled {{to be sent to}} France in 30 days. Graves took Eichelberger with him, initially as his Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3 (Operations). While he was en route to California, Eichelberger learned from Graves that the 8th Division's destination had changed, and it was now bound for Siberia instead. President Woodrow <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> agreed to support the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and Graves would command the American Expeditionary Force Siberia. The American Expeditionary Force Siberia departed San Francisco on 15 August, with Eichelberger as its Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (Intelligence).|$|E
5|$|Lloyd George agreed {{it might}} be {{acceptable}} to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> started {{to believe in the}} merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the end result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds, and led to his resignation from the Treasury.|$|E
5|$|Nickiesha Wilson {{also participated}} for Jamaica in the women's 400meters hurdles event. Born in Kingston, Wilson {{participated in the}} {{athletics}} program at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and participated in the Beijing Olympics at age 22. <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> not previously participated in any Olympic games or events. During the August 17 qualification round, Wilson {{was placed in the}} second heat and placed third out of the heat's seventh athletes after finishing the race in 55.75seconds. Wilson placed ahead of Romania's Angela Morosanu (56.07seconds) and behind Russia's Anastasia Ott (55.34seconds). The heat itself was led by Great Britain's Tasha Danvers (55.19seconds). Of the 27 athletes participating in the qualification round, Wilson ranked tenth. She advanced to the semifinals.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the other}} candidates, Cowell was elected {{as the first}} Sanskrit {{professor}} at the University of Cambridge in 1867, supported by Müller and others. Griffith was principal of his college from 1861 until 1878 (succeeding Ballantyne); he carried out further work in India after his retirement, and died there. Ballantyne resigned as principal because of health problems and returned to England, where he served as librarian to the India Office (a position that <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> held {{in addition to the}} professorship) until his death in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no {{relation}} to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator. They {{were accused of}} accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message. Both men denied all charges. Neither Daniel nor <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there {{at some point during}} the day. No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} first three matches of the 1906–07 season due to cricketing commitments, Bell was chosen to replace McFarlane for the visit of Nottingham Forest on 15 September 1906. Two weeks later he scored twice in the 4–0 home win over Burton United, {{and went on to}} score three more goals in his next four appearances, {{including}} a late winner away at Leeds City. However, the victory was overshadowed by the news that Leeds forward Soldier <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> died after collapsing during the match. Bell went on to score a total of 12 goals in 1906–07, his highest return in a single season. His performances for Burnley led to a call-up from the England amateur team in April 1907, and he won his first cap in the 8–1 defeat of the Netherlands in The Hague. In the match, he played alongside full England internationals Harold Hardman and Vivian Woodward, who, like Bell, was a professional architect.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his production duties, <b>Wilson</b> <b>has</b> also made many cameo appearances (speaking and non-speaking) in the Bond films.

5|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Henry—he {{was known}} by his middle name as a boy—was sent to Union College in Schenectady, New York. Admitted to the sophomore class, Seward was an {{outstanding}} student and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Samuel Seward kept his son short on cash, and in December 1818—during the middle of Henry's final year at Union—the two quarreled about money. The younger Seward returned to Schenectady, but soon left school in company with a fellow student, Alvah Wilson. The two took a ship from New York to Georgia, where <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> been offered a job as rector, or principal, of a new academy in rural Putnam County. En route, Wilson {{took a job at}} another school, leaving Seward to continue on to Eatonton in Putnam County. The trustees interviewed the 17-year-old Seward, and found his qualifications acceptable.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Boult {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} the tenor Steuart Wilson and his wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She {{divorced}} Wilson in 1931. In 1933, Boult astonished those who knew his notorious shyness with women by marrying her and becoming a much-loved stepfather to her four children; the marriage lasted {{for the rest of his}} life. The enmity it provoked in <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> repercussions in Boult's later career. The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career but not Boult's: Wilson was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival but Boult was invited to conduct the orchestra at Westminster Abbey for the coronation of George VI in 1937.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{attended}} Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, {{which was}} run by the Presbyterian Board of Missions of Freedmen. She was the only child in her family to attend school, so each day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get to and from school, Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life. <b>Wilson</b> <b>had</b> attended Scotia Seminary (now Barber-Scotia College). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended Dwight L. Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in Chicago (now the Moody Bible Institute), hoping to become a missionary in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal among African Americans.|$|E
