5|$|The Maclennan Hill <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> {{and steep}} {{bottleneck}} for traffic leaving the inner city.

5|$|The {{majority}} international {{reaction was}} extremely critical of Lumumba. Lumumba's attack on colonialism was especially {{interpreted as an}} attack on Belgium itself and nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the two countries. International observers though the speech unwise, ungrateful and tactless. The confrontational attitude taken by Lumumba appeared to confirm Belgian and American suspicions that Lumumba <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> radical. Between September 1960 and January 1961, partly at the instigation of the two countries, Lumumba was deposed from power, arrested and executed with the complicity of both the Congolese and Katangese governments.|$|E

5|$|Despite the misgivings of the expedition's commanders, {{the fleet}} left Brest as {{scheduled}} on 15 December 1796, one day {{ahead of a}} message from the Directory calling off the entire operation. De Galles knew that the British would be watching Brest harbour: their frigates were a constant presence as part of the Inshore Squadron of the blockade. In an effort to disguise his force's intentions, he first anchored in Camaret Bay and issued orders for his ships to pass through the Raz de Sein. The Raz <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> narrow channel littered with rocks and sandbanks and subject to heavy surf during bad weather, but would also obscure the size, strength and direction of the French fleet from the British squadron offshore, which French scouts claimed consisted of 30 ships.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} way to purify uranium oxide in a laboratory was {{to take advantage of the}} fact that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether. Scaling this process up for industrial production <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> proposition; ether was explosive, and a factory using large quantities was likely to blow up or burn down. Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis, Missouri, which had experience with ether. Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt's chemical engineers, Henry V. Farr and John R. Ruhoff, on 17 April 1942. Within a few months, sixty tons of highly pure uranium oxide was produced.|$|E
5|$|To the LCL, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> situation, {{and seeing}} {{a need to}} avoid it, they compromised: their {{position}} abruptly changed to being in favour of wholesale reform of the Legislative Council. When Dunstan put forward bills to reform it, the LCL relented, and Eastick convinced the LCL councillors to let them pass, conditional on amendments to the legislation. These were a minor change to the particular proportional system used to elect the councillors, and that it remained non compulsory {{to vote in the}} council. The new council would eventually have 22 members, with half elected each election from a multi-member constituency covering the entirety of the state. Hall attacked the LCL for its sudden change in stance on reform, and managed to see the first LM policy become law with the lowering of the council suffrage age to 18.|$|E

5|$|As Steinhauer {{noted in}} his autobiography, the UK <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> {{environment}} for a foreign agent. Only five years previously, the country {{had not had a}} dedicated counter-espionage organisation. In 1909 a series of spy scares fanned by the press led to the establishment of the Secret Service Bureau, jointly headed by Captain Vernon Kell and Lieutenant-Commander Mansfield Cumming. They soon split their responsibilities; Kell took charge of counter-espionage, while Cumming focused on foreign intelligence. These two divisions of the Secret Service Bureau eventually became two independent intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6. The Bureau quickly identified a list of possible German agents in the UK. Just before the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, Chief Constables across Britain and Ireland were instructed to arrest suspects in their areas. This was done quickly and a number of German agents were caught, crippling German intelligence operations in the UK at a crucial moment in the war. Steinhauer himself had been lucky to escape arrest; he was known by name to the British authorities and he had been spying on the Royal Navy in Scotland as recently as late June 1914.|$|E
25|$|Logging <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> trade, {{with high}} {{accident}} rates. On October 8, 1871, the Peshtigo Fire burned 1,875 square miles (4,850kmÂ²) of forest land around {{the timber industry}} town of Peshtigo, Wisconsin, killing between 1,200 and 2,500 people. It was the deadliest fire in United States history.|$|E

They were stretched out, exhausted and low on fuel; many tanks had broken down. There now <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> gap {{between them and the}} infantry. A determined attack by a fresh large mechanized force could have cut them off and wiped them out.|$|E
25|$|Nickell {{contends that}} the pirate theory raises more {{questions}} than it answers. He contends that a journey into Kentucky <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> undertaking, and that Swift {{could just as easily}} set up a clandestine coining operation in the backwoods of Virginia or aboard his ship. He also questions why Swift would take the time to produce such a detailed journal to cover his story.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, John Brunner and Ludwig Mond founded Brunner Mond in Winnington {{and started}} {{manufacturing}} soda ash using the Solvay ammonia-soda process. This process used salt {{as a main}} raw material. The chemical industry used the subsided land for the disposal of waste from the manufacture of soda-ash. The waste was transported through a network of cranes and rails to the produce limebeds. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> alkaline substance and caused the landscape to be abandoned as unusable.|$|E

Nixon planned to run for {{president}} in 1960, and offered his services in the hopes of negotiating a settlement which might win him labor's backing. The Board of Inquiry, meanwhile, reconvened on November 10 and issued a second report on January 6, 1960. The major issues, the Board said, remained the size of the wage increase and Section 2(b).|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} of the viceroyalty {{had suffered}} many casualties lately, {{particularly during the}} native uprisings of Tupac Amaru. All the help he obtained were a few cannons and the suggestion to arm the people for the defense. The Viceroy understood that arming the creole civilian population, many of them influenced by revolutionary ideas, fomented by the American and French revolutions, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> strategy for {{the interests of the}} Crown. History would prove him right as only six years later the Argentine movement for independence was started.|$|E
25|$|The journey, a {{distance}} of over a mile {{at a point where}} the tides run swiftly, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> one, and its reputation, the roughness of the water, and the smallness of the boats deterred travellers. Daniel Defoe visited the crossing from the Aust side in the 18th century, but did not trust the ferry to survive the bad weather, and elected to go via Gloucester instead. By that time, ferry crossings from New Passage, between Redwick near Pilning and Sudbrook on the Welsh side, rivalled the Aust passage, which became known as the Old Passage.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{thousands}} of boys {{were employed in}} glass making industries. Glass making <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133Â°F). When the boys are at work, {{they are exposed to}} this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, heat exhaustion, cut, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00pm to 3:00am. Many factory owners preferred boys under 16 years of age.|$|E
25|$|In historiography, the {{hurricane}} and the rebuilding afterward divide {{what is known}} as the Golden Era (1875â1900) from the Open Era (1920â1957) of Galveston. The most important long-term impact of {{the hurricane}} was to confirm fears that Galveston <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> place to make major investments in shipping and manufacturing operations; the economy of the Golden Era was no longer possible as investors fled. In 1920, Prohibition and tax law enforcement opened up new opportunities for criminal enterprises related to gambling and bootlegging in the city. Galveston rapidly became a prime resort destination enabled by the open vice businesses on the island. This new entertainment-based economy brought decades-long prosperity to the island.|$|E
25|$|Although Lanying was sorrowful {{about her}} fatherâs death, she began {{working at the}} age of 60 after the Culture Revolution. She found that the {{dislocation}} density of existing gallium arsenide was very large due to gravity and not good enough to use, so she decided to make the experiment in artificial satellites. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> experiment because the melting point of gallium arsenide is 1238 Celsius degrees. However, she finished successfully and became the first person in the world who had made this experiment successfully. Because of this work in gallium arsenide, the government in China named a gallium arsenide company(Chinese: ä¸­ç§ç¨¼è±) after her in 2001. This company has been in business for over than 10 years.|$|E
