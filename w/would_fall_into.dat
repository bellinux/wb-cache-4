5|$|Following {{their opening}} victory, the United {{traveled}} up north {{to take on}} New England Revolution on 26 March. The United <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> a 2–0 hole early in the match, with some citing poor officiating as the cause. A late penalty kick goal from Charlie Davies resulted in a 2–1 loss for the United.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, at {{the church}} of St Vigeans, near Arbroath, communion was not held for several years because the villagers {{believed}} there was a curse on the church. The curse said that if communion were held then the church <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> a large subterranean lake.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prince finally {{succumbed to}} {{syphilis}} on 30 October 1713, sparking a succession crisis. Cosimo III deposited {{a bill in}} the Tuscan senate, the nominal legislature, provisioning for a male line succession failure by making the Electress Palatine Gian Gastone's heiress. It passed and was disseminated to chancelleries across Europe. Austria refused to sanction it, fearing that Tuscany <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the Bourbons' hands. However, France and England did.|$|E
50|$|Although Moses Hogan {{arrangements}} were quite unique, they <b>would</b> generally <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> these three main categories...|$|R
50|$|Not all {{algebraic}} {{structures in}} a wider sense <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> this scope. For example, ordered groups involve an ordering relation, so <b>would</b> not <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> this scope.|$|R
50|$|Hisahide, {{a master}} of tea {{ceremony}} is also said to have smashed his favorite tea bowl so that it <b>would</b> not <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> {{the hands of his}} enemies.|$|R
5|$|Like ale, aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, {{such a man}} <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> a trance, and his spirit would fly out of his body toward the clouds as if his spirit were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the damage was done to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought ale using plough beams. In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), {{and for this reason}} people would not hurt these snakes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used robot configurations are articulated robots, SCARA robots, delta robots and cartesian coordinate robots, (gantry robots or x-y-z robots). In the context of general robotics, most types of robots <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the category of robotic arms (inherent {{in the use of}} the word manipulator in ISO standard 1738).|$|E
60|$|Sometimes someone <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> off <b>into</b> {{the water}} and get wet, but Jerry Muskrat or Billy Mink always pulled them out again, and no one cared the tiniest bit for a wetting.|$|R
50|$|Although the Mandate of Heaven {{remained}} with the Zhou, China became increasingly fragmented after that, and <b>would</b> soon <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> a long age of conflict for hegemony {{that would last}} over five centuries.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{original}} founding fathers, {{the rest of the}} owners <b>would</b> soon <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> place, including a man whose own dreams of playing football were ended by a heart ailment, Thomas Origer, who would run the Chicago Fire.|$|R
25|$|Such {{blurring}} {{of the senses}} was also {{a factor in the}} practice of spirit intermediaries, or mediumship. Practitioners of the art <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> trances or dance to perform supernatural tasks. These people would often rise to power {{as a result of their}} art—Luan Da, a Han dynasty medium, was granted rule over 2,000 households. Noted Han historian Sima Qian was scornful of such practices, dismissing them as foolish trickery.|$|E
25|$|Rusk {{met with}} Foreign Minister Nikezic on August 30, 1967. However, {{according}} to telegram 30825 to Belgrade, September 1, which summarizes the conversation, Rusk said {{the key to}} a settlement was to end the state of war and belligerence and that if a way could be found to deal with this, other things <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> place; the difference between pre-June 5 positions and secure national boundaries was an important difference.|$|E
25|$|The {{first sale}} in Sweden was to ASEA-Atom in 1974 to control nuclear power plants. A Swedish {{subsidiary}} was established the following year. Because of the proprietary system architecture of each manufacturer, companies <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> a vendor lock-in; therefore purchase of computer systems were often {{more of a}} strategic than product-specific purchase. An important aspect for ND was therefore to convince their potential customers {{that they would be}} able to deliver in the long run.|$|E
60|$|But Reddy Fox {{was afraid}}. Yes, Sir, {{he was afraid}} to take one step on the long bridge. He was afraid that he <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> through <b>into</b> the water or onto the cruel rocks below. Granny Fox ran back to where Reddy sat.|$|R
50|$|After {{two more}} {{seasons in the}} lower half of Serie C1 they were relegated down and then relegated from Serie C2 by 1992, instead of {{carrying}} on in the city the Campania club moved back to Naples and <b>would</b> eventually <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> obscurity.|$|R
60|$|Davies' crestfallen air bore this out, but {{he waited}} silently, {{and for a}} moment or two neither Brand nor Mowbray spoke. The Colonel, to his astonishment, was {{conscious}} of some relief. After all, he <b>would</b> rather <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> Harding's hands than the moneylender's.|$|R
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, time had {{taken its toll}} on Craven Park stadium, {{following}} the Bradford City stadium fire, capacity was restricted {{and the cost of}} safety work spiraled. Major renovations were needed to bring it up to scratch. Large amounts of money were spent on the ground each year repairing sections but once one section was repaired another <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> disrepair. In 1988/89, their last full season at Craven Park, Rovers were relegated to the 2nd Division and Millward decided to stand down as coach. Wright Properties Ltd purchased Craven Park from the club and the final game was played there on 9 April 1989.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a more}} {{pressing}} action on {{the eastern edge of}} Stanley. Twenty US-built LVTP-7A1 Argentine tracked amphibious armoured personnel carriers from Lieutenant-Commander Guillermo Cazzaniga's 1st Amphibious Vehicles Battalion, carrying D and E Companies of the 2nd Marine Infantry Battalion (BIM-2) from Puerto Belgrano, had been landed from the tank landing ship ARA Cabo San Antonio at Yorke Bay, and were being watched by a section of Royal Marines under the command of Lieutenant Bill Trollope. Two Argentine-built landing crafts (Numbers 09 and 23), also took part in the landings later that morning and <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> British hands {{at the end of the}} fighting in June.|$|E
25|$|DCC <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the {{chromosomal}} instability category. The {{chromosomal region}} of 18q has shown consistent LOH for nearly twenty years. Approximately 70% of primary colorectal cancers display LOH in this region, {{and the percentage}} increases when comparing early to advanced cancers. This increase in DCC loss in advanced cancer may indicate that DCC loss {{is more important to}} tumour progression than tumour formation. However, region 18q is not the location of DCC alone, and many studies are in conflict when reporting whether 18q LOH is attributable to DCC or other tumour suppressor candidates in the neighbouring areas. Many reviews refuse to comment on DCC due to its history of conflicting information, stating that more study is required.|$|E
50|$|For {{his role}} in Father Ted, he wore contact lenses (to show Father Jack's blank eye). People would not eat lunch with him during filming {{if he was in}} his Father Jack make-up. because the false flaky skin he was wearing <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> off <b>into</b> the food.|$|R
50|$|Much {{has been}} done to promote wind music through organisations, institutions, music {{retailers}} and passionate individuals but this <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> largely <b>into</b> the concert band genre. Indeed it is the development of the concert band which procured an environment whereby music for the woodwind section was required.|$|R
50|$|However, Andrey Shchelkalov <b>would</b> soon <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> disgrace for his willfulness. Andrey and Vasili {{were known}} to have {{misrepresented}} family records of noble families and influenced the local administrative hierarchy. Andrey Shchelkalov left diplomatic service in 1594, took monastic vows and assumed the name of Theodosius.|$|R
25|$|Tyrannosaur {{remains were}} among the first dinosaur fossils {{collected}} in the United States. The first of these was named Deinodon horridus by Joseph Leidy. However, as this species was based only on teeth the name <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> disuse. Soon after, Edward Drinker Cope described Laelaps aquilunguis from a partial skeleton in New Jersey. Its discovery heralded the realization that carnivorous dinosaurs were bipeds, unlike the lizardlike megalosaurs sculpted for the Crystal Palace. Laelaps was also among the first dinosaurs to be portrayed artistically as a vigorous, active animal, presaging the Dinosaur Renaissance by decades. Later in the century, Cope's hated rival Othniel Charles Marsh would discover that the name Laelaps had already been given to a parasitic mite, and would rename the dinosaur Dryptosaurus.|$|E
25|$|Like Rex, Roman has a bionic arm, {{which he}} uses to trigger explosives. He is {{defeated}} by Yusei, but before he dies, he triggers an explosion that sends Yusei down into the pool Ener-D. His deck focuses around Spider type monsters, and specializes in changing an opponent's monster into defense mode to obtain counters for summoning his Earthbound Immortal Uru. Uru can control an opponent's monster by sacrificing one of his own. Roman is later defeated by Yusei, but he sets off an explosive in his mechanical arm before crumbling to dust, so that Yusei <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> {{the gate to the}} Netherworld. His spirit remains in the world until Goodwin is defeated, at which point Roman joins his brother in the afterlife. His ace is the Dark Synchro Underground Arachnid.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{had long}} been {{interested}} in acquiring Cuba from the declining Spanish Empire. As with Texas, Oregon, and California, American policy makers were concerned that Cuba <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> British hands, which, according to the thinking of the Monroe Doctrine, would constitute {{a threat to the}} interests of the United States. Prompted by John L. O'Sullivan, in 1848 President Polk offered to buy Cuba from Spain for $100million. Polk feared that filibustering would hurt his effort to buy the island, and so he informed the Spanish of an attempt by the Cuban filibuster Narciso López to seize Cuba by force and annex it to the United States, foiling the plot. Nevertheless, Spain declined to sell the island, which ended Polk's efforts to acquire Cuba. O'Sullivan, on the other hand eventually landed in legal trouble.|$|E
50|$|Men {{and women}} both {{participate}} in the singing and dance. Fann at-tanbura is {{closely associated with the}} Zār spiritual ritual, and it was originally used in healing practices. Participants <b>would</b> occasionally <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> a trance. In modern times though it is more often a musical performance.|$|R
5000|$|Axes {{designed}} for warfare ranged in weight from just over , and in length from just over [...] to upwards of , {{as in the}} case of the Danish axe or the sparth axe. Cleaving weapons longer than 1.5 m <b>would</b> arguably <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the category of polearms.|$|R
5000|$|John de Montfort, Earl of Richmond - {{upon his}} death, Earldom {{returned}} to the crown in 1342; it remained with the crown {{during most of the}} Breton War of Succession in part to ensure it <b>would</b> not <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the hands of the King of France.|$|R
25|$|In foreign policy, Alexander sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, {{fearing the}} remote colony <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> British hands {{if there were}} another war. He sought peace, moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871, and in 1872 joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that {{stabilized}} the European situation. Despite his otherwise pacifist foreign policy, he fought a brief war with Turkey in 1877–78, pursued further expansion into Siberia and the Caucasus, and conquered Turkestan. Although disappointed {{by the results of}} the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Alexander abided by that agreement. Among his greatest domestic challenges was an uprising in Poland in 1863, to which he responded by stripping that land of its separate constitution and incorporating it directly into Russia. Alexander was proposing additional parliamentary reforms to counter the rise of nascent revolutionary and anarchistic movements when he was assassinated in 1881.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of the War of the Second Coalition, which {{actually}} was a continuation of the first war, without France, Great Britain, or the Batavian Republic having concluded a peace, Great Britain and Russia decided to launch an invasion of the Batavian Republic in the peninsula of North Holland in August 1799. It was hoped that this invasion would cause a popular uprising of the Dutch population against their republic. The former Stadtholder and his eldest son the Prince of Orange tried to support the expedition by propaganda-efforts and intrigues with disaffected officers. The loyalty of the Batavian navy was especially in doubt, as this was a hotbed of Orangist sentiment. The British Major General George Don, who conducted a reconnaissance of the Republic in July, 1799, estimated that the Helder squadron of the Batavian fleet <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> British hands without a fight, if the Allies played their cards right.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Akers-Jones briefly {{emerged from}} {{retirement}} to defend, before Hong Kong's Legislative Council, {{his role in}} zoning the Discovery Bay resort project on Lantau in the 1970s. Developers were allowed to build there with the stipulation that it would become a resort, {{but most of the}} units were later converted into luxury housing. Akers-Jones was involved in the original zoning decision as the then Secretary for the New Territories. With the new Hong Kong Disneyland having opened nearby and property prices having skyrocketed as a result, suspicions {{about the fact that the}} original zoning plan was never enforced have again come to the fore. He criticised the decision to call on an elderly man to testify on the matter, which happened some 30 years earlier. However, he revealed that colonial officials had abruptly changed the zoning of the Discovery Bay project, and gave it to new developers because they feared it <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the hands of the former Soviet Union.|$|E
60|$|So strong is {{the working}} {{of the mind}} that already {{she had begun to}} feel as though poison were numbing her heart and {{clouding}} her brain, and was sure that soon she <b>would</b> have <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> the sleep which Harun had warned her would end in death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then what am I to do?" [...] he said. [...] "It wouldn't be any use to write, for it <b>would</b> likely <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> Emmeline's hands. She won't let Prissy go {{anywhere}} alone after this, and how am I {{to know when}} the old cat is away?" ...|$|R
60|$|People {{who knew}} the river shook their heads, {{and said that the}} {{decision}} had been delayed too long. The Nile <b>would</b> have <b>fallen</b> to a point so low that it would be difficult if not impossible to pass up the cataracts, and long before help could reach Khartoum the city and its noble governor <b>would</b> have <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> the hands of the Mahdi.|$|R
