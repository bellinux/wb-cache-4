Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music. By alternating hymn-based vocalization and jazz rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of sampling in hip hop music.|$|E

25|$|After {{the comic}} book boom of the 1990s comics fans {{witnessed}} a fast downfall {{around the turn of}} the Millennium. 2003 can be regarded as the low-point in the scene, when 117 individual comic publications were issued throughout the whole year. The vast majority of these comics were children's comics sold at newspaper stands. By 2003 a generation reached their adolescence with no substantial comic book intake, and the generation that once grew up on superhero comics was left <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> any comics since the late nineties and more importantly: reached their young adulthood.|$|E

25|$|T3 and T4 {{are carried}} in the blood, bound to plasma proteins. This {{has the effect of}} {{increasing}} the half-life of the hormone and decreasing the rate at which it is taken up by peripheral tissues. There are three main proteins that the two hormones are bound to. Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a glycoprotein that has a higher affinity for T4 than for T3. Transthyretin is also a glycoprotein, but only carries T4, <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> any affinity at all for T3. Finally, both hormones bind with a low affinity to serum albumin, but, due to the large availability of albumin, it has a high capacity.|$|E

In the early days of August 1921, the Churchills' children were entrusted to a French nursery governess in Kent, Mlle. Rose. Clementine travelled to Eaton Hall to play tennis with Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster, and his family. While still under the care of Mlle. Rose, Marigold had a cold but was reported to have recovered from the illness. As the illness progressed <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> any notice, it turned into septicaemia. Rose sent for Clementine, but the illness proved fatal on 23 August 1921, and Marigold was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery three days later.|$|E

She is held captive by her aunt Vanessa Cortlandt (also known as drug lord Proteus), after she reveals to Vanessa that she knows Vanessa played a part in Frankie's death. Maggie's cousins, Dr. David Hayward and Leo du Pres, save her, and Vanessa is later captured and sent to jail. Maggie, <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> any family, views David and Leo more as her brothers than as her cousins. They form a close relationship, bonding over their battles with Vanessa. Maggie easily bonds with Bianca as well due to the connection that the two shared with Frankie. They become best friends.|$|E
25|$|Keelmen were {{traditionally}} {{bound to}} employment for a year, the binding day normally being Christmas Day but employment {{tended to be}} seasonal <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> any work in winter. The availability of work was often affected by the weather, if ships were unable {{to come into the}} river, and also by the supply of coal from the pits. Strikes might affect output and wily pit owners would sometimes curtail production to keep prices high. As a result, keelmen could spend long periods without work, during which they would have to live on credit or find employment in clearing wrecks and sand banks from the river. The Tyneside keelmen formed an independent society in 1556 but were never incorporated, probably because the Newcastle Hostmen feared their becoming too powerful. The Wearside keelmen were finally incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1792.|$|E
25|$|In South Shields, 6.7% of the {{population}} are from an ethnic minority (non white British), compared with 5.0% in the surrounding borough of South Tyneside. Most of the Asians in the South Shields are Bangladeshi, {{with a small amount}} of Yemenis mainly concentrated in the Rekendyke area, to the north of Simonside. The Bangladeshi community is the third largest in Tyne and Wear, after Newcastle upon Tyne and Sunderland with around 1.5 - 2% of the town's population being Bangladeshi. Nearly all of the ethnic minority population in South Tyneside is concentrated in South Shields town centre, <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> any in Jarrow, Hebburn or the suburbs of the town, such as Cleadon park or Horsley Hill. The population of the South Tyneside Metropolitan borough had decreased from 152,785 in 2001, to 148,127 in 2011. In 2001, {{the population}} of South Shields was 82,854.

25|$|In 1921 Larramendi seemed already {{overwhelmed}} by mounting problems; another one were rumors about negotiations related {{to some sort}} of dynastic accord, allegedly conducted by Don Jaime with the Alfonsist branch; Larramendi has always been fiercely hostile to any compromise with the despised Liberal dynasty. He arranged for another grand meeting; it took place in Lourdes, though due to lower attendance and minor scale of discussions taking place it was rather an operational session than a milestone comparable to the Biarritz amassment; it provided Larramendi with little assistance. Soon afterwards the claimant left for Colombia <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> any guidance or information passed to his delegate in Spain; upon his return, in the summer of 1921, Larramendi handed his resignation. When discussing its background, some scholars claim he was tired of uphill struggle; others point to talks with the Alfonsists and general Don Jaime’s detachment or Larramendi’s remorse about the 1920 electoral disaster.|$|E
25|$|Exploration boomed. By 1950, Alberta {{was one of}} the world's {{exploration}} hot spots, and {{seismic activity}} grew until 1953. After the Leduc strike, it became clear that Devonian reefs could be prolific oil reservoirs, and exploration concentrated on the search for similar structures. A series of major discoveries followed, and the industry began to appreciate the diversity of geological structures in the province that could contain oil. Early reef discoveries included Redwater in 1948, Golden Spike in 1949, Wizard Lake, Fenn Big Valley and Bonnie Glen in 1951 and Westerose in 1952. In 1953, Mobil Oil made a discovery near Drayton Valley, in a sandstone formation. By 1956, more than 1,500 development wells dotted what became the Pembina oil field (the largest field in western Canada) <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> a dry hole among them, and the oil bearing Cardium Formation was dubbed the Cardium Freeway. The Swan Hills field, discovered in 1957, exploited a carbonate rock formation.|$|E
25|$|The {{last four}} named storms by PAGASA {{was from the}} last week of October until the mid-week of November. During late-October, Vinta made {{landfall}} over northern Luzon with little damages. As November came in, the PAGASA had monitored a weak Tropical Depression Wilma which had brought minor damages and a waterspout in southern Visayas. Later that week, Typhoon Haiyan entered the area as rapidly intensifying storm system with a fast-pace speed and was named Yolanda by PAGASA. The monstrous typhoon first made landfall over eastern Visayas at its peak strength of a pressure of 895 millibars, which is the strongest storm globally to make landfall at that intensity. Winds were recorded gusting up to 315km/h (195mph), with the storm producing a large storm surge which brought the death toll to nearly 7,000 people in that same country. Just like the formation of Bising during January, the last named storm, Zoraida, formed and impacted southern Philippines <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> any deaths and damages. No storms formed after that from November through {{to the end of the}} year.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} season – one <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> {{a day of}} rain in the Home Counties after early May – {{bore out}} almost all that was thought of Knox. When sound, he was clearly the fastest bowler seen {{for a long time}} in county cricket and, even on much truer Oval pitches, he was able to make the ball rise dangerously. He could also spin the ball back from the off as much as Richardson at his best. Early in the season, Knox’s bowling was beyond everything else the factor behind Surrey rising to the top of the table, and at times – notably against Leicestershire and Sussex at the Oval – his pace could bowl sides out cheaply on even the best of pitches. However, from the middle of June, the strain of bowling on such hard, sun-soaked pitches took its toll and Knox suffered constantly from shin strains. These strains kept him out of nine of Surrey’s last sixteen matches and according to Wisden, Knox “often played when he should have been resting.” Nonetheless, his twelve wickets for 174 against the Players at Lord's in July is still remembered as perhaps the fastest bowling ever seen in the history of Gentlemen v Players games: some of the professional batsmen were literally intimidated. Knox was rewarded for this and his superb early season form with nomination as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden.|$|E
500|$|This {{proved a}} {{tactical}} blunder: when a British army under General John Burgoyne arrived in July 1777, Burgoyne {{did exactly what}} Kościuszko had warned of and had his engineers place artillery on the hill. With the British in complete control of the high ground, the Americans realized their situation was hopeless and abandoned the fortress <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> a shot fired in the Siege of Ticonderoga. The British advance force nipped hard {{on the heels of}} the outnumbered and exhausted Continentals as they fled south. Major General Philip Schuyler, desperate to put distance between his men and their pursuers, ordered Kościuszko to delay the enemy. [...] Kościuszko designed an engineer's solution: his men felled trees, dammed streams, and destroyed bridges and causeways. Encumbered by their huge supply train, the British began to bog down, giving the Americans the time needed to safely withdraw across the Hudson River.|$|E
500|$|The cap is then {{packed with}} a smokable substance, and screwed onto the bottle {{once it is}} {{immersed}} to its neck in liquid. While lighting the bowl with (preferably) a lighter or match, the bottle is gradually lifted until it is about {{to come out of}} the water or when the substance discontinues burning. While the bottle is held in place, the lid is removed, the user's mouth is placed on the bottle opening, and the user inhales as the bottle is pushed back down into the water. The cause of the smoke being expelled by the bottle's movement is the rise in internal pressure, created when the water volume increases; the smoke enters the lungs in a [...] "smoother" [...] manner than inhaling from a joint, blunt, or bowl by itself. This will give the smoker a sudden dose <b>with</b> <b>hardly</b> any smoke lost, rather than the amount of smoke lost with joints and blunts.|$|E
