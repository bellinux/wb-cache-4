He wrote {{that this is a}} trap that constrains our creativity, prevents us from exploring new ideas, and hampers our dealing with the full complexity of new issues. He developed a systematic method of dealing with change that involved looking at any new issue from three angles: technical and production, political and resource allocation, and corporate culture.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Richard Pascale {{wrote that}} {{relentless}} change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves. His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” {{by which he}} means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, <b>We</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> depend on what worked yesterday and refuse {{to let go of}} what worked so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{phenomenon}} was observed, but not photographed, in the Owens Valley of California. Early {{in the morning}} with no wind, thin clouds were observed to form above the valley. The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible free convection whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that <b>we</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> think that it is necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. Perhaps it would be more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization. The concept also applies to any fluid motion as opposed to a strictly forced flow.|$|E

25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, <b>we</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E
500|$|All {{members of}} the band were {{involved}} in the writing of songs, and there may have been more than one person's set of lyrics appearing in a single release. Powell said that [...] "It's quite interesting to have two people's viewpoints within the same song. I'm not sure how many bands actually do that. In most bands, the guitarist writes the music and the singer writes the lyrics. <b>We</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> share things out more evenly." [...] He also criticised the attachment of an indie pop label to the band, saying [...] "We're seen as one of the indie bands. But we've always just tried to make pop music. Even if it is pop music with a hard edge and quite a twisted little view of life. We've always seen ourselves as a little bigger than an indie band." ...|$|E
500|$|The surname [...] "Affleck" [...] is of Scottish origin. Affleck {{appeared}} on the PBS genealogy series Finding Your Roots in 2014. When told during filming that an ancestor had been a slave owner in Georgia, Affleck responded: [...] "God. It gives me kind of a sagging feeling to see a biological relationship to that. But, you know, there it is, part of our history ... <b>We</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> separate ourselves from these things by going like, 'It's just dry history, and it's all over now'." [...] Later, a representative for Affleck told host Henry Louis Gates Jr. via email that Affleck [...] "was uneasy about the slave owner" [...] and the information {{was not included in}} the show's final cut.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Since the {{discovery}} of head-direction cells in nonhuman mammals, we have {{learned a great deal}} about how an internal compass-like system functions in the mammalian brain. In contrast, we know very little about how this system operates in humans—or, for that matter, whether humans even have an internal compass for com-puting body heading. This article reviews a recent line of inquiry that uses animal models of head-direction-system functioning to motivate behavioral research on human sense of direction.

500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, <b>we</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times {{wrote in}} his review of the episode; [...] "As with many epic sagas, the story and action in “Game of Thrones” are driven largely by {{characters}} moving toward and eventually becoming the people {{they are supposed to}} be. While <b>we</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> focus on the big-ticket destinies, whether it’s Daenerys Targaryen emerging triumphantly from the flames last week or Jon Snow rising from the dead to fight again, the smaller figures have their own slots to fill."

[...] Tim Surette of TV.com {{wrote in his}} review, [...] "The Door was BRUTAL in its final minutes, and you're still crying over it, admit it." [...] Lauren O'Callaghan of SFX Magazine wrote in her review, [...] "The Door, was the midseason episode.

2500|$|The {{fundamental}} principle of gestalt perception {{is the law}} of [...] (in the German language, pithiness), which says that <b>we</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> order our experience {{in a manner that}} is regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple.

That is, you can figure out what actions are connected to what consequences, at least up to a probability distribution. <b>We</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> move toward a less knowable environment, one that was chaotic, it was complex, it was difficult <b>to</b> understand and <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> examine the effects of that kind of environment.|$|R

2500|$|Law of Symmetry—The law of {{symmetry}} {{states that}} the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts. [...] Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape. [...] Similarities between symmetrical objects {{increase the likelihood that}} objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets. [...] When the image is perceived, <b>we</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.|$|E

[...] They are also afraid of harmless side effects like febrile seizures and dramatically overestimate the likelihood of permanent damage from typical fevers.

2500|$|During the show, Cuozzo contrasted [...] tabloid journalism {{with the}} area in which he works, noting, [...] "Tabloid journalism is journalism driven by a focused {{concentration}} on individuals as distinct from the workings of institutions. So even if we cover institutions, such as government or the Federal Reserve, <b>we</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> do so from the point with the perspective that they're run by individual men and women." [...] Cuozzo noted that monopoly newspaper markets tend to publish articles that [...] "march in lock step with the advertising community," [...] and newspapers that promote or tolerate public journalism do so with the hope of selling more advertising rather than selling more papers. In describing the Post and its place in New York public journalism, Cuozzo noted, [...] A month after appearing on the Think Tank, in late November 1996, Cuozzo's father Joseph died in North Babylon, New York. Three months later, Cuozzo's mother-in-law, Lenore Hershey, died of complications from Parkinson's disease.|$|E

Or is it because there's something inherently funny in custard pies? Or in faces? Or in throwing things? No. No. and no! The real reason why we laugh is because we are relieved. Because we are released from a sense of fear. Wherever we may happen to be - in the cinema, theatre, or music-hall - <b>we</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> identify with the actors we are watching. So that when a custard pie is thrown we fear for a moment that it as been thrown at us. And then, immediately we realise that it hasn't hit us, we experience a feeling of relief, and we laugh".|$|E
