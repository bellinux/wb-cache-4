According to Harry Walters, an anthropologist and former chairman of the Center for Diné Studies at Diné College in , the incident demonstrates a crucial difference between Navajo and Western culture in the way visions and supernatural experiences are handled: [...] "Rather than focus on the sightings to determine if who saw it was nuts or not – that's what a Westerner would do – <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> as a message: 'Are we going the way we should? Walters said.|$|E
500|$|On 4 December 2014, Chris Martin {{announced}} {{in an interview}} with Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 that Coldplay {{are in the middle of}} working on their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams. Martin stated it might be the band's final album and compared it to Harry Potter; [...] "It's our seventh thing, and the way <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> it's like the last Harry Potter book or something like that." [...] He added that, unlike their promotion efforts for Ghost Stories, the band will tour for the seventh record. In an interview with Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 2, Martin hinted at the style of the album by saying that the band was trying to make something colourful and uplifting, yet not bombastic. He also stated that it will be something to [...] "shuffle your feet" [...] to.|$|E
500|$|Wizards & Warriors III {{received}} {{praise from}} Retro Gamer magazine in September2010, {{as part of}} its retrospective on the Wizards & Warriors series. They said that the third installment was the best game in the series as well as developer Ste Pickford's personal favorite, {{despite the fact that it}} did not sell as well as its predecessor Ironsword. Developer Ste Pickford said: [...] "Wizards & WarriorsIII was more like a game that I really wanted to make. IronSword was pretty much a straight sequel for a game dropped in our lap; <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and tried to make a new version with some improvements." [...] Pickford added that, while he could have done better with both Ironsword and Wizards & WarriorsIII, he wished he would have been able to see the latter to its completion.|$|E

McLaughlin, who at {{the time}} was the Deputy Director of the CIA, {{described}} the extent of the Agency's investigation into the claim: [...] "Well, on something like the Atta meeting in Prague, we went over that every which way from Sunday. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from every conceivable angle. We peeled open the source, examined the chain of acquisition. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> photographs. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> timetables. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> who was where and when.

[...] "I talked about him—but, in very beautiful and glowing terms, stopping short of endorsing him. And unfortunately, or fortunately, however <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> the media said I 'endorsed' him, so he renounced my so-called endorsement and support.

"Well," [...] replied Rinkitink, {{leaning against}} an old barrel and looking quite solemn, [...] "the thing is {{certainly}} unlucky, any way <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> I suppose someone has passed along here and, seeing the shoe upon the dust-heap, has carried it away.

5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another.

It was (indefinite and much-abused term) Colonial; painted white; and double, with dormer windows of diagonal wood-surrounded panes in the roof. There was a large pillared porch on its least private side--namely, the front. A white-capped maid stood in the open doorway and smiled at Honora as she entered.|$|E
