Executive producer Susan Bower had hinted previously that the milestone would involve Paul and Alan Fletcher teased audiences with the revelation that something horrible would happen to an iconic character. Of Paul's involvement and the reasoning behind it Bower explained: [...] "As Stefan Dennis – Paul Robinson – was in the first episode 25 years ago, it was decided that his character play a most important role in this very special event [...] Paul Robinson, or P.R as we like to call him, has been up to his usual tricks {{over the past few weeks}} and everyone on Ramsay Street is becoming really sick of him. <b>What</b> <b>will</b> <b>they</b> do about it?" [...] It was then announced the plot would be a whodunnit style arc, in which Paul is left fighting for his life after being pushed from the mezzanine level of Lassiter's Hotel.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, the American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA) began grading each {{college or}} {{university}} {{on the strength of}} its general education requirements. ACTA's annual report on <b>What</b> <b>Will</b> <b>They</b> Learn? uses how many of seven subjects (composition, mathematics, foreign language, science, economics, literature and American government or history) are required by an institution to assign it a letter grade (A through F). The 2011-2012 edition of <b>What</b> <b>Will</b> <b>They</b> Learn? graded 1,007 institutions, and awarded nineteen schools an [...] "A" [...] for requiring more than five of the subjects. Its 2012-2013 evaluation awarded twenty one [...] "A" [...] grades among 1,070 colleges and universities. ACTA's rating system has been endorsed by Mel Elfin, founding editor of U.S. News & World Report's rankings. New York Times higher education blogger Stanley Fish agreed a university ought to have a strong core curriculum, but disagreed with the inclusion of some ACTA subjects in that core.|$|E

Pepperdine was one of 21 schools to receive an [...] "A" [...] grade, which is assigned to schools that include at least six of the seven designated subjects in their core curriculum.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{their arrival}} in France, the former prisoners were brought {{together}} to undergo medical examinations. Then {{they were sent}} to different barracks to fill out forms and be interrogated. The authorities sought to assemble proof of ill-treatment, which the prisoners tended to deny {{so as to be}} reunited more quickly with their families. The poor condition of accommodations in France was noted by a number of men, including Charles Gueugnier: [...] "Entering there, the heart tightened; one was caught by an irrepressible disgust. They dared call this Augias pigsty American Park! Really, we were better and more properly housed by our Prussian enemies! Poor mothers, <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>they</b> do with your children? Those among you who miraculously came back from that ghastly mêlée more or less wounded or sick were treated here worse than dogs or pigs".
