5|$|Davidson {{played a}} large role in the Fourth Test Old Trafford. Victory would give Australia an {{unassailable}} 2–1 series lead and retention of the Ashes.

5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that they <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> relocate. The reduction {{in the base of}} around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; there are risks associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be discarded. Finally, a business <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies {{tend to be the}} need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Australia's {{military}} forces were focused upon the militia and what Regular forces existed were mostly serving in the artillery or engineers and were assigned in most part to the task of coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be raised. This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).|$|E

5|$|Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker {{arranged}} another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was {{a modest}} gentleman, who was generally unlikely {{to win the}} major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw). The conditions of the match against Lasker are still debated among chess historians, but it seems Schlechter accepted to play under very unfavourable conditions, notably that he <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared {{the winner of the}} match, and he <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> win a revenge match to be declared World Champion. The match was originally meant to consist of 30 games, but when it became obvious that there were insufficient funds (Lasker demanded a fee of 1,000 marks per game played), the number of games was reduced to ten, making the margin of two points all the more difficult.|$|E
