5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how to classify the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis {{has been defined as}} a percentage of body surface area (BSA)≤10, a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ≤10, and a dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10. The DLQI is a 10 question tool used to measure the impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> indicating greater social or occupational impairment.|$|E
5|$|The {{first class}} arrived in fall 1927. The {{incoming}} Experimental College class was more diverse than the larger university's population. One third of students hailed from Wisconsin (as opposed to 90 {{percent in the}} university), most were from urban areas (the East Coast had particularly strong representation), one third were second-generation immigrants, and Meiklejohn estimated their Jewish population at 40 percent. The College was all-male, {{due in part to}} space availability and the regents' refusal of mixed-sex living arrangements, in keeping with American college conventions. The students were largely well-versed in current affairs, <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> on entrance exams and lower high school grades than their UW counterparts. Meiklejohn appreciated the challenges of reconciling this diversity and related this task to those facing the country's democratic governance.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Central to the four-branch {{model is}} the idea that EI {{requires}} attunement to social norms. Therefore, the MSCEIT is scored in a consensus fashion, <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> indicating higher overlap between an individual's answers and those provided by a worldwide sample of respondents. The MSCEIT can also be expert-scored, so that the amount of overlap is calculated between an individual's answers and those provided by a group of 21 emotion researchers.|$|E

This led some states to require three years of mathematics instead of two. But because this requirement was often met by taking another lower level mathematics course, the additional courses had a “diluted” effect in raising achievement levels.|$|E

25|$|Credit {{scores are}} often used in {{determining}} prices for auto and homeowner's insurance. Starting in the 1990s, the national credit reporting agencies that generate credit scores have also been generating more specialized insurance scores, which insurance companies then use to rate the insurance risk of potential customers. Studies indicate {{that the majority of}} those who are insured pay less in insurance through the use of scores. These studies point out that people <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> have fewer claims.|$|E
25|$|The {{free market}} {{viewpoint}} defines economic liberty as {{the freedom to}} produce, trade and consume any goods and services acquired {{without the use of}} force, fraud or theft. This is embodied in the rule of law, property rights and freedom of contract, and characterized by external and internal openness of the markets, the protection of property rights and freedom of economic initiative. There are several indices of economic freedom that attempt to measure free market economic freedom. Empirical studies based on these rankings have found higher living standards, economic growth, income equality, less corruption and less political violence to be correlated <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> on the country rankings. It has been argued that the economic freedom indices conflate together unrelated policies and policy outcomes to conceal negative correlations between economic growth and economic freedom in some subcomponents.|$|E

Scores for QoL and symptoms range from 0-25, <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> indicating worse quality of life.
