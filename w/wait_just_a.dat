In the video, movement can be seen, especially in the lights above the newscasters. The three newscasters were María Victoria Llamas (substituting for Guillermo Ochoa), Lourdes Guerrero and Juan Dosal. As the movement began Llamas reports grabbing {{the underside of the}} desk, and whispering quickly to her colleagues that she hoped no one could see how scared she was. The last image broadcast from the studio was that of Lourdes Guerrero stating [...] "...it's still shaking a little (sigue temblando un poquitito), but we must take it calmly. We will <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> second so we can keep talking." [...] Then the image disappeared. The transmission ended because a nearby 10-ton antenna had bent over and crushed parts of Televisa's buildings that were located on Niños Héroes and Dr. Río de la Loza Streets in Colonia Doctores.|$|E

50|$|Given that {{it plays}} such {{a central role}} in Cambodian culture, a wealth of {{different}} versions and including school plays have created distinctive interpretations of the tale. One of the most influential (and the one which serves {{as the basis for the}} version used in schools) sees the events through a rather crude interpretation of the Law of Karma, whereby Tum's death due to his impulsive decision to disrobe against the wishes of his abbot (who'd asked Tum to <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few weeks), and Teav's demise is attributed to her disobeying her mother's wishes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in Japan on September 30, 2015. An English version of the game was not announced {{for almost a year}} after its initial Japanese release, leaving the game's fate in the West uncertain at the time. Journalists had considered it as a likely candidate for game localization by Xseed Games, due to their close relationship with Falcom from translating entries in their Trails and Ys titles. Other journalists mistook the Xanadu related trademark leaked in January 2015 as a sign of it being translated by XSeed, though this was actually in reference to Xanadu Next. USGamer described the game's chances of being localized as [...] "extremely strong". In February 2016, Falcom president Toshihiro Kondo, when asked if third party companies were interested in releasing the title in the English in the West, responded that it was [...] "something that we definitely want to make a reality and are currently working towards.

After the shaking stopped, they both left the Televisa studios through a back door, and hours later they were back on the air in the studios of Canal de las Estrellas to broadcast live what was happening. Some members of the Hoy Mismo staff died, including producer Ernesto Villanueva and engineer David Mendoza Córcega, who had just parked at the Televisa building, but had no time to escape from his car. The falling debris also killed street vendors who worked just outside the studio building. Reconstruction of the studio building began in 1995 and ended in 2000.|$|E

5000|$|The Secret History {{continues}} {{with the following}} account of Bodonchar's life: Belgunudei and Bugunudei, the two sons previously born from Dobun Mergen, spoke secretly from their mother Alan Gua: [...] "This mother, although she is without a man, has given birth to these three sons. In the house there is only that Maalig Bayagudai person. These three sons must be his." [...] Their mother Alan Gua figured out they were speaking these things in secret. So on one spring day she boiled mutton and had her five sons Belgunudei, Bugunudei, Bukhu Khatagi, Bukhatu Salji and Butunchar Munkhag sit {{next to each other}} facing her. She gave each of them a single arrow and said [...] "Break it". They snapped the single arrows easily. Then she gave them five arrows in a bundle and said [...] "Break it". Each of the five tried breaking that bundle of five arrows, taking turns and trying from different angles, but couldn't manage to break it at all. Then their mother Alan Gua said: [...] "You, my two sons Belgunudei and Bugunudei, say I have given birth to these three sons and you are now suspicious and question whose sons they are and where on earth they came from. Your are right in being suspicious. Every night a radiant yellow person used to come in through the opening in the roof of the ger (yurt) or through the space above the ger entrance and caress my belly, his light getting absorbed into my belly. When he left, he left like a yellow dog rising and twisting away along the dividing line of the sun and the moon (at the meeting line of dawn and night). Why do you lightly speak such futile words? If we interpret this sign, it is clear they are sons of Heaven (Tengri). Why do you speak of {{them as if they were}} commoners? When they become Kings of All (Khamag-un Khagad), then will commoners see who they really are!" [...] And then Alan Gua told them a word of wisdom: [...] "You, my five sons, were born from my one womb. If you become separate like those single arrows, you will be easily broken in half by anybody who passes. If you become one union like that bundle of arrows, how will anybody be able to break you easily?" [...] And then suddenly one day their mother Alan Gua was no more.After their mother Alan Gua died, the brothers divided their property. Four of them, Belgunudei, Bugunudei, Bukhu Khatagi and Bukhatu Salji took shares. They excluded Butunchar from the clan, saying he was stupid and didn't give him any share. Butunchar, seeing he was not counted as urag (blood relation, member of the clan) said [...] "What's the point of me being here!" [...] and galloped off down the Onon River on his black-speckled white horse with a stripe down its back and a scanty tail saying [...] "If I die, so be it! If I live, so be it!" [...] He rode downstream till he reached Baljun Aral (Baljun Island) where he made a grass tent for himself and settled there. While he was staying there he saw a female brown hawk catch and eat a black pheasant. He plucked some hairs from the tail of his horse, made a snare, caught the hawk and reared it. When he had nothing to eat he shot and killed wild game penned in against a cliff by a pack of wolves or went and collected the scraps left by the wolves, fed his stomach as well as his hawk's and survived the winter that year. Spring came. Wild geese and ducks began to arrive and Butunchar after starving his hawk for a while released it, and it caught for him so many geese and ducks that he could not eat them all and hung some of them on a withered tree, where they stayed till they stank. A group of people came to Tunkhelig Stream from the forests on the northern side of Mount Duiren. Butunchar would leave his hawk, go to those people, drink fermented mare's milk during the day and go back to spend the night in his grass tent. Those people asked for his hawk but Butunchar refused to give it to them. Those people never asked Butunchar [...] "Whose son are you? Where are you from?" [...] nor did Butunchar ask them [...] "What people are you?" [...] They simply continued living close to each other. Bukhu Khatagi came searching for his younger brother Butunchar Munkhag saying [...] "this one has disappeared down the Onon River". When he asked the people camped at Tunkhelig Stream [...] "Have you seen a person looking like this and this? With a horse like this and this?" [...] they replied [...] "The man and horse are both exactly as you say. He has a hawk. Every day he comes to us to drink fermented mare's milk and goes back. No one knows where he spends the night! Whenever the wind blows from the north-west the feathers of the wild geese and ducks caught by his hawk come whirling down like a snow-storm. He must be close by. Now is almost the time for him to come. <b>Wait</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little bit!" [...] After a short while, a man came up towards Tunkhelig Stream. When he came closer, it was indeed Butunchar. Bukhu Khatagi saw and recognized him and led him back, galloping up the Onon River. Butunchar was trotting behind his elder brother Bukhu Khatagi. He said as he was trotting: [...] "Elder brother! Elder brother! It is good for a body to have a head, for a coat to have a collar." [...] He repeated the same words but his elder brother didn't make anything of it and didn't reply. Butunchar rode on and said the same words again. At this his elder brother said [...] "What are these words you have been muttering all this while?" [...] Butunchar said [...] "Those people camped at the Tunkhelig stream, they have no great and small, no good and bad, no head and feet. They are equal one to the other. An easy people. Let us conquer them."His elder brother then said: [...] "Alright, if that is the case, when we come home let us hold a meeting of brothers and having agreed, let us conquer those people." [...] They came home, a discussion among brothers was held and they rode off to conquer. They sent Butunchar ahead to reconnoitre as forward scout. Butunchar went as forward scout and caught a woman midway through her pregnancy. He asked [...] "What manner of person are you?" [...] The woman replied [...] "I am a woman of the Jarchuud Adankhan clan of the Uriankhai tribe". The brothers, all five of them, conquered those people and came to enjoy an easier life with a good number of beasts, bread and bondservants (fixed phrase meaning greater prosperity).|$|E

The sequestration process occurs naturally by storing the atmospheric carbon in plants or soil. While carbon is a necessary element in the life cycle, too much carbon in the atmosphere is thought to contribute to a general increase in the temperature of the earth’s atmosphere, which is referred to as global warming.

40|$|China has {{the third-largest}} {{economy in the}} world, with a gross {{domestic}} product of U. S. $ 748 billion in 2000 and an economic growth rate of 8. 2 percent. By as early as 2007, it is projected {{that it will have}} the world's largest economy, outstripping in gross terms both the United States and the European Union. Second only to Japan, China is currently running a huge trade surplus with the United States while prices at home remain relatively stable. In 1997 - 98, during the Asian financial crisis, the semiconvertible yuan was largely unaffected while the currencies of China's regional neigbors were clobbered. These and other impressive data indicate an economy that by any measure has witnessed more than twenty years of unbridled success and has nothing but smooth sailing ahead. But <b>wait</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> minute, says the renowned economist and journalist, He Qinglian. While China's leaders persistently and, some would say, ad nauseam promote the country's economic prowess, she sees a darker side of the Chinese "miracle" This was evident in the first two chapters of her book that were published in >i>The Chinese Economy>/i>, vol. 33, no. 3 (May-June 2000). Is He Qinglian simply a Chinese naysayer? A Beijing "nabob of negativism"? Someone too willing to throw cold water on what by all accounts has been two remarkable decades and more of economic progress for possibly the largest segment of humankind in history? Perhaps. But then, consider the points made in the following three chapters of He Qinglian's monumental work, which has been influential among China's leaders and regime critics alike, and which the translators, Nancy Yang Liu and Lawrence R. Sullivan, have rendered in English as >i>China's Descent into a Quagmire. >/i>...|$|E
