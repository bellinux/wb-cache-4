40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to use microcontroller and sensors to automatically sort out organic and inorganic waste materials to be recycled. This is to reduce the time taken to sort out organic and inorganic waste materials manually and to save cost involved in processing waste. This study further described a sophisticated technique in <b>sorting</b> the <b>waste</b> based on the microcontroller unit that used gas sensors to separate the organic and raw wastes. The gas detection system was incorporated within the conveyer that passed in front of the gas sensor and sent data to controller through analog to digital convertor. The Microcontroller- based automatic <b>waste</b> management <b>sorting</b> <b>unit</b> for a recycling plant was successfully designed, built and this provided an efficient system for <b>sorting</b> out <b>wastes</b> into various components...|$|R

A research was focus on central build-up area and suburban built-up area. This simply means research among family houses and prefabricated houses.

40|$|Purpose: This study explores informational {{structures}} {{producing and}} organizing {{the construction of}} <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> in Sweden. It shows how the issue is constructed by it being searched for in Google and how this contributes to the specific informational texture of <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> in Sweden. It is guided by the following questions: Who are the main actors and which are the central topics featuring in Google results on popular, suggested searches for <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> in Sweden? What do the link relations between these {{tell us about the}} issue space that is formed around <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> in Sweden? How is the construction of the notions of <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> and <b>waste</b> shaped in the information available through Google’s features for related and other relevant searches? Design/methodology/approach: <b>Waste</b> <b>sorting</b> is discussed as a practice structured along moral rules and as a classification exercise. The study brings together two types of material, results from searches carried out in Google and lists of Google query suggestions for relevant search terms. These are analysed with a mixed method approach, uniting quantitative network analysis and qualitative content analysis of query suggestions. A sociomaterial approach theoretically grounds the analysis. Finding: <b>Waste</b> <b>sorting</b> in Sweden emerges as an issue that is characterised by dense networks of rules and regulation, focused in public authorities and government agencies, which in turn address consumers, waste management businesses and other authorities. Search engine use and <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> in Sweden are shown to be joined together in various mundane everyday life practices and practices of governance that become visible through the search engine in form of search results and suggested searches. The search engine is shown to work as a fluid classification system, which is also created and shaped by its use. Originality/value: The study offers a novel methodological approach to studying the informational structures of an issue and of its shaping through it being searched for. The sociomaterially grounded analysis of Google as a fluid classification system is original...|$|R

40|$|High-throughput and low-latency sorting {{is a key}} {{requirement}} in many applications that deal with large amounts of data. Searching and highenergy physics systems require {{a considerable number of}} <b>sorting</b> <b>units.</b> The particle detectors in CERN?s Large Hadron Collider require hundreds of fast <b>sorting</b> <b>units.</b> To provide the performance and flexibility needed in high-energy physics experiments, these <b>sorting</b> <b>units</b> are often implemented using high-end FPGA devices. This thesis presents efficient techniques for designing high-throughput, low-latency <b>sorting</b> <b>units.</b> Our <b>sorting</b> architectures utilize modular design techniques that hierarchically construct large <b>sorting</b> <b>units</b> from smaller building blocks. The <b>sorting</b> <b>units</b> are optimized for situations in which only the M largest numbers from N inputs are needed, since this situation commonly occurs in many applications for scientific computing, data mining, network processing, digital signal processing,and high-energy physics. We utilize our proposed techniques to design parameterized, pipelined, and modular <b>sorting</b> <b>units.</b> A detailed analysis of these <b>sorting</b> <b>units</b> indicates that as the number of inputs increases their resource requirements scale linearly, their latencies scale logarithmically, and their frequencies remain almost constant. When synthesized to a 65 -nm TSMC technology, a single pipelined 256 -to- 4 <b>sorting</b> <b>unit</b> with 19 stages can perform more than 2. 7 billion sorts per second with a latency of about 7 ns per sort. When implemented on a Virtex- 5 FPGA, the same <b>sorting</b> <b>unit</b> can perform roughly 200 million sorts per second with a latency of about 95 ns per sort. We also propose iterative sorting techniques, in which a small <b>sorting</b> <b>unit</b> is used several times to find the largest values...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{is the major}} solid waste generator in Hong Kong. In 1998, it generated about 32   710 t per day of construction and demolition (C&D) waste. In the management of such a huge quantity of C&D waste, Hong Kong has adopted a strategy of depositing the inert portion (e. g. sand, bricks and concrete) of the waste at public filling areas for land reclamation and the non-inert portion (e. g. plastics, paper, wood) at municipal solid waste landfills. However, the C&D waste arisen is usually {{in the form of}} a mixture of both inert and non-inert materials. As a result, the waste has to be disposed of at landfills, aggravating the landfill shortage problem. There is a paramount need to separate the C&D waste into its constituent parts before it is delivered to either the landfills or the public filling areas for disposal. In order to study the feasibility of carrying out on-site <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> and the current situation of the building relating C&D waste generated in Hong Kong, a survey was conducted. This paper presents the results of the survey undertaken to evaluate three alternative <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> methods on building construction sites and to compare them with the use of an off-site central <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> facility. The results indicate source separation has the advantages of requiring less effort and resulting in better segregation of inert and non-inert wastes as compared with <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> centrally carried out at a designated area on- or off-site. In addition, the views of the building industry participants were also obtained through a questionnaire survey to give a better understanding of their attitude on on-site <b>waste</b> <b>sorting.</b> The results indicate that the building construction participants are reluctant to carry out on-site <b>waste</b> <b>sorting.</b> Even when high a tipping fee is imposed, they have little incentive to perform on-site <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> which is considered to be time and labour demanding. Only through contractual requirements or legislation can on-site <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> be fully implemented and becomes a long-term solution to the landfill shortage problem in Hong Kong.

The paper discusses {{the results of a}} case study from Vellinge municipality (Sweden), where the introduction of separate food waste collection is thought to have a role in reducing the total amount of household waste and improving the <b>sorting</b> of packaging <b>waste.</b> The study relies on data from official waste statistics and a survey of 117 municipal residents focusing on households' perceptions, attitudes and self-reflected changes in <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> behaviour. The respondents mentioned the increased environmental awareness and the convenience of food <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> among the primary reasons for the perceived changes in personal <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> routines. The study also tested the significance of other variables, such as income, employment, economic activity, socio-demographics, infrastructure, waste tariffs, illegal dumping, and awareness raising campaigns. Most of the variables were static and none showed sufficient correlation to the observed reduction of waste collection rates and the improvements in <b>sorting</b> other <b>waste</b> fractions.
