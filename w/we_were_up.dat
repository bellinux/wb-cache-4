We're not really unhappy or bogged down by it. We'll {{go back to our}} hotel and enjoy it. That's what sport is all about. the response from our team was great. even the guys who didn't get a chance were completely behind the team. So the spirit was great." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album's content, [...] "It's a pretty exhausting record. It's quite dense and I {{think some of the}} decisions we made don't always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking a lot more about what we'd want to play when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on.

DeLonge recalled the meeting in 2000: [...] "When I first met Mark, we were running around naked, doing weird stuff. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>up</b> skateboarding until late hours of the morning, antagonizing security guards, and we were just always having fun."
