Based on two infrared cameras operating in the 3 − 5 µm wavelength range, the system acquires thermographic image sequences of the water surface with high temporal resolution. Due to the optical properties of water, imaging in this region of the infrared spectrum is well suited for stereo matching, as it avoids or reduces {{the problems associated with}} transparency, specular reflections, and lack of texture at visible wavelengths.

40|$|Conditions {{leading to}} the onset of air-flow {{separation}} over a mobile air-water interface are discussed. It is argued that, in a frame of reference in which the interfacial boundary assumes a steady shape, the occurrence of separation requires a stagnation point on the interface. In the case of air blowing over water waves, this corresponds to the onset of wave breaking. These arguments are strongly supported by flow visualization and pressure measurements carried out in a laboratory <b>wind-wave</b> <b>flume.</b> Furthermore, the pressure measurements show a greatly enhanced interfacial shear stress for a breaking wave compared with that over an unbroken wave of the same wavelength. The implications of these findings for wind-wave generation are discussed. 1...|$|E

40|$|Three image {{processing}} techniques are described {{to measure the}} modulation of the amplitude, phase speed, frequency, and wavenumber of short waves {{as a function of}} the phase of the long wave. First, long and short waves are separated by appropriate bandpass filtering. Secondly, the phase speed is computed by determining the local orientation in the space-time domain. Thirdly, Hilbert filters are used to compute the phase and amplitude of the long and short waves. Local wavenumbers and frequencies can then be estimated from spatial and temporal phase gradients, respectively. These techniques are successfully used to analyze long wave/short wave interaction of mechanically generated waves in the glass-wall wave channel at the Scripps Hydraulic Facility and the modulation of short wind waves by larger waves in the large <b>wind-wave</b> <b>flume</b> of Delft Hydraulics (The Netherlands) ...|$|E
40|$|A <b>wind-wave</b> <b>flume</b> {{is used to}} {{determine}} the extent to which the thermal boundary layer (TBL) at a wind-forced air-water interface is completely renewed from below. We measure skin temperature, Tskin, radiometrically, temperature immediately below the TBL, Tsubskin, using a temperature profiler, and net heat flux using the gradient flux technique. The Tskin probability density function, p(Tskin), and surface renewal time scale, τ, were measured using passive and active infrared imaging techniques, respectively. We find that the mean percentile rank of Tsubskin in p(Tskin) is 99. 90, implying that complete surface renewal occurs. This result suggests an alternative to radiometric measurement of Tskin through the simple combination of an infrared camera and an in situ temperature sensor. Comparison of the temperature difference across the TBL to the expected cooling implies that a significant portion of events only partially renew the TBL. This result should impact efforts to improve air-sea transfer models...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{technique}} is presented {{that makes it}} feasible to measure the viscous shear stress τµ from active thermography. With a CO 2 laser, patterns are written to the sea surface. This temperature structure is distorted by the velocity profile in the viscous boundary layer.

The viscous shear stress is extracted from the recovered velocity profile. The computation relies on a shape analysis of the visualized thermal structures. An analytical function is derived which captures the dynamical processes. The model parameters can then be computed in a standard nonlinear parameter estimation framework.

These may be classified into 3 types: Ventilated, compres-sion and hammer shocks (Fig. 1). The following conc"Lusions are reached: (1) Model impu"Lses, Ip dt, can be translated to the prototype by Froude's law. - (2) Froudets law also applies to the maximum pressure of a wetl-ventitated shock, but wilt yietd conservative vaLues when the bubble content in prototype is high and the pressure rise is very rapid. - (3) The Compression Model Law, Fig. 5, applies approximately to the maximum pressure of a compression shock. - (4) Froude's law is valid for a normal ham-mer shock, {{but in some cases}} a composite effect, also invol,ving compressibi"Lity, may occur. It is suggested that future research be based on detailed stUdies in large, well instrumented models, and that the physical analysis be translated to prototype with duo consideration of various scate effects such as difference in bubble contents.

40|$|Affordable {{high quality}} {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) video cameras and image processing software are powerful tools for bubble measurements. Because {{of the wide}} variation between bubble populations, different bubble measurement systems (BMSs) are required depending upon the application. Two BMSs are described: a mini-BMS designed to observe the background bubble population from breaking waves, and a large-BMS designed to noninvasively determine the time-resolved bubble distribution inside dense bubble plumes and near the interface, as are details of the analysis techniques. Using the two systems in conjunction with each other allowed size distributions over the range 15 - 5000 -μm radius to be obtained. The BMSs were designed for application to breaking-wave bubble plumes in the field or laboratory. Distributions measured by both BMSs in aerator-generated plumes agreed very well for the overlapping size range.

Experiments were carried out on the <b>Wind-Wave</b> <b>Flume</b> of the Large Thermostratified Tank of IAP RAS. A special net located under the surface at different depths allows to vary parameters of surface waves independently on wind parameters. Theory of self-similarity of air flow parameters in the flume was used to calculate values aerodynamic and heat transfer coefficients from the measured velocity and temperature profiles by Pito and hotfilm gauges respectively. Simultaneous measurements of surface elevation with system wire allow to obtain spectra and integral parameters of waves.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} is presented {{that makes it}} possible to measure the viscous shear stress τµ from active thermography. With a CO 2 laser, patterns are written to the sea surface. This temperature structure is distorted by the linear velocity profile in the viscous boundary layer. Due to the non-zero penetration depth of both the laser and the infrared camera, this vertical velocity profile can be resolved. By resolving the velocity profile, the viscous shear stress can be extracted from the recorded image sequences. At the same time, the flow field at the water surface can be measured accurately. Estimating both quantities is only possible by modeling the imaging process as well as the velocity profile in the boundary layer. The model parameters can then be computed in a standard parameter estimation framework. This novel technique was tested both on simulated data and on measurements conducted in a small annular <b>wind-wave</b> <b>flume.</b> The friction velocity computed in this fashion compared favorably to independent measurements.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{relation between}} {{shape of the}} surface, flow dynamics beneath the surface and related exchange processes such as gas transfer are not well understood. In order to gain insight into the dynamics of three dimensional flow fields close the air/sea shear layer we present a stereo particle tracking velocimetry method. The well established particle tracking velocimetry for two dimensional image sequences is combined with a stereo correlation algorithm. The stereo correlation {{is applied to the}} trajectories extracted from each image sequence of the stereo camera setup. Particle features can be extracted not only from one single image but from the whole sequence. These are then used in the correlation process, thus making the algorithm more efficient. A precise sub pixel calibration allows quantitative study of the properties of the flow field. Only two cameras are needed and therefore this method simplifies the experimental setup compared to multiple camera setups. Stereo particle tracking was applied for flow field investigations in a <b>wind-wave</b> <b>flume</b> and in a gas liquid reactor...|$|E
40|$|Down-looking laser {{altimeters}} {{are commonly}} {{used to measure the}} sea surface elevation. However, because the laser radiation is attenuated by spray droplets suspended along the transmission path, it is presumed that altimeters may also provide an indirect measure of the sea spray volume. Here we discuss this conjecture by means of laboratory experiments, which have been conducted in a <b>wind-wave</b> <b>flume.</b> A large number of wind conditions were considered between equivalent 10 -metre wind speeds of 20 and 60 m/s in order to generate different spray volumes above the water surface. The facility was equipped with a laser and side-looking camera system to estimate the spray volume as well as a nearby down-looking laser altimeter. Results confirm that there is a robust degradation of the laser intensity for increasing wind speed and hence amount of spray droplets above the water surface. A simple regression model to extract spray volume from the average intensity of the laser radiation is presented, demonstrating the promise of laser altimeters for making in-situ spray observations. Additional observations will be required to calibrate the altimeters for applications in the open ocean marine environment...|$|E
40|$|Improved {{understanding}} of the physical mechanisms that control air-sea gas transfer will ultimately lead to more accurate models of climate change and global warming. The presence of surfactants on the sea surface influences the free surface behaviour, propagation characteristics of waves and alters the near-surface turbulent length and velocity scales. These effects are thought to inhibit surface renewal and therefore reduce the rate of air-water gas and heat transfer [Saylor et al. 2000]. A number of laboratory experiments in wind-wave tanks {{have shown that the}} presence of a surfactant results in significant reductions in the air-water gas transfer rate [e. g. Zappa et al. 2001]. In this study, we completed a series of experiments in a <b>wind-wave</b> <b>flume</b> at the University of Washington, Seattle. Measurements were made at wind speeds from 4 to 10 m/s with clean and surfactant contaminated water. Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) was used to measure the two dimensional turbulent velocity fields beneath the air-water interface. Bulk gas transfer velocities were measured during these experiments for two gases, He and SF 6. The wind waves were damped {{in the presence of a}} surfactant as expected. The DPIV data was used to study the characteristics of the wind drift layer and near-surface turbulence.

A modified technique of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to obtain turbulent pulsation averaged velocity fields of the air flow over the water surface curved by a wave and average profiles of the wind velocity. The main modifications are: 1) the use of high-speed video recording (1000 - 10000 frames/sec) with continuous laser illumination helps to obtain ensemble of the velocity fields in all phases of the wavy surface for subsequent statistical processing; 2) the development and application of special algorithms for obtaining form of the curvilinear wavy surface of the images for the conditions of parasitic images of the particles and the droplets in the air side close to the surface; 3) adaptive cross-correlation image processing to finding the velocity fields on a curved grid, caused by wave boarder; 4) using Hilbert transform to detect the phase of the wave in which the measured velocity field for subsequent appropriate binning within procedure obtaining the average characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{laboratory}} study of the response of waves to an opposing wind are presented. The {{study was conducted in}} a special purpose <b>wind-wave</b> <b>flume</b> which allowed mechanically generated waves to propagate in opposition to wind. The mechanically generated waves were created by a wedge wave maker for which an extensive set of measurements were performed to determine its transfer function. A wave follower which could hold pressure and velocity probes a fixed distance above the moving water surface was designed and constructed. Extensive evaluation experiments indicated that the wave follower tracked the water surface with little error in the frequency range of interest. The transfer functions of all intermediate devices in the pressure and velocity recording systems were determined and subsequently used to correct all pressure and velocity records. Measurements of the wave induced pressure at various heights above the waves-indicated that the pressure and water surface were 180 º out of phase, consistent with the predictions of potential flow theory. Such a result indicates that there is no air-water energy flux due to normal stresses. Measurements of the velocity field above the waves indicated that the Reynolds stress term -p ǖǖ can cause waves to decay in an opposing wind. The magnitude of the decay is proportional to the wave slope squared and the term (1 - U ∞/C) squared. Hence, high frequency waves will decay far more rapidly than low frequency waves. Typical results indicate that low frequency ocean swell is almost uneffected by opposing winds whereas high frequency wind waves will be attenuated very rapidly...|$|E

The maximum vertical distance a wave may travel up a phics. coastal structure, known as the wave sunup height, {{is an important factor in}} determining the crest elevation of a revetment. When the wave sunup height exceeds the crest height of the structure, the overtopping rate becomes an additional design factor of great significance for coastal structures.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper a {{modified}} vorticity-based model for gas transfer under breaking waves {{in the absence of}} significant wind forcing is presented. A theoretically valid and practically applicable mathematical expression is suggested for the assessment of the oxygen transfer coefficient in the area of wave-breaking. The proposed model is based on the theory of surface renewal that expresses the oxygen transfer coefficient as a function of both the wave vorticity and the Reynolds wave number for breaking waves. Experimental data were collected in wave flumes of various scales: a) small-scale experiments were carried out using both a sloping beach and a rubble-mound breakwater in the wave flume of the Laboratory of Harbor Works, NTUA, Greece; b) large-scale experiments were carried out with a sloping beach in the <b>wind-wave</b> <b>flume</b> of Delft Hydraulics, the Netherlands, and with a three-layer rubble mound breakwater in the Schneideberg Wave Flume of the Franzius Institute, University of Hannover, Germany. The experimental data acquired from both the small- and large-scale experiments were in good agreement with the proposed model. Although the apparent transfer coefficients from the large-scale experiments were lower than those determined from the small-scale experiments, the actual oxygen transfer coefficients, as calculated using a discretized form of the transport equation, are in the same order of magnitude for both the small- and large-scale experiments. The validity of the proposed model is compared to experimental results from other researchers. Although the results are encouraging, additional research is needed, to incorporate the influence of bubble mediated gas exchange, before these results are used for an environmental friendly design of harbor works, or for projects involving waste disposal at sea...|$|E

In cases where the fetch is short or the storm duration is short, so that large waves cannot develop, it was found that the wind dominated the surge response behaviour of the platform. In the cases where large waves were allowed to develop, the response was not governed by the action of the wind, but the dynamic action of the wind did contribute to the total surge response.

While momentum fluxes are estimateddirectly through the eddy correlation method in a station about {{the middle of the}} tank, they provide informationcorresponding to rather short non-dimensional fetch not previously reported. Wave evolution along the tank isdetermined through a series of wave gauges, and the wind-induced surface drift is obtained at one of the firstmeasuring stations {{at the beginning of the}} tank. At each experimental run very low wind was on (about 1 m/s) fora certain period and suddenly it was constantly accelerated to reach about 13 m/s (as well as 8 and 5 m/s duringdifferent runs) in about 15 sec to as long as 600 sec. The wind was kept constant at that high speed for 2 to 10 min,and then suddenly and constantly decelerate to 0. Data from the constant high winds provided us with referenceequilibrium conditions for at least 3 different wind speed. We, nevertheless, focus in the recordings while windwas being constantly accelerated expecting some contribution to the understanding of gustiness, the implied windwave growth and the onset of surface drift. Wind-wave growth is observed to lag behind the wind stress signal,and furthermore, a two regime wind stress is noticed, apparently well correlated with a) the incipient growthand appearance of the first waves and b) the arrival of waves from the up-wind section of the tank. Results ofnon-dimensional wave energy as a function of non-dimensional fetch represent an extension of at least 2 decadesshorter non-dimensional fetch to the wave growth curves typically found in the literature. The linear tendency ofwave growth compares very well only when wind is reaching its maximum, while during the accelerated windperiod a lower non-dimensional wave energy is found.
