50|$|His {{research}} on writing examines how <b>writer-reader</b> interaction shapes writers’ writing processes and development. Nystrand’s social-interactive model of writing, in which text meaning is neither (a) {{found in the}} writer’s intentions, which, according to cognitive models of writing, the writer “translates” into text, nor (b) embodied in the text itself, as proposed in such formalist accounts of exposition as Olson’s doctrine of autonomous text. Rather, texts are said merely to have a potential for meaning, which is realized only in use, for example, when a text is read (even by the writer). This meaning is dynamic, which is to say, it evolves {{over the course of}} reading, a view consistent with Bakhtin, Fish, and Rommetveit; it is not exactly the same from reader to reader or even from reading to reading; and it is entwined with the cultural and ideational assumptions readers bring to the text. This {{is not to say that}} readers completely determine the meaning of the text; instead, whatever meaning is achieved is a unique configuration and interaction of what both writer and reader bring to the text. Because meaning is not encoded in the text itself, writers do not achieve explicitness by saying everything in autonomous texts. The writer’s problem in being explicit is not saying everything—a sure-fire recipe for being tedious and boring. Indeed, the writer’s problem is knowing just which points need to be elaborated and which can be assumed. This in turn depends on what readers already know, or more specifically on what the writer and reader share. Explicitness is consequently not a text phenomenon but rather a social-interactive, or dialogic one. Hence, skilled writers anticipate what Bakhtin terms “responsive understanding” at each point of their composing.|$|E

São histórias contadas pelas próprias professoras, por meio de depoimentos, e contextualizadas no seu presente pelas observações de aulas de leitura, pretendendo com isso verificar pelas histórias de leitura dessas professoras se aquele que forma leitores na escola é leitor. Através dos depoimentos as professoras falam da trajetória de leitura percorrida por elas desde a infância até o momento em que foram convidadas a falar sobre esta trajetória. Falam também da escola e do descontentamento com a profissão. Se por um lado os depoimentos mostraram o envolvimento das professoras com a escrita ao longo de sua vida, por outro as aulas complementam os depoimentos mostrando esse envolvimento com a leitura também sob o ponto de vista profissional, ou seja, enquanto aquele que pretende formar leitores. 	Ao lado dos depoimentos das professoras foram colocados outros: o de pessoas que escreveram e publicaram suas histórias de leitura - escritores-leitores que muito contribuíram para minha própria história e que mostram em seus relatos como se tornaram e permaneceram leitores -' o meu, enquanto história de quem conviveu com muitas das situações apresentadas pelas professoras e que hoje se considera leitora. As condições de leitura apresentadas pelos escritores-leitores, o posicionamento dos autores citados nesta pesquisa sobre o que sejam a leitura e as condições de ser leitor vão de encontro à situação apresentada pelas professoras sujeitos desta pesquisa. As circunstâncias de vida e de trajetória de leitura apresentadas por elas; a forma como concebem a leitura e como conduzem suas aulas; a falta de acesso ao livro e/ ou similares e de tempo para utilizá-los, atualmente, constituem elementos que me levaram a entender que muitas destas professoras estão situadas na categoria de não-leitores. Abstract: This study {{deals with}} the history of reading of {{portuguese}} language teachers in elementary public scools in Teresina - Piauí. These are histories told by the teachers' themselves through interviews, and viewed within the context during which the teachers work with the objetive to verify if the teachers who teach reading in public school are also readers. During the interviews they were asked to teU their reading phases since their chilhood until that present time. They also talked about the school and their insatisfaction with their profession. If on one hand, the interviews showed the teachers involvement with writing through the course of their lives, on the other hand the classes also complemented those interviews showing the involvement with reading from the teachers' point ofview, that is, by those that intended form readers. The result of these interviews were compared with histories published by some other authors - which influenced the author and contributed very much to my own history. They showed in their interviews how they become and continued to be readers. As one who lived through many of the situations presented by the subjects. I considered myself a reader. The condition of reading presented by the <b>writer-readers,</b> {{the point of view of}} the authors cited in this research about what is a roading, and the condition about being a reader are in disagreement with the stuidies presented by the subjects in this research. The life circunstance and the phase of reading presented by the subjects; the way how they conceive reading and how they teach; the lack of access to book, and/or similars, and the time to use them, at present contitute data which leads to the understanding that many of these teacher are situated in the category of non-readers...|$|R

40|$|Writers {{achieve an}} {{appropriate}} <b>writer-reader</b> relationship in business prose not by merely switching {{from their own}} to the reader’s viewpoint but by artfully interweaving multiple rhetorical and linguistic elements. The <b>writer-reader</b> relationship is expressed through the many possible combinations of vision and voice, which originate in the textual identities of the implied writer, the implied reader, and, some-times, other characters. By combining multiple visions and voices, writers create what Bakhtin called intentionally hybrid, internally dialogic language that fulfills a social purpose by reflecting human rela-tionships even when the subject matter is impersonal and technical. You-attitude is but one instance of such language and {{is not always the}} best choice.

The particular focus is on recent monolingual work in the area of evaluation/appraisal theory (Martin and White 2005) and on the deictic positioning of writer/reader as expressed in pronoun choice and naming. Detailed examples are discussed from government documents and sensitive political propaganda (from Hugo Chávez and Barack Obama), leading to the suggestion, for future research, that there are certain key risk points which are most sensitive to intervention from the translator...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis set {{of eleven}} articles, by {{linguists}} from four different European countries {{and a variety}} of theoretical backgrounds, takes a new look at the discourse functions of a number of English connectives, from simple coordinators (and, but) to phrases of varying complexity (after all, the fact is that). Using authentic spoken and written data from varied sources, the authors explore the ways in which current uses of connectives result from the interaction of syntax, semantics and prosody, both over time and through diversity of discourse situations. Most adopt an integrative approach in which speaker-listener or <b>writer-reader</b> relationships are viewed as {{part and parcel of the}} linguistic properties of each marker.

40|$|In the past, we {{were taught}} to think that writing and reading were two {{separate}} skills and the writer {{was more important than}} the reader because he or she was seen as an active composer of messages while the reader was seen only as a passive receiver of these messages This has changed because in academic writing, {{the focus is on the}} active <b>writer-reader</b> relationship.

The aim of this paper is to examine and understand how the writer (ESL student) and the reader (lecturer) relationship in academic writing can be improved if their shared knowledge of the assigned text increases.

40|$|The {{view that}} {{academic}} writing is persuasive is now widely accepted. Exactly {{how this is}} achieved, however, is more contentious, and raises {{a number of important}} issues, not least of which are those concerning the relationship between reality and accounts of it, the efficacy of logical induction, and the role of social communities in constructing knowledge. These topics have been debated for years in epistemology and the sociology of science, and in the past decade applied linguists have also entered the fray. Corpus linguists have been particularly active in emphasising the importance of rhetoric in academic persuasion, and, in this chapter, I bring my own small contribution to the discussion. In particular, I look at what differences in disciplinary discourses tell us about the ways academic knowledge is socially constructed, focusing on interpersonal features of language. I am interested in what this tells us about writers’ ideas of appropriate <b>writer-reader</b> relationships and how this, in turn, contributes to knowledge-making in the disciplines (Hyland & Bondi, 2006) ...|$|E
40|$|Academic writing, {{much like}} {{any other kind of}} writing, is only {{effective}} when writers use conventions that other members of their community find familiar and convincing. Essentially the process of writing involves creating a text that we assume the reader will recognise and expect, and the process of reading involves drawing on assumptions about what the writer is trying to do. It is this <b>writer-reader</b> coordination which enables the co-construction of coherence from a text. Scholars and students alike must therefore attempt to use conventions that other members of their discipline, whether journal editors and reviewers or subject specialist teachers and examiners, will recognise and accept. Because of this discourse analysis has become a central tool for identifying the specific language features of target groups. In this paper I draw on my own work, conducted over several years into research and student genres, to show how some familiar conventions of academic writing are used in different disciplines and what these differences can tell us about the work in the disciplines themselves. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{metadiscoursal}} components of academic texts, through which writers organise, interpret and evaluate content matter, provides one means of examining {{the relationship between}} writer and reader. This paper explores one grammatical feature of metadiscourse, clauses with an anticipatory it and extraposed subject (as in ‘It {{is interesting to note}} that no solution is offered’). This feature is compared in two computerised corpora of text, one consisting of published journal articles from the field of Business Studies and the second of MBA student dissertations written by non-native speakers of English. It-clauses are found to have four main interpersonal roles in hedging, marking the writer's attitude, emphasis, and attribution. The main differences between the two corpora are in the use of it-clauses to persuade readers of the validity of claims, with student writers making an apparently greater and more overt persuasive effort, and stating propositions more forcefully. Proposals are made on why this might be the case, taking into account the different <b>writer-reader</b> relationships in journal articles and dissertations.

It investigates the writers ’ capability to deploy the propositional discourse and interpretations in a coherent and convincing way appropriate to the projected readers ’ comprehensive abilities. A small-scale sample of 80 ‘discussion ’ and ‘conclusion ’ chapters constitutes this corpus. This small-size corpus aligns with the contemporary trends in corpus-based work in the fields of English where smaller, more focused corpora, which have been set up for a specific research or pedagogical purpose, {{are much more likely to}} yield insights that are directly relevant to teaching and learning for specific purposes. Using Hyland's (2005) interpersonal model of metadiscourse, the discussion and conclusion chapters have been compared to examine the influence of intercultural and local institute academic culture contexts on the writers ’ use of interactive metadiscourse devices.

Three linguistic resources – interactant pronouns, questions, and directives – are looked at in a corpus totalling 334 short argumentative essays produced by Iranian EFL writers (at two proficiency levels of high and low and two test versions of Academic and General) and British A-level students. The texts are analyzed using specially devised analytical frameworks and with the help of WordSmith Tools, a corpus analysis software. The results reveal that both language groups use the three linguistic devices for fairly similar purposes, indicating the generic similarities in the writings of both groups of students. The findings, however, show noticeable quantitative differences: the British students use questions more frequently than the Iranian students, whereas the Irania...|$|E

Numerous {{studies have focused on}} research articles across different disciplines and cross-culturally. However, little research has been carried out into the students’ research report, from a developmental perspective and in a different language from English. To address this gap, we are reporting on a longitudinal study that aimed to characterize the transition of the academic register and the interactional function from university to scientific publication. The research focus is twofold: (1) it examines the academic register by means of lexical diversity, syntactic complexity and lexical density, and (2) it examines and compares the distribution of stance and engagement markers across stages. The data (N = 16) consists of university master’s theses written in Catalan (Romance language) and published articles in English, in the discipline of immunology, written by the same eight subjects.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the set of skills and {{strategies}} associated with managing digital publics online represent an emergent literacy practice of importance to literacy researchers and educators. Drawing on two case studies of online communities popular with contemporary youth to learn, play, and socialize, we articulate how youth participants strategically negotiate multiple audiences online with varying levels of publicity {{in order to achieve}} learning outcomes. In one case, players of a popular production-centered video game share their content in ways that garner the specific kind of audience and feedback they need for their projects. In another, members of an online fan fiction community analyze and negotiate expectations of their audience in order to craft media that garners attention and sustains readership. Both examples identify how skills centered on navigating and managing publics – that is, multiple audiences that are permeable across a wider public online – constitute a recognizable and important “new literacy” in digitally mediated learning environments. We situate our empirical studies in sociocultural theories of learning and historicize the work in contemporary digital cultures and the general move from the <b>writer-reader</b> relationship to writer-audience relationships to more complex relationships within digital publics.

The case study involves news reports and analytical articles that represent explicit and implicit {{evaluation of the}} North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The investigation {{is based on the}} principles of the media linguistic approach and suggests the structural peculiarities of a media image that can be analyzed as a three-sided unit including positive, negative and neutral structural elements of image introduction into a media text. The NATO's image can be viewed as that of a geopolitical actor, creating its Natoland. Certain media topics are analyzed as creating positive and negative images of the NATO as a military organization. A finite list of positive and negative constituents to the Alliance's image is presented in the paper. It is assumed that the simplistic <b>writer-reader</b> model of interaction shapes certain elements of a media image that can be interpreted by a reader. The author distinguishes in the paper the principle constituents of an international organization in general, and the NATO in particular. Findings of the study demonstrate that the NATO's media image is interpreted by the readers as the conceptual entity of two key images: a peacemaker and a hawk that are restored on lexical and intertextual levels. ...|$|E
40|$|Summary of the {{doctoral}} dissertation Interpersonality Strategies in International Student Handbooks Written by Native Speakers of English (NSE) and Non-native Speakers of English (NNSE) Tesis doctoral presentada por: Stan McDaniel Mann Valencia, 2014 	Have you ever read a brochure or handbook written in English by a non-native speaker of English (NNSE), {{noticed that the}} grammar and syntax was excellent and the terminology was near-perfect, but you still {{did not understand the}} essence of what the author was trying to communicate, or you had the feeling that the information was ambiguous? It was precisely for these two reasons that this research on interpersonality strategies was carried out. Through this analysis it is hoped to contribute to explaining why international student handbooks written by NNSE do not persuade effectively enough and do not establish a proper <b>writer-reader</b> relationship, which are precisely two of the main goals of interpersonality. Interpersonality is also referred to as interactional metadiscourse or interpersonal metadiscourse, and all three terms are used interchangeably throughout this study. 	Since the term metadiscourse was coined over 50 years ago, the definitions for it have continuously evolved. Metadiscourse may be broadly described as overtly expressing the writer´s acknowledgement of the reader (Dahl, 2004, p. 1811). There are two classifications of metadiscourse, textual metadiscourse and interactional metadiscourse. For this study, interactional metadiscourse has been chosen due to its focus on establishing a close <b>writer-reader</b> relationship. 	Hyland and Tse´s (2004) model of analysis proved to be the most reliable for this study {{due to the fact that}} it was the first classification of interactional metadiscourse markers with 5 main interactional metadiscourse categories: hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and self-mentions, each category with its corresponding subcategories for a more precise classification and analysis. The main objective was to see the difference of interpersonal metadiscourse usage between NSE and NNSE authors of international student handbooks. The corpus for this study consisted of 50 international student handbooks written by NSE authors, 10 handbooks from 10 different universities from the following NSE countries: USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, and Australia, and 50 handbooks written by NNSE authors, 10 handbooks from 10 different universities from the following NNSE countries: France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, and Japan. A total of 31, 989 interpersonal metadiscourse markers from NSE handbooks were classified and analyzed, and a total of 12, 948 interpersonal metadiscourse markers from NNSE handbooks were classified and analyzed. 	This study was rather unique in that, unlike the vast majority of the previous research performed on interpersonal metadisdourse which was done on the genre of the research article, it was focused on the business-academic genre of international student handbooks. 	For the statistical analysis, the obtained data was submitted to SPSS, and the ANOVA and T-tests were run. For the percentage analysis, percentages were computed for the main categories and subcategories of interactional metdisdourse. Significant and highly significant differences were discovered and discussed. On a general level, NNSE authors used a total of 10. 03...|$|E
40|$|Building on {{previous}} studies that suggest notable differences between levels {{of writing and}} disciplines, this study investigates stance devices across two parameters: disciplinary differences and academic level of the writer. It investigates disciplinary differences in terms of <b>writer-reader</b> interactions {{in the domain of}} academic writing and how disciplinary communities employ stance markers in research articles. This study also examines what strategies student writers and academics employ in terms of identity within their own writing and how these writers convey their ideas and present themselves. Based on a corpus of 39 academic research articles, this comparative study, following Hyland 2 ̆ 7 s (2005 a) framework, explores whether four categories of stance features (hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions) show any similarities and differences across the disciplines of Civil Engineering and Applied Linguistics and student and expert writing. The results showed that student writing featured more stance markers than those written by academics, although the differences were small. Moreover, the results revealed cross-disciplinary differences in terms of the frequency of stance markers. The Applied Linguistics research articles contained more stance markers than those in Civil Engineering with a large discrepancy particularly in the use of self-mentions. Findings from this research may help inform student writers and writing instructors about the use of stance markers in academic research articles and help particularly students promote their way of presenting their opinions and themselves in the text...|$|E
40|$|Abstract While {{earlier studies}} {{examined}} reader comprehension, this {{paper in the}} field of written healthcare communication focuses on potential reader response for original English and translated German patient information leaflets (PILs) and hence patient behaviour. For that purpose the cultural dimension of Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) as a measure of controlling future events following Hofstede (2001) was examined. Hofstede’s study reveals a markedly higher UA index for Germany than for the UK. For this paper UA was defined in terms of analytical criteria which include aspects of epistemic and deontic modality, <b>writer-reader</b> relation and external role relation (ERRO), (causal) explicitation, as well as degrees of explicitness and subjectivity, and explicit uncertainty markers (EUMs). The translation corpus consists of two sections (one informative and one instructive) from 10 PILs (9, 659 words) for medicines treating hypertension and insomnia, taken from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The findings show matching values for the analytical criteria in the English source text PILs and the German translated PILs to a considerable extent, albeit a higher frequency of explicit uncertainty markers and causal explicitation, and a somewhat higher degree of objectivity in the German PILs. These results, and the paucity of translation shifts for the analytical criteria, may, however, partly be attributed to close translation practice which otherwise transpires in literally translated, unidiomatic phrases in the German PILs. This may raise questions of suitability of translation practice for reader response and patient behaviour with written healthcare communication, notably also for texts in more culturally diverse language communities. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Evaluative {{stance is}} {{constructed}} through the syntactic and lexical choices a writer makes {{to express the}} writer’s attitude, establish and maintain <b>writer-reader</b> relationships and organise discourse. The APPRAISAL theory (Martin & White, 2005) within Halliday’s (1994) Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) {{is one of the}} approaches to explore the ways interpersonal meanings are expressed, and therefore is commonly applied when researching evaluative aspects of language use. Despite the large body of work done on APPRAISAL, there remains a paucity of research focusing on a range of APPRAISAL resources deployed by L 1 English writers and Hong Kong L 2 English writers. Based on a corpus of 60 academic argumentative essays, the present study applied the APPRAISAL systems to conduct a Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (Granger, 1993; 1996) to compare and contrast the evaluative stance construed in L 1 and L 2 texts. The findings show significant differences in the use of evaluative resources between L 1 and L 2 essays in the two writing tasks. L 1 English writers shifted from GRADUATION resources when discussing a positive topic to ENGAGEMENT resources when addressing a negative issue. In contrast, Hong Kong L 2 English writers demonstrated a consistent and heavy reliance on resources of ATTITUDE in argumentative writing. The underuse of certain evaluative resources draws attention to the need for making the full range of these resources available for L 2 learners. Future academic writing research is expected to take a contrastive corpus-based approach as well as a functional instead of a pragmatic perspective when corpus linguistics and SFL are more closely aligned. published_or_final_versionApplied English StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in Applied Linguistic...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are to {{investigate}} the interactive strategies of the translators in the genre of popular science and the potential influence of translation practice on nontranslated popular science writings. The theoretical framework of interaction in written texts and translations is based on work on text-linguistics, pragmatics, discourse analysis, and target-oriented and inter~ctional translation studies. The theoretical framework of the relationship between translations and non-translations draws mainly from polysystem theory and other empirical studies. The investigation is based on corpora comprising texts from Scientific American magazine (English and Chinese editions) and Academia Sillica Balanced Corpus of Modem Chinese. This corpus-based methodology is adopted to facilitate the observation of recurrent patterns of Interactive trends in a large body of texts. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are involved. Whereas quantitative analysis points out trends of interaction based on numerical evidence, qualitative analysis focuses on contextualised factors and seeks to explain the interactive phenomena. The textual findings of interactive patterns are then further supported by paratextual evidence. The study finds that the Chinese translators of popular science writings tend to take an active approach in mediating the gap between source text writers and target readers. The translators use more interactive strategies than the source text writers to involve the readers in the texts. Another important finding is that, based on the use of selected interactive features, we suggest that the Chinese popular science writings have been influenced by the interactive strategies used by the'translators; and have begun to show trends of more active <b>writer-reader</b> interaction which are not seen in iraditional popular science writings in Taiwan.

30|$|This {{paper has}} offered a slight {{adjustment}} of the taxonomy of attitudinal invocation sub-types proposed by Martin and White (2005), proposing that classificatory weighting {{be given to the}} distinction between, on the one hand, resources which rely entirely on the reader referencing and applying attitudinally-charged cultural/communal frames (Evoke) and, on the other hand, resources which involve some overt signalling in the text that an attitudinal value is at stake (Provoke). The proposed array also notes that these resources should not be seen as a typology, but rather considered as overlapping sets of mechanisms or text-strategies in context. My reasoning arises from the observation that there is a notable rhetorical difference between utterances where the writer relies on the reader to make an attitudinal inference (evoking) and utterances where the reader is given signals that an attitudinal value is being offered (provoking). With respect to my concern regarding the enactment of textual persona, this distinction is critical given that the more a writer relies on evocation, the more they construe a relationship of affiliation and axiological alignment with the intended/putative reader. For the same reason, engagement resources and the co-positioning of addressees have been shown to operate in activating or invoking attitude as well. Furthermore, as indicated earlier, the use of either invoked negative or positive assessments can be used to gather whether audience members are construed as in-group members or not. In this way, particular textual personae will be construed according {{to the extent that the}} writer does assume such ‘solidarity’ with readers, and according to the particular value positions (via particular attitudinal assessments) of specific targets, and for which such <b>writer-reader</b> alignment is assumed. This two-way Evoke versus Provoke taxonomy is thus also designed to support the analysis of textual persona in that it facilitates tracking of the degree to which and the contexts in which the writer projects this ‘like-minded’ reader.|$|E
40|$|By reading mournful poems rhetorically, I {{expand the}} concept of the elegy in order to reveal continuities between private and {{communal}} modes of mourning. My emphasis on readers of elegies challenges writer-centered definitions of the elegy, like that given by Peter Sacks, who describes how the elegy's formal conventions express the elegist's own motives for writing. Although Sacks's Freudian approach helpfully delineates some of the consoling effects that writing poetry has on the elegist herself, this dissertation revises such writer-centered concepts of the elegy by asking how elegies rhetorically invoke ethical relationships between writers and readers. By reading elegiac poems through Kenneth Burke's rhetorical theories and Emmanuel Levinas's ethics, I argue that these poems characterize, as Levinas suggests, subjectivity as fundamentally structured by ethical relationships with others. In keeping with this ethical focus, I analyze anthology poems, meaning short lyric poems written by acclaimed authors, easily accessible, and easily remembered - including several well-known poems by such authors as Emily Dickinson, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Robert Frost. Anthology pieces invite ethical evaluation in part because they represent what counts as valuable poetry - and also, by implication, what does not. Because anthology poems are read by broad, diverse audiences, I suggest that a rhetorical methodology focusing on <b>writer-reader</b> relationships is essential to evaluating these poems' ethical implications. This rhetorical approach to poetry, however, questions rhetoricians and aesthetic theorists from Aristotle and Longinus to Lloyd F. Bitzer and Derek Attridge who emphasize distinctions between rhetoric and poetics. I address the ongoing debate about the relationship between rhetoric and poetics by arguing, along the lines of Wayne C. Booth's affirmation that fiction and rhetoric are interconnected, that poetry and rhetoric are likewise integrally tied. To this debate, I add an emphasis on philosophy - from which Plato, Ramus, and others exclude rhetoric and poetry - as likewise essential to understanding both poetry and rhetoric. By recognizing the interrelatedness of these disciplines, we may better clarify poetry's broad, ethical appeals that seem so valuable to readers in situations of loss...|$|E
40|$|Distance education, and {{therefore}} the writing of distance materials, is a growing field in South Africa. This makes it potentially a site of innovation and change as writers experiment with ways of creating effective teaching situations at long range. The Fort Hare Distance Education Project materials {{seem to be a}} response to both the increased need for teacher upgrade programmes and the need for innovation to tailor those programmes to the needs of local teachers in a changing society. This innovative attempt to communicate with tertiary distance students has unusual features which suggest that they are worth investigation. Using discourse analysis, including the work of Scollon and Scollon on politeness theory, and an analysis of visual elements using categories developed by Kress and van Leeuwen, this study focuses on 18 pages of a sample text, booklet 9, “A Whole Language Approach,” to investigate how the <b>writer-reader</b> relationship and the identity of the reader are constructed. The analysis reveals a complex, interlocking construction of identity and relationship, producing and resolving apparent contradictions as writers move from one position to another while they negotiate their ongoing and evolving relationship with the readers. Features of identity and relationship operating through the text include issues of authority, changing roles of teachers and learners, trust, what constitutes appropriate language and materials, acknowledging prior learning in under-qualified professionals, ownership of the text, hierarchy and egalitarianism, and stereotyping. The study suggests that the Fort Hare Distance Project materials offer an example of strategies suited to local students which should benefit those who design such courses. It further suggests that visual analysis together with discourse analysis provides insights which seem not to be accessible through a study of the verbal text, and that an analysis of visual elements may widen a researcher’s options. It reveals ways in which writers can negotiate conflicting positions and consciously or unconsciously attempt to resolve contradictions and ambivalence. It suggests issues which need to be negotiated in any text written in South Africa for a similar audience...|$|E
40|$|The Bronco Chase {{and arrest}} of O. J. Simpson {{for the murder}} of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman, and his {{subsequent}} criminal trial {{became one of the most}} captivating, mass-mediated events of the last decade of the twentieth century. Simpson's iconic celebrity status and his race as an African-American inflamed the notoriety of the crime. An insatiable spectatorial desire for Simpson and narratives concerning his alleged involvement in the Brentwood murders engulfed the American public and American culture for thirty-two months. An excessive scrutiny of his identity by the media, law and order professionals and the populace generated a racially charged discursive cacophony. The memoir Simpson published during his remand to raise funds for his defense expenses, I Want to Tell You: My Response to Your Letters, Your Messages, Your Questions, allows for a productive critical study of everyday rhetoric and the commodity fetishism of celebrity. Released in late January 1995, during the first week of the prosecution's opening statements in the criminal trial, I Want to Tell You was Simpson's first public comment following the nationally televised reading of his suicide note and his spectacular arrest on June 17, 1994. The intercalation of Simpson's narrative utterance with 108 of the more than three hundred thousand letters he received from June to December 1994 as Los Angeles County Jail inmate 4013970 is a practical manifestation of the use value and exchange value of fame. The reciprocity of the epistolic, the phatic demands of address, the etiquette of fan mail and hate mail, the gift of the written text, vulnerable and resonant, reveal an adherence to the symbiotic dynamic of the celebrity-fan, <b>writer-reader,</b> dyadic relation and its currency. Plying his trade as idol of consumption, as spectacle, as genre, Simpson capitalised on the cultural condition of his name and his face as objects of desire. The racialised flesh of Simpson's African-American male body became a site and a sight for narrative and inscription within a pay-per-view marketplace of reification, prosopopoeia, gazeability and criminality...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} the discursive strategies {{related to the}} <b>writer–reader</b> textual reciprocity. I focus on one way of achieving such reciprocity [...] the employment by the writer of facilitative schematic structures and metalanguage where one text segment signposts information conveyed in the segment that follows. I refer to these facilitative schematic structures as "organising relational schemata". I see organising relations as the most explicit components of the rhetorical structure of texts: they illuminate the main message and aid the reader 2 ̆ 7 s cognitive processes in the orientation of how information is conveyed by text. This paper discusses the way the choices of organising relations and associated metalanguage by the writers in different cultures and different discourse communities contribute to the communicative homeostasis {{in the world of}} text. It shows how the influence of a native culture and intellectual style together with the forces operating within the writer 2 ̆ 7 s international disciplinary community interact in the authorial guidance in the scholarly prose. I introduce and exemplify three types of organising relational structures: Advance Organisers, Introducers and Enumerators. I trace the utilisation of these three types of relations in sociology research papers written in English and produced in "Anglo" and Polish academic discourse comunities by native English speaking and native Polish speaking scholars. The relational typology adopted is based on a study by Golebiowski (2002), which proposed a theoretical framework for the examination of discoursal structure of research papers, referred to as FARS – Framework for the Analysis of the Rhetorical Structure of Texts. FARS entails a relational taxonomy which displays a pattern of rhetorical relations utilised by the writer to achieve textual coherence. I describe intertextual differences in the frequency of occurrence of organising relations, their degree of explicitness and their positioning in the hierarchical structure of texts. Differences in the mode of employment of textual organisers suggest that the rhetorical structure of English research prose produced by non-native speakers cannot escape being shaped by the characteristics and conventions of the authors’ first language. They are also attributed to cultural norms and conventions as well as educational systems prevailing within the discourse communities which constitute the social contexts of texts. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Bilge Karasu (1930 - 1995), a {{prominent}} figure in Turkish literature, reached readers {{with his first}} novel Night (1985) after his exquisite short story books such as Troya’da Ölüm Vardı (1963), Uzun Sürmüş Bir Günün Akşamı (1970) and Göçmüş Kediler Bahçesi (1979). Night, which occupies {{a special place in}} the contemporary Turkish literature and among the author’s other works, was awarded the Pegasus Prize in 1991, but it has not been sufficiently studied and criticized until then. Because of its multi-layered structure, its style of handling the text-author-reader interaction, and its dissimilarity to traditional novels, the text has been labeled as “hard”. In this thesis, we carefully analyze in detail the “meta-fiction” and “fiction” frames in Night, as well as the connections between them, a task not undertaken earlier. We observe that because it interferes with the characters’ discourse, the discourse of the writer, which manifests itself at the meta-fiction level {{at the beginning of the}} text, becomes fictionalized and loses its authority. By means of handling the form and the content simultaneously, we also attempt to explain, how the reader is ushered into the text and how s/he is characterized there. The purpose of this thesis is not to present a definitive interpretation of the text, but to reveal its pattern of plural meanings within the framework of the <b>writer-reader</b> interaction. At the end of the thesis, we observe that the darkness, which has risen constantly in the first, second, and third sections of the text, has left itself to “night” at the last section. We understand that Night has a fictitious writer who produces a meta-discourse as he fictionalizes, and in the end, it breaks into pieces like a mirror fallen on the ground. The last words of the text, reveals and fictionalizes the “author” who sets up this “breaking into pieces”. This “author” employs the same techniques on his readers, which the “oppressors” narrated in the text use on others in order to pacify them. Therefore, the reader becomes a character of the text.

40|$|The {{birth of}} cyber {{literature}} {{is something that}} cannot be avoided. It was born by utilizing the facilities provided by cyber space. This situation is enriched by the fluid nature of digital media that serve as the medium of information dissemination. One of the social media is Facebook. The such social media as a two-sided objects, {{on the one hand}} it can be used for good thing and on the other it can be used for evil (cyberbully for instance). It depends on which side people will use it. The research found that Facebook as one of the media of cyber literature is very popular with the reasons: a) it is easily accessible, b) authors and readers can interact directly, c) interaction between fellow readers is easy to do, d) it is a means of socializing with authors and readers, e) available public groups and closed groups, and f) special conversations can be made through inbox. However, Facebook is also not free with weaknesses. For example, Facebook can be misused among other: a) to cheat, b) to bully, c) to spread hoaxes, and d) to provoke. Maybe this is because Facebook cannot distinguish between the original account and the fake one. Profile picture is sometimes not identic with the owner. Cyber literature is mediated by technology of computer. The technology has triggered the interest of many authors to allow their motivation and creativity to make use the space (internet wall). In some cases, both printed publication and cyber publication have differences and similarities. But the presence of media technology has changed the way of view and barriers of the world so far. The era of technology (internet) has at least shifted the perspective and attitude of the people about the importance of documenting a literary work. Through the internet space, the literary documentation becomes easy. It is just like a book or any pieces of literature that can be recorded as source of document where the writer and reader can look them back at what they have written. The research concluded that facebook can be a medium of cyber literature with unlimited space. This opportunity has been exploited by poet writers to introduce their works. In turn, literary learners can appreciate cyber literature through facebook with a <b>writer-reader</b> interactivity. The theory belongs to reader response of literary text. Cyber Literature is a term known since the coming of the internet which brings a convenience, changing habit and world view. This study is a survey-based on respondents' opinion about the existence of cyber literature on social media; of its benefit and impact to the reader. This study limits to the poems on Facebook group. The reason is simple; it favors the short form. For the study of a reader-writer interactivity in cyber literature is more likely on poetry. The approach is reader response literary theory with focus on the reader-writer interactivity on Facebook. This research aimed at uncovering the motivation of readers to response the uploaded text, the reasons why they love it and what its advantages. The results showed that cyber literature is successfully to introduce a new literary genre as well as to raise motivation and creativity of authors to make use the internet space...|$|E
