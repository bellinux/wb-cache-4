5|$|Beverley {{inherited}} a large estate after his father's death in 1722, and continued speculating in land. He received income from tobacco production and rent from tenant farmers. Although by 1745 Beverley's estate produced 57 hogsheads (about 26,000kg) of tobacco, the income from his 119 tenants in Caroline, Culpeper, Orange and King and Queen Counties <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more lucrative.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{percent of}} the English adult male {{population}} is estimated to have died during the war, a rather large percentage by most standards. The impact on the Native Americans <b>was</b> <b>far</b> higher, however. So many were killed, fled, or shipped off as slaves that the entire Native American population of New England fell by sixty to eighty percent.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the first}} {{discovered}} millisecond pulsar, with a rotational period of 1.557708 milliseconds, meaning it completes almost 642 rotations per second. This period <b>was</b> <b>far</b> shorter than astronomers considered pulsars capable of reaching, {{and led to the}} suggestion that pulsars can be spun-up by accreting mass from a companion.|$|E

5|$|Such vast cargoes {{would be}} carried by boat {{as far as}} possible, by sea and/or river, and only the {{shortest}} possible distance overland.

5|$|The {{original}} proposed {{opening of}} the line was on 28 October 1850 by Thomas Farncombe, Lord Mayor of London, but the line <b>was</b> <b>far</b> from complete by this time and so the ceremony was postponed. A second proposed opening date of 1 January 1851 was rejected due to signaling problems.|$|E

5|$|The smog was {{compared}} to the 1948 smog in Donora, Pennsylvania and the Great Smog of London of 1952, both of which lasted five days. The London smog's death toll of 4,000 <b>was</b> <b>far</b> higher than Donora, but the smog in Donora <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more severe; {{at the time of}} its smog, Donora was a small industrial town with a population of only 13,000, and its population was proportionally hit much harder with 20 deaths and smog-related illnesses among 43 percent of the population. Pollution experts estimated that if a smog as strong as the Donora smog had occurred in the much more populous New York City, the death toll could have been as high as 11,000 with four million ill.|$|E

5|$|There {{seems to}} only be one known example of extreme marital strife in Tolkien's mythology, that of Eöl and Aredhel, {{in which the}} latter {{actually}} left the former without his knowledge, resulting in Eöl ultimately killing her (albeit he was actually trying to kill their son Maeglin).

5|$|With an {{increasing}} Third World presence {{and the failure}} of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East, Vietnam, and Kashmir, the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange.

Abovian's influence on Western Armenian literature was not as strong as it was on Eastern Armenian, particularly in its formative years.|$|E

5|$|After Wilson's {{temporary}} departure during Houses fifth season, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times immediately {{stated that}} she wanted the character {{to return to the}} show. Linda Stasi of The New York Post said that Dr. House's relationship with Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston), who temporarily replaced Wilson, <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more natural than House's relationship with Wilson. Critics from TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, Blog Critics and USA Today, all found Leonard's performance in the season 4 finale worthy of an Emmy Award.|$|E
5|$|Although Elizabeth Johnson {{was mistaken}} about the Pike village site, her mistake is {{held to be}} a {{fortunate}} one. The Webster County site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting. The Republic County site was not entirely pristine, due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation; but it <b>was</b> <b>far</b> better preserved. Today, the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site, built in 1967 {{over one of the}} excavated earth lodges.|$|E
5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more than the vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as {{the power of the}} tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E

5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France would never accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} similar casualties {{during the}} previous day. Russian victories gave their artillery a clear line of fire into the suburbs of Czyste and Wola. They also strengthened the morale of Russian soldiers, who were convinced that the battle was over once Fort 54 fell. The battle <b>was</b> <b>far</b> from lost for the Polish side though: although the Russians could now attack the third line of Polish defences in Wola (Forts 23 and 24) or Czyste (Forts 20–22), their attacks could easily be flanked by forts of the second line still in Polish hands. Also, {{in order to support}} the advance with artillery, the Russian guns would have to be stationed in open field.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he <b>was</b> <b>far</b> more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E
