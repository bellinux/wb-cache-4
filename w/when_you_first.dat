500|$|According to Yorke, Radiohead {{hoped to}} achieve an [...] "atmosphere that's perhaps a bit {{shocking}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> hear it, but only as shocking as the atmosphere on the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds." [...] They expanded their instrumentation to include electric piano, Mellotron, cello and other strings, glockenspiel and electronic effects. The exploratory approach was summarised by Jonny Greenwood as [...] "when we've got what we suspect to be an amazing song, but nobody knows what they're gonna play on it." [...] One reviewer characterised OK Computer as sounding like [...] "a DIY electronica album made with guitars".|$|E
500|$|Harrison married Hetty Cary in 1894. They {{had four}} children: three daughters, Ursula, Constance, and Sally, and a son, Richard. He {{was a member}} of the Episcopal Church. [...] Harrison was {{described}} as [...] "physically imposing", and gray-haired in his middle age. Harry DeButts, an employee and protégé, described him as [...] "a little cold <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> met him, but underneath he was a very warm, admirable, capable and wise man". He died on February 2, 1938, of heart disease, and was buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia. [...] On the day after Harrison's death, the New York Times carried his obituary, but instead of a photograph of Harrison, the picture that ran with the obituary was of John Jeremiah Pelley, the president of the Association of American Railroads, who was still alive.|$|E

500|$|Fazekas said that, [...] "Whitney is used {{to people}} {{treating}} her {{with a certain amount}} of deference, because she’s a famous actress, and she’s met her match in Peggy." [...] She added that in the series, [...] "You see the makings of a villain, but she doesn't start off evil. She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not a bad guy <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> meet her." [...] Fazekas additionally noted how the sexist themes of the times were handled, by showing [...] "that the only way Whitney Frost felt she could exert power in the world was through her husband, because she had been told her whole life, 'Nobody cares how smart you are, they care about how pretty you are.'" [...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend. And like many friends and family, you end up , but he’s always there ... he knows I can do what I say I can do, especially in the science world. So he’s really the only one who gets me." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{think the}} way the game is written is that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> start playing it, it is fun, and you make great accomplishments. And then the further you get into it, the higher level you get, the longer {{you have to stay}} on it to move onward, and then it isn't fun anymore. But by then you're addicted, and you can't leave it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The siting of the {{homestead}} on its flood-free position enabled {{management of the}} land from then onwards. Early writers commented on {{the homestead}}'s siting {{and the beauty of}} its setting. It was [...] "very prettily situated on a hill overlooking a grassy margined lake of considerable size, surrounded by high hills, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> catch sight of it, you naturally say, 'well, this takes a lot of beating'. And so it does, for beauty of landscape". A second wrote, [...] "This well-known station home...is beautifully situated on a rise overlooking the Herbert, just before that river takes its plunge down the scrub-clad gullies {{to the level of the}} coast".|$|E
2500|$|The {{legacy of}} Buechner's time in Bermuda has, however, {{manifested}} {{in other respects}} in his writing and in his life. [...] While he often refers to {{the natural beauty of}} Bermuda's island landscape—the [...] "unutterable, blinding blue-green flash of the ocean" [...] and its [...] "unkempt greenness"—and its idyllic island charms—the [...] "narrow-gauge Toonerville Trolley of a railway with wicker armchairs for seats" [...] and the pastel houses [...] "with their blinding white roofs stepped to catch the rain"—the distinctly British flavor of pre-World War II Bermuda also instilled in him an enduring love of English custom and culture. [...] Amidst the sounds and textures Buechner recalls from his days in Bermuda, he writes of [...] "the sound and feel of English money—the heavy coppers and florins and half crowns that weighed down your pockets, the thin little sixpences and threepenny bits, the pound notes with the King's picture on them." [...] Traces of the United Kingdom were all around him: [...] "I remember the public library with a park behind it where a British regiment called the Sherwood Foresters gave band concerts underneath a huge India rubber tree, and a bookstore that smelled the way a new book printed in England does <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> open it." [...] That smell, [...] "faintly like nutmeg, dry, erudite," [...] stayed with Buechner the rest of his life. Details from the island's celebration of the coronation of George the Sixth—for which Buechner and his classmates [...] "helped drag brushwood {{to the top of a}} hill for a bonfire" [...] and went around [...] "lighting bonfires on all the hills in Bermuda"—appear throughout his memoirs. [...] Thus, in The Eyes of the Heart, Buechner recalls the [...] "royal governor who on state occasions such as the coronation of George VI wore a cocked hat with white plumes on it like the captain of the Pinafore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} not," [...] Matteo said. [...] "I had never dreamt of {{doing more than}} {{recovering}} the Pluto, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> talked about that, it seemed almost like madness.

6000|$|... "It was a distinction, my dear Dorian--a great distinction. Most {{people become}} {{bankrupt}} through having invested too {{heavily in the}} prose of life. To have ruined one's self over poetry is an honour. But <b>when</b> did <b>you</b> <b>first</b> speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?" ...|$|R
