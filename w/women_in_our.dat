25|$|When Qabbani was 15, his sister, who was 25 at the time, {{committed}} suicide because {{she refused to}} marry a man she did not love. During her funeral he decided to fight the social conditions he saw as causing her death. When asked whether he was a revolutionary, the poet answered: “Love in the Arab world is like a prisoner, and I want to set (it) free. I want to free the Arab soul, sense and body with my poetry. The relationships between men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society are not healthy.” He is {{known as one of}} the most feminist and progressive intellectuals of his time.|$|E

Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test, an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, [...] "Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society." [...] She {{has been the subject of}} many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as first lady and has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers. Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her, including but not limited to [...] "The Hillary Shimmy Song", which went viral.|$|E

But {{this is not just a}} 'pop album,' it's a woman holding forth on the role of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society, how they should approach the nuances of their life and most importantly, how they can choose to value relationships... That isn't just the work of a diva, that is the work of a political figure." ...|$|E

500|$|Bush {{first became}} {{involved}} with The Heart Truth awareness campaign in 2003. It is an organization established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to raise awareness about heart disease in women, and how to prevent the condition. She serves in the honorary position of ambassador for the program leading the federal government's effort to give women a [...] "wake up call" [...] {{about the risk of}} heart disease. She commented on the disease: [...] "Like many women, I assumed heart disease was a man's disease and cancer was what we would fear the most. Yet heart disease kills more <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> country than all forms of cancer combined. When it comes to heart disease, education, prevention, and even a little red dress can save lives." [...] She has undertaken a signature personal element of traveling around the country and talking to women at hospital and community events featuring the experiences of women who live, or had lived, with the condition. This outreach was credited with saving the life of one woman who went to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E

2500|$|For women, {{artists such}} as Missy Elliott, Lil' Kim, and others are {{providing}} mentorship for new female MCs. In addition, there is a vibrant scene outside the mainstream that {{provides an opportunity for}} women and their music to flourish. Rap music has the power to influence how we view black <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society. Queen Latifah used her award-winning song [...] "U.N.I.T.Y." [...] to support to other women and to inform of the presence of women in the hip hop genre. However, many contemporary females in hip hop do not embody this mindset and counteract it.|$|E

The new letter written by Mayor Tom Bates and Council members Max Anderson, Linda Maio and Darryl Moore affirmed [...] "the recruiters' right to locate in our city {{and the right of}} others to protest or support their presence." [...] The new letter also stated that Berkeley did not support [...] "the recruitment of our young people into this war" [...] but [...] "deeply respect and support the men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> armed forces."

She was, however, not singular in this respect, since the practice of such self-denial is, unfortunately, not a very unusual thing {{in the case of a}} good many young <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> cities who work remarkably hard.

60|$|There {{were many}} who believed, {{because there were}} no <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> midst, we should spare our labor in the way of keeping cleanly, and before we had been in the new village a week, the floors of many of the {{dwellings}} were littered with dirt of various kinds, until that which should have been a home, looked more like a place in which swine are kept.|$|E
