If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it <b>will</b> <b>lie</b> {{down on top of}} the nest and try to blend in with the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I <b>will</b> <b>lie</b> to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E

25|$|Multivariate {{modeling}} {{can give}} {{answers to questions}} about the genetic relationship between variables that appear independent. For instance: do IQ and long-term memory share genes? Do they share environmental causes? Additional benefits include the {{ability to deal with}} interval, threshold, and continuous data, retaining full information from data with missing values, integrating the latent modeling with measured variables, be they measured environments, or, now, measured molecular genetic markers such as SNPs. In addition, models avoid constraint problems in the crude correlation method: all parameters <b>will</b> <b>lie,</b> as they should, between 0–1 (standardized).|$|E

25|$|Modern {{excavation}} techniques {{require that}} the precise locations of objects and features, known as their provenance or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see Primary Laws of Archaeology). Likewise, their association, or relationship with nearby objects and features, needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which artifacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different phases of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its stratigraphy; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures <b>will</b> <b>lie</b> above those from more ancient cultures.|$|E
25|$|Late 20th century domestic/studio models {{typically}} use up to 200 latch-hook needles to {{hold the}} stitches in fine, standard, mid-gauge or bulky gauge needle. A carriage or cam box is passed across the bed of needles causing the needle movements required to produce each next stitch. By means of various selection methods, e.g. punch cards, particular needles can be caused to travel by alternate pathways through the cam box. Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions <b>will</b> <b>lie</b> under (slip stitch) or over the needle or {{be held in the}} needle hook (tuck stitch). Needles can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping. In the most modern machines, punchcards have been replaced by computer control.|$|E
25|$|A {{stallion}} {{will defend}} his group from other males. When challenged, the stallion issues {{a warning to}} the invader by rubbing nose or shoulder with him. If the warning is not heeded, a fight breaks out. Zebra fights often become very violent, with the animals biting at each other's necks, heads or legs, wrestling to the ground, and occasional kicking. Sometimes a stallion <b>will</b> <b>lie</b> still {{on the ground as}} if surrendering, but once the other male lets up, will strike and continue the fight. Most fighting occurs over young mares in estrus, and as long as a harem stallion is healthy, he will usually not be challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then the new stallion gradually takes over pushing the old one out without a fight.|$|E

If v1 is outside the triangle, the only way vn will land on the actual triangle, is if vn is on what would be part of the triangle, if the triangle was infinitely large.|$|E
25|$|This method {{consists}} of precisely measuring a star's {{position in the}} sky, and observing how that position changes over time. Originally, this was done visually, with hand-written records. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, this method used photographic plates, greatly improving the accuracy of the measurements as well as creating a data archive. If a star has a planet, then the gravitational influence of the planet will cause the star itself to move in a tiny circular or elliptical orbit. Effectively, star and planet each orbit around their mutual centre of mass (barycenter), as explained by solutions to the two-body problem. Since the star is much more massive, its orbit will be much smaller. Frequently, the mutual centre of mass <b>will</b> <b>lie</b> within the radius of the larger body. Consequently, it is easier to find planets around low-mass stars, especially brown dwarfs.|$|E
25|$|Even the {{youngest}} children quickly learn that, {{with varying degrees}} of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a reasonable man in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed <b>will</b> <b>lie</b> in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability {{to the extent that the}} extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.|$|E
