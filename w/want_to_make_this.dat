25|$|Devastated {{to report}} that Blur won't be {{performing}} at BDO in 2014. It's a shock that {{it has come to}} this. Only 8 weeks to go, the band feels that with the constantly shifting goalposts and challenging conditions of the organisers, they can't let it drag on any longer and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> announcement, to be clear to Blur fans that they won't be there. We've done our very best to work with the organisers and considered every option to make it happen, but they've let us down and let everyone else down too.|$|E

According to Bill Mechanic, the former head of 20th Century Fox, [...] "John wanted me to make Battlefield Earth. He had Scientologists all over me. They come up to you and they know who you are. And they go, 'We're really excited about Battlefield Earth.'" [...] This did not impress Mechanic: [...] "Do you think in any way, shape, or form that weirding me out is going to make me <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> movie?" ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Glen Schofield {{stated the}} biggest {{challenge}} the developers were facing was [...] "just trying to match the breathtaking {{look and feel of}} the movies". Similarly, Neil Young said [...] "We wanted to make something that's authentic and true to the movie. The people on our team really care about making a game that aspires to more than just a sequel, they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> equivalent to the movie experience itself." [...] EA Redwood Shores worked closely with New Line Cinema to make the games as authentic as possible, using the actual reference photos, drawings, models, props, lighting studies and motion capture data.

500|$|Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a biopic of Ed Wood when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Alexander even proposed making a documentary about Wood, The Man in the Angora Sweater in his sophomore year at USC. However, Karaszewski figured, [...] "there would be no one on the planet Earth who would make this movie or <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> movie, because these aren't the sort of movies that are made." [...] Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films for their work on Problem Child and Problem Child 2, Alexander and Karaszewski wrote a 10-page film treatment for Ed Wood and pitched the idea to Heathers director Michael Lehmann, with whom they attended USC film school. The basis for their treatment came from Rudolph Grey's Nightmare of Ecstasy, a full-length biography, which draws on interviews from Wood's family and colleagues. Lehmann presented their treatment to his producer on Heathers, Denise Di Novi. Di Novi had previously worked with Tim Burton on Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns and The Nightmare Before Christmas, and a deal was struck with Lehmann as director and Burton and Di Novi producing.|$|E
500|$|In November 2014, Disney Animation {{commenced}} a 16-month upgrade of the Roy E. Disney Animation Building, {{in order}} to fix what Catmull had called its [...] "dungeon-like" [...] interior. For example, the interior was so cramped {{that it could not}} easily accommodate [...] "town hall" [...] meetings with all employees in attendance. [...] Disney did not disclose the renovation's cost, but Lasseter revealed that [...] "he whole center of the second floor will have an atrium that will go up two stories we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> building so beautiful that it's worthy of the artistic talent that's there." [...] In addition, it was revealed that the large sorcerer's hat would become the building's main entrance. Lasseter stated, [...] "There will be a gorgeous stairway that goes up into the hat, it's a really great symbol like you're entering the building through the magic of Mickey Mouse's hat." [...] Due to the renovation, the studio's employees were temporarily moved from Burbank into the closest available Disney-controlled studio space– the DisneyToon Studios building in the industrial park in Glendale and the old Imagineering warehouse in North Hollywood under the western approach to Bob Hope Airport (the Tujunga Building). Director Don Hall analogized the studio's relocation to the end of The Empire Strikes Back, where [...] "you know they're going to get back together." [...] The renovation was completed in October 2016.|$|E
2500|$|J. Baldwin {{was a young}} {{designer}} and instructor of design at colleges around the San Francisco Bay (San Francisco State University , the San Francisco Art Institute, and the California College of the Arts [...] ). As he recalled in the film Ecological Design (1994), [...] "Stewart Brand came to me because he heard that I read catalogs. [...] He said, 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> thing called a [...] "whole Earth" [...] catalog so that anyone on Earth {{can pick up a}} telephone and find out the complete information on anything. ...That’s my goal.'"

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, on {{the other}} hand, thought it was [...] "the best of the recent {{roadshow}} musicals... Since The Sound of Music, musicals have been... long, expensive, weighed down with unnecessary production values and filled with pretension... Finian's Rainbow is an exception... it knows exactly where it's going, and is getting there as quickly and with {{as much fun as}} possible... it is the best-directed musical since West Side Story. It is also enchanting, and that's a word I don't get to use much... it is so good, I suspect, because Astaire was willing to play it as the screenplay demands... he... created this warm old man... and played him wrinkles and all. Astaire is pushing 70, after all, and no effort was made to make him look younger with common tricks of lighting, makeup and photography. That would have been unnecessary: He has a natural youthfulness. I particularly <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> point because of the cruel remarks on Astaire's appearance in the New York Times review by Renata Adler. She is mistaken." ...|$|E
2500|$|I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> {{absolutely}} clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And {{the charges}} of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor {{involved in this case}} admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone. The person that made these accusations against me changed her story about what happened that night every single time she told it. So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't blame them for that – there isn't a guide book to follow in a situation like this. They made it clear to me that they needed to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it would be best for me to focus on my defense. It hurt at the time, but I knew I did have to focus on defending myself.|$|E
2500|$|In October, at age 14, Douglas {{moved into}} the home of Missy Parton in West Des Moines, Iowa, to train under Liang Chow, the former coach of 2007 World Champion and 2008 Summer Olympics gold {{medalist}} Shawn Johnson. Although Douglas' former coach, Walker, stated in 2012 that she was convinced Douglas could {{have made it to}} the Olympics if she had remained in Virginia Beach, Douglas said, [...] "Something clicked in my head that said, if I really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> happen I need to get better coaching." [...] The impetus for Douglas's move to Iowa was when Walker had invited Chow to teach a clinic at her gym, Excalibur. Douglas was impressed when Chow was able to teach her how to perform the Amanar vault in a single afternoon. Douglas considered a move to Texas to train with a renowned coach there, but after that coach declined to train her out of loyalty to Walker, Douglas selected Chow. Chow was initially skeptical, since Douglas had been just one of hundreds of kids at the clinic in Virginia Beach. However, Chow subsequently informed Douglas's Excalibur coaches that he had agreed to train her, but pointed out that he did not recruit her, saying, [...] "I would never recruit anybody to my program." [...] Later on, Gabby suffered from a hamstring strain and a hip flexor injury in July. She couldn't do much during this time, but this allowed her to improve her bar skills.|$|E
