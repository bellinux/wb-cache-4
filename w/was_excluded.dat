An additional seven patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because the time period between T 0 and T 1 was greater than 12 months, and finally, three patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because other molar distalizing mechanics were used. Gender differences were not considered a factor because treatment was performed in non-growing patients.|$|R

5|$|There were {{restrictions}} in Slovakia on Jews' education, housing and travel, {{and they were}} required to wear a yellow badge. Available jobs went first to non-Jews.

30|$|Fifteen {{patients}} <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> {{from the}} study for various reasons. Seven patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because the device was not successfully placed in the ventricle of the brain. In these cases, there was no ICP waveform or reading associated with the ventricular catheter, therefore comparison to intraparenchymal ICP was not possible. Three patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because of difficulty with insertion and suspected rupture of the parenchymal balloon. There was no intraparenchymal waveform or ICP reading, and comparison to ventricular ICP was not possible. Three patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because of unavailability of the investigator for study enrollment or data collection. Two patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because of death within four hours of device insertion and inability of investigator to collect data. As a result, 35 patients were successfully enrolled.|$|R
30|$|Four hundred eighty-seven people {{completed}} the online survey. Three surveys <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> as duplicates, based on IP address and content.

5|$|According to Stratton and Martin, {{movement}} is the game's most important pillar. To help keep movement fast, weapon reloading <b>was</b> <b>excluded</b> and levels {{were designed to}} discourage players from hiding. On January 25, Stratton confirmed the game's feature of non-linear exploration and stated that combat is the game's focus and that {{the difficulty of the}} game was raised with the aim of creating an ultimate first-person shooter. On March 31, 2016, the release date of the Doom beta, a cinematic trailer directed by Joe Kosinski was created to evoke the game's three core pillars: incessant combat, terrifying demons, and powerful guns.|$|E
5|$|After the 1962 World's Fair and {{introduction}} of the Seattle Center Monorail, a proposal was drawn up by fair organizers to extend the system to the airport. The plan, supported by Governor Albert D. Rosellini, was ultimately rejected by incoming Governor Daniel J. Evans in favor of completing Interstate 5. The Forward Thrust rapid transit plan, which was rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included Sea-Tac Airport in its long-term plans for service; the airport <b>was</b> <b>excluded</b> from the first phase because of possible changes brought by airport expansion and the Supersonic Transport program.|$|E
5|$|Although Brunei first {{participated in}} the Summer Olympics in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, it was only {{represented}} by one official. It would not be until the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States that the country would send athletes to the Games. Since then, it has participated in six Summer Olympic Games between its debut and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The country was the sole member of the International Olympic Committee {{not to participate in}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing; it had intended to do so, but <b>was</b> <b>excluded</b> {{on the day of the}} opening ceremony after failing to register any athletes. No Brunei athlete had ever won a medal at the Summer Olympics before the 2016 Rio Games.|$|E

50|$|This list is {{far from}} complete. Many {{countries}} <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from it because their Industry Associations lacked a searchable, online database. Belgium, Iceland and Mexico are some of them. Some European countries who do have it (Greece, Hungary and Spain) <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> anyway, because their databases showed no relevant sales pertaining industrial rock and metal groups. Latin American countries with online databases (Argentina and Brazil) <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> over the same principle.|$|R
30|$|Reports {{dealing with}} {{patients}} suffering from craniofacial syndromes or developmental disorders <b>were</b> <b>excluded.</b> Those including only primary dentition <b>were</b> as well <b>excluded.</b> The reports taking {{the rates of}} third molar missing cases (without presenting any information to filter third molars out) <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> (V Rakhshan, unpublished work).|$|R
5|$|Although, the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad had no {{political}} power the office {{continued to be}} held by the second Nawab Bahadur Syed Wasif Ali Meerza Khan Bahadur, who had held the office since 1906, and {{after his death in}} 1959, he was succeeded by his son, Syed Wasif Ali Meerza Khan Bahadur. Waris Ali Meerza died in 1969, survived by his three sons and three daughters. According to the Nawab’s law, the eldest son of the Nawab succeeded him, however, Waris Ali's eldest son, Wakif Ali Meerza Bahadur, <b>was</b> <b>excluded</b> from the succession by his father for contracting a non-Muslim marriage and for not professing the Muslim religion.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, shows it {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This {{is confirmed by}} {{a map of the}} island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street <b>was</b> <b>excluded</b> from the lot of the Truman Annex, and disconnected from the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on new land.|$|E
5|$|In Linz, Kepler's primary {{responsibilities}} (beyond {{completing the}} Rudolphine Tables) were {{teaching at the}} district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague—though he <b>was</b> <b>excluded</b> from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler {{had to deal with}} the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina in the Protestant town of Leonberg. That blow happening only a few years after Keplers excommunication is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.|$|E

5|$|Nevinson {{studied at}} the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks and {{alongside}} Stanley Spencer and Mark Gertler. When he left the Slade, Nevinson befriended Marinetti, {{the leader of the}} Italian Futurists, and the radical writer and artist Wyndham Lewis, who founded the short-lived Rebel Art Centre. However, Nevinson fell out with Lewis and the other 'rebel' artists when he attached their names to the Futurist movement. Lewis immediately founded the Vorticists, an avant garde group of artists and writers from which Nevinson <b>was</b> <b>excluded.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 2008, Del Piero won his 90th cap for Italy in {{friendly}} against Austria under Lippi, becoming {{only the}} fifth Italy player {{to reach this}} landmark at the time. Despite announcing his intention to carry on playing {{until the age of}} 40, he <b>was</b> <b>excluded</b> from Lippi's 2010 FIFA World Cup squad. Del Piero's final appearance for Italy came in a 2–0 win against Georgia in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier on 10 September 2008; he came on for Di Natale in the 56th minute and later set up Daniele De Rossi's second goal of the match.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January 1940, Northcott became acting Chief of the General Staff (CGS) {{following}} the death of Lieutenant General Ernest Ker Squires. In August, his successor, General Sir Brudenell White, died in an air crash and Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee succeeded him. The post of commander of the 8th Division thereby became available but Northcott <b>was</b> <b>excluded</b> from consideration because his knowledge was vital to the new CGS. When the commander of the 9th Division, Major General Henry Wynter, fell ill in January 1941, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey asked for Northcott to replace him, but Northcott was involved in organising the 1st Armoured Division and the appointment instead went to Brigadier Leslie Morshead.|$|E
30|$|The {{eligible}} {{clinical trials}} for inclusion were all controlled randomized studies that evaluated the efficacy {{and safety of}} GT-based chemotherapy for MBC patients. The studies included gemcitabine additional roles to taxanes and gemcitabine replacement roles to other non-taxane drugs.
