5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, <b>with</b> <b>elements</b> of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Sevastopol, Hitler felt Manstein was the right man to command the forces at Leningrad, which had been under siege since September 1941. <b>With</b> <b>elements</b> of the 11th Army, Manstein was {{transferred}} to the Leningrad front, arriving on 27 August 1942. Manstein again lacked the proper forces to storm the city, so he planned Operation Nordlicht, a bold plan for a thrust to cut off Leningrad's supply line at Lake Ladoga.|$|E

5|$|Brown Sugar is {{the debut}} album of American R singer and multi-instrumentalist D'Angelo. It was {{released}} on July 4, 1995, by EMI Music. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1994 to 1995 at Battery Studios and RPM Studios in New York City and at the Pookie Lab in Sacramento. Production, instrumentation, arrangements, and songwriting were primarily handled by D'Angelo, who employed both vintage recording equipment and modern electronic devices. Brown Sugar contains themes of love and romance, and features a fusion of contemporary R and traditional soul music, along <b>with</b> <b>elements</b> of funk, quiet storm, and hip hop music.|$|E

Gottesman testified that genes influenced IQ, but only in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>elements</b> such as schooling, money, and nutritious food from childhood onwards. In 2003, he and colleagues published a study showing that heritability was higher for IQ differences within high socioeconomic status (SES) people than among low SES people, i.e., genes influenced differences between children's test scores more among high SES than among low SES children.|$|E

This version (a draft was written by Alan Ormsby, but it was later re-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation <b>with</b> <b>elements</b> of a love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, {{making it to the}} final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15million and rejected Dante's version.|$|E
5|$|Kingsbury's {{actions were}} {{a turning point}} in the battle. The Japanese had begun to gather {{momentum}} in their attack, and were threatening to overrun the 2/14th's headquarters. His attack inflicted damage to the Japanese force, temporarily halting their advance. This allowed the Australian troops to stabilise their positions, eventually regaining control and defending the battalion's headquarters. His act of bravery served as an inspiration to the troops. However, the battle ended in defeat for the Australians, <b>with</b> <b>elements</b> of the 2/14th breaking during the afternoon of 29 August.
