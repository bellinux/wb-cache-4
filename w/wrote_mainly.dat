25|$|In 1953, {{his last}} major {{historic}} study, Prelude to World War II, was published, about the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. As a historian, he <b>wrote</b> <b>mainly</b> about recent and contemporary history, {{but was also}} noted for his studies of the medieval Italian commune. His The French Revolution: 1788–1792 is an outstanding explanation of the social, political and philosophical currents (and monarchical incompetence) that led to that cataclysm.|$|E
25|$|Born in {{the town}} of Hampden, Maine, she grew up first in Worcester, Massachusetts. She was the first child of three born to Joseph Dix and Mary Bigelow, who had deep ancestral roots in Massachusetts Bay Colony. Her father was an {{itinerant}} worker as a Methodist preacher. At the age of twelve, she sought refuge with her wealthy grandmother, Dorothea Lynde (wife of Dr Elijah Dix) in Boston to get away from her alcoholic parents and abusive father. About 1821 Dix opened a school in Boston, which was patronized by well-to-do families. Soon afterward she also began teaching poor and neglected children out of the barn of her grandmother's house, but she suffered poor health. It has been suggested that Dorothea suffered from major depressive episodes, which contributed to her poor health. From 1824 to 1830, she <b>wrote</b> <b>mainly</b> devotional books and stories for children. Her Conversations on Common Things (1824) reached its sixtieth edition by 1869. Her book The Garland of Flora (1829) was, along with Elizabeth Wirt's Flora's Dictionary, one of the first two dictionaries of flowers published in the United States. Other books of Dix's include Private Hours, Alice and Ruth, and Prisons and Prison Discipline.|$|E
25|$|Gli indifferenti was {{published}} {{at his own}} expense, costing 5,000 Italian lira. Literary critics described the novel as a noteworthy example of contemporary Italian narrative fiction. The next year, Moravia started collaborating with the newspaper La Stampa, then edited by author Curzio Malaparte. In 1933, together with Mario Pannunzio, he founded the literary review magazines Caratteri (Characters) and Oggi (Today) and started writing for the newspaper Gazzetta del Popolo. The years leading to World War II were difficult for Moravia as an author; the Fascist regime prohibited reviews of Le ambizioni sbagliate (1935), seized his novel La mascherata (Masquerade, 1941) and banned Agostino (Two Adolescents, 1941). In 1935 he traveled to the United States to give a lecture series on Italian literature. L'imbroglio (The Cheat) {{was published}} by Bompiani in 1937. To avoid Fascist censorship, Moravia <b>wrote</b> <b>mainly</b> in the surrealist and allegoric styles; among the works is Il sogno del pigro (The Dream of the Lazy). The Fascist seizure of the second edition of La mascherata in 1941, forced him to write under a pseudonym. That same year, he married the novelist Elsa Morante, whom he had met in 1936. They lived in Capri, where he wrote Agostino. After the Armistice of September 8, 1943, Moravia and Morante took refuge in Fondi, {{on the border of}} Ciociaria; the experience inspired La ciociara (The Woman of Ciociara, 1958).|$|E

500|$|Alfred William Pullin, {{known by}} the {{pseudonym}} Old Ebor (30 July 1860– 23 June 1934), was a British sports journalist who wrote primarily about rugby union and cricket. He <b>wrote</b> <b>mainly</b> for British newspapers the Yorkshire Post and the Yorkshire Evening Post. Considered by critics {{to be one of}} the greatest authorities in the country on his two sports, he wrote a daily column using his pseudonym [...] "Old Ebor" [...] for 40years.

500|$|Chasing Vermeer is Blue Balliett's first {{published}} book. Its original purpose {{was a book}} to read to her class for fun. She realized that a mystery about [...] "real" [...] art issues had not been written since E.L. Konigsburg's From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and desired to write what she wished to read. Chasing Vermeer took about five years to complete, as Balliett was also a teacher and parent. She compared writing the book to weaving, as she first <b>wrote</b> <b>mainly</b> about art, but then incorporated the pentominoes and classroom scenes, creating many different levels to read on. She admits that it ended up more complex than she had thought it would be.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} 1997's Good Will Hunting, which Affleck co-wrote and acted in, marked {{a turning point}} in his career. The {{screenplay}} originated in 1992 when Damon wrote a 40-page script for a playwriting class at Harvard University. He asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him {{in front of the class}} and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script in earnest. The film, which they <b>wrote</b> <b>mainly</b> during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994 when Affleck was 22 years old. During the development process, they received notes from industry figures including Rob Reiner and William Goldman. Following a lengthy dispute with Castle Rock about a suitable director, Affleck and Damon persuaded Miramax to purchase the screenplay. The two friends moved back to Boston for a year before the film finally went into production, directed by Gus Van Sant, and co-starring Damon, Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams. On its release, Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the [...] "smart and touching screenplay", while Emanuel Levy of Variety found it [...] "funny, nonchalant, moving and angry". Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote that Affleck brought [...] "a beautifully nuanced tenderness" [...] to his role as the working-class friend of Damon's mathematical prodigy character. Affleck and Damon eventually won both the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Affleck has described this period of his life as [...] "dreamlike": [...] "It was like one of those scenes in an old movie when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black on to the screen. You know, '$100 Million Box Office! Awards!'" [...] He remains the youngest writer (at age 25) to ever win an Oscar for screenwriting.|$|E

500|$|Belarusian {{literature}} was formed {{on the basis}} of Old Russian literature, and the process of its separation took place in the 14th–15th centuries. The heyday came in the 16th–17th centuries (the so-called [...] "Golden Age"). Old Belarusian language was the official language of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (ON Statutes 1529, 1566 and 1588, polemical religious literature). Since the beginning of the 16th century, the books in Old Belarusian were printed. The first printed book in the Old Belarusian language – [...] "Psalms" [...] – was published in Prague in 1517 by Francysk Skaryna. It was the first book printed {{in the language of the}} East Slavic group. In the 16th and 17th centuries there was a Baroque syllabic poetry and drama school under the influence of Polish culture (Symeon of Polotsk). In the 18th century numerous wars caused the decay of scholars. The literature gradually fell into disrepair; its revival began in the last quarter of the 17th century, when a professor of Dominican college Kajetan Marashovski wrote the first untitled comedy that featured Belarusian language. Revitalization process of creativity in the Belarusian language continued at the beginning of the 19th century. (Anonymous satirical poem [...] "Taras on Parnassus", the first romantisty: Paŭluk Bahrym and the Polish language poets Jan Barszczewski, Jan Czeczot, Adam Mickiewicz and Alexander Rypiński. Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich was the first author, who <b>wrote</b> <b>mainly</b> in Belarusian. He created of the first Belarusian comedy [...] "Idyll" [...] in 1846. Books were printed mostly using Latin script. In the second half of the 19th century realism was present the works by Francišak Bahuševič, Adam Hurynowicz, Jan Lucyna. New stage of development of Belarusian literature started after 1905 Russian Revolution. In 1906 the first newspapers in Belarusian language [...] "Nasa Dolia" [...] (Our share) and [...] "Nasha Niva" [...] were issued in Vilnius. They united writers who advocated the strengthening of national identity (Maksim Bahdanovič, Sergei Paluyan, Źmitrok Biadula, Maksim Haretski, Yadvigin Sh, Yanka Kupala, Yakub Kolas, Alés Harun, Andrew Ziazulia and others.). Belarusian literature had a syncretic character, combines elements of romanticism and realism, impressionist and modernist. In particular Maxim Bogdanovich developed impressionism and symbolism in Belarusian poetry, Źmitrok Biadula – in prose, Yanka Kupala developed romanticism and modernism in poetry. Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich became the winner of Nobel Prize for Literature 2015. Aleksievich works devoted to the life of the late Soviet and post-Soviet era, imbued with a sense of compassion and humanism.|$|E

6000|$|As {{applied to}} Browning the poems {{represent}} the indignation {{with which he}} regarded such personal revelations, such utterance of sighs and groans, as characterized Byron (the [...] "Last King" [...] of [...] "At the Mermaid"); but they overstate the impersonal nature of Browning's own work which is frequently a very direct statement of his own emotions and views, while even from his dramatic work {{it is not difficult}} to find his [...] "hopes and fears, beliefs and doubts." [...] In stanzas 10-12 of [...] "At the Mermaid," [...] for example, just after he has protested against [...] "leaving bosom's gate ajar," [...] he fully sets forth the joy, the optimism, of his own outlook on life. [...] "Shop" [...] is an indirect protest against the assumption that Shakspere <b>wrote</b> <b>mainly</b> for money, caring merely for the material success of his work. (See Poet-Lore, Vol. III, pp. 216-221, April, 1889, for Browning's tribute to Shakspere.) More directly the poem represents the starved life of the man whom [...] "shop," [...] the business necessary to earn a living, occupies [...] "each day and all day long" [...] with no spirit-life behind.|$|E
60|$|He {{had arrived}} at this extreme before he {{received}} the note from Mrs. Birkwall, which she made his prompt bread-and-butter letter the excuse of writing him. She <b>wrote</b> <b>mainly</b> {{to remind him of}} his promise to stay another day with her husband on his way home through Burymouth; and she alleged an additional claim upon him because of what she said she had made Birkwall do for him. She had made him go down to the freight-depot every day, and see what had become of Phyllis Desmond's piano; and she had not dared write before, because it had been most unaccountably delayed there for the three days that had now passed. Only that morning, however, she had gone down herself with Birkwall; and it showed what a woman could do when she took anything in hand. Without knowing of her approach except by telepathy, the railroad people had bestirred themselves, and she had seen them with her own eyes put the piano-case into a car, and had waited till the train had bumped and jolted off with it towards Mewers Junction. All the ladies of her supper party, she declared, had been keenly distressed at the delay of the piano in Burymouth, and she was now offering him the relief which she had shared already with them.|$|E
