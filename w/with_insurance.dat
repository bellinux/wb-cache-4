25|$|The {{foundation}} Naschet Jenische (literally: arise, Yenish!) {{was established}} in 1986, focussing on the refurbishment and 'reparations' of the injustice perpetrated against the Yenish (Fahrende) people in Switzerland, in particular by the programm Kinder der Landstrasse. In 1988 a fund commission, which regulated the inspection for the affected Yenish people, was established and completed their work in 1992. The inspection of the files of Pro Juventute is governed since then directly by the Swiss Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv). The affected Yenish people received in all 11 million Swiss Francs, {{but not more than}} 20,000 Swiss Francs each. The advice and support of people and families affected by Kinder der Landstrasse is still the main focus of the activities of the foundation. The foundation advises Yenish people in personal, family and social problems, in particular in contacts with the Swiss authorities, and assists in the inspection of personal files. The foundation also supports the search and the reuninicfaction of families. Yenish people are assisted with applications for financial assistance to public and private institutions. Advice can be also invoked in the case of difficulties <b>with</b> <b>insurance</b> and taxes. The consultancy activity is financed by Pro Juventute. Another important part of the foundation's activities are the public relations; Naschet Jenische informs about the history and the current situation in Switzerland and arbitrates contacts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractConclusionThere {{were greater}} {{operative}} mortality rates in uninsured patients for both elective and emergent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Uninsured patients underwent treatment for ruptured AAAs {{more often than}} did patients <b>with</b> private <b>insurance.</b> SummaryThe authors studied whether patients <b>with</b> private <b>insurance,</b> compared <b>with</b> patients with Medicaid or no <b>insurance,</b> differ <b>with</b> respect to outcome of AAA repair and timely access to treatment of AAA. The national inpatient procedure diagnostic codes for AAA repair, intact and ruptured, were examined for 5363 patients younger than 65 years, from 1995 to 2000, with risk-adjusted analyses for access to AAA treatment and outcomes of repair. Dependent variables included in-hospital mortality, ruptured AAA, and intact AAA. Independent variables were comorbid disease, gender, age, race, payer status, and median income. Patients <b>with</b> no <b>insurance</b> or Medicaid {{were more likely to}} have AAA rupture (P <. 001). Patients without insurance were at increased risk for rupture compared with patients <b>with</b> private <b>insurance</b> (odds ratio, 2. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 5 - 3. 5; P <. 001). Operative mortality rates appeared greater after elective AAA repair in patients <b>with</b> no <b>insurance</b> or Medicaid compared with patients <b>with</b> private <b>insurance.</b> Operative mortality rates were also higher after ruptured AAA repair in patients without insurance or Medicaid. CommentAdditional analyses are needed to determine whether patients without <b>insurance</b> or <b>with</b> Medicaid tend to avoid health care because of the financial burden or whether delayed access to surgical treatment results from gate-keeping issues or other deterrents to health care among patients <b>with</b> no <b>insurance</b> or Medicaid...|$|R
