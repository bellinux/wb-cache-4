6000|$|The {{first thing}} was a general chorus of [...] "there goes Bill!" [...] then the rabbit's voice alone [...] "catch him, you by the hedge!"

6000|$|... "Well?" [...] cried my sister, {{addressing}} us both at once. [...] "And <b>what's</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> I wonder <b>you</b> condescend <b>to</b> {{come back}} to such poor society as this, I am sure I do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never waste time," [...] {{said the}} newcomer, promptly. [...] "But <b>what's</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> Where {{did you get}} that donkey head? Really, I wouldn't have known you at all, Shaggy Man, if I hadn't looked at your feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} that I should go through this scene {{by way of a}} joke? I never was so much in earnest in my life before. I am in love with her, I tell you, as much in love as though I had known her for years. <b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with {{reference}} to me has happened to me with reference to her, or something very like it, and marry her I must and will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been an awful scene," [...] she said, and her {{shoulders}} quivered.

[...] "And when I could bear it no longer, I would take your hand and call you by name, and often quiet you thus." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see. Well, {{before you}} decide to go I'd {{like to have a}} little talk with you. My {{daughter}} has told me part of <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> on the trail. I want to know all of it. You're young, but you've been out in the world, and you know what people can say about you and my girl."

5000|$|Spoken while Freamon {{tries to}} persuade McNulty {{to see that}} there is more to life than casework. The line comes from the famous lyrics by John Lennon, [...] "Life is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> while you're busy making other plans." ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{a simple}} science, philosophy. The idea is that it never matters <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{provided}} you don't mind it. The weak point in {{the argument is that}} nine times out of ten you can't help minding it.|$|R

[...] cried that young lady, [...] "where have you been all this time, and <b>what's</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> You look as though you'd lost your last friend." [...] And then noting the shop from which he had emerged and the {{deduction}} being all too obvious, she laid one of her shapely hands upon {{the sleeve of his}} cheap, ill-fitting coat. [...] "You're up against it, kid, ain't you?" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "of course I {{remember}} our arrival at that Gate after the lady {{and the old}} man had pulled us out of the river, and, Horace, talking of spiders reminds me of hanging {{at the end of that}} string of yak's hide. Not that I need much reminding, for I am not likely to forget it. Do you know I cut the rope because I felt that I was going mad, and wished to die sane. <b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> Did you slip?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ye-es,' {{said the}} other, turning full upon him. 'If you {{had told him}} who you were; if you had given him your card, and found out, afterwards, that his station or {{character}} prevented your fighting him, {{it would have been}} bad enough then; upon my soul it would have been bad enough then. As it is, you did wrong. I did wrong too, not to interfere, and I am sorry for it. <b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> afterwards, was as much the consequence of accident as design, and more your fault than his; and it shall not, with my knowledge, be cruelly visited upon him, it shall not indeed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh, {{but he was}} a bad un--I can't {{think as}} there's another such," [...] said Dolly. [...] "But I'm o'ercome, Master Marner; I'm like as if I'd waked and didn't know whether it was night or morning. I feel somehow as sure as I do when I've laid {{something}} up though I can't justly put my hand on it, as there was a rights in <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> if one could but make it out; and you'd no call to lose heart as you did. But we'll talk on it again; for sometimes things come into my head when I'm leeching or poulticing, or such, as I could never think on when I was sitting still." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)" [...] contain the famous Lennon quote [...] "Life is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{while you are}} busy making other plans."

5000|$|The Knesset Ethics Committee censured Plesner in 2011 {{for making}} “insulting and harmful {{comments}} {{that are not}} connected to political stances and public life, but rather an MK’s personal life.” Plesner, during a Haneen Zoabi speech on the Gaza Flotilla, said of Zoabi, “Go to Gaza {{for a week and}} see <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> a single 38-year-old woman.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} seen it, and I never shall see it, because there's no such {{difference}} between us. It isn't the years that make us young or old--who is it says that? No matter, it's true. And I want you to believe it. I {{want you to feel}} that I am your youth--the youth you were robbed of--given back to you. Will you do it? Oh, if you could, I should be the happiest girl in the world." [...] Tears of fervour dimmed the beautiful eyes which looked into his. [...] "Don't speak!" [...] she hurried on. [...] "I won't let you till I have said it all. It's been this idea, this hope, with me always--ever since I knew <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> here long ago--that you might go back in my life and take up yours where it was broken off; that I might make your life what it would have been--complete your destiny--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must hope so," [...] {{the latter}} said gravely; [...] "if we fight on a fair field I have no misgivings whatever. But Merci always takes up strong {{positions}} and entrenches himself, and Enghien is {{so anxious to}} fight that he will do so at a disadvantage rather than wait until we can meet them on even terms. You know what happened at Freiburg, where we lost some nine thousand men and gained no great advantage; while if we had moved round and threatened their line of retreat the enemy must have fallen back at once, we should have obtained our object without {{the loss of a}} man, and might possibly have fallen upon Merci in his retreat, and well nigh annihilated his army. Do not think, Campbell, that I am for a moment underestimating Enghien's genius. It is extraordinary, and in the hour of battle he is superb, not only from his extreme personal bravery, but from the quickness with which he grasps every point, seizes upon the spot where a blow can be best delivered, and snatches victory, where another would see only defeat before him. But he is reckless of life so long as he carries his point, and rather than lose a day in turning the enemy's position and so forcing him to relinquish it, will sacrifice whole regiments by marching straight against the most formidable entrenchments. Had he but patience in addition to his own splendid qualities, I think he would be the greatest military genius the world has ever seen. And now let me hear <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> after you left my side that night after Marienthal." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{central theme}} of many {{religions}} is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> people upon death. Almost all religions are greatly devoted to the afterlife, emphasizing that {{what you do in}} your current life effects <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in the afterlife. This usually takes the form of judgement by a deity, in which ones deeds and characteristics in life determine either punishment or reward (when one has been mostly good).|$|R
