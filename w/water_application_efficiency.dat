40|$|Abstract Adequate {{estimates}} of yields under comparable amounts of infiltrated water of different irrigation systems {{are essential for}} evaluation and adoption of irrigation decisions. A simulation model, crop evapotranspiration and Young's criteria for subjective probability estimates from objective data were used to simulate water management regimes for pressurized and surface-irrigation systems. Historical climatic data, representative soil series and irrigation technologies for CentralArizona were considered in the simulations. Comparable spatial and average yields for drip, graded furrow, level furrow and level basin systems with similar distribution uniformity of applied water were predicted when each irrigation system infiltrates to the same depth in the low-quarter section of the irrigated field as the average of that quarter, to meet seasonal crop evapotranspiration. This implies that a similar fraction of the field (87 · 5 %) is adequately irrigated in each case. Irrigation reuse systems are advisable to achieve comparable, and high, <b>water</b> <b>application</b> <b>efficiencies</b> with furrow systems.

40|$|The use of {{irrigation}} in Nebraska’s soybean production systems has steadily increased {{to the extent}} that irrigated soybean acreage in recent years has accounts for about 45 % of State total soybean acreage. Technological advances in irrigation equipment can greatly improve on‐farm <b>water</b> <b>application</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (with respect to both energy and water). However, producer adoption of these advances is very slow because of the capital expenditures required for irrigation system upgrades. An alternative approach is greater producer adoption and use {{of irrigation}} water management strategies that ensure that water is scheduled and applied in a just‐in‐time fashion, which also optimizes water and energy use efficiency. However, producer adoption of crop irrigation scheduling (IS) methods has also been slow, mainly because of the huge personal time commitment that is generally required to generate the daily updates in a soil water balance sheet, and each field in the farm enterprise requires the creation and daily update of a separate sheet. The only apparent solution to this problem is to create internet-accessible websites that are capable of quickly outputting IS‐based water balance sheets that the producer simply view or print out. Relieving the producer from a daily focus on generating multiple field‐specific daily water balance sheets would likely increase producer adoption of IS methods, simply because producer could now focus instead examining those sheets to determine what specific fields should be irrigated today. The goal of the activities proposed in this project is to provide the Nebraska producer with the means to accomplish that shift in focus...|$|R

Sprinkler and gravity irrigation were compared at the North Platte Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Nebraska. The experimental plots were located in an area on the Northeast corner of the station, known as the Shelby land. The legal description of the area is the south 600 feet of the east ½ of the east ½ of the southeast ¼ of section 16, T 13 N, R 30 W. The soil on the experimental area was a Bridgeport very fine sandy loam. Eight plots, 56 by 500 feet, were used in the experiment. Four plots of Midland milo were irrigated with a portable sprinkler line and four with gated pipe into furrows.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{differential}} irrigation treatments {{on the water}} use of broccoli (c. v. Indurance) and carrots (c. v. Stefano) were studied in the rainy, winter season from July to September 2006 and in the dry, summer period from November 2006 to March 2007, respectively. Broccoli and carrots are produced on the Swan Coastal Plain region on Grey Phase Karrakatta Sand. Such soils generally have water holding capacities as low as 10 to 13 %. This soil is typical to the Swan Coastal Plain and requires irrigation to be applied at rates of up to 150 % of class A pan evaporation (Epan) to optimise growth and quality. High spatial uniformity (an average of 90 %) of water distribution (DU) was achieved with the sprinkler irrigation system. The average irrigation water use efficiencies (Eu) in both the experiments were relatively high, at 78 % and 95 % in broccoli and carrot trials, respectively. The numerous rainy days during the winter season affected the results of <b>water</b> <b>application</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (Ea) of the broccoli experiment, which ranged from 35 % to 43 %. This contrasted with the carrot experiment where the <b>water</b> <b>application</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (Ea) of the 100 % Epan and Crop Factor (CF) treatments were 81 % and 78 %, respectively. For the carrot experiment the <b>water</b> <b>application</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for the 100 % Epan and crop factor treatments were 14 % higher than the 150 % Epan treatment. These {{results indicate that the}} sprinkler irrigation systems in both experiments showed good performance makes the system suitable for experimental purposes and also for vegetable production on soils of this nature. Despite the differences in irrigation volume, soil water contents remained very high and did not differ among treatments in both the experiments. The differential soil water stress index (DSWSI) for the 100 % Epan (T 1) and variable water replacement (VR) (TVR) treatments ranged from 0. 74 to 1. 71 for both broccoli and carrot trials. There were only small soil water tension differences among all the irrigation treatments and ranged from - 2. 4 kPa to - 7. 6 kPa, which was within the range between saturation and field capacity for sandy soil (0 to - 10 kPa). In the broccoli experiment, even though the 150 % Epan (T 2) irrigation treatment received 46 % and 61 % more irrigation than the 100 % Epan (T 1) and variable water replacement (TVR) irrigation treatments respectively, the treatments appeared to be largely negated by the high incidence of rainfall during the growing season. For example, the total depth of <b>water</b> <b>application</b> at 150 % Epan was 13. 9 % and 17. 2 % greater than 100 % Epan and TVR treatments respectively. As such the yield, biomass components and nutritional value (ascorbic acid and carotenoid content) did not vary among the treatments. However, irrigation was still required based on the set scheduling parameters and when considered in isolation of rainfall the irrigation crop water use efficiency (WUEi) on T 1 and TVR treatments increased by 1. 6 -fold compared to T 2 treatment. For the carrot experiment the total depth of <b>water</b> <b>application</b> (rainfall and irrigation) for the 150 % Epan treatment was 33 % and 23 % greater than at 100 % Epan and Crop factor (CF) treatments, respectively. The yield (carrot roots) on a fresh weight basis (FW) for plants irrigated with the 150 % of Epan and Crop factor (CF) treatments were 16 % and 20 % higher than the yield for plants irrigated with the 100 % Epan treatment. Total (root and shoot) fresh weight of carrot plants irrigated For the carrot experiment the total depth of <b>water</b> <b>application</b> (rainfall and irrigation) for the 150 % Epan treatment was 33 % and 23 % greater than at 100 % Epan and Crop factor (CF) treatments, respectively. The yield (carrot roots) on a fresh weight basis (FW) for plants irrigated with the 150 % of Epan and Crop factor (CF) treatments were 16 % and 20 % higher than the yield for plants irrigated with the 100 % Epan treatment. Total (root and shoot) fresh weight of carrot plants irrigated with the CF treatment was 17 % higher than the total fresh weight of plants irrigated with the 100 % Epan treatment. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between irrigation treatments for root and total (root and shoot) mass on a dry weight basis and the ratio of carrot root to shoot, on a fresh and dry weight basis. The root lengths for plants grown with the CF and 150 % Epan irrigation treatments averaged 30 cm, and were 14 % larger than the root lengths for the 100 % Epan treatment. The plant height for plants grown with the CF irrigation treatment was 6 % higher than at the 100 % Epan irrigation treatment and leaf length at the CF irrigation treatment was 12 % greater than at the 150 % Epan irrigation treatment. The root diameter and leaf width of carrots were not significantly different for all treatments. There were no significant differences in ascorbic acid and total carotenoid content of carrot roots among the three irrigation treatments. The average values of antioxidant content from diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging, ARP (anti radical power) and total trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity were 44. 83 %, 0. 8789 and 1. 056 μmol TE/g, respectively. The reduction of the irrigation level treatment from the 150 % Epan water replacement to the 100 % Epan water replacement increased the percentage of the DPPH scavenging by 1. 55 %, and total antioxidant capacity (AOC) and ARP activities by 4. 19 %. On a dry weight basis, the crop water use efficiencies (WUE) (irrigation plus rain water) of carrot plants irrigated with the 100 % Epan and CF treatments, were the same (0. 013 g/mm). However, these were 30 % greater than the WUE values of carrots irrigated with the 150 % Epan treatment. On a fresh weight basis, the WUE of carrot plants irrigated with the 100 % Epan and CF (0. 120 and 0. 132 g/mm) treatments were 14 % and 26 % greater than the WUE of carrot plants irrigated with the 150 % Epan treatment, respectively. An example of the diurnal trends of the carrot’s physiological responses to the irrigation treatments showed that on average, the rate of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and intercellular CO 2 for carrot plants grown with the 150 % Epan treatment was higher than the rate of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and intercellular CO 2 at both the 100 % Epan and CF treatments. However, not all the physiology measurements showed a significant difference among all the treatments. The variation in the physiological measurements was predominantly influenced by the change of temperature during the diurnal hours. This study has proven the hypothesis that, on a free draining sandy soil, the irrigation treatments did not affect the growth and yield. However, there was a potential to reduce irrigation volumes from standard industry levels to maximise the WUE without decreasing the yield and crop quality, especially for broccoli and carrot, in Western Australia...|$|R

40|$|Spate {{irrigation}} is {{a method}} of flood water harvesting, practiced in Dera Ismael Khan (D. I.

A field study on the effect of different pre-sowing <b>water</b> <b>application</b> depths on the yield of wheat was conducted during 2006 - 2007. The spate irrigation command areas normally receive the flood water as a result of rainfall on the mountains during the months of July to September, which also carries a significant amount of sediment load. The flood water flows in different torrents and is diverted through earthen bunds to the fields for irrigation with depth of <b>water</b> <b>application</b> ranging from 21 to 73 cm and resulted in sediment deposition of 1. 8 - 3. 6 cm per irrigation. In this study, the effect on wheat yield of three different pre-sowing <b>water</b> <b>application</b> depths (D 1 45 cm) were studied under field conditions. Fifteen fields with field sizes of about 2 - 3 ha were randomly selected, in each field five samples were collected for analysis of soil physical properties, yield and yield components. Five major soil texture classes (silty clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam and loam) were found in the area with water-holding capacity ranging from 23 % to 36. 3 % (on a volume basis) and bulk density varied from 1. 35 to 1. 42 gcm- 3. About 36 % more grain yield was obtained from loam soil fields, followed by silt loam (24 %) as compared to wheat grown on silty clay soil condition. The maximum wheat grain yield of 3448 kgha- 1 was obtained from fields with <b>water</b> <b>application</b> depths of 30 - 45 cm and the lowest wheat yield was recorded in fields with <b>water</b> <b>application</b> depths greater than 45 cm.

The results show that the LEPA system is profitable only when cotton price is set above $ 1. 59 /kg. The exit (entry) threshold is consistently low (high) over a range of values for parameter changes including investment cost, exit cost, variable cost, risk-adjusted discount rate, and volatility rate, so it is unlikely that farmers with irrigation systems in place would leave them easily. This implies that to attain the goal of saving water, Lubbock County needs to focus on convincing current farmers to replace old irrigation systems with new ones.

40|$|The agro-hydrological model SWAP {{was used}} in a {{distributed}} manner to quantify irrigation water management effects {{on the water and}} salt balances of the Voshmgir Network of North Iran during the agricultural year 2006 - 2007. Field experiments, satellite images and geographical data were processed into input data for 10 uniform simulation areas. As simulated mean annual drainage water (312 Â mm) of the entire area was only 14 % smaller than measured (356 Â mm), its distribution over the drainage units was well reproduced, and simulated and measured groundwater levels agreed well. Currently, water management leads to excessive irrigation (621 - 1436 Â mmÂ year- 1), and leaching as well as high salinity of shallow groundwater are responsible for large amounts of drainage water (25 - 59 %) and salts (44 - 752 Â mgÂ cm- 2). Focused water management can decrease mean drainage water (22 - 48 %) and salts (30 - 49 %), compared with current water management without adverse effects on relative transpiration and root zone salinity.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the expected variability in irrigated crops under field size, surface irrigation conditions is needed to improve irrigation designs and water management scheduling procedures. The objective of this work is to describe <b>water</b> <b>application</b> uniformity under an efficient level -basin irrigation system and the variability of water use (soil water depletion) for three levels of irrigation and two basin lengths for a wheat crop. High water distribution uniformities with a level -basin irrigation system did not necessarily result in maximum irrigation <b>application</b> <b>efficiencies</b> where variations in soil -water factors were greater on a drier irrigation treatment than medium or wet treatment.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{potential}} of using rapid response tensiometers to evaluate preplant irrigation was conducted at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, Lubbock and Halfway, Texas. Sites used for the study were an Olton loam soil at Lubbock and a Pullman clay loam at Halfway. Soil water potential was measured with both portable rapid response and permanently installed tensiometers. Soil water content was measured with a neutron probe. Since preirrigations are performed during freezing weather, {{it was necessary to}} develop a technique to keep the permanent tensiometers from freezing. Substituting a methanol-water mixture (30 % by volume), the water in the tensiometers protected the tensiometers down to temperatures of - 18. 8 ?C. Soil water potential values for "field capacity" (- 14 to - 17 cbars at 60 cm; - 15 to - 18 cbars at 120 cm) were significantly lower than those obtained during a previous study (- 23 to - 25 cbars at 60 cm; - 34 to - 35 cbars at 120 cm). Data obtained were insufficient to explain the differences. It was possible to install the rapid response tensiometers in 10 minutes or less. However, considerable problems were encountered once the rapid response tensiometers were installed. These included cracked bulbs and soil clay plugging the pores of the tensiometer bulbs which eventually resulted in slow response time and inaccurate readings. As long as the tensiometers were working properly, readings obtained compared favorably (within - 5 cbars) with those from the permament tensiometers. Both permanently installed tensiometer and the neutron soil moisture probe provided good data for evaluating the efficiency of preplant irrigation from furrow irrigation. As expected, more water was applied to the soil close to the point of application with decreasing amounts applied with increasing distance from the point of <b>application.</b> The <b>application</b> <b>efficiency</b> was affected by the distance from the water source, flow rate, amount of water applied, and initial soil <b>water</b> content. <b>Application</b> <b>efficiencies</b> ranged from 22 to 76 %.

This work presents {{the development of}} a decision support system for solving surface irrigation design problems in northern Nigeria. The arid northern states affected by desert encroachment constitute a good candidate and their climatological data was obtained from the Nigerian Metrological Agency. The interactive system was defined in terms of inputs and outputs. The inputs were properties of soil, surface irrigation method and climate. The outputs were mainly the quantity of water application, scheduling pattern, possible design configuration, advance time, cut-off time, application rate, and water use efficiency. The FAO Penman-Monteith equation was used to estimate evapotranspiration values of major crops grown in Nigeria. Mathematical models outlined by Walker and Skogerboe were adapted, and heuristics applied in determining the best configuration that achieves optimum <b>water</b> <b>application</b> <b>efficiency.</b> We encoded the knowledge base using Matlab® software. The application was successfully used for the modification of a farm irrigation scheme in Kaduna state.

Yield, evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation drainage loss, along with the costs and returns per acre attributable to irrigation scheduling, were simulated {{through the use of}} a computerized plant growth model. The model created yearly 2 ̆ 2 irrigation schedules 2 ̆ 2 for alfalfa hay based on actual climatic, soil and plant characteristic data from the Utah State University Greenville Experiment Station. The model calculated the irrigation schedules based on a soil-water balance equation which never allowed the available soil water to go below the crop stress point. The production variables (yield, ET, drainage, <b>water</b> <b>application</b> <b>efficiency)</b> achieved with the model-calculated schedules were contrasted against the same variables under conventional practices of zero, five and eight irrigations per season. Under five and eight irrigations, the amount of water applied at each irrigation was varied from one to eight inches, which simulated irrigations ranging from 3. 4 to 26. 6 hours per set. The yearly irrigation schedules created by the soil-water balance equation maximized crop evapotranspiration and yield.

40|$|The {{region of}} Campinas {{is one of}} the largest {{producer}} of fresh market tomatoes in Brazil. However, the furrow irrigation system usually adopted by the farmers is known by its high water consumption; due to lack of water management and to its distribution in bare soil open channels. In order to identify the major causes of water loss, a furrow irrigation system traditionally employed in the region was evaluated. The following irrigation performance parameters were determined under field conditions: <b>water</b> <b>application</b> <b>efficiency,</b> storage efficiency, deficit degree, runoff and deep percolation losses. Additionally, the water use efficiency was evaluated at the end of the crop cycle. Based on the obtained results, it was observed that the values of application efficiency were between 25. 3 and 32. 2 %, with deep percolation losses between 62. 3 and 74. 1 %. The values of the irrigation performance parameters demonstrated that the adopted irrigation management provides low values of application efficiency, mainly due to high losses by percolation. These results showed that farmers need to implement some technical criteria to manage the irrigation practices and search for technological changes in the water distribution systems...|$|E
40|$|Winter {{dry season}} is mainly depends on irrigation. Because, the {{rainfall}} {{in this season}} is almost zero. At {{the end of this}} season, ground water mainly remains at about 10 - 12 meter depth. On the other hand, the crop then remains at booting to flowering stages. During this period, a huge number of cracks developed on the puddled field due to shortage of water. Consequently, the size and number of cracks depend on the irrigation interval, the intensity and duration of drought spell. The sizes of the cracks are range about 10 - 30 mm wide. Normally, the major cracks goes below puddled layer of 70 - 100 mm and almost all the cracks are interlinked and remain active through the growing season. Therefore, a major portion of the irrigation water lost through this cracks. Hence, a large area remains fallow due to proper management and shortage of irrigation <b>water.</b> Therefore, irrigation <b>application</b> <b>efficiency</b> to be increased in cracking soils by reducing seepage and drainage losses in paddies.
