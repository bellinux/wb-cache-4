The more she worked with the poor in her foundation, the more she adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, [...] "Sometimes I have wished my insults were slaps or lashes. I've wanted to hit people in the face to make them see, if only for a day, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> each day I help the people." [...] Crassweller writes that Evita became fanatical about her work in the foundation and felt on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social ills. [...] "It is not surprising", writes Crassweller, [...] "that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after 1946, they simultaneously veered toward the transcendental." [...] Crassweller compares Evita to Ignatius Loyola, saying she came to be akin to a one-woman Jesuit Order.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the news confirming the development of HeartGold and SoulSilver, fans posted their reactions and commentary on the Internet. In particular, IGN editor Jack DeVries reasoned that {{the primary reason for}} the updated games was to be compatible with Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, allowing players to collect old Pokémon species that were previously unobtainable in the new games. He also expressed skepticism that the new titles could match the quality of the originals; stating, [...] "For me, Gold/Silver were amazing because they introduced so many new features that have since become standards for the series. It was the first, and only, time the Pokémon games have made such a significant expansion. These days we're lucky if we get a new feature that invisibly changes the strategic elements of the game." [...] He reminisced over the qualities that made Gold and Silver truly unique, including the full color support, internal clock, Pokémon breeding, and PokéGear. Several months later, after DeVries had played through some of the game, he wrote, [...] "so far I like <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>see,</b> even if it all feels very familiar and formulaic at this point." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to other}} artists that the {{director}} have worked with, Rolston usually brought his team of professionals along to the shooting, including make-up artist, wardrobe-hair stylist, dancers and choreographer. However, Rolston and his team turned out to cause a few creative conflicts with the group during production. One of them came from the original routine conducted by Watkins, {{the person who was}} in fact choreographed most of the group's early videos. She remembered Rolston's camp's choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. [...] "locked" [...] the girls out from providing ideas as they were practicing the new dance moves. The trio eventually dropped his choreograph because they thought his version wasn't their [...] "style of dancing." [...] But still, two of his moves were adapted in the final clip. [...] "To me, I didn't even think about, 'Well, can I really choreograph?' I was just like, 'Let me do my thing.' I just like to dance and I know when I like <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>see.</b> I like different kinds of stuff," [...] Watkins shared. The [...] "bend-down-and-jump-up" [...] dance that appears in the video was made up by Watkins to [...] "Foe Life", a song of Mack 10, the rapper whom she later married from 2000 to 2004.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pictorial}} {{ideals of}} Roh's original magic realism attracted new generations of artists through the latter {{years of the}} 20th century and beyond. In a 1991 New York Times review, critic Vivien Raynor remarked that [...] "John Stuart Ingle proves that Magic Realism lives" [...] in his [...] "virtuoso" [...] still life watercolors. Ingle's approach, as described in his own words, reflects the early inspiration of the magic realism movement as described by Roh; that is, the aim is not to add magical elements to a realistic painting, but to pursue a radically faithful rendering of reality; the [...] "magic" [...] effect on the viewer comes from the intensity of that effort: [...] "I don't want to make arbitrary changes in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> to paint the picture, I want to paint what is given.

2500|$|The Penrose–Lucas {{argument}} {{about the implications of}} Gödel's incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been widely criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers, and the consensus among experts in these fields seems to be that the argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack. Marvin Minsky, a leading proponent of artificial intelligence, was particularly critical, stating that Penrose [...] "tries to show, in chapter after chapter, that human thought cannot be based on any known scientific principle." [...] Minsky's position is exactly the opposite – he believed that humans are, in fact, machines, whose functioning, although complex, is fully explainable by current physics. Minsky maintained that [...] "one can carry that quest [...] too far by only seeking new basic principles instead of attacking the real detail. This is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> in Penrose's quest for a new basic principle of physics that will account for consciousness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could go to him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E
