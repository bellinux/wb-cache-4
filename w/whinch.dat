In the indoeuropean prehistory, widows {{were required to}} follow the same fate than their husbands, right after the husbands’ death. This paper analyzes this practice in different cultures of indoeuropean background, with {{special attention to the}} Greek mythological stories, and the sati or suttee ceremonies among the Hindues.

40|$|Ade Murdani@ymail. comThis {{research}} was conducted on July to September 2014, which is held in the Laboratory of fishing Gear Materials, Utilization of Water Resources, The Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Sciences, University of Riau. The {{purpose of this study}} was to know the effect of drying for the breaking strength of polyamide yarns which have experienced the preservation of jengkol bark extract and salam bark extract. This study used an experimental method by performing the experiments effect of drying outdoors directly in sunlight and in a room with aerated for breaking strength of yarns PA(polyamide) <b>whinch</b> heve experienced the preservation. The breaking strength of yarns that used jengkol and salam bark extract which were dried in the room are higher than the yarns in the outdoors with directly sunlight. The soaking of yarns by using jengkol bark extract resulted the better breaking strength of yarns than the yarns which were soaked by salam bark extract...|$|E
40|$|Defects on edge dislocations are principally jogs {{and bound}} vacancies, both of <b>whinch</b> may be charged. For freshly {{introduced}} dislocations in Nacl {{at room temperature}} the only significant defects are bound cation vacancies. The charge on such dislocations has been determined and provides {{a measure of the}} concentration of vacancies on the core. This concentration depends on the previous movement of the dislocations, and by using crystals with known point defect concentrations {{it has been shown that}} dislocation sweep up not only free vacancies but also vacancies bound to impurities. A saturation charge is reached at about one vacancy per two sites on the core. These charges are determined by kinetic considerations. The establishment of thermal equilibrium requires diffusion which leads to a change in the charge, the formation of a compensating charge cloud, and possibly the pinning of the core by impurities. Theories of the equilibrium charge have to take account of the way the charge is accommodated on the core. Observations of the isoelectric temperature provide a source of information about the equilibrium conditions at the dislocation core...|$|E
40|$|The wide {{development}} of interfluvial spaces (30 - 40 kms wide) dipping very slightly (10 - 15 m/ 30 - 40 kms), {{the presence of}} loess-like deposits and eolian sands reduced fragmentation leading to the predominance of clasto-carstic depressions (crovs) realized by suffusion and setting processes. The semiarid continental temperate climate featured by hot summers and cold winters;the quantity of the precipitations is small (450 - 550 mm/year two thirds of which fall in winter-spring) while potential evapo-transpiration is high (some 700 mm/year) <b>whinch</b> means a deficient humidity (of some 150 - 250 mm/year. Against this morphological, litilogical and climate background the local water network is represented by a few waterways with temporary flow which ends up toward the confluence with fluviatile limans and in “crov” lakes that have a permanent/temporary regime, too. Most of these lakes are distinguished by {{a high degree of}} mineralization which makes them fall into group of brackish and sault lakes. Some of these lakes have used for balneary treatment (for instace Lacul Sărat-Brăila, Movila Miresii) and fish breeding (Plopu, Secu, Lutu Alb) ...|$|E
40|$|The authors analyse {{the current}} {{epidemiological}} situation of sheep Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) in Sardinia, where {{the prevalence of}} ovine CE is still very high (70 %) and this parassitosis is also frequently found in the human population. For this reason Sardinia represents a peculiar model for CE study, because there are particular conditions that allow Echinococcus granulosus to complete its life cycle. Some social and economical factors support the persistence of sheep CE: over 3 million Sarda breed heads are extensively bred; the presence, at farm level, of a strong relationship between dog, sheep and human; the low commercial value of meat coming from adult sheep, <b>whinch</b> results in {{a large number of}} sheep being slaughtered at home or on the farm rather than in authorized slaughterhouses. Moreover Sardinia is the only Italian region where partially successful echinococcosis control plans have been applied. The authors suggest some indirect and direct initiatives, including the use of a new vaccine against the development of this metacestode in sheep, to reduce the prevalence of CE...|$|E
40|$|To {{know the}} {{marriage}} in Dhawe tribe and the maturity before getting married based on common on {{law for the}} people of Dhawe tribe in Nagekeo district is the part of Indonesian society who have norms and certain costoms. To describe n analyze the application a bout marriage conventional system of Dhawe tribe n the sign of maturity, giving the alternative, in order to know deeper the marriage processes according to the law conventional n positive law n to know the necessaries that are needed as the sign of respect for Dhawe tribe, in case of knowing the comparison n the difference between. Conventional law n positive law. The approximant method is sosiologi law <b>whinch</b> means to analyze various rule of laws that relate with relate with marriage based on conventional law of Nagekeo district. The problem solving in this theses by using the descriptive and qualitative methol. The data source is taken from the prime data that is directly taken fron the main source of the data or information given by the custom functioners. And the second data is the supporter data from the second source for the first data namely literature, legal documents, texts n library. The technical data collection is that the prime data is taken by doing interview about Dhawe tribe 2 ̆ 7 s marriage to the custom missioners and society of Dhawe tribe by using respondent technique that are already united in note form meanwhile the secondary data is taken the is taken from the divining manual study such as document, internet, scientific journal and etc by learning and analyze the data. The technique of data analyze is used to express and analyze the description, condition and the development of conventional law aspect or Dhawe tribe in Nagekeo district. Meanwhile qualitative means the thinking process and to compare the one and another factors by concluding they view points of the writer. The result of application marriage system and the sign of maturity of Dhawe tribe in Nagekeo district that a girl is allowed to get married if she has fulfilled the maturity processes by being cut the teeth. She may follow some stages of marriage like tied application or conventional marriage and religious ceremonials. Thus the marriage conventional law is stated perfect. Meanwhile, the comparison between the conventional law about the marriage of Dhawe tribe in Nagekeo district according to the conventional law must be done and if the law is not being obeyed one will be punished according to the rules that are accepted in Dhawe tribe and as the part of national culture that causes the difference law as the social fenomena, seasonal, environment, insight and political pattern. While the similarity is caused by the existence of law and justice based on the constitution number 1 the year 1974 that is valid to tie the third side along it is noted in clausula or it is agreed marriage convention...|$|E
