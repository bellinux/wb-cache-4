500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{would say}} that I got into jazz <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> Woody Herman's band because that band was sorta jazz-oriented. They had records. It was the first band I ever joined where the musicians carried records on the road... Duke Ellington records... Woody Herman discs [...] Charlie Barnet V-Discs... That's the first time I sort of got into jazz. The first time I sort of felt that I was {{anything}} remotely connected with jazz.|$|E
2500|$|Lisberger elaborates: [...] "Everybody {{was doing}} backlit {{animation}} in the 70s, you know. It was that disco look. And we thought, {{what if we}} had this character that was a neon line, and that was our Tron warrior– Tron for electronic. And what happened was, I saw Pong, and I said, well, that's the arena for him. And {{at the same time}} I was interested in the early phases of computer generated animation, which I got into at MIT in Boston, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> that I met a bunch of programmers who were into all that. And they really inspired me, by how much they believed in this new realm." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> well <b>into</b> the orchard, {{where it}} was darker than in the garden, I listened intently, hoping that I might hear some sound that would guide me.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>into</b> {{his bunk}} he again buried {{his face in}} his hands, {{covering}} his eyes, and as I turned to go I could hear him murmuring, “I am a sick man, a very sick man.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out <b>into</b> {{the street}} and met the {{disgorging}} picture-palaces capering on the pavements and humming it (for he had put the gramophones on with the films), and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw far to the south the red electrics flash 'Gubby' across the Thames, I feared more than ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Chief," [...] replied Lane, in sarcasm. [...] "But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> action I {{think the}} facts you {{mentioned}} sort of rejuvenated a disabled soldier." ...|$|E
60|$|HARRY. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> {{the street}} I wanted to fire my {{revolver}} to frighten them. There wasn't a cartridge in it. I always keep it loaded and locked up.|$|E
60|$|There was no disputing {{the fact}} that I looked most disgustingly like Clark <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> his clothes. I {{actually}} felt a grudge against them for their excellent fit.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> down <b>into</b> the centrale, I saw the Germans {{lined up}} on one side {{with a couple of}} my men with pistols {{standing}} over them. Von Schoenvorts was among them. On the floor lay Benson, moaning, and beyond him stood the girl, a revolver in one hand. I looked about, bewildered.|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{were only}} 50 or 60 {{miles off the}} coast of Ireland. So I had this big Celtic {{influence}} growing up. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard him incorporating that into his music, that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> really <b>got</b> <b>into</b> it." [...] Davy Knowles, 2008 According to Knowles, the first band that influenced him was Dire Straits, whose song [...] "Sultans of Swing" [...] inspired him to begin playing the guitar after hearing it played in his father's car stereo. Because he was brought up in the Isle of Man, Knowles has publicly stated that, he draws a great deal of influence from the Celtic genre of music, particularly from the Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher. [...] "Rory Gallagher understood Celtic influences, being an Irishman, and I saw that where I was growing up, too. We were only 50 or 60 {{miles off the coast}} of Ireland. So I had this big Celtic influence growing up. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard him incorporating that into his music, that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> really <b>got</b> <b>into</b> it," [...] said Knowles in an interview with the Seattle P.I..|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{have once}} <b>got</b> <b>into</b> my scarlet coat I {{can be very}} proud of it, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am once seated in my divan I shall find it of all postures the easiest. Do you {{understand}} me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two more!--I left eleven two-deckers, three frigates, a sloop, and a cutter in sight, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the boat. You {{might have}} covered 'em {{all with a}} pocket-handkerchief, hey! Atwood!" ...|$|E
60|$|Finally, I {{remember}} that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> my little bedroom, I was truly wretched, {{and had a}} strong conviction on me that I should never like Joe's trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Nathan, I'm only a fool--but if {{you talk}} in that way of false pretences and public opinion, why do you tell {{everybody}} that your horrid cutting and carving is harmless chemistry? And why were you in such a rage <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> your workshop, and found you out? Answer me that!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out <b>into</b> the dark, {{where my}} hot face cooled in the wind, my relief equaled my other feelings. Sampson {{had told me}} to clear out, and {{although}} I did not {{take that as a}} dismissal I considered I would be wise to leave the ranch at once. Daylight might disclose my footprints between the walls, but even if it did not, my work there was finished. So I went to my room and packed my few belongings.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> safe <b>into</b> Morella, {{along with}} {{the tail of the}} sallying party, I was for the first time made acquainted with the ridiculous result of the lancer's thrust (as he {{delivered}} his lance, I must tell you that a ball came whiz over my head from our fellows, and entering at his nose, put a stop to HIS lancing for the future). I hastened to Cabrera's quarter, and related to him some of my adventures during the day.|$|R
6000|$|While my maid {{was gone}} down on some {{necessary}} business, and likewise {{to get me}} some burnt wine, which I was to drink going to bed, or rather <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was just <b>got</b> <b>into</b> bed, the Quaker and I had the following dialogue: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I'd {{been her}} sister she couldn't {{have done more}} for me. I feel as though I were really quite fond of her. But she isn't a bit like what I expected. She chooses to have her own way; but then she is so good-humoured! And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> any little trouble she--" ...|$|E
60|$|Twice I {{knocked her}} 'and away, and then, right afore {{my wife and}} the party next door, she put her arm round my waist. By the time I got to the 'ouse my legs was {{trembling}} so I could hardly stand, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the passage I 'ad to lean {{up against the wall}} for a bit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, bother!" [...] said I; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> bed I {{drew the}} clothes {{over my head}} and sang that brave song all to myself. Doing it that way the words and tune didn't matter at all, but I felt the spirit of it, and that was all I wanted, and then I went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} dark, {{when we all}} sprang ashore; and, for the first time, I felt dusty {{particles}} of the renowned British soil penetrating into my eyes and lungs. As for stepping on it, {{that was out of}} the question, in the well-paved and flagged condition of the streets; and I did not have an opportunity to do so till some time afterward, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out <b>into</b> the country; and then, indeed, I saw England, and snuffed its immortal loam-but not till then.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> was <b>got</b> <b>into</b> {{the town}} {{a great way}} from the inn, I met with an ancient woman who had just opened her door, and I fell into chat with her, and asked her a great many wild {{questions}} of things all remote to my purpose and design; but in my discourse I found by her how the town was situated, that I was in a street that went out towards Hadley, but that such a street went towards the water-side, such a street towards Colchester, and so the London road lay there.|$|R
2500|$|Erik Hage {{commented that}} after the {{favourable}} commercial reception of Wavelength, Morrison was inspired to [...] "return to something deeper, to once again take up the quest for music, that was spontaneous, meditative, and transcendent—music that satisfied {{the other side of}} his artistic nature." [...] Morrison was quoted on his opinion of the album, [...] "Into the Music was about the first album where I felt, [...] I'm starting here...the [...] Wavelength thing, I didn't really feel that was me." [...] (1988) [...] "That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>into</b> it. [...] That's why I called it Into the Music." [...] (1984) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the courtyard, I found Estella {{waiting with}} the keys. But she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I {{had kept her}} waiting; {{and there was a}} bright flush upon her face, as though {{something}} had happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the gate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I go {{back into}} my life, and I address myself to the noblest of created beings," [...] {{continued}} Pesca, vehemently apostrophising my unworthy self over the top rail of the chair. [...] "Who found me dead {{at the bottom of}} the sea (through Cramp); and who pulled me up to the top; and what did I say <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> my own life and my own clothes again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{was like}} this. At the {{beginning}} of this term I came back expecting to be head of this show. You see, Richards left at Christmas and I was next man in. Dallas and I had made all sorts of arrangements for having a good time. Well, I got back on the last evening of the holidays. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> this study, there was the man Plunkett sitting in the best chair, reading.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Nancy fainted, and I {{caught up}} {{the key of}} the door from her hand, {{intending}} to unlock it and get help. But as I was doing it {{it seemed to me}} better to leave it alone and get away, for the thing might look black against me, and any way my secret would be out if I were taken. In my haste I thrust the key into my pocket, and dropped my stick while I was chasing Teddy, who had run up the curtain. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>into</b> his box, from which he had slipped, I was off as fast as I could run." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, my dear, I {{am getting}} past being teased,' she said. 'Vexations don't hurt {{me as much}} as love does me good, and they'll not forget their affection. It is all {{goodness}} in Jem, and poor Oliver will understand it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> him <b>into</b> our home ways again; but he has been so long away from home, poor fellow!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Wade {{worked on}} Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. He co-wrote eight episodes of Baby Looney Tunes, a Warner Bros. show. He also worked Al Roach: Private Insectigator; and Deer Mike, a Disney show. Wade says of a break he received, [...] "Years ago, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the business, <b>I</b> called a TV {{production}} company {{looking for a}} job. The nice man on the phone {{told me that there}} was no work to be had because everyone was on hiatus. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> innocently asked him if ‘hiatus’ was an island, he laughed and hired me to write comedy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid, Gar'ner, they'll {{never want}} {{anything}} {{more in this}} life! The second mate {{and two of the}} hands were sitting in the cabin <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> this berth, and I fear 't will be found that they're dead. I urged them to turn in, too, as the berths were the only place where anything like warmth was to be found; but drowsiness had come on 'em, and, when that is the case, freezin' soon follows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A squall of words!--If {{your ship}} steer as wild as your ideas, Captain, {{you will make}} a crooked passage to the south. Do you not think it an easier matter, for an old man like me, to tell a few lies than to climb yonder long and heavy hill? In strict justice, more than half my duty was done <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the {{presence}} of the believing widow; and when I concluded to refuse the half of the reward that was unpaid, and to take bounty from t'other side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is no boy of mine," [...] Malcolm said; [...] "but I {{will tell}} you all about it presently. First let me lay him down on that settle, for the poor little chap is fast asleep and dead tired out. Elspeth, roll up my cloak and make a pillow for him. That's right, he will do nicely now. You are changed less than any of us, Elspeth. Just as hard to look at, and, I doubt not, just as soft at heart as you used to be when you tried to shield me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> scrapes. And now to supper." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> this <b>into</b> my head--which {{was during}} the rehearsal--I {{considered}} two things:--firstly, how we could best put about {{the success of the}} piece more widely and extensively even than it has yet reached; and secondly, how you could be best assisted against a bad production of it hereafter, or no production of it. I thought I saw immediately, that the point would be to have this representation noticed in the newspapers. So I waited until the rehearsal was over and we had profoundly astonished the family, and then asked Colonel Waugh what he thought of sending some cards for Tuesday to the papers. He highly approved, and I yesterday morning directed Mitchell to send to all the morning papers, and to some of the weekly ones--a dozen in the whole.|$|R
60|$|As I {{had asked}} for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in, before he left me, the good old {{constitutional}} rushlight of those virtuous days.--an object like {{the ghost of a}} walking-cane, which instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement {{at the bottom of a}} high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>into</b> bed, and lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus. And thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one another.|$|R
2500|$|... "Drumchapel is {{a housing}} estate just outside Glasgow. Well, it's in Glasgow, but just outside civilisation," [...] he has joked. [...] "To be quite honest, I quite liked it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> lived there. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> moved to Drumchapel, I was {{fourteen}} {{and there was}} a bluebell wood there, and it was in great condition then— I don't think it's in quite so good condition now— but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really quite liked it. I just started to dislike it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> older, <b>into</b> my teens and things. In my late teens, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was stuck out there, it cost me {{a lot of money to}} go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, but I liked that aspect of it, buying stuff out of vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van." ...|$|R
