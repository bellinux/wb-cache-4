Antibiotics are often given if deemed appropriate based on the presumed underlying cause and the horse's CBC results. Therapy to help prevent endotoxemia and improve blood protein levels (plasma or synthetic colloid administration) may also be used if budgetary constraints allow. Other therapies include probiotics and anti-inflammatory medication. Horses that are not eating <b>well</b> <b>may</b> also require parenteral nutrition.

When this happens, the leader end which filled the <b>well</b> <b>may</b> propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash. In a typical cloud-to-ground flash, a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud.

However, as development progressed, upon adding such a large cast of characters to the game, the development team felt that his story couldn't sufficiently be focused on, and he was switched into the Guile character. The developers still left some subtle references to Magus; including his Japanese name, Alf, resembling Magus's cats name, Alfador in Chrono Trigger, his English name, Guile, being similar to [...] "Gil", the name for Magus in Radical Dreamers, and similarities to Magus in his appearance and [...] "floating" [...] nature of movement.|$|E
2500|$|DAI is {{difficult}} to detect since it does not show up well on CT scans or with other macroscopic imaging techniques, though it shows up microscopically. [...] However, there are characteristics typical of DAI {{that may or may}} not show up on a CT scan. [...] Diffuse injury has more microscopic injury than macroscopic injury and {{is difficult}} to detect with CT and MRI, but its presence can be inferred when small bleeds are visible in the corpus callosum or the cerebral cortex. [...] MRI is more useful than CT for detecting characteristics of diffuse axonal injury in the subacute and chronic time frames. [...] Newer studies such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging are able to demonstrate the degree of white matter fiber tract injury even when the standard MRI is negative. [...] Since axonal damage in DAI is largely a result of secondary biochemical cascades, it has a delayed onset, so a person with DAI who initially appears <b>well</b> <b>may</b> deteriorate later. [...] Thus injury is frequently more severe than is realized, and medical professionals should suspect DAI in any patients whose CT scans appear normal but who have symptoms like unconsciousness.|$|E

He was not one of those who act or pray, that they may be seen of men." [...] In closing, Nelly attempted to answer the question of whether General Washington was a Christian. She responded, [...] "Is it necessary that any one should certify, 'General Washington avowed himself to me a believer in Christianity?'
