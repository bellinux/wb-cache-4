40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effect of different particle size of oil palm Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB) and their distribution as new substrate {{for the production of}} citric acid through Solid State Bioconversion (SSB) in laboratory scale by Aspergillus niger. The experiment was carried out to observe the productivity of citric acid with different particle size of EFB in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. The result obtained through this study showed that the 0. 5 mm down graded particle of EFB gave the highest production of citric acid compared to other particle size. The maximum production of citric acid of 131. 3 g kg - 1 -EFB with the production rate of 16. 4 g kg - 1 -day was obtained from EFB with particle size of 0. 5 mm after 8 days of bioconversion. Furthermore, the results of particle size distribution show that the <b>well-graded</b> <b>particle</b> size of EFB produced the highest citric acid compared to uniformly-graded and gap-graded particle...|$|E
40|$|Sediment is {{important}} in determining the morphology of river systems. The Densu basin has come under intense anthropogenic activities such as farming, sand winning, bushfires, among others, which are impacting on the fluvial processes, forms and channel morphology of the river. The study investigated sedimentation of the river channel {{in the light of}} these human activities along its banks. Fluvial processes include erosion and deposition particularly at the lower and middle courses, which is fashioning the morphology of the river channel. Data on river sedimentation was determined through sediment load analysis. The results of bed load show <b>well-graded</b> <b>particles,</b> particularly results of low flows throughout the river’s course. Generally, the percentage of coarser materials (gravels, sediments> 5 mm) was low, while the percentage of sand in the bed material was high in all the stations at high flows, over 80 % in Ashalaja, 70 % in Mangoase and moderate at Akwadum (about 50 %). Clay particles were low or absent in the sampled stations during high flows. Fluvial sediment transport for suspended load during high flows was high and low for the low stages. The highest suspended sediment discharge was 475. 641 tonnes/day at Akwadum at 2. 18 m and the lowest was 0. 492 tonnes/day at 0. 53 m also at Akwadum. Sediment discharge increased downstream from Akwadum to Ashalaja at both low and high flows, which was attributed to a number of variables such as a reduction in vegetative cover and increase in discharge downstream. The middle course experienced active channel erosion whilst deposition (channel braiding) was prevalent at the lower course...|$|R
40|$|For years, {{specifications}} {{have focused}} on the water to cement ratio (w/cm) and strength of concrete, despite the majority of the volume of a concrete mixture consisting of aggregate. An aggregate distribution of roughly 60 % coarse aggregate and 40 % fine aggregate, regardless of gradation and availability of aggregates, has been used as the norm for a concrete pavement mixture. Efforts to reduce the costs and improve sustainability of concrete mixtures have pushed owners to pay closer attention to mixtures with a <b>well-graded</b> aggregate <b>particle</b> distribution. In general, workability has many different variables that are independent of gradation, such as paste volume and viscosity, aggregate’s shape, and texture. A better understanding of how the properties of aggregates affect the workability of concrete is needed. The effects of aggregate characteristics on concrete properties, such as ability to be vibrated, strength, and resistivity, were investigated using mixtures in which the paste content and the w/cm were held constant. The results showed the different aggregate proportions, the maximum nominal aggregate sizes, and combinations of different aggregates all {{had an impact on the}} performance in the strength, slump, and box test...|$|R
