50|$|The need {{to clean}} slag from a manual <b>weld</b> <b>before</b> {{restarting}} {{increases the risk}} of accidental slag inclusion in the finished weld. This risk is avoided through the use of firecracker welding. As the electrode position is also constant relative to the weld, the risk of porosity is also reduced, {{to the level of a}} skilled welder. The process is also suitable for use in areas with limited access. Once started it continues automatically, without needing enough space for a skilled welder with sight of the weld.|$|R

40|$|A brief {{description}} is given of {{different groups of}} high chromium steels (rustless iron and stainless steels) according to their composition and more generally accepted names. The welding procedure for a given group will be much the same regardless of the slight variations in chemical composition which may exist within a certain group. Information is given for the tensile properties (yield point and ultimate strength) of metal sheets and <b>welds</b> <b>before</b> and after annealing on coupons one and one-half inches wide. Since welds in rustless iron containing 16 to 18 percent chromium and 7 to 12 percent nickel show the best combination of strength and ductility in the 'as welded' or annealed condition, it is considered the best alloy to use for welded construction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a methodology to remove labels automatically from digitized weld radiographs {{as part of}} the automatic weld defect detection process. An algorithm was developed to detect and remove labels printed onto <b>weld</b> radiographs <b>before</b> <b>weld</b> extraction algorithm or defect detection algorithm is applied. Normality test was used to determine if the intensity profile parallel to the weld contains label pixels. Thresholding followed by region filling operations were carried out to remove the labels. The algorithm was tested on 50 weld radiographs with labels and the labels on 90 % of these images were successfully removed...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{provided}} for joining beryllium pieces which comprises: depositing aluminum alloy {{on at least}} one beryllium surface; contacting that beryllium surface with at least one other beryllium surface; and welding the aluminum alloy coated beryllium surfaces together. The aluminum alloy may be deposited on the beryllium using gas metal arc welding. The aluminum alloy coated beryllium surfaces may be subjected to elevated temperatures and pressures to reduce porosity <b>before</b> <b>welding</b> the pieces together. The aluminum alloy coated beryllium surfaces may be machined into a desired <b>welding</b> joint configuration <b>before</b> <b>welding.</b> The beryllium may be an alloy of beryllium or a beryllium compound.

50|$|Buddy Baker {{qualified}} on the pole, but {{dropped out}} on lap 38 with ignition problems causing a misfiring engine. The team {{had made some}} minor repairs by <b>welding</b> <b>before</b> the race and it was thought the primary ignition control box had been damaged. During attempts to diagnose and repair the problem, the team switched to the backup box and replaced much of the ignition system, to no avail. When the team returned home after the race, engine builder Waddell Wilson checked and determined that the crewman who had switched to the backup box by unplugging the primary ignition box and plugging into the backup box had in fact, during the chaos, plugged back into the defective primary box. When Wilson switched to the backup ignition box, the car fired in perfect condition.|$|R

40|$|Laser welding {{has been}} {{considered}} as a promising method to join sintered NdFeB permanent magnets thanks to its high precision and productivity. However, the influences of laser welding on the magnetic property of NdFeB are still not clear. In the present paper, the effects of laser power on the remanence (Br) were experimentally investigated in laser spot welding of a NdFeB magnet (N 48 H). Results show that the Br decreased {{with the increase of}} laser power. For the same welding parameters, the Br of magnets, that were magnetized <b>before</b> <b>welding,</b> were much lower than that of magnets that were magnetized after welding. The decrease in Br of magnets after laser welding resulted from the changes in microstructures and, in turn, the deterioration of magnetic properties in the nugget and the heat affected zone (HAZ) in a laser weld. It is recommended that the dimensions of nuggets and HAZ in laser welds of a NdFeB permanent magnet should be as small as possible, and the magnets should be <b>welded</b> <b>before</b> being magnetized in order to achieve a better magnetic performance in practical engineering applications...|$|R

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the cross-sectional residual stress profile in a 2024 aluminium alloy VPPA weld using a newly invented technique - the contour method. The method is destructive, but simple in principle and easy in use. It needs only one straight cut through a sample on the plane of interest, followed by measurement of the surface contour produced by relaxation of the pre-existing stress field. Finite-element modelling is then used to back-calculate the original stress field. In this case we validate measurements made with the contour method, by using non-destructive diffraction data obtained from the same <b>weld</b> <b>before</b> cutting. This allows a comparison to be made and excellent agreement between {{the results from the}} two methods is seen. The study indicates that the contour method is a powerful novel technique to obtain an accurate full two-dimensional map of residual stress fields...|$|R
