25|$|Hybridization capture {{with the}} {{selector}} probe set is performed on tumor DNA from a biopsy and sequenced {{to a depth}} of ~10,000× coverage. The biotinylated selector probes bind selectively to the regions of the DNA library that were chosen to be where the recurrently mutations occur in the given cancer type. In this <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> left with a smaller library that is enriched for only the regions you want, which can then be sequenced. This allows the determination of patient specific mutations. Hybridization capture with the same selector is then performed on ctDNA from the blood to quantify the previously identified mutations in the patient. CAPP-Seq can be applied to ctDNA from multiple blood samples at different time points in order to follow tumor evolution.|$|E

500|$|Mars {{claims that}} his work with other artists has {{influenced}} his musical style: [...] " [...] Nothin' on You had a Motown vibe, Billionaire was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favourites is the CeeLo Green song. I don't think anyone else could've sung that song. And there's Just the <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are.</b> If you know my story, you know I love all different genres of music." [...] Mars states that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: [...] "In Hawaii {{some of the biggest}} radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward James Olmos portrays Gaff. Olmos {{used his}} diverse ethnic background, and {{personal}} research, {{to help create}} the fictional [...] "Cityspeak" [...] language his character uses in the film. His initial address to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, [...] "Horse dick ! No <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> the Blade ... Blade Runner." [...] M. Emmet Walsh plays Captain Bryant, a hard-drinking, sleazy, and underhanded police veteran typical of the film noir genre. Joe Turkel portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. William Sanderson was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J.F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions, and shares their shorter lifespan due to his rapid aging disease; Joe Pantoliano was considered for the role. James Hong portrays Hannibal Chew, an elderly geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes, and Hy Pyke portrays the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis with ease and in a single take, something almost unheard-of with Scott whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.|$|E

Carolina Frost for the Huffington Post said that Mars at the 2012 Brit Awards [...] "took his poptastic song Just the <b>Way</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are,</b> and gave it a fresh jazzy arrangement." [...] While Tweeter David Quantick summed up his opinion, asking if [...] "someone came as a spare Osmond". Others praised Mars' vocality and confidence with his soulful rendition. It was the twelfth song of his debut worldwide tour, The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour and was fourteenth on the set list of his second worldwide tour, The Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013).

2500|$|Ørsted Pedersen {{worked in}} duo and trio {{arrangements}} with pianist Kenny Drew, recording over 50 albums together.

He was presumably the most sought-after Danish instrumentalist internationally ever, and had traveled and recorded with a series of the greatest jazz soloists internationally.|$|E
2500|$|Terpening’s second thriller, League of Shadows (2005), was a {{contemporary}} novel of intrigue with an extensive back story {{that takes place}} in Italy during the Fascist Era. The historical scenes depict the efforts of three spies in 1943 to infiltrate Italian leader Benito Mussolini’s secret police, the OVRA. Decades after that intrigue went horribly wrong, an unknown enemy begins to hunt down the former secret agents, and their one hope for survival is an ex-cop obsessed with his mission. The Midwest Book Review called the novel “an addictive read, weaving together human drive, determination, and betrayal into a gripping whole”, while Lucille Cormier, in The Historical Novels Review, said that “You can race through this suspense thriller riding the whirlwind of drug busts, jungle guerrilla attacks, gun fights, assassinations, and love affairs right into the breathtaking climax. Or, if you are disciplined enough, you can turn each page slowly and savor the extraordinary visual and historical detail Ron Terpening has painted into his complex story. Either <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in for a treat. This is a book to add to every collection of historical fiction.” Joel Tscherne (Cleveland Public Library) noted in Library Journal that this is a novel that “fans of Jack Higgins’s thrillers will enjoy.” ...|$|E
