5|$|The third {{series of}} Spooks was {{produced}} by Kudos Film and Television for the BBC. Much of the production crew from the first two series returned. New crew members were brought in with the requirement that they were fans of the series and have ambition, {{so that they can}} understand Spooks. Andrew Woodhead was the series producer, with Jane Featherstone, Simon Crawford Collins and Gareth Neame as executive producers. Collins, who was the producer for the first two series, had to step back to executive producer, as he was overcommitted producing Kudos crime series Hustle. Woodhead replaced him as he was accustomed to the show, but also added more vitality to the show. Christopher Aird was the assistant producer. The third series included five writers. Howard Brenton <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> first, second and eighth episodes. Rupert Walters <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> third and ninth episodes. Ben Richards <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> fourth, sixth and tenth episodes. Richards previously <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> ninth episode of series two, and accepted the offer to return. His script in the second series was his first script for television; he found writing easier as time went by. Raymond Khoury <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> seventh episode. Series creator David Wolstencroft <b>wrote</b> <b>the</b> fifth episode. Wolstencroft was poised to write the next episode, but found himself committed to other projects.|$|E
