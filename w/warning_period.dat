40|$|The {{ability of}} rats {{to detect the}} {{presence}} of sinusoidal amplitude modulation (AM) of a broadband noise carrier was determined before and after bilateral ablation of auditory cortex. The rats were trained to withdraw from a drinking spout to avoid a shock when they detected a modulation of the sound. Sensitivity was evaluated by testing the rats at progressively smaller depths of modulation. Psychophysical curves were produced to describe the limits of detection at modulation rates of 10, 100 and 1000 Hz. Performance scores {{were based on the}} probability of withdrawal from the spout during AM (<b>warning</b> <b>periods)</b> relative to withdrawal during the un-modulated noise (safe periods). A threshold was defined as the depth of modulation that produced a score halfway between perfect avoidance and no avoidance (performance score = 0. 5). Bilateral auditory cortical lesions resulted in significant elevations in threshold for detection of AM at rates of 100 and 1000 Hz. No significant shift was found at a modulation rate of 10 Hz. The magnitude of the deficit for AM rates of 100 and 1000 Hz was positively correlated with the size of the cortical lesion. Substantial deficits were found only in animals with lesions that included secondary as well as primary auditory cortical areas. The results show that the rat 2 ̆ 7 s auditory cortex is important for processing sinusoidal AM and that its contribution is most apparent at high modulation rates. The data suggest that the auditory cortex is a crucial structure for maintaining normal sensitivity to temporal modulation of an auditory stimulus. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of their defeat at the battle of Alamance, public opinion was decidedly against them.

However as the initial excitement over the glorious battle died down, many newsmen, especially in the Boston area, began to question the reasons behind the rebellion and investigated further to find its cause. Several reasons were found to see the destruction of the Regulators as an act of an oppressive government. Most particularly admonished was the methods in which Tryon himself had used to win the battle of Alamance. The use of a riot act, and the execution of rebellion leaders after the battle was frowned upon.

40|$|Earth Crossing Asteroids (ECAs) {{are those}} asteroids whose orbit cross section can {{intersect}} the {{capture cross section}} of the Earth as a result of secular gravitational perturbations. This thesis provides a framework for understanding the origin, nature, and types of ECAs. The change in velocity requirements to achieve a two Earth radii deflection for long and short term warning scenarios are developed. Next, a method of developing hypothetical Earth colliding asteroid orbits is presented. These hypothetical orbits are used in two ways: (1) to evaluate the ability of Dance of the Planets, a solar system simulation model developed by Applied Research and Consulting, Inc., to accurately propagate orbits of imported asteroid orbits, and (2) to analyze the sensitivity of deflection distance to variation in deflection angle and orbital parameters of a given orbit. Inaccuracies during importation of data precluded the use of Dance of the Planets for the purpose of sensitivity analysis. The program does provide an excellent tool for visualization of ECA scenarios. Consequently, a simpler orbital model was developed to provide a Earth miss distance sensitivity analysis. With one asteroid orbital <b>period</b> <b>warning</b> the minimum change in velocity to deflect an asteroid two Earth radii is approximately 0. 135 m/s and the optimal deflection is along the flight path. Maximum deflection occurs when the deflection is applied at perihelion. The miss distance decreases markedly with increase in true anomaly until it is a minimum at aphelion. U. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|The key {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} that optimization of evacuation <b>warnings</b> by time <b>period</b> and impacted zone is crucial for efficient evacuation of an area impacted by a hurricane. We assume that people behave in a manner consistent with the warnings they receive. By optimizing the issuance of hurricane evacuation warnings, one can control the number of evacuees at different time intervals to avoid congestion in the process of evacuation. The warning optimization model is applied to a case study of Hurricane Sandy using the study region of Brooklyn. We first develop a model for shelter assignment and then use this outcome to model hurricane evacuation warning optimization, which prescribes an evacuation plan that maximizes the number of evacuees. A significant technical contribution is the development of an iterative greedy heuristic procedure for the nonlinear formulation, which is shown to be optimal for the case of a single evacuation zone with a single evacuee type case, while it does not guarantee optimality for multiple zones under unusual circumstances. A significant applied contribution is the demonstration of an interface of the evacuation warning method with a public transportation scheme to facilitate evacuation of a car-less population. This heuristic we employ can be readily adapted to the case where response rate is a function of evacuation number in prior periods and other variable factors. This element is also explored in the context of our experiment...|$|R
40|$|Two pigeons {{were trained}} to peck a key under a free-operant {{avoidance}} schedule. Then, changes in key color signalled the beginning (safe period) and the end (<b>warning</b> <b>period)</b> of the response-shock interval, with a response required to change the key color. Finally, a change in key color signalled the <b>warning</b> <b>period</b> and either a response or a shock reinstated the safe stimulus. During signalled avoidance, response rate was higher during the warning stimulus than during the safe stimulus. More responding tended {{to occur in the}} warning stimulus when it was terminated by either a response or a shock than by only a response. In either procedure, response latency during the warning stimulus was a function of the duration of the warning stimulus. In general, response and shock rate were higher during unsignalled than during signalled avoidance. When the warning stimulus was brief, the results were similar to those of unsignalled avoidance. These results confirm previous findings with pigeons, are in general agreement with data provided by other species in studies of signalled avoidance, and thereby indicate the transituationality of the key-pecking operant...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to test a model in which the {{decision}} to evacuate is a function of four processes (risk perception, preparedness, social influence, and economic resources). Participants were interviewed by telephone both while they were under a hurricane warning and after the threat had disappeared (pre-post sample). Because all respondents had been participants in an earlier panel study, pre-threat data were also available. The pre-post sample of 95 panelists was older than the non-respondent sample of 54 panelists who could not be reached by phone during the <b>warning</b> <b>period</b> but was otherwise comparable. The results indicated that higher risk perception and the belief that one is influenced by others are the strongest predictors of intentions to evacuate. Furthermore, risk perception was shown to mediate the influences of many background variables (e. g., experiences, demographics) on evacuation intentions. Post-event comparisons between the pre-post group and a reactivity control group of 66 panelists suggested that the <b>warning</b> <b>period</b> interview did not increase anxiety but may have influenced reactiv...|$|E

40|$|An {{early warning}} system (EWS) for flash floods has been {{developed}} {{for part of the}} Sinai peninsula of Egypt, an hyper-arid area confronted with limited availability of field data, limited understanding of the response of the wadi to rainfall, and a lack of correspondence between rainfall data and observed flash flood events. This paper shows that an EWS is not a "mission impossible" when confronted with large technical and scientific uncertainties and limited data availability. Firstly, the EWS has been developed and tested based on the best available information, this being quantitative data (field measurements, simulations and remote sensing images) complemented with qualitative "expert opinion" and local stakeholders' knowledge. Secondly, a set of essential parameters has been identified to be estimated or measured under data-poor conditions. These are: (1) an inventory of past significant rainfall and flash flood events, (2) the spatial and temporal distribution of the rainfall events and (3) transmission and infiltration losses and (4) thresholds for issuing <b>warnings.</b> Over a <b>period</b> of 30 yr (1979 – 2010), only 20 significant rain events have been measured. Nine of these resulted in a flash flood. Five flash floods were caused by regional storms and four by local convective storms. The results for the 2010 flash flood show that 90 % of the total rainfall volume was lost to infiltration and transmission losses. Finally, it is discussed that the effectiveness of an EWS is only partially determined by technological performance. A strong institutional capacity is equally important, especially skilled staff to operate and maintain the system and clear communication pathways and emergency procedures in case of an upcoming disaster...|$|R
40|$|With many incidences of landslides, mudslides {{and erosion}} occurrences lately, {{especially}} in the highlands in Malaysia, properties were damaged and lives were lost. Seeing the need of resolving and minimizing such untoward incidences, a study has been embarked on developing a near real-time early warning system on erosion hazards so as to provide an early warning to the public, whenever there are signs and probable occurrence of such incidences. Consequently, a case study on Cameron Highlands Catchment was carried out, which involved a detailed baseline database {{of the study area}} to be set up first. The highland catchment is considered an environmentally sensitive area where many land development for various activities such as agriculture, agro-tourism, property development and road-widening projects, had already been carried out and some are still on going as to-date. To develop the baseline database, acquisition of the latest Structure Plan, Satellite Imagery, topographical and rainfall information of the catchment area were carried out. Once this is done, real-time rainfall information would be adopted to develop the early warning system. This could be done by using solar-powered rain sensors, which would be triggered based on the rainfall amount and intensity. A SIM-card based GPRS transmitter, which is attached to the rain sensing and transmission unit would then send out e-mails at every minute interval, so that the data could be transferred to a receiving unit. At this point, the e-mail is read and data is processed within the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) using an automated keyboard simulation programme. The final processed values would then be set against the threshold values, which will trigger an early warning if any of the values exceeds the threshold limits. Therefore, it is hoped that the application of this new locally developed system, which has been trademarked under the name EWARNSTM (Early Warning And Risk Navigation Systems), would be beneficial to the local authorities, highway operators and the public in general in providing an early <b>warning</b> especially during <b>periods</b> of heavy rainfall, which could possibly trigger serious soil erosion occurrences that may induce landslides...|$|R

In respond to warnings, physicians had to make adjustments, of which the majority was changing to an unsplit pill (72. 9 %). The interruptive warning system could avoid the prescriptions with inappropriate pill splitting. Accordingly, physicians changed their behavior of prescribing special oral formulations regarding inappropriate pill splitting. We suggest the establishment of such system to target special oral formulations with warnings to prevent inappropriate pill splitting...|$|R
