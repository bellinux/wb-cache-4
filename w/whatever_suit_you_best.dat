5000|$|Jailbreak: Source has {{received}} an overall positive reception from various critics. Mod DB wrote a lengthy {{preview of the}} mod prior {{to the release of}} 0.4 describing it as [...] "fresh and exciting", and praising it for its approach to game design by allowing a player [...] "to play in <b>whatever</b> style <b>suits</b> <b>you</b> <b>best</b> and still have a contribution to a team win". The reviewer also commented on the environment design, [...] "For instance, the new maps are amazing - not only do they look great but each level is like another game within itself!" [...] finally ending by saying that the game would be a [...] "surefire hit". The majority of the review was full of praise, but Mod DB did criticise the lack of extensive custom sounds within the mod saying [...] "Some of the HL2 sound effects are there but this does not take away from the feeling each theme creates for itself.".|$|R

40|$|There {{are a large}} {{variety of}} sedan cars {{available}} in the market today in the US. Therefore deciding on what sedan car <b>suits</b> <b>you</b> <b>best</b> is difficult. This study created a hierarchical decision model {{to determine the best}} characteristics of a sedan car. This model has been chosen because it allows users to easily visualize how each criterion at each tier impacts the decision. It is also applicable for manufacturers to realize what characteristics need to be improved. This paper will look at the following six criteria: fuel economy, overall crash test rating, costs, features, performance, and dependability. Although there are other factors that go into a sedan car, we felt these six are the most important criteria for selecting a sedan car. The authors of this document are considered experts for evaluating sedan cars using the pairwise comparison. The use of the HDM along with pairwise comparison allowed for the creation quantified weighted values for each element at each tier. Using the HDM and inputting the top five best-selling sedans of 2012 resulted in the Honda Accord LX 2012...|$|R

5000|$|In 1973, Eastwood {{told the}} late film critic Gene Siskel, [...] "No, I don't believe in God." [...] Nearly four decades later while {{promoting}} his film, Hereafter (2010), Eastwood stated that [...] "I was always respectful {{of people who}} were deeply religious because I always felt that if they gave themselves to it, then it had to be important to them. But if you can go through life without it, that’s OK, too. It’s <b>whatever</b> <b>suits</b> <b>you.</b> I do believe in self-help. I’m not a New Age person but I do believe in meditation, and for that reason I’ve always liked the Buddhist religion. When I’ve been to Japan I’ve been to Buddhist temples and meditated and I found that rewarding." [...] As much as anything, Eastwood has found spirituality in nature (as suggested by his 1985 Western, Pale Rider), stating that [...] "I was born during the Depression and I was brought up with no specific church. We moved every four or five months during the first 14 years of my life, so I was sent to a different church depending on wherever we lived. Most of them were Protestant, but I went to other churches because my parents wanted me {{to try to figure out}} things for myself. They always said, ‘I just want to expose you to some religious order and see if that’s something you like’. So although my religious training was not really specific, I do feel spiritual things. If I stand on the side of the Grand Canyon and look down, it moves me in some way." ...|$|R

My favourite is 'Bathes unseen,' which is a masterpiece; and the next, 'Into the green recessed woods,' is perhaps more remarkable, though it does not take my fancy so imperiously.

40|$|Our taster {{sessions}} {{give students}} {{the chance to}} develop and build on the {{knowledge and understanding of}} a particular writing form. It's also an opportunity for you to develop the independent practice skills crucial to a professional writer and an opportunity to develop writing industry contacts. All MA Professional Writing students spend time exploring different forms of writing before deciding which area they wish to specialise. Specialisms might be in the field of Business Writing, Features Writing, Non-Fiction, the Novel, Writing for Children or Scriptwriting. So this is your opportunity to explore and experiment with different areas of writing to see which one <b>suits</b> <b>you</b> <b>best.</b> Within these taster sessions, you will be invited to initiate, negotiate and complete an extended piece of writing to high standards. You will also develop a report that should demonstrate an enhanced understanding of the market context for your work as well as an appraisal of its strengths and weaknesses. Your development as a writer through these sessions will be supported by your peers. Your support will {{come in the form of}} online discussions, peer-to-peer feedback and by your own personal reflection on the feedback you receive on your work and your market research. To get the most from this experience, students are expected to participate in a schedule of peer-to-peer reviews. We have created assignment forums for you to post your work - this is where you receive feedback from your peers as well as critique the work of others. Please note that these taster sessions are taken from our part-time distance learning course. The audio lectures may contain instances of tutors speaking directly to our distance learning students. ...|$|R
40|$|Learners of {{a foreign}} {{language}} are generally keen to practice the language outside the classroom, but without guidance from a teacher, they often {{do not know how}} to go about it. DIY Techniques for Language Learners addresses this common problem by offering no-nonsense, practical advice that any learner can try out. •	Part A explains a few basic principles related to language learning, and summarises relevant research findings in plain language aimed at learners themselves. A series of questionnaires help you find out what exactly you need to learn and decide what learning approach <b>suits</b> <b>you</b> <b>best.</b> •	Part B is a recipe-type list of 81 learning techniques for developing vocabulary, grammar, reading, writing, speaking and listening skills. Each technique is described step-by-step, with a clear explanation of what it can be used for, and specific advice on how to assess your performance in each case. DIY Techniques for Language Learners is primarily aimed at language learners who wish to supplement a taught course with extra practice, those who just prefer to work independently, or those who are unable to attend a conventional course. It is also a good starting point for learners who wish to study with another learner or with a proficient speaker of the target language who is not a language teacher. Teachers themselves will find a wealth of ideas in the book, both for out-of-class supplementary work and classroom-based strategy training. Since all the tasks described encourage learner initiative and can be self-assessed, this is also a good way to optimise learning with minimum teacher input. Finally, DIY Techniques for Language Learners is a useful reference for language advisors and a valuable open-access resource in teaching institutions and public libraries...|$|R
