25|$|During the 1800s, the Georgetown {{waterfront}} {{was largely}} a commercial harbor. Most of the land was occupied by warehouses. Between 1900 and 1960, the harbor largely closed as commercial river traffic declined sharply. The warehouses were demolished {{and a number of}} coal gas, cement, steel, and other medium and light industrial manufacturing plants were erected in their place. By 1960, many of these plants closed, and the waterfront fell into disuse. A city-owned waste incineration plant, a <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> facility, and construction materials depot occupied portions of the site.|$|E

Further, a total waste production in the Czech Republic and European Union is evaluated. For the processing of this thesis are important statistical values of production of municipal <b>waste</b> and <b>sorted</b> <b>waste</b> in the Czech Republic and European Union. The practical part describes the list of wastes produced in Přibyslav {{over the past ten}} years. To determine the balance of the waste generated was done using basic descriptive statistics of the evaluation.

40|$|There are {{two major}} ways in which solid <b>waste</b> can be <b>sorted</b> and {{recycled}} – at the household level, when households are required to <b>sort</b> <b>waste</b> into a given number of categories, or in specialized sorting facilities. Traditionally, it has been thought that sorting at the household level is an inconvenience, as it uses space and requires time and consideration. Our study provides empirical evidence to the contrary. Through a carefully designed choice experiment we collected stated choices {{of the members of}} a Polish municipalities with respect to the way their <b>waste</b> is <b>sorted</b> and how often it is collected. In the scenario of our study, respondents were informed that the <b>waste</b> will be <b>sorted</b> anyway – if not at the household level than at a specialized sorting facility. Interestingly, analysis of the preferences of members of the general public shows, that people are willing to <b>sort</b> <b>waste</b> at the household level, even if unsorted waste would be collected at no extra cost. We calculate maximum willingness to pay for collecting <b>sorted</b> vs. unsorted <b>waste,</b> as well for increased frequency of collection. Overall, our results provide encouraging evidence that most people prefer to <b>sort</b> <b>waste</b> themselves if given the choice, and thus demonstrate their pro-environment preferences, even without economic incentives to do so...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{evaluating}} {{the influence of}} frequency balance of containers for <b>sorted</b> for <b>sorted</b> <b>waste</b> for the intensity of sorting in two locations in České Budějovice. The influence was examined using three independent methods (monitoring the filling of containers ? by a balancing caluclation ? by a questionnaire) At {{the assessment of the}} impact of collection frequency to the selection account was taken of the following criteria: full containers at the time of collection, walking distance of population to the containers for <b>sorted</b> <b>waste,</b> type of buildings in the monitored area, <b>sorted</b> <b>waste</b> containers capacity, the amount of <b>sorted</b> <b>waste,</b> population per one collection point, etc. The results showed that the level of <b>sorting</b> of mixed <b>waste</b> in České Budějovice is not at good level. Collection frequency of <b>sorted</b> <b>waste</b> is sufficient and is not limiting to the intensity of sorting.
