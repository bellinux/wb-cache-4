Found out that your claws were {{beginning}} to make up new designs on their own. New types of their own. Better types. Down in your underground factories behind our lines. You let them stamp themselves, repair themselves. Made them more and more intricate. It's your fault this happened." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a June 2013, {{interview}} with HipHopDX, ¡Mayday! spoke {{about why they}} chose to title the album Believers, saying: [...] "We felt like <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{about the people who}} are true ¡MAYDAY! fans and address them. This album was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> them in a way. Metaphorically, we feel like the universe gives you what you <b>want,</b> and <b>we</b> feel like we’re blessed by the universe, ‘cause we’re strong enough to ask and do {{what we need to do}} to make things happen. We feel like the universe works for you. Not to be corny, but you gotta believe it to see it. That’s why the cover is this little kid with a slingshot that just took down a helicopter, you know? It’s about seeing is believing. That’s what ¡MAYDAY! is. When you see us, you believe us. We turn people on all the time." [...] In the same interview, they spoke about the inspiration behind the song [...] "Marathon Man", saying: [...] "We have a song called “Marathon Man” inspired by the Boston bombing. Instead of a preachy gotta-save-the-world record, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it because it was crazy event so <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do a story on it when you’re in the race. Imagine a story of you in the race and there’s a bomb. You still runnin’, ‘cause you wanna win that race. You don’t wanna let that event stop you from doing what you wanna do in your life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you can't, 'cause you've {{agreed to}} go to Aggie Morrell's an' wear a ten-cent necktie; so run home, sonny, for <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about what it wouldn't do for you to hear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Flaxie, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to yeh." [...] There was no answer, and he {{came back}} and sat down. Bert pointed to the letter which Flaxen had flung down on the table. The giant took it, folded it up, and called, [...] "Here's y'r letter, babe." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Thank You {{is a song}} <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do {{speaking}} about our generation and {{what is really going}} on right now. Every generation has a song. We’re not trying to say this is the song, but it’s a story and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about what is going on right now. Thank you is a sarcastic way of saying you know what," [...] — Oller about the song's content. [...] "Thank You" [...] is a pop rap and teen pop song with a length of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. It is written in the key of B major. Lyrically, it is a sarcastically-written approach on the world's issues and a sarcastic gratitude to the previous generation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{think we}} ought to go home first," [...] {{continued}} Tom, after a pause. [...] "The folks will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see us, and, besides, <b>we</b> will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> matters over with dad, and also with Uncle Randolph. They may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tell us something about the business." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bono {{noted that}} the lyrics were {{influenced}} by both Cole Porter and Bach, and that the song is about [...] "two lovers holding on {{to each other and}} trying to turn their life into worship". Lanois described the song's origins: [...] "We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have something euphoric and Bono came up with that little melody. And he loved that melody, and stuck with it. Almost like a fanfare. And then I was involved in the lyrical process on that, because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about sacrifice that one makes for one's medium or one's art. I thought it had for a setting New York in the 1950s; looking out a small bedroom window. Maybe a Charlie Parker kind of figure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, if it isn't Fred Dobson!" [...] {{burst from}} Randy's lips. [...] "How {{in the world}} did he get away out here? Fred Dobson! Fred Dobson!

6000|$|The {{decision}} once arrived at, it {{was determined}} to announce it to the children, who had up to this time {{no idea of the}} great change decided upon.

60|$|If it is a {{question}} of origins, the origin is always the same, whatever we say about it. So is the cause. Let that be a comfort to us. If <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about God, well, we can please ourselves. God has been talked about quite a lot, and He doesn't seem to mind. Why we should take it so personally is a problem. Likewise if we wish to have a tea party with the atom, let us: or with the wriggling little unit of energy, or the ether, or the Libido, or the Elan Vital, or any other Cause. Only don't let us have sex for tea. We've all got too much of it under the table; and really, for my part, I prefer to keep mine there, no matter what the Freudians say about me.|$|E
40|$|Ordinary {{objects are}} vague, because either (i) {{composition}} is restricted, or (ii) {{there really are}} no such objects (but <b>we</b> still <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about them), or (iii) because such objects are not metaphysically (independently of us) distinguishable from other 'extra-ordinary' objects. In any sense {{in which there are}} ordinary objects, they are vague...|$|R
5000|$|Mayor Jasper Que of {{this town}} has claimed that the May 4 slaying of {{broadcaster}} Richard Nadjid as an off-shoot of a love triangle. He said, [...] "The findings of our police is love triangle. There are women involved and <b>we</b> don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it. <b>We</b> are not pursuing that issue anymore {{for the sake of}} the family." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{publishing}} {{a very good}} review for their 1995 album Afraid of Sunlight and including it in their 50 Best Albums of 1995, Q refused to interview the band or write a feature on them. Steve Hogarth later said: [...] "How can they say, this is an amazing record... no, <b>we</b> dont <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you? Its hard to take when they say, heres a very average record... well {{put you on the}} front cover." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{are times}} when the proverb: [...] "Act in haste and repent at leisure" [...] should be written [...] "Unless you act in haste you will repent at leisure." [...] This is such a time. We can take, of course, the right steps or the wrong steps to settle our {{soldiers}} on the land; but no wrong step we can take will be so utterly wrong as to let the moment of demobilisation slip. We have a good and zealous Minister of Agriculture, we have good men alive to the necessity, working on this job. If we miss the chance {{it will be because}} [...] "interests" [...] purblind, selfish and perverse, and a lethargic public opinion, do not back them; because <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> it out; because trade and industry think themselves of superior importance to the land. Henceforth trade and industry are of secondary importance in this country. There is only one thing of absolutely vital importance, and that is agriculture.|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s, we, Bronwyn Fredericks and Pamela Croft were both {{living in the}} Australian Central Queensland region. As two Australian Aboriginal women we were both engaged in the same areas of {{politics}} and activism and were both undertaking doctoral studies. At times during our studies, we would become frustrated {{with the lack of}} literature and scholarly leadership in our respective disciplines. We also knew we had lots to say that was inside and outside of the scope of our studies and our disciplines. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about history, health, education, culture, the manifestations of whiteness in Australia, the relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians and much more. Through our joint history we knew we could work in a partnership with each other in ways that supported and respected one another and recognised each other’s skills and abilities. We began to share our visions and our ideas in ways that stimulated creativity and inspiration. We began to plan projects using Pamela’s art works and Bronwyn’s words. We came to find a space in which we could jointly work. This paper will share part of our visioning journey and highlight some of the aspects of how we work together in our creative partnership. It will demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} enact our visions and to realise our dreams and aspirations...|$|R
5000|$|Masterson {{made her}} feature film directorial debut in 2007, with The Cake Eaters, which premiered at the Ft. Lauderdale International Film Festival {{as well as}} the Ashland Independent Film Festival where it {{received}} the 'Audience Award - Dramatic Feature' prize in 2008. Of her move to directing, Masterson said in an interview, [...] "When I signed to do this, I wasn't scared but, yes, it was scary. I'm already 40, although <b>we</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about that. In '92, I wrote my first screenplay, which I then was to direct, but I ended up taking an acting job because it takes forever to get a movie made." ...|$|R
5000|$|The band's {{critical}} and commercial success peaked {{with the release}} of their second album, Bande à Part. With the release of 3 and Couleurs sur Paris, critics gave the band less attention. The band subsequently went into hiatus, releasing no new material and performing few live shows. Collin later explained this hiatus, saying, [...] "I was bored of myself doing covers," [...] and citing diminishing critical acclaim: [...] "With the first and second albums, all the media said: ‘This is a great idea, a great rendition’ - and after the third album it was suddenly, ‘OK, it’s always the same thing, the same concept, <b>we</b> don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it'." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{begins with}} an edited quote from the {{beginning}} of [...] "Message to the Grass Roots", a speech by Malcolm X. As it appears in the song, the quote is: [...] "... And during the few moments that we have left, ... <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> right down to earth in a language that everybody here can easily understand."The unabridged beginning of the speech is:"... And during the few moments that we have left, we want to have just an off-the-cuff chat between you and me—us. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> right down to earth in a language that everybody here can easily understand."During a rest in the music at 4:35, John F. Kennedy's inaugural address is heard ("Ask not what your country can do for you ..."). The song ends with Franklin D. Roosevelt saying [...] "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself", from his first inaugural address. The lyrics also mention Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, and Mahatma Gandhi.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, an edited {{quote from}} this speech was {{used at the}} {{beginning}} of the song [...] "Cult of Personality" [...] by Living Colour.

5000|$|The FBI became {{involved}} in the investigation and the letters were turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department's Criminal Conspiracy Section. During the course of the investigation, the United States Department of Agriculture attempted to contact The Breeders through a classified ad placed in the Los Angeles Times. The ad stated: [...] "Breeders if you're for real send one of your little friends. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> Call John at USDA." ...|$|E
5000|$|I don’t {{understand}} why Q Magazine won’t write about us. The most memorable review {{they gave us}} was of Afraid of Sunlight which said, [...] "If this were by anything other than Marillion it would be hailed as near genius". And they still wouldn’t give us a feature. How can they say, [...] "this is an amazing record ... no, <b>we</b> don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you"? It’s hard to take when they say, [...] "here’s a very average record ... we’ll {{put you on the}} front cover". Why don’t they just stop pretending that it’s all about music and admit it’s really about money? Then put the top-selling five bands on the cover and tell everyone else to fuck off.|$|R
5000|$|Dear citizens, {{ever since}} the mid-1980s when gender-equality issues came into public awareness, our country has been {{focusing}} on overhauling laws, policies and social systems to improve women’s rights and status. We have our first female president. More women pass major government service exams than men. Female ROTCs command conscripted male soldiers. Women surpassed men in university entrance rates and youth employment rates years ago. Despite this, men are still seen as superior while women are seen are [...] "socially weak".Dear citizens, While everyone else was {{speaking on behalf of}} women, Man of Korea started to speak for men. We began our group online in January 2008, and launched a formal civic group in March 2011. We have been treading a thorny path filled with mockery and ridicule. When we said excessive privileges for women should be distributed to men too, we were called male chauvinists. When we said men and women should share equal expenses and we should create an environment where men can also be house husbands, we were called losers. In this country, where discussing male rights is considered to be cheap gossip for losers and you have to discuss national politics to be taken seriously, Man of Korea has been marginalized.We {{would like to say that}} men can also be weak. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> point out that if the gender you were born with determines your rights, privileges and duties, we will never achieve equality. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say that it is important to create a society where men and women stand on an equal footing and can understand and respect each other. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the equality of every human beyond gender equality.|$|R

5000|$|After the {{controversy}} caused by passing {{of this bill}} by Virginia representatives, Governor Bob McDonnell amended the bill to include language {{that would require the}} written consent of the woman seeking an abortion, and would also require only a transabdominal ultrasound. However, Rep. Byron urged rejection of the amendment on its grounds that a transvaginal ultrasound is an invasive procedure because, “If <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about invasiveness, there's nothing more invasive than the procedure that she is about to have," [...] she said, referring to her belief that abortions harm viable persons within the womb.|$|E
5000|$|How do we embrace these things... genetically genesplicing in more {{intelligent}} messaging, more {{things that would}} wake up people, in ways that might affect their life in more positive ways?

And for me, that was the hardest thing to find. And it took a while... How do we do what Orwell was doing, what Seuss was doing, and what Lucas had done - take these ideas that are so messed up <b>we</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about them, and repackage them into a comedy of irony?

40|$|Looking at {{philosophy}}—and I mean western {{philosophy to}} be more specific—in the course of its historical development {{that goes back to}} ancient Greece, it emerged as a thematic phenomenon in the spontaneous course of broadening the scope of the sphere of human intellectual achievements at the time when the ancient Greeks were deeply immersed in and dimly shrouded by the superstitions and mystifications that characterized its mythological religion dominated by the Olympus-based pantheon of gods and goddesses led by the ¨almighty¨ Zeus. If <b>we</b> <b>want</b> now <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of fiction, ancient mythological Greek religion was hardcore fiction. And the emergence of the first so-called philosophers was a welcome relief in the lives of a people fed up with the exploitative machination of a hyper-superstitious religion enslaving them for so many generations...|$|R
