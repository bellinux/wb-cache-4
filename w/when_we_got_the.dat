500|$|The program {{featured}} {{an interview}} with Morales's former attorney Robert Walton, who quoted him as having said, [...] "I was in Dallas <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> {{son of a bitch}} and I was in Los Angeles <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> little bastard." [...] O'Sullivan reported that the CIA {{declined to comment on the}} officers in question. It was also alleged that Morales was known for his deep anger toward the Kennedys for what he saw as their betrayal during the Bay of Pigs Invasion.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} {{successfully}} nominated in 2009, {{but failed to}} merit an award. Mark Hentemann, executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process, [...] "We had internal discussions in the writers' room, {{and it seemed like}} we were much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children's shows in animation. We assumed we would not get anywhere, and so it was a great surprise <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> nomination." ...|$|E
500|$|Doody and Kirshen {{describe}} {{the show as}} [...] "writing-heavy". Doody {{said in an interview}} with the British Comedy Guide: [...] "Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot say things like, [...] "It's almost too much." [...] I really like that. I like that it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> series, I honestly didn't know where we'd come up with the material of the quality we were determined to keep up." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} among four other episodes {{submitted}} by the Family Guy production team for consideration of an Emmy Award nomination, in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series category. [...] "And I'm Joyce Kinney" [...] was submitted, along with [...] "Halloween on Spooner Street", [...] "Road to the North Pole", [...] "New Kidney in Town" [...] and [...] "Trading Places". The series was successfully nominated in 2009, but failed to merit an award. Mark Hentemann, executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process, [...] "We had internal discussions in the writers' room, {{and it seemed like}} we were much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children's shows in animation.

500|$|Satisfied was {{released}} through Slanted Records on August 26, 2008, and debuted {{at its peak}} positions of number 116 on the Billboard 200 and number three on the Billboard Top Christian Albums charts. [...] First week sales nearly doubled those of DecembeRadio. [...] The album cover {{was the product of}} a spontaneous suggestion from the band's manager on the day of a photoshoot. [...] Another photo had been slated for the album cover, but the band found a swamp and acted on their manager's idea. [...] "We went down there, took off our shoes, rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and stood there for 45 minutes while we got our picture taken. It's a good thing we did it because <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> pictures back, those were by far our favorite!" [...] said Bunn.|$|E
500|$|However, NBC {{eventually}} {{opted not}} to put the show on the fall schedule, and instead delayed the premiere of the third season {{until the beginning of}} 2011. This allowed for the network to run its new comedy, Outsourced, in two-hour comedy schedule block rather than Parks and Recreation. The schedule change meant that all sixteen episodes from the third season would be filmed before any of them were shown; the rest of the episodes, starting with the seventh, were filmed in the fall of 2010. [...] NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the schedule changes were frustrating, but said: [...] "It sounds a little corny, maybe even a little community theater-ish, but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> bad news our thinking was to just put our heads down and keep making the best show we could." [...] Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice." [...] Poehler also said it gave them the luxury of time to go back and reedit episodes or shoot and add new material.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> video back and watched it, it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got to watch that again.'" [...] In an interview with the British magazine Rock Sound, Lee further explained the concept which was related with his departure: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The doctor {{allows you}} are making pretty good progress. The man who means to put you out must use a gun," [...] {{he said with a}} jolly laugh. [...] "Anyhow, we were bothered and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> {{bulletin}} we rushed the bar for drinks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is lucky," [...] he said, [...] "there is {{a fallen}} tree. So {{we shall have}} no {{difficulty}} about firewood.

6000|$|So they {{softened}} {{down and}} said it was all right; and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to <b>the</b> village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says: ...|$|R

6000|$|... “That’s so,” Jimmy put in. “My {{notion is}} that the flour was bad <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it. <b>The</b> ship-chandler fellow had a greedy eye. But when {{you deal with the}} man who finds the money you can’t be particular.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two of the {{servants}} were down {{with it as}} well," [...] he continued. [...] "We implored Lady Idlemay, when she offered us the letting of the house, to have the drains put in thorough order, but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> estimate out for her she absolutely declined. To tell you the truth, the best agents had all refused, under the circumstances, to have the house upon their books at all. That is why we got the letting of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jake looked thoughtful. [...] "They're strong antagonists; but I've {{a notion}} there's {{somebody}} on our side. In fact, I was puzzled <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> contract.

6000|$|... "Can't {{cultivate}} an ear {{for music}} in that cat nohow," [...] said Captain Jim. [...] "He won't stay {{long enough to}} learn to like it. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> organ up at the Glen church old Elder Richards bounced up from his seat the minute the organist began to play and scuttled {{down the aisle and}} out of the church at the rate of no-man's-business.

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> deer strung up I {{went off}} into the woods, and sat on a log, and contended with a queer sort of {{sickness}} until it passed away.

It would force me to try to analyze the psychology of hunting. Upon my return to Copple I found he had the buck ready to load upon his horse. His hands were bright red. He was wiping his hunting-knife on a bunch of green pine needles.|$|E
