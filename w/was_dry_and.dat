5|$|August 6, 2015: Hurricane Guillermo {{interacted with}} a longwave trough in the {{subtropical}} jet to its northeast to spawn a rare dry-season atmospheric river, which {{went on to}} send moisture toward the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing a rare lightning storm to that area that night. Since the storm <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> hardly brought any rain, the NWS issued a Red Flag Warning for that area.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human settlement at Little Thetford since the Neolithic Age. A 1996 search along the Anglian Water pipeline at Little Thetford—Cawdle Fen uncovered an important and unusually dense concentration of late Neolithic (3000–2201BC) remains. This is unusual because, although the fenland basin <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> forested during the Mesolithic era, the area was sometimes subject to marine incursions, and at other times, fresh-water flooding. This led to marshes and open water areas {{which may have been}} difficult to settle on—except perhaps for seasonal activity. A Neolithic polished flint axe (4000–2201BC) was found in the village in 1984 at Bedwell Hey Farm. Fourteen pre-Roman flints of various finishes were also discovered in 1998 at the same site.|$|E

25|$|Wingate set {{out from}} Imphal on 12 February 1943, with the Chindits {{organised}} into eight separate columns to cross the Chindwin river. The force met with initial success in putting {{one of the main}} railways in Burma out of action. But afterwards, Wingate led his force deep into Burma and then over the Irrawaddy river. Once the Chindits had crossed, they found conditions very different from that suggested by the intelligence they had received. The area <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> inhospitable, criss-crossed by motor roads which the Japanese were able to use to good effect, particularly in interdicting supply drops to the Chindits who soon began to suffer severely from exhaustion and shortages of water and food.|$|E
25|$|East Palo Alto also {{includes}} {{a small piece of}} land across the Bayshore Freeway (US 101) from the shopping center, a roughly triangular area between US 101 and San Francisquito Creek, formerly the site of a two-block-long retail business district known as Whiskey Gulch. The name dates back to the time that Stanford University, in Palo Alto to the west, <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> prohibited alcohol sales within a radius of one mile (1.6km) from the campus; Whiskey Gulch was just outside the limits, and was home to a number of liquor stores and bars. In 2000 the city tore down Whiskey Gulch and replaced it with the University Circle office complex. A 200-room Four Seasons hotel opened in University Circle in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{management}} of Kent International Airport (formerly RAF Manston) donated a Pickett-Hamilton fort to Lashenden Air Warfare Museum. Although {{most of the}} surviving forts are flooded, the fort at Manston <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> in superb condition. The fort was excavated and restored to working order by museum members {{over a period of}} 18 months. Although the fort was originally intended to be buried on an airfield there was concern that putting it in the ground might, over time, degrade the concrete. Therefore, the fort has been placed at ground level and surrounded with a cone of earth and sandbags. The lifting mechanism is in working order and can be activated by visitors putting a coin into a slot. This is the only fully restored Pickett-Hamilton fort.|$|E

25|$|After a {{reign of}} 45 years, Amenemhet III was succeeded by Amenemhet IV, whose nine-year reign is poorly attested. Clearly by this time, dynastic power began to weaken, for which several {{explanations}} have been proposed. Contemporary {{records of the}} Nile flood levels indicate {{that the end of}} the reign of Amenemhet III <b>was</b> <b>dry,</b> <b>and</b> crop failures may have helped to destabilize the dynasty. Further, Amenemhet III had an inordinately long reign, which tends to create succession problems. The latter argument perhaps explains why Amenemhet IV was succeeded by Sobekneferu, the first historically attested female king of Egypt. Sobekneferu ruled no more than four years, and as she apparently had no heirs, when she died the Twelfth Dynasty came to a sudden end as did the Golden Age of the Middle Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|During {{several of}} the summer {{months of the year}} 1783, when the effect of the sun's rays to heat the earth in these {{northern}} regions should have been greater, there existed a constant fog over all Europe, and a great part of North America. This fog was of a permanent nature; it <b>was</b> <b>dry,</b> <b>and</b> the rays of the sun seemed to have little effect towards dissipating it, as they easily do a moist fog, arising from water. They were indeed rendered so faint in passing through it, that when collected in the focus of a burning glass they would scarce kindle brown paper. Of course, their summer effect in heating the Earth was exceedingly diminished. Hence the surface was early frozen. Hence the first snows remained on it unmelted, and received continual additions. Hence the air was more chilled, and the winds more severely cold. Hence perhaps the winter of 1783–4 was more severe than any that had happened for many years.|$|E
500|$|Fruit was readily {{combined}} with meat, fish and eggs. The recipe for Tart de brymlent, a fish pie from the recipe collection Forme of Cury, includes {{a mix of}} figs, raisins, apples and pears with fish (salmon, codling or haddock) and pitted damson plums under the top crust. It was considered important {{to make sure that}} the dish agreed with contemporary standards of medicine and dietetics. This meant that food had to be [...] "tempered" [...] according to its nature by an appropriate combination of preparation and mixing certain ingredients, condiments and spices; fish was seen as being cold and moist, and best cooked in a way that heated and dried it, such as frying or oven baking, and seasoned with hot and dry spices; beef <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> hot and should therefore be boiled; pork was hot and moist and should therefore always be roasted. In some recipe collections, alternative ingredients were assigned with more consideration to the humoral nature than what a modern cook would consider to be similarity in taste. In a recipe for quince pie, cabbage is said to work equally well, and in another turnips could be replaced by pears.|$|E

500|$|The {{bus driver}} {{said that the}} crash {{was caused by the}} bus hitting a patch of black ice on the road, but James Hetfield later stated that he first {{believed}} the bus flipped because the driver was drunk. Hetfield also stated that he walked long distances down the road looking for black ice and found none. When local freelance photographer Lennart Wennberg (who attended the crash scene the following morning), was asked in a later interview about the likelihood that black ice caused the accident, he said it was 'out of the question' because the road <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> the temperature around , above the freezing point of [...] This was confirmed by police who – like Hetfield – also found no ice on the road. Ljungby detective Arne Pettersson was reported in a local newspaper to have said the tracks at the accident site were exactly like ones seen when drivers fall asleep at the wheel. However, the driver stated under oath that he had slept during the day and was fully rested; his testimony was confirmed by the driver of a second tour bus that was carrying the band's crew and equipment. The driver was determined not at fault for the accident and no charges were brought against him.|$|E
500|$|The Third Test in Adelaide was Morris's first Test as captain, after Hassett withdrew on match eve {{due to a}} {{strained}} hip muscle. Australia were already one batsman short after the Australian Board of Control had earlier vetoed the selection of Barnes [...] "for grounds other than cricketing ability", which was widely {{believed to be a}} result of Barnes' previous clashes with authority. Under board's regulations at the time, a replacement player needed the approval of the entire board. Since it was the weekend, some of the members could not be contacted by phone, and as a result Hassett could not be replaced by another specialist batsman from outside the twelve man squad. Instead, his place was taken by a specialist bowler already in the squad. This left Morris leading an extremely unbalanced team with four specialist batsmen and Miller as the all-rounder. Morris had a long tail with wicketkeeper Gil Langley and five specialist bowlers all with batting averages less than 23, and was reportedly [...] "in a state of shock". Morris won the toss and elected to bat on a sticky wicket. Because of a leak in the covers, one end of the pitch <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> the other was wet. Australia were bowled out for a low score of 82 but managed to restrict the West Indies to 105. In all 22 wickets fell on the first day, the most in a Test on Australian soil in 50 years. Morris proceeded to reverse the batting order in the second innings, with bowler Ian Johnson and Langley opening the batting. They were followed by bowlers Geff Noblet and Doug Ring, {{in order to protect the}} batsmen from a wicket that was still wet. Ring made an unexpected 67 and Morris scored 45 as Australia compiled 255, but it was not enough; the West Indies reached the target with six wickets in hand.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the second}} week of June to the end of winter, the weather {{patterns}} became quite unusual. Strong high-pressure systems over Tasmania and Victoria were virtually constant and allowed moist easterly air to flow consistently over New South Wales and Queensland. Combined with a series of upper-level lows lifting the moisture, this caused remarkably heavy rain except over the extreme south of New South Wales, where it <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> the ski season extremely poor. June 1950 was Sydney's wettest month on record with , whilst at Dorrigo {{on the edge of the}} coastal escarpment, over [...] fell in the last three weeks of the month and [...] on the 24th alone.

2500|$|The English Channel {{is thought}} to have been created between 450,000 and 180,000years ago by two catastrophic glacial lake {{outburst}} floods caused by the breaching of the Weald-Artois Anticline, a ridge that held back a large proglacial lake, now submerged under the North Sea. Around 10,000years ago, during the Devensian glaciation with its lower sea level, Great Britain was not an island, but an upland region of continental northwestern Europe, lying partially underneath the Eurasian ice sheet. The sea level was about [...] lower than today, and the bed of the North Sea <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> <b>and</b> acted as a land bridge, now known as Doggerland, to the Continent. It is generally thought that as sea levels gradually rose {{after the end of the}} last glacial period of the current ice age, Doggerland became submerged beneath the North Sea, cutting off what was previously the British peninsula from the European mainland by around 6500 BC.|$|E
2500|$|It {{only needed}} a {{significant}} fall in rainfall {{to cause a}} crisis, and in 1989-90 and 1990-91 Malawi’s rainfall was at best moderate and locally poor. This depleted smallholder food reserves before a deeper crisis in 1991-92. Rainfall before the 1991 planting season was low and sporadic. The withdrawal of fertilizer subsidies made a poor harvest poorer: only 40% of the normal maize crop was gathered in 1992. [...] After better rainfall and a good crop in 1992-93, the 1993-94 growing season <b>was</b> <b>dry,</b> <b>and</b> its harvest was below 50% of normal. Maize prices were very high, as household and ADMARC reserves were low and alternative foods were scarce. The crisis was caused by state regulation of agriculture, the diversion of resources to inefficient estates and failure to support smallholders growing food crops; all policies executed through ADMARC. Fertilizer subsidies and Malawi-wide ADMARC pricing and market coverage were no substitute for paying reasonable prices for the crops that farmers grew. Although withdrawal of subsidies exacerbated the agricultural decline, it originated in the policies the government had followed since ADMARC was formed.|$|E
