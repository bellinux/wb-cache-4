500|$|McQueen and MacGraw {{began an}} affair during production. She would {{eventually}} leave her husband Evans and become McQueen's second wife. Foster {{was worried that}} their relationship could have a potentially {{negative impact on the}} film by causing a [...] scandal. MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role. According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: [...] "After we had completed The Getaway and I looked at <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in it, I hated my own performance. I liked the picture, but I despised my own work." ...|$|E
500|$|Through {{the early}} 19th century, Thompson {{continued}} to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company, {{and for the}} few years {{when he had a}} total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether. He was known to have written [...] "I had made it a law to myself that no alcohol should pass the mountains in my company". When two of Thompson's trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson [...] "placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse rubbing his load against the rocks {{to get rid of it}} … I told them <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> and that I would do the same to every keg of alcohol." [...] Of course, wine, beer, rum and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time.|$|E

500|$|Looking back on {{the play}} years later, Regiels said [...] "I was embarrassed when I {{realized}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> I wanted a hole {{to open in the}} ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E
500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done...</b> was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going to}} be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Machine Gun" [...] {{is another}} song that Hendrix had {{spent more time}} developing. [...] By the Fillmore East concerts, it became an {{extended}} guitar improvisational piece, which [...] "would completely change the perception of Hendrix's capabilities as an improviser and musician", according to Shadwick. [...] Although based on a [...] "minor drone-blues" [...] {{in the line of}} [...] "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)", Hendrix's performance has been compared to jazz saxophonist John Coltrane's approach to improvisation. [...] Miles Davis, with whom Coltrane had recorded several albums in the 1950s, including the influential Kind of Blue, noted the connection: [...] "Jimi liked <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with Kind of Blue and some other stuff and wanted to add more jazz elements to what he was doing. [...] He liked the way Coltrane played with all those sheets of sound, and played his guitar in a similar way". [...] From Hendrix's dedication of the song [...] "to all the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York, oh yes, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam", [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is as much about the late 1960s American race riots as the war in Vietnam. [...] Guitarist Vernon Reid describes it as [...] "like a movie about war without the visuals. [...] It had everything—the lyrics, the humanism of it, the drama of it, the violence of it, the eeriness of it, [...] the unpredictability of it". [...] In many commentaries about Band of Gypsys, [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is singled out as the highlight of the album. [...] Both McDermott and Shadwick call it one of Hendrix's greatest achievements, which sets a standard {{that the rest of the}} album does not approach.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Canibus {{signed up}} for the United States Army. In a 2005 interview, Canibus stated [...] "I enlisted because I wanted {{to get away from the}} music...

Nichole was sitting down when I cut her throat.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{before it}} became {{possible}} to simulate molecular dynamics with computers, some undertook {{the hard work of}} trying it with physical models such as macroscopic spheres. The idea was to arrange them to replicate the properties of a liquid. J.D. Bernal said, in 1962: [...] "... I took a number of rubber balls and stuck them together with rods of a selection of different lengths ranging from 2.75 to 4 inches. I tried to do this in the first place as casually as possible, working in my own office, being interrupted every five minutes or so and not remembering <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> before the interruption." ...|$|E

I can talk about it now at 65 because it's sort of, dispassionate about it, and I've seen worse things since, but that gave me a bit of a turn, yes, I didn't enjoy that.
