5|$|Humans evolved {{for life}} in Earth gravity, and {{exposure}} to <b>weightlessness</b> {{has been shown to}} have deleterious effects on the health of the human body. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer term exposure to <b>weightlessness</b> results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.|$|E
5|$|Chaffee {{received}} his first spaceflight assignment in January 1966, {{when he was}} selected for the first manned Apollo-Saturn flight, AS-204. Joining Command Pilot Grissom and Senior Pilot White, he replaced the injured Donn F. Eisele in the third-ranked Pilot position. Eisele required surgery for a dislocated shoulder, which he sustained aboard the KC-135 <b>weightlessness</b> training aircraft. He was reassigned to a second Apollo crew, commanded by Wally Schirra.|$|E
5|$|Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton {{selected}} the first Apollo crew in January 1966, with Grissom as Command Pilot, White as Senior Pilot, and rookie Donn F. Eisele as Pilot. But Eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the KC135 <b>weightlessness</b> training aircraft, {{and had to}} undergo surgery on January 27. Slayton replaced him with Chaffee, and NASA announced the crew selection on March 21, 1966. James McDivitt, David Scott and Russell Schweickart were named as the backup crew.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{adverse effects of}} long-term <b>weightlessness</b> are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face. These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final phase was {{operational}} training for the astronauts. This focused on giving them hands-on experience using the instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight. They received training in the effects of microgravity and rapid acceleration. The astronauts spent time in simulators, aboard cargo planes that simulated <b>weightlessness,</b> underwater to practice extravehicular activities (EVAs), and on visits to manufacturing plants {{to check on the}} progress of the hardware.|$|E
5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by <b>weightlessness,</b> and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies to}} grow the Mercury {{spacecraft}} capabilities to long-duration flights, developing space rendezvous techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data {{on the effects of}} <b>weightlessness</b> on humans.|$|E
5|$|Because of his long-running {{television}} {{career and}} eccentric demeanour, Moore was widely recognised {{and became a}} popular public figure. In 1976 {{it was used to}} good effect for an April Fools' Day spoof on BBC Radio 2, when Moore announced a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event that meant that if listeners could jump at that exact moment, 9.47 a.m. they would experience a temporary sensation of <b>weightlessness.</b> The BBC received many telephone calls from listeners alleging they experienced the sensation. He was a key figure in the establishment of the International Birdman event in Bognor Regis, which was initially held in Selsey.|$|E
5|$|NASA astronauts train {{underwater}} {{to simulate}} the <b>weightlessness</b> and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40ffw (12mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50fsw (6–15msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be breathed in the preflight surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly {{by a factor of}} seven to nine times compared with air. A study by another military organization, the Special Operations Command also indicated that preflight oxygen might be an effective means for reducing DCS risk.|$|E
5|$|The post-flight {{analysis}} {{reported no}} major malfunctions—the only troublesome anomaly being the suit temperature controls— {{and all the}} engineering objectives of the mission were deemed successfully completed. The fuel-conservation measures {{were found to have}} worked particularly well, with even less fuel than anticipated being consumed; despite the technical changes, the official report gave full credit for this to the pilot. The medical analysis found no significant physiological effects from nine hours of <b>weightlessness,</b> and noted that Schirra had received no significant radiation exposure. Analysis of the radiation-sensitive plates confirmed {{that there had been a}} very low radioactive flux inside the spacecraft, and the six ablative materials tested were all deemed broadly satisfactory despite some difficulty comparing them to each other.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for <b>weightlessness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} space station Horizon sends a distress signal to the ISIS agency, stating that the spaceship has been under attack. Anthony Drake (Bryan Cranston), {{the commander of the}} station, has urged ISIS to assist the crew in controlling the situation. A reluctant Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler) is the first one to voice concern over the issue, as none of them have undergone training in preparation for a flight. Despite these concerns, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter) is quick to take the job for financial gain. The field agents of ISIS—except Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin), who is being evaluated by Doctor Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates) for medical purposes—are subjected to basic astronaut regimens in anticipation for the flight, including a flight simulator (which Archer makes Cyril crash), and <b>weightlessness</b> training, which causes Lana to vomit copiously {{because of the lack of}} gravity.|$|E
25|$|Howard {{anticipated}} {{difficulty in}} portraying <b>weightlessness</b> in a realistic manner. He discussed this with Steven Spielberg, who suggested using a KC-135 airplane, {{which can be}} flown {{in such a way}} as to create about 23 seconds of <b>weightlessness,</b> a method NASA has always used to train its astronauts for space flight. Howard obtained NASA's permission and assistance in filming in the realistic conditions aboard multiple KC-135 flights.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the advent}} of space {{stations}} that can be inhabited for long periods, exposure to <b>weightlessness</b> has been demonstrated to have some deleterious effects on human health. Humans are well-adapted to the physical conditions at {{the surface of the}} Earth. In response to an extended period of <b>weightlessness,</b> various physiological systems begin to change and atrophy. Though these changes are usually temporary, long term health issues can result.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the advent}} of space {{stations}} that can be inhabited {{for long periods of}} time, exposure to <b>weightlessness</b> has been demonstrated to have some deleterious effects on human health. Humans are well-adapted to the physical conditions at the surface of the earth, and so in response to <b>weightlessness,</b> various physiological systems begin to change, and in some cases, atrophy. Though these changes are usually temporary, some do have a long-term impact on human health.|$|E
25|$|Various filmed inserts {{presented}} by James Burke, featuring him inside the Apollo Command Module, demonstrating Apollo Saturn emergency precautions, demonstrating the Lunar EVA suit and explaining <b>weightlessness</b> training.|$|E
25|$|The term micro-g {{environment}} (also µg, {{often referred}} to by the term microgravity) {{is more or less}} a synonym of <b>weightlessness</b> and zero-G, but indicates that g-forces are not quite zero, just very small.|$|E
25|$|Although the Earth's pull due {{to gravity}} in LEO is not much less than {{on the surface of}} the Earth, people and objects in orbit {{experience}} <b>weightlessness</b> because they are in free fall.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} problem {{experienced}} by humans {{in the initial}} hours of <b>weightlessness</b> is known as space adaptation syndrome or SAS, {{commonly referred to as}} space sickness. It is related to motion sickness, and arises as the vestibular system adapts to <b>weightlessness.</b> Symptoms of SAS include nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The first case of SAS was reported by cosmonaut Gherman Titov in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition. The duration of space sickness varies, but rarely has it lasted for more than 72 hours, after which the body adjusts to the new environment.|$|E
25|$|The Zero Gravity Corporation, {{founded in}} 1993 by Peter Diamandis, Byron Lichtenberg, and Ray Cronise, {{operates}} a modified Boeing 727 which flies parabolic arcs to create 25–30 seconds of <b>weightlessness.</b> Flights may be purchased for both tourism and research purposes.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to <b>weightlessness</b> causes {{changes to}} the signals from the receptors to touch, pressure, and gravity, i.e., all {{information}} necessary for postural stability. Adaptive modifications in the central processing of sensory information take place to produce motor responses that are appropriate for the new gravitational environment. As a result, terrestrial motor strategies are progressively abandoned in <b>weightlessness,</b> as astronauts adapt to the weightless environment. This is particularly true for the major postural muscles found in the lower legs. The modifications in posture, movement, and locomotion acquired in reduced gravity are then inappropriate for Earth's gravity upon return. After landing, postural instability approaching clinical ataxia is manifested {{as a result of}} this in-flight neural reorganization.|$|E
25|$|To sum up, we {{have two}} notions of weight of which weight1 is dominant. Yet 'weightlessness' is {{typically}} exemplified not by absence of weight1 but {{by the absence of}} stress associated with weight2. This is the intended sense of <b>weightlessness</b> in what follows below.|$|E
25|$|WK2 {{will provide}} preview flights {{offering}} several seconds of <b>weightlessness</b> before the suborbital event. It {{is intended to}} have a service ceiling of about 60,000ft (18km), offering a dark blue sky to passengers. This will allow tourists to practice before the real flight.|$|E
25|$|He {{accumulated}} 7307 parabolas, totaling 39h 18m in <b>weightlessness,</b> {{equivalent to}} 26.2 Earth orbits, {{more than the}} first American, the first Russian, or the first Chinese astronauts. He accumulated a total of 52m in Martian gravity and 49m 30s in lunar gravity during partial-g parabolic flights.|$|E
25|$|Sensory and {{sensorimotor}} disturbances when {{arriving in}} low Earth orbit are well documented, the most known of these being space motion sickness (SMS). Individual differences, spacecraft size, and body movements cause SMS symptoms. Typically lasting {{the first three}} or four days of <b>weightlessness,</b> symptoms range from headaches and fatigue to nausea and vomiting. The consequences vary from simple discomfort to possible incapacitation, creating potential problems during extra-vehicular activity, re-entry, and emergency egress from the spacecraft. The body receives a variety of conflicting signals from the visual, somato-sensory, and vestibular organs in <b>weightlessness.</b> These conflicting inputs are thought to be the primary cause of SMS, but the precise mechanisms of the conflict are not well understood. Medications currently used to alleviate the symptoms produce undesirable side effects.|$|E
25|$|In <b>weightlessness,</b> astronauts {{must rely}} {{much more on}} vision to {{maintain}} their spatial orientation, because the otolith organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous illusions of self-motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based {{studies suggest that the}} CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” ambiguity based on the frequency content of the linear acceleration detected by the otolith organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to <b>weightlessness</b> presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to spatial disorientation and SMS.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{effects of}} {{long-term}} <b>weightlessness</b> include muscle atrophy, {{deterioration of the}} skeleton (osteopenia), fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, and puffiness of the face.|$|E
25|$|Of course, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to remove all hazards; the most important factor affecting human physical well-being in space is <b>weightlessness,</b> more accurately defined as Micro-g environment. Living in this type of environment impacts the body in three important ways: loss of proprioception, changes in fluid distribution, and deterioration of the musculoskeletal system.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that astronauts in orbit are weightless because they have flown high enough to escape the Earth's gravity. In fact, {{at an altitude of}} , equivalent to a typical orbit of the Space Shuttle, gravity is still nearly 90% as strong as at the Earth's surface. <b>Weightlessness</b> actually occurs because orbiting objects are in free-fall.|$|E
25|$|The crew of an {{interstellar}} {{ship would}} face several significant hazards, including the psychological effects of long-term isolation, {{the effects of}} exposure to ionizing radiation, and the physiological effects of <b>weightlessness</b> to the muscles, joints, bones, immune system, and eyes. There also exists the risk of impact by micrometeoroids and other space debris. These risks represent challenges {{that have yet to}} be overcome.|$|E
25|$|Although {{investigations}} of higher cognitive processes, such as navigation and mental rotation are limited, the astronauts frequently {{report that the}} spacecraft interiors look longer and higher than they actually are, {{and a reduction in}} the perceived height of three-dimensional objects is observed in-flight compared with pre-flight, suggesting an alteration in the mental representation of three-dimensional cues in <b>weightlessness.</b> Perception is a model of the brain, a hypothesis about the world that presupposes the Newton's laws of motion. These laws change in <b>weightlessness</b> and, therefore, one could expect changes in the mental representation of objects’ shape and distance during spaceflight. The rare investigations carried out in space so far have not demonstrated drastic changes, probably because the CNS continues to use an internal model of gravity, at least for a short while. It can be speculated that the way of processing three dimensions will be more developed after a long absence of a gravitational reference.|$|E
25|$|Inertial mass {{is found}} by {{applying}} a known net force to an unknown mass, measuring the resulting acceleration, and applying Newton's Second Law, m = F/a. This gives an accurate value for mass, {{limited only by}} {{the accuracy of the}} measurements. When astronauts need to be measured in the <b>weightlessness</b> of free fall, they actually find their inertial mass in a special chair called a body mass measurement device (BMMD).|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} small (1mm) adult Caenorhabditis elegans worms, living in petri dishes {{enclosed}} in aluminum canisters, survived reentry and impact {{with the ground}} and were recovered weeks after the disaster. The culture {{was found to be}} alive on April 28, 2003. The worms were part of a biological research in canisters experiment designed to study the effect of <b>weightlessness</b> on physiology; the experiment was conducted by Cassie Conley, NASA's planetary protection officer.|$|E
25|$|When the {{gravitational}} field is non-uniform, {{a body in}} free fall suffers tidal effects and is not stress-free. Near a black hole, such tidal effects can be very strong. In {{the case of the}} Earth, the effects are minor, especially on objects of relatively small dimension (such as the human body or a spacecraft) and the overall sensation of <b>weightlessness</b> in these cases is preserved. This condition is known as microgravity and it prevails in orbiting spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{experience}} {{their own}} body weight {{as a result}} of this supporting force, which results in a normal force applied to a person by the surface of a supporting object, on which the person is standing or sitting. In the absence of this force, a person would be in free-fall, and would experience <b>weightlessness.</b> It is the transmission of this reaction force through the human body, and the resultant compression and tension of the body's tissues, that results in the sensation of weight.|$|E
25|$|Another current {{research}} {{interest is the}} creation of Bose–Einstein condensates in microgravity in order to use its properties for high precision atom interferometry. The first demonstration of a BEC in <b>weightlessness</b> was archived in 2008 at a drop tower in Bremen, Germany by a consortium of researches led by Ernst M. Rasel from Leibniz University of Hanover. The same team demonstrated in 2017 the first creation of a Bose–Einstein condensate in space and it is also subject of two upcoming experiments on the International Space Station.|$|E
