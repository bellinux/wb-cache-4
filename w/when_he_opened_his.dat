25|$|Noël Corbu {{circulated}} {{the story}} from the mid-1950s <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> restaurant that Saunière discovered parchments in the hollow pillar of his Altar in 1891, and these related to the treasure of Blanche of Castile, and which 'according to the archives' consisted of 28,500,000 gold pieces. This was the treasure of the French crown assembled by Blanche of Castile to pay the ransom of Saint Louis, a prisoner of the infidels, the surplus of which she had hidden at Rennes-le-Château. Saunière had only found one part of it, so {{it was necessary to}} continue his investigations.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, Brown {{was one of}} a few African-Americans {{practicing}} law in San Francisco <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> own business. He practiced criminal defense law, representing pimps, prostitutes and other clients that more prominent attorneys would not represent. One early case was to defend Mario Savio on his first civil disobedience arrest. He quickly became involved in the Civil Rights Movement, leading a well-orchestrated sit-in to protest housing discrimination after a local real estate office refused to work with him because of his race. Brown helped organize the public protest and helped attract media coverage. His role in the protests gave him the notoriety to run for the State Assembly.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after taking}} office, Laffoon {{organized}} the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels, a charitable organization {{of people who}} had been commissioned as honorary Kentucky colonels. During his term as governor, Laffoon commissioned 2,368 honorary colonels, the most ever by a Kentucky governor. His best known commission was to Harland Sanders, who used the title [...] "Colonel" [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants. Other colonels commissioned by Laffoon included Mae West, Shirley Temple, Clark Gable, Bing Crosby, Will Rogers, Fred Astaire, Jean Harlow, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Jack Dempsey and W. C. Fields.|$|E
500|$|Laffoon's {{feud with}} Lieutenant Governor Chandler {{continued}} throughout his term and affected the 1935 gubernatorial race. (At the time, {{the lieutenant governor}} was elected independently from the governor.) Term-limited by the state constitution, Laffoon supported political boss Tom Rhea to succeed him as governor, and convinced the Democrats to again hold a nominating convention to choose their gubernatorial nominee. This would have greatly improved Laffoon's chances of hand-picking his successor. While Laffoon was {{on a visit to}} Washington, D.C., Chandler was left as acting governor under the provisions of the Kentucky Constitution. Chandler issued a call for a special legislative session to consider a mandatory primary election bill. Laffoon rushed back to the state to invalidate the call, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld it as constitutional, and the primary law was passed. Chandler defeated Rhea in the primary, and went on to succeed Laffoon as governor. Following his term in office, Laffoon returned to his native Madisonville, where he died of a stroke in 1941. Among his gubernatorial legacies was appointing a record number of Kentucky colonels, including Harland Sanders, who used the title [...] "Colonel" [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to this angle, the IWA began hinting that Colón would be joining a heel stable known as [...] "Capitol Sports" [...] (borrowing the name that WWC used during the 1970s-90s), which in storyline was being covertly operated by González in cooperation with his [...] "business partners" [...] (a reference to Colón, Sr. and Jovica) {{with the intention of}} taking over the promotion. In a segment of their television show, the company ran a script where a surprise arrival was announced, which was promoted as [...] "a young wrestler [...] with a tremendous future in the United States [...] who has Capitol flowing through veins" [...] and with whom González had differences in the past that were overcome <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> eyes (in reference to WWC's heel turn) so that he could [...] "complete" [...] an unspecified task in the invasion. The IWA further mocked Colón in a skit where Savio Vega dismissed this revelation, citing that he had video evidence of a match where Flash Flanagan (who was active in the promotion performing as [...] "Slash Venom") pinned him at OVW. This angle was concluded in a segment where González berated an unknown individual during a call for being unable to appear in a card, claiming that [...] "he [...] as mediocre as [...] father and brother".|$|E

Although Agari looks scary, he is actually rather shy. He hides underneath the water with only his fin visible because he is too nervous to speak, mainly because he often ends up scaring people <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> mouth and flashes his many sharp teeth. Therefore, he uses body language to communicate instead.|$|R

5000|$|Each Marx Brother {{has his own}} form of comedy. Zeppo is at <b>his</b> funniest <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>his</b> {{mouth and}} sings. It has taken forty years, of course, for the full humor to come across. For a normal comedian this may be bad timing, but for a Marx Brother it's immortality. Almost every crooner of 1932 looks stilted and awkward now, but with Zeppo, who was never very convincing in the first place, the effect crosses the {{threshold}} into lovable comedy.
