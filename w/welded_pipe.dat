40|$|Creep {{deformation}} in <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> {{and plates}} {{is of particular}} importance in the power industries. Most failures of <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> occur in the type IV region at the boundary with the parent material, which is relatively much harder. This thesis extends the work of Nicol (1985), Hawkes (1989) and Newman (1993) on the Cosserat theory of plates and shells, and has two major aims. The first is to develop the work of Hawkes to model successfully the strain rates in four-zone, thickwalled <b>welded</b> <b>pipes.</b> It is possible {{to determine the effects}} that the thickness of the pipe wall, the radius of the pipe and the creep index, n, in Norton's law have on the strain-rate distribution throughout the pipe. Using Continuum Damage Mechanics and this Cosserat model, the position and time to rupture in <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> is then calculated. The second aim of this thesis is to develop further the initial modelling work of Nicol (1985) and Hawkes (1989) by obtaining some simple perturbation models for both <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> and plates. The results obtained with the perturbation solutions are then compared with the numerical solutions of Newman (1993) for a plate and the numerical solutions derived in this thesis for a pipe...|$|R

40|$|This article {{contains}} an overview on automated ultrasonic weld inspection for various pipe types. Some inspection steps might by {{carried out with}} portable test equipment (e. g. pipe end test), but the weld inspection in all internationally relevant specifications must be automated. The pipe geometry, the production process, and the further pipe usage determine if NDT is required and thus, the number of required ultrasonic probes. Recent updates for some test specifications enforce {{a large number of}} ultrasonic probes, e. g. the SHELL standard. To save production cost, seamless pipes are sometimes replaced by ERW (electric-resistance <b>welded)</b> <b>pipes</b> and LSAW (submerged-arc <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> with longitudinal seam) pipes by SSAW (submerged-arc <b>welded</b> <b>pipes</b> with spiral seam) pipes, the inspection methods change gradually between the various pipe types.

50|$|Responding to her {{research}} findings {{and to other}} testimony from business, on June 20, 2008, U.S. steel pipe manufacturers, who have been battling a surge in imports from China, won a major victory when the International Trade Commission {{cleared the way for}} the imposition of stiff penalty tariffs for the next five years. The commission voted 5-0 that the U.S. industry was being harmed by the import of circular steel pipe from China. The decision marked the first time a U.S. industry has won a decision to impose tariffs on a Chinese product based on the argument that the Chinese government was unfairly subsidizing a Chinese industry.

After the concept proved itself useful it was made famous by being used for the largest conventional bomb in the U.S. military's arsenal at the time, the BLU-82.

Measurements have been made on pipes subjected to varying degrees of plastic pre-straining before welding, in order to assess the effects of plastic strain on the weld residual stresses and the intergranular strains in the material. The intergranular strains following plastic deformation will also be affected by the annealing effect of the <b>welding.</b> <b>Pipes</b> were initially prepared with plastic strain of 0, 10, 15, 20 and 25 % plastic deformation. Thereafter, the pipes were cut in half and welded with a circumferential butt-weld.
