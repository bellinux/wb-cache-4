25|$|The {{citizens}} of the city (controlled by the game player) earn the money by driving around a vehicle for a given amount of time, picking up passengers and taking them to their destinations. The player receives money upon successfully dropping off each passenger, and bonuses are obtained when they are transported in {{a short amount of}} time. Players have to avoid certain hurdles, such as other vehicles and Burns' nuclear transit buses. The game contains seventeen different collectible vehicles, six starting locations, and ten different missions. In order to collect the vehicles and unlock starting locations, players must earn progressively more money for each vehicle or starting location they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> <b>In</b> order to complete missions, players must do certain things (such as protecting Krusty the Clown from a fan mob by driving him away, and getting Homer to his workplace unnoticed).|$|E

Jarrah began to roll the airplane left and right to knock the passengers off balance.

Hold from the inside. Hold." [...] Jarrah changed tactics at 09:59:52 and pitched the nose of the airplane up and down to disrupt the assault.|$|E
500|$|In December 1962, the Beatles {{concluded}} {{their fifth}} and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, {{they had agreed}} that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, {{in an effort to}} maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, [...] "Look, if you really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> these bigger places, you're {{going to have to change}} – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ..." [...] Lennon said: [...] "We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality." ...|$|E

You can go into the green zone if they let you, but DO NOT go into the red zone.'" [...] He said that they [...] "were {{absolutely}} sure we would never get past the first checkpoint. It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a [...] "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage that if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." [...] He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.|$|E

While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, I {{grew up in the}} church, I have a very religious family. I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I never look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Dappy {{described}} the song as being [...] "up-tempo, fast, party music" [...] {{as well as}} being [...] "Up-to-date and about Facebook and stuff." [...] The song lyrics follow a theme of infatuation and disappointment with each member describing their own personal experience of how they met someone they thought was 'The one' and how the person left before {{they were able to get}} the phone number. References by Dappy include how he searched on Facebook for the woman he never got a phone number from. Tulisa's story includes how she wore a [...] "LBD" [...] and [...] "Bang bang shoes" [...] when leaving her date for a moment to go to the ladies bathroom at a club and on return discovering he left her without his phone number. Despite the lyric in the song referring to searching for someone you are in love with on Facebook, in an interview with Hollyoaks, Dappy said that that is not something he does: If I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> touch with someone, I'll just ring them, man. A lot of girls might be trying to find me on Facebook, but they won't. They'll find a fake one.|$|E

2500|$|Avatar: The Last Airbender co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko voiced {{their opinion}} within an {{interview}} regarding Shyamalan writing, directing, and producing the film. The two displayed much enthusiasm over Shyamalan's {{decision for the}} adaptation, stating that they admire his work and, in turn, he respects their material. Producer Frank Marshall explained that they have high hopes to stick to a PG rating. [...] "I'm not even sure we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the PG-13 realm. Furthermore, Shyamalan said, [...] "A lot of {{the inspiration for the}} direction we took comes from a friend of mine. A Nathan Blackmer helped shape this Idea into the film it became. I took away {{a little bit of the}} slapsticky stuff that was there for the little little kids, the fart jokes and things like that...We grounded Katara's brother...and that really did wonderful things for the whole theme of the movie." [...] Paramount's president Brad Grey said that despite the director's career being inconsistent, he [...] "believed in [...] vision and that he could execute it," [...] adding that [...] "It's a bold step because he had to create a potential new franchise." [...] The studio was willing to spend $250 million in a trilogy of films, one for each season. The Last Airbenders budget wound up being $150 million, with later over $130 million being spent on marketing costs, making it Shyamalan's most expensive film. During production, the name Avatar was removed from the title to avoid confusion with the highly-successful 2009 film Avatar.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{getting the}} job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early [...] "mood reels" [...] saying, [...] "I don’t know what the {{situation}} would be, {{but that would be}} a person he’d <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> trouble with." [...] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that [...] "at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death." [...] He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet, and that filming would begin in June 2016. In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt. It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay, and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch; both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay. The pair had proposed a take on the character that was [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a [...] of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them in this film. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character and [...] "what {{it would be like to}} be a real kid who gets superpowers", rather than the [...] "drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well. Daley called the film [...] "an origin story of him finding his place in the Marvel [...] Universe", with the writing team wanting the film to [...] "focus on [...] coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses," [...] such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, [...] "Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie." [...] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as [...] "the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington D.C." [...] One of the first sequences they pitched was [...] "seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. If you have a character that you’re so familiar with, and you’re familiar with the sort of areas he’s been in, why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven’t seen before?" [...] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, [...] "low-stakes" [...] approach than previous films, in part to Spider-Man existing in a world with the Avengers, since [...] "if the threat became world-threatening, you would obviously bring in the big guys to handle it." ...|$|E
