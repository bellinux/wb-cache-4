With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.|$|E
500|$|The Irish {{songwriter}} John Lyons (b. 1934) {{wrote the}} popular song The Kilkenny Louse House. The song contains the lines [...] "Well {{we went up}} the stairs and <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the light, Sure in less than five minutes, I had to show fight. For the fleas and the bugs they collected to march, And over me stomach they formed a great arch". It has been recorded by Christie Purcell (1952), Mary Delaney on From Puck to Appleby (2003), and the Dubliners on Double Dubliners (1972) among others.|$|E

500|$|Consequently, {{there was}} a demand for bootleg {{recordings}} of the band. The most notorious of these was an LP entitled H Bomb, recorded at Aachen on 11 July 1970, {{which led to a}} subsequent court case when Virgin Records' Richard Branson was prosecuted for selling it. An article in Melody Maker that examined the bootleg phenomenon claimed that H Bomb was the best selling one at that time. This success, along with albums from other artists such as the Who's Live at Leeds and the Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out convinced the band that an official live album would be commercially successful. [...] At the time, Glover told Sounds magazine that [...] "there are so many bootlegs of us going around, if <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> our own live set, it should kill their market." ...|$|E

Say Anything on record will now be identified in the same way Nine Inch Nails is, in that it’s pretty much me and whoever I choose to play with at the time. Live shows will continue to have their own identity including Jake, Jeff, Parker, Adam, and whoever plays drums for us live. The band couldn’t be further from breaking up, and as I’ve said recently, we plan on releasing music as Say Anything forever, and already have a lot in the works." ...|$|E

In a March interview with Vibe, after the interviewer referred to the song as the album's first single, Schoolboy Q stated [...] " [...] is not a single, but it's a record <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> there." [...] It was conclusively deemed a buzz single. In April, Schoolboy Q announced that an official remix of the song would be released featuring American trap rapper Jeezy. However, in August 2013, he would later tell MTV that the remix had not come together and would not be released.

2500|$|Apocryphal {{legend has}} it that in 1961, {{longtime}} magazine and comic book publisher Martin Goodman was playing golf with either Jack Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of rival company DC Comics, then known as National Periodical Publications, [...] and that the top executive bragged about DC's success with the new superhero team the Justice League of America. While film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan has debunked the particulars of that story, Goodman, a publishing trend-follower, aware of the JLA's strong sales, did direct his comics editor, Stan Lee, to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee, writing in 1974, [...] "Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most.

"Once we {{came away}} {{with the success of}} February Son, we kind of fell into the trap that a lot of bands do that have success with their first one, who think 'Well, we're just {{going to do it again}} -- let's go {{platinum}} this time.' We attempted to broaden the scope of what <b>we</b> were <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> there. Instead of just <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> rock songs, <b>we</b> had other types of music that we were exploring and <b>we</b> tried to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> a broader plain of music. That made it a little bit more difficult for people to get their head around it -- especially if they were into the rock and roll aspect of this band." ...|$|R

2500|$|While on the Never Say Never tour, fellow {{group members}} Swifty and Kuniva (D12) along with Royce Da 5'9" [...] stopped by KISS 100FM for a live {{interview}} and spoke on Relapse. Royce {{stated that the}} album will be a game changer and jokingly said {{he might have to}} push his own album back three years after Eminem drops his. Kuniva added that D12 recorded many tracks for Relapse but wasn't sure if they would make the album or not. Swifty then confirmed that Eminem would be dropping two albums in 2009, with Relapse 2 following Relapse. Relapse was re-released on December 21, 2009, as Relapse: Refill, with seven bonus tracks and including the single [...] "Forever" [...] (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack), [...] "Taking My Ball" [...] (released with DJ Hero), and five previously unreleased tracks. On its re-release, Eminem stated: [...] "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> Relapse 2 next year".|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting {{one foot in front of}} the other. The song reminds us of the early days when <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2010 Ras Kass {{launched}} a Kickstarter campaign {{to fund the}} manufacture of 1,000 CDs and 500 records for his A.D.I.D.A.S. (All Day I Dream About Spittin) project and a viral marketing campaign called [...] "Save The Ras Kass", which included a series of satirical web episodes {{about the plight of}} the endangered emcee. In an interview with MTV UK writer Han O'Connor he explained his decision to use Kickstarter, stating [...] "we started trying different angles at solving old problems. Kickstarter was the natural evolution of trying creative new business models. When <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> The Quarterly there were people that said, ‘well how come you didn’t create a CD for this?’ and I’m like ‘well if I have to spend that $5000 and you want one, I appreciate it but there’s the small problem that I spent $5000.’" [...] His webisodes document the downfall of an emcee, as he explained, [...] "You just see this downward spiral; it’s just that fall from grace and I’m kind of making fun of that and using me as the vehicle for it." [...] Finally, Ras Kass exceeded the $3,800 needed for the record in less than five days, with the project being released as a limited edition double CD and LP on July 20, 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Because Eminem {{recorded}} {{far more}} material {{than he could}} use for one album and {{felt that he had}} to offer his fans more music after staying on hiatus for so long, fellow D12 member Swift confirmed that Eminem in fact had planned to put out two albums the same year, following with Relapse2, in late 2009. According to Angela Yee's Shade 45 interview with Eminem on April 23, 2009, Relapse2 was to be a continuation of Relapse. During the interview, Eminem confirmed: [...] "It's extremely close to being finished, it just depends on how many songs I want to put on it." [...] Eminem also explained the album was more [...] "emotionally driven" [...] than Relapse, which was, as he explains, [...] " [...] rap records". Guest appearances were expected to come from the likes of Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Royce da 5'9", Lloyd Banks and Cashis. The album was subsequently pushed back for an early 2010 release, so Eminem decided to re-release Relapse as Relapse: Refill with seven new tracks, including the single [...] "Forever" [...] (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack) and [...] "Taking My Ball" [...] (released with DJ Hero), as well as five previously unreleased tracks. On its re-release, Eminem stated: [...] "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned.
