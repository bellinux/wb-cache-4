25|$|Intra-Palestinian {{fighting}} and PLO-Israeli conflict continued, and July 24, 1981, Habib brokered a cease-fire agreement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and Israel: {{the two sides}} agreed to cease hostilities in Lebanon proper and along the Israeli border with Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|Petra Schelm (August 1950 – 15 July 1971) {{joined the}} Baader-Meinhof group {{along with her}} boyfriend Manfred Grashof. She {{travelled}} to Jordan alongside {{the rest of the}} Faction and trained in urban guerrilla warfare <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> in May 1970.|$|E
25|$|Habash aligned the PFLP <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and the Lebanese National Movement, but stayed neutral {{during the}} Lebanese Civil War {{in the late}} 1970s. After a stroke in 1980, when {{he was living in}} Damascus, his health {{declined}} and other PFLP members rose to the top.|$|E
5|$|When Israel besieged Beirut in 1982, al-Wazir, {{disagreed}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> leftist {{members and}} Salah Khalaf; he proposed that <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> {{pull out of}} Beirut. Nevertheless, al-Wazir and his aide Abu al-Walid planned Beirut's defense and helped direct <b>PLO</b> forces against <b>the</b> IDF. <b>PLO</b> forces were eventually defeated and then expelled from Lebanon, <b>with</b> most of <b>the</b> leadership relocating to Tunis, although al-Wazir and 264 other PLO members were received by King Hussein of Jordan.|$|R
50|$|Boueiz is {{a lawyer}} by profession. He served as foreign {{minister}} from 1990 to 1992 when he left office {{for a few months}} following the general elections of 1992 and was temporarily replaced by Nasri Maalouf in the post. It was Boueiz who participated in a first official meeting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> Farouk Qaddumi, head of the group's political department, in the mid-May 1991 after a long period.|$|R
5000|$|Sabri Jiryis, {{acting as}} his {{brothers}} attorney, {{claimed that the}} suspicions were baseless. Jiryis said the security services had been tracking his brother for nine months, and that during his interrogation, he was presented with a recording of a phone call during which his brother was heard rejecting the Iranian agents' offer of assistance. [...] "'My brother is a very secular man, affiliated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> centrist stream, who believes in peace talks and a two-state solution for two nations,' he told Haaretz, and added: [...] "What {{they are trying to}} ascribe to him contradicts his political outlook." ...|$|R
25|$|He {{is opposed}} to Israeli {{settlement}} activity and {{was among the first}} to praise the Oslo Accords and talks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> In his speeches and essays he frequently attacks the non-Zionist left and always emphasizes his Zionist identity. He is perceived as an eloquent spokesperson of the Zionist left.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} vacuum {{resulting from}} the 1985 Israeli withdrawal would eventually lead to the de facto Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Syria would gain much more power over Lebanon than what it enjoyed before 1982, but {{it would no longer}} align <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> In the War of the Camps that followed the Israeli withdrawal, Syria fought their former Palestinian allies.|$|E
25|$|In {{part due}} to the Israeli-Palestinian {{discourse}} engendered by Peace Now and its activists, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin and Yasser Arafat succeeded in signing the Declaration of Principles/Oslo Accords on the lawn of the White House on 13 September 1993. Peace Now was the first Israeli organisation to meet <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> at a time when such an undertaking was deemed illegal by the Israeli government.|$|E
500|$|During the Black September clashes in Jordan, al-Wazir {{supplied}} the encircled Palestinian forces in Jerash and Ajlun with arms and aid, [...] but the conflict was decided in Jordan's favor. After Arafat {{and thousands of}} Fatah fighters retreated to Lebanon, al-Wazir negotiated an agreement between King Hussein and <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> leading organizer, calling for better Palestinian conduct in Jordan. Then, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other <b>PLO</b> leaders, he relocated to Beirut.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{research}} for the TRAC database {{began in the late}} 1990s, as global awareness of terrorism was rising due to activities of groups like FARC, the IRA, and Pakistani groups associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Taliban. <b>The</b> <b>PLO</b> profile was <b>the</b> first profile developed and impetus for the articles on terrorism in nationalist and separatist movements. TRAC's coverage of Islamist terrorism expanded as the demand for research on terrorism responded to the 9/11 attacks in New York City.|$|R
25|$|As {{the crisis}} unfolded, {{attempts}} were made to negotiate the release of the hostages. According to declassified diplomatic documents, the Egyptian government under Sadat tried to negotiate <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and <b>the</b> Ugandan government. <b>PLO</b> chairman Yasser Arafat sent his political aide Hani al-Hassan to Uganda as a special envoy to negotiate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hostage takers and <b>with</b> Amin. However, <b>the</b> PFLP-EO hijackers refused to see him.|$|R
25|$|In 1993, he {{took part}} in forming Gush Shalom, the Israeli Peace Bloc—a {{grassroots}} peace movement in whose ranks Peled alternately expressed a sharp criticism of his old friend Rabin for severe human rights violations in the occupied territories; warmly commended and congratulated him for his dramatic rapprochement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and the handshake with Arafat on the White House lawn; and finally expressed a growing worry and anxiety at {{the slow pace of}} the peace process and the continuing occupation, oppression and settlement activity—which gave ample opportunity, as Peled wrote in several admonitory articles, to extremists on both sides to create a renewed dynamic of escalation.|$|E
25|$|Saad's killing {{brought his}} family and the PNO {{widespread}} public sympathy and boosted their reputation among the Lebanese left and the Sunni Muslim community. Despite his previous tensions <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> Saad's funeral in Sidon on 7 March became a scene of Lebanese-Palestinian solidarity and was the second largest public show {{of support for the}} PLO in Lebanese history, quickly becoming a huge anti-government protest. Subsequently, countrywide small-scale clashes erupted between Saad's supporters—Lebanese and Palestinian, including the PLO—and the Lebanese Army. Sidon was shut down for weeks because of the violence and Protéine's Beirut office was burned down. By late March, 19 people had died in the confrontations. By 13 April, the skirmishes evolved into open warfare between rival forces in the country.|$|E
25|$|After {{continued}} {{talks between}} Italy and Egypt the four hijackers were eventually {{removed from the}} 737, arrested by the Italian Carabinieri at Sigonella, and taken to the air base jail then transferred to a local prison. The public magistrate in Syracuse announced late on the 11th that his inquires were complete and EgyptAir 2843 could depart for Rome with Badrakkan and Abbas aboard. Craxi saw this as a stalling tactic that was a courtesy to the US. The Italian foreign ministry contacted the U.S. embassy and informed them of the flight, saying that the two wanted to consult <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> office in Rome. The American's viewed this {{as a prelude to}} Abbas being released. The 737 was then cleared by the Italians to fly to Rome's Ciampino airport with Abbas and Badrakkan still aboard.|$|E
2500|$|Imad Mughniyeh and Mustafa Badr Al Din {{took charge}} of the Syrian–Iranian backed operation. Mughniyeh had been a highly trained {{security}} man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> Force 17 [...] [...] [...] Their mission was to gather information and details about the American embassy and draw up a plan that would guarantee the maximum impact and leave no trace of the perpetrator. Meetings were held at the Iranian embassy in Damascus. They were usually chaired by the ambassador, Hojatoleslam Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi, who played an instrumental role in founding Hezbollah. In consultation with several senior Syrian intelligence officers, the final plan was set in motion. The vehicle and explosives were prepared in the Bekaa Valley which was under Syrian control.|$|R
5000|$|These people {{rejected}} the Soviet Union and Arab states {{close to it}} (The pro-Syrian Ba'ath, Algeria, Libya and South Yemen). They resented Yasser Arafat’s rapprochement <b>with</b> Moscow and <b>the</b> <b>PLO’s</b> progressive drift towards “third-worldist” leftwing rhetoric.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Ghilan {{became one of}} the first non-Communist Israelis to meet <b>with</b> representatives of <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> He later became a {{personal}} friend of Yasser Arafat. Ghilan moved to Paris in 1969 and returned to Israel after the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993.|$|R
25|$|The Intifada was not {{initiated}} by any single individual or organization. Local leadership came from groups and organizations affiliated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> that operated within the Occupied Territories; Fatah, the Popular Front, the Democratic Front and the Palestine Communist Party. The PLO's rivals {{in this activity}} were the Islamic organizations, Hamas and Islamic Jihad {{as well as local}} leadership in cities such as Beit Sahour and Bethlehem. However, the uprising was predominantly led by community councils led by Hanan Ashrawi, Faisal Husseini and Haidar Abdel-Shafi, that promoted independent networks for education (underground schools as the regular schools were closed by the military in reprisal for the uprising), medical care, and food aid. The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) gained credibility where the Palestinian society complied with the issued communiques. There was a collective commitment to abstain from lethal violence, a notable departure from past practice, which, according to Shalev arose from a calculation that recourse to arms would lead to an Israeli bloodbath and undermine the support they had in Israeli liberal quarters. The PLO and its chairman Yassir Arafat had also decided on an unarmed strategy, in the expectation that negotiations at that time would lead to an agreement with Israel. Pearlman attributes the non-violent character of the uprising to the movement's internal organization and its capillary outreach to neighborhood committees that ensured that lethal revenge would not be the response {{even in the face of}} Israeli state repression. Hamas and Islamic Jihad cooperated with the leadership at the outset, and throughout the first year of the uprising conducted no armed attacks, except for the stabbing of a soldier in October 1988, and the detonation of two roadside bombs, which had no impact.|$|E
2500|$|Peled did {{approach}} his old comrade in arms Yitzhak Rabin, then on {{his first}} term as Prime Minister of Israel (1974–77). He offered to brief Rabin on his talks with the Palestinians, and Rabin consented. On several occasions, indeed, Sartawi and other Palestinian interlocutors used this channel to pass on specific messages intended for Rabin's ears. The PM patiently heard him out, but never consented {{to send a message}} in return. [...] "That would be negotiating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> and I will never never do that" [...] he told Peled—ironic words in retrospect, as Rabin was later to conduct intensive talks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and sign the Oslo Agreement with Arafat. Peled always believed that Oslo was at least in part a late flowering of the seeds he and his friends had sown in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{from his}} cell in Paris, the pro-Palestinian {{terrorist}} [...] Ilich Ramirez Sanchez Carlos stated that [...] "the Mitrokhin Committee attempts to falsify history" [...] and that [...] "they were the CIA and the Mossad to hit in Bologna", {{with the intent}} to warn and punish Italy for its relations of mutual trust <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> who had secretly pledged not to hit Italy in exchange for some protection.|$|E
50|$|From September 2005, the NSC {{was headed}} by President and Prime Minister, <b>with</b> as members <b>the</b> <b>PLO’s</b> Negotiations Affairs Department (NAD), the Secretary General of the Presidency, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Civil Affairs, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the National Security Advisor.|$|R
500|$|Abu Nidal {{had carried}} out the {{operation}} without the permission of Fatah. Abu Iyad (Arafat's deputy) and Mahmoud Abbas (later President of the Palestinian Authority), flew to Iraq to reason with Abu Nidal that hostage-taking harmed the movement. Abu Iyad told Seale that an Iraqi official at the meeting said: [...] "Why are you attacking Abu Nidal? The operation was ours! We asked him to mount it for us." [...] Abbas was furious and left <b>the</b> meeting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other <b>PLO</b> delegates. From that point on, Seale writes, <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> regarded Abu Nidal as {{under the control of}} the Iraqi government.|$|R
50|$|The main {{discussion}} since 1993 {{has focused}} on turning {{most or all of}} the Gaza Strip and the West Bank into an independent Palestinian state. This was the basis for the Oslo accords, and it is, as a matter of official policy, favoured by the U.S. The status of Israel within the 1949 Armistice lines has not been the subject of international negotiations. Some members of <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> recognize Israel's right to exist within these boundaries; others hold that Israel must eventually be destroyed. Consequently, some Israelis hold that Palestinian statehood is impossible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> current <b>PLO</b> as a basis, and needs to be delayed.|$|R
2500|$|Jordan severed its {{residual}} {{administrative and}} financial {{ties to the}} West Bank {{in the face of}} sweeping popular support for the PLO. The failure of the [...] "Iron Fist" [...] policy, Israel's deteriorating international image, Jordan cutting legal and administrative ties to the West Bank, and the U.S.'s recognition of the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people forced Rabin to seek an end to the violence though negotiation and dialogue <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Italy {{also had}} {{something}} approaching rapprochement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> that kept its terrorist away from Italian citizens and interests. This {{was a result}} of a 1973 deal made between Italy and the PLO after an attack on an airport in Rome. The PLO would not target Italians in exchange for Italian acquiescence of its objectives. Arafat was able to contact Craxi warning him that [...] "uncontrollable actions could result" [...] if Abbas was turned over to the US.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a younger}} man, Peres was once {{considered}} a [...] "hawk". He was a protégé of Ben-Gurion and Dayan {{and an early}} supporter of the West Bank settlers during the 1970s. However, after becoming the leader of his party his stance evolved. Subsequently, he {{was seen as a}} dove, and a strong supporter of peace through economic cooperation. While still opposed, like all mainstream Israeli leaders in the 1970s and early 1980s, to talks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> he distanced himself from settlers and spoke of the need for [...] "territorial compromise" [...] over the West Bank and Gaza. For a time he hoped that King Hussein of Jordan could be Israel's Arab negotiating partner rather than Yasser Arafat. Peres met secretly with Hussein in London in 1987 and reached a framework agreement with him, but this was rejected by Israel's then Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir. Shortly afterward the First Intifada erupted, and whatever plausibility King Hussein had as a potential Israeli partner in resolving the fate of the West Bank evaporated. Subsequently, Peres gradually moved closer to support for talks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> although he avoided making an outright commitment to this policy until 1993.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, an {{unofficial}} PLO information office {{was established in}} New York in 1964 and run by Sadat Hassan, who served as Permanent Representative of Yemen to the United Nations. The Palestine Information Office was then registered <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Justice Department as a foreign agent and operated until 1968, when it was closed. <b>The</b> <b>PLO</b> was designated a terrorist organization by the United States in 1987, but in 1988 a presidential waiver was issued which permitted contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> organization. A <b>PLO</b> office was reopened in 1989 as the Palestine Affairs Center. <b>The</b> <b>PLO</b> Mission office, in Washington D.C., was opened in 1994, and represented <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> in <b>the</b> United States. On 20 July 2010, the United States Department of State agreed to upgrade the status of <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> Mission in <b>the</b> United States to [...] "General Delegation of the PLO".|$|R
50|$|In 1982, {{after an}} attack on a senior Israeli diplomat by Lebanon-based Palestinian militants in Lebanon, Israel invaded Lebanon in a much larger scale in {{coordination}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Lebanese Christian militias, reaching Beirut and eventually resulting in ousting of <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> headquarters in June that year. Low-level Palestinian insurgency in Lebanon continued in parallel <b>with</b> <b>the</b> consolidation of Shia militant organizations, but became a secondary concern to Israeli military and other Lebanese factions. <b>With</b> ousting of <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> <b>the</b> Lebanese Civil War gradually turned into a prolonged conflict, shifting from mainly PLO-Christian conflict into involvement of all Lebanese factions - whether Sunni, Shia, Druze, and Christians.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Party member Habib al-Shartouni assassinated the Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel, {{the leader}} of the Lebanese Forces, who had asked for the Israelis to invade Lebanon {{all the way up to}} Beirut, and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> consent of whom the Siege of Beirut was effectuated. The Party also {{undertook}} many operations against Israeli presence in Lebanon, including a military operation in broad daylight against Israeli officers stationed in Beirut, which triggered the beginning of the generalized armed struggle for Lebanese liberation. Sana'a Mehaidli, whose family had been displaced and was forced to live homeless after the Israeli occupation, detonated herself in her car along with an Israeli convoy in South Lebanon. The Party joined arms <b>with</b> <b>the</b> communists, <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> <b>the</b> Arab nationalists, and other left-leaning groups to fight against the Israeli invasion, leading to the break of the siege and to the withdrawal of the Israelis from Beirut. Today, the Party's military wings fights alongside the Syrian Arab Army against the FSA and ISIS.|$|R
2500|$|In January 1988 the US {{dropped its}} arrest warrant for Abbas [...] deferring to his Italian {{conviction}} {{and due to}} insufficiency of evidence at the moment {{to take him to}} trial on different charges. The US Justice Department claimed that other countries that had evidence against him were refusing to cooperate with their prosecution. At a 1988 press conference in Algeria, Abbas offered a different explanation for the death of Klinghoffer [...] "Maybe he was trying to swim for it." [...] No overt attempt to capture Abbas or enforce his sentence was made by Italy, who desired continued relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When {{the first}} Intifada broke out, Rabin adopted harsh {{measures}} {{to stop the}} demonstrations, even authorizing the use of [...] "Force, might and beatings," [...] on the demonstrators. Rabin the [...] "bone breaker" [...] {{was used as an}} International image. The combination of the failure of the [...] "Iron Fist" [...] policy, Israel's deteriorating international image, and Jordan cutting legal and administrative ties to the West Bank with the U.S.'s recognition of the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people forced Rabin to seek an end to the violence through negotiation and dialogue <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> From 1990 to 1992, Rabin again served as a Knesset member and sat on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.|$|E
2500|$|Mattityahu [...] "Matti" [...] Peled ( [...] , born Mattityahu Ifland on 20 July 1923, died 10 March 1995) was a {{well-known}} Israeli public figure {{who was at}} various periods of his life a professional military man who reached the rank of Aluf (Major General) in the IDF {{and was a member}} of the General Staff during the Six-Day War of 1967; a notable scholar who headed the Arabic Language and Literature Department of Tel Aviv University; a radical peace activist and a leading proponent of Israeli dialogue <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and of complete withdrawal from the Occupied Territories in whose conquest he personally had a major role; and a member of the Knesset who often expressed controversial views considered [...] "extreme left" [...] in Israeli terms, yet was treated with considerable respect by staunch political people.|$|E
40|$|How Rho-GEFs and Rho GTPases {{regulate}} division-site selection during cytokinesis in fission yeast is unknown.

50|$|U.S. Ambassador to Israel Peter Hacker (Robert Mitchum) {{and head}} of {{security}} Frank Stevenson (Rock Hudson) are {{en route to a}} secret location in the Judean desert to meet <b>with</b> representatives of <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> (Palestinian Liberation Organization). It is part of Hacker’s secret plan to have young Jews and Muslims begin a peaceful dialogue. An armed Israeli helicopter locates and disrupts the meeting by firing on it causing several deaths. Hacker and Stevenson survive and are apprehended by Israeli ground soldiers.|$|R
50|$|Within PFLP, he {{gradually}} {{began to}} favor a reduced emphasis on armed struggle and closer cooperation <b>with</b> Fatah, <b>the</b> dominant <b>PLO</b> faction. As a result, he {{was removed from}} the PFLP Politburo in 1981, and was appointed to run external relations. In drawing closer to Fatah leader Yasser Arafat and meeting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, he was expelled from the PFLP in 1987.|$|R
