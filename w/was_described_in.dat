Originally interpreted {{as a member of}} Multituberculata, an extinct group of small, rodent-like mammals, {{on the basis of a}} single brachydont (low-crowned) molar, it was recognized as related to the hypsodont (high-crowned) Sudamericidae after the discovery of additional material in the early 1990s. After a jaw of the sudamericid Sudamerica <b>was</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> 1999, these animals (collectively known as Gondwanatheria) were no longer considered to be multituberculates and a few fossils that were previously considered to be Ferugliotherium were assigned to unspecified multituberculates instead.

Homogenous algorithms which use the same algorithm with different parameter either by introducing randomness or by manipulating input attributes, model outputs or training instances with a process of “bagging” or “boosting” as has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> [121].
