Did men not like clever girls? Ought we {{to try to}} appear less clever?" [...] Whilst Owen Gibson of the newspaper said she was the [...] "school swot" [...] before she turned into a [...] "beauty queen". Columnist Felicity Cloake compiled an advice guide to attending Christmas parties for the workplace, on style she advised her readers to look to Jane for inspiration {{if they want to}} [...] "dress to impress". Josh Burt of entertainment website Hecklerspray ran a make over feature inspired by Jane's make over, he also branded Jane a whore and said he thought her make over was astonishing. He also stated: [...] "Ever since Plain Jane the Superbrain took off her glasses, smeared some slutty red lipstick around her mouth, and rubbed ice cubes on her stupid nipples, the celebrity makeover has been a must for anyone hoping to increase their fame. For those unaware, the whole Plain Jane thing happened in the Australian drama serial, Neighbours. She went from geek to whore in a matter of moments." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Annie Temple from Philadelphia Daily News {{said that the}} release was [...] "not so flattering" [...] and [...] "was a sloppy job". Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times said that [...] "the video is sometimes distracting and blurry, wonder what went wrong during recording. The angles are awkward, especially when the audience members are shown touching Madonna's hand. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> necessary to show a fan coming unannounced on the stage?" [...] Terry Atkinson from the same paper said, [...] "This follows the typical concert video format of putting you in the best seat {{in the hall and}} letting the aura of a superior performer encaptivate your senses." [...] Sylvia Chase from The Wichita Eagle said that [...] "seeing Madonna live in an arena and seeing her up, close and personal in the tour cassette is totally different. The energy, the movements, the provocation—all captures you more." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave it a positive review, stating [...] "filmed with abrupt, swooping camera movements that accentuate the singer's flouncing, slightly ungainly style of dancing, Madonna Live vividly captures the contradictory elements that have made the performer into a cultural icon in spite of a shrill, limited singing voice. In close-up, Madonna's provocative pouts, wiggles and come-hither glances become a more than half-deliberate burlesque of erotic centerfold photography. Both her post-disco music and defiant strut suggest a child's parody of grown-up posturing." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{competing}} {{coalition of}} Greek city-states centred around Sparta arose, and became more {{important as the}} external Persian threat subsided. This coalition {{is known as the}} Peloponnesian League. However, unlike the Hellenic League and the Delian League, this league was not a response to any external threat, Persian or otherwise: it was unabashedly an instrument of Spartan policy aimed at Sparta's security and Spartan dominance over the Peloponnese peninsula. The term [...] "Peloponnesian League" [...] is a misnomer. It was not really a [...] "league" [...] at all. Nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> [...] "Peloponnesian". There was no equality at all between the members, as might be implied by the term [...] "league". Furthermore, most of its members were located outside the Peloponnese Peninsula. The terms [...] "Spartan League" [...] and [...] "Peloponnesian League" [...] are modern terms. Contemporaries instead referred to [...] "Lacedaemonians and their Allies" [...] to describe the [...] "league".|$|E
