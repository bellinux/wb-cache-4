500|$|After {{completing}} the film, Hillenburg {{wanted to end}} the series [...] "so [...] wouldn't jump the shark." [...] "We're working on episodes 40 through 60 right now, and I always looked at that as a typical run for an animated show. [...] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now {{was a good time}} to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it's good not to go to the point where people don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> show anymore," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: [...] "The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn't afford not to," [...] storyboard director Sam Henderson observed. Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: [...] "I think [...] respect that my contribution is important. I think they would want to maintain the original concept and quality." [...] Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role. Although he no longer has a direct involvement in the production of SpongeBob SquarePants, he still retains a position as an executive producer and maintains an advisory role, reviewing each episode. While he was on the show, Hillenburg voiced Potty the Parrot and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording. During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty, while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director.|$|E

Minogue {{previously}} released the Christmas track [...] "Santa Baby", which appeared on her 2000 single, [...] "Please Stay"; {{a recording of}} [...] "Let It Snow" [...] in 2010; and two Christmas extended plays in 2010, A Kylie Christmas and A Christmas Gift. Speaking with Idolator's Mike Wass, Minogue stated [...] "I always thought I would do a Christmas album, {{it was just a}} case of when... I mentioned it to a couple of people on my team and they were saying, 'What {{do you want to do}} for the rest of the year? What do you want to do next?' I said, 'I'm thinking about a Christmas album, actually.' Some of that stems from last Christmas." [...] Minogue said that she had Christmas in Los Angeles, California in 2014, and her friend suggest recording a Christmas album; [...] "They just assumed I had done one, and when I said I hadn't done an entire album they just started, 'You've got to do it. It would be amazing. We just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> little outfits.'" [...] Kylie Christmas was recorded at Angel Studios and Sarm Music Village, and features a mix of both classical Christmas songs and new original material. American guitarist and producer Nile Rodgers and Minogue's sister Dannii Minogue were reported to be working on the album, while The Sun claimed she had recorded [...] "half of the album".|$|E
