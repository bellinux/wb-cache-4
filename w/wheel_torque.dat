25|$|In September 2005, the GS 350 (GRS191) and GS 430 (UZS190) {{went on sale}} in Japan; the GS 350 using a 3.5-liter 2GR-FSE engine with D4-S direct injection, {{while the}} GS 430 used the same 4.3-liter 3UZ-FE V8 used in the {{previous}} model. Sales in the United States began in March 2006 as a 2006 model, with the initial U.S. model lineup including the GS 300 (GRS190), featuring a ULEV certified 3.0-liter 3GR-FSE V6 engine, and the GS 430. The GS 300 featured a D4 direct-injection fuel system for all markets except Continental Asia, excluding Singapore, becoming Toyota's first vehicle equipped with direct injection sold in the United States. The 3.0-liter engine was {{also found in the}} Toyota Mark X as well as the Zero Toyota Crown, however the new GS 300 was never offered in the Japanese market. The GS 300, GS 350, and GS 430 engine options were paired to a new 6-speed automatic sequential shift gearbox. An all-wheel drive system was made available in the GS 300, thus becoming the first Lexus sedan to offer such a configuration; the system varied the front/rear <b>wheel</b> <b>torque</b> split anywhere from 50/50 to 30/70 depending on conditions.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we derive {{steady-state}} cornering {{conditions for a}} single-track vehicle model without restricting {{the operation of the}} tires to their linear region (i. e. allowing the vehicle to drift). For each steady-state equilibrium we calculate the corresponding tire friction forces at the front and rear tires, as well as the required front steering angle and front and rear wheel longitudinal slip, to maintain constant velocity, turning rate and vehicle sideslip angle. We design a linear controller that stabilizes the vehicle dynamics with respect to the steady-state cornering equilibria using longitudinal slip at the front and the rear wheels as the control inputs. The <b>wheel</b> <b>torques</b> necessary to maintain the given equilibria are calculated and a sliding-mode controller is proposed to stabilize the vehicle using only front and rear <b>wheel</b> <b>torques</b> as control inputs...|$|R

A special transmission unit is used in the experimental car MUTE of the Technical University of Munich, where the bigger motor is providing the driving power and the smaller for the torque vectoring functionality. The detailed control system of the torque vectoring is described in the doctoral thesis of Dr.-Ing. Michael Graf. In case of electric vehicles with four electric motor drives, the same total <b>wheel</b> <b>torque</b> and yaw moment can be generated through an infinite number of <b>wheel</b> <b>torque</b> distributions.

50|$|The second {{engagement}} mode uses {{wheel slippage}} control logic. If {{the difference between}} front and rear wheels rises because of a slippery surface or poor traction {{at the front of}} the vehicle, that condition is detected by wheel-speed sensors which are monitored by VTM-4's ECU. In response, the ECU commands an increasing amount of torque for the rear <b>wheels.</b> <b>Torque</b> is proportional to both slip rate and the rate at which the slip rate is increasing. This operation is similar to conventional slip-based all-wheel-drive systems already on the market.|$|R

50|$|Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>torque</b> rises {{smoothly}} {{from zero}} to the optimum setting in proportion to vehicle acceleration (both forward and reverse).

Accurately determining the cornering dynamics on a realtime basis, the system operates to control vehicle behavior through corners and realize vehicle behavior that more closely mirrors driver intent.|$|E

50|$|For {{driving in}} {{particularly}} challenging conditions, such as snow, the driver can select “4WD Lock” mode. In Lock mode, the system still apportions {{front and rear}} torque automatically, but enables greater power transfer to the rear wheels. In dry conditions, 4WD Lock mode places priority on performance. More torque is directed to the rear wheels than in 4WD Auto mode to provide greater power off the line, better control when accelerating on snowy or loose surfaces, and enhanced stability at high speeds. Rear <b>wheel</b> <b>torque</b> transfer is increased by 50 percent over the amounts in 4WD Auto mode - meaning up to 60 percent of available torque {{is sent to the}} rear wheels under full-throttle acceleration on dry pavement.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} on the strip road where longitudinal slopes were determined by the leveling method {{as well as individual}} distances of the strip road of uniform slope. Skidders were used for carrying out traction tests in downhill and uphill skidding of 9 different loads. Measurement of <b>wheel</b> loads, <b>wheel</b> <b>torques</b> and components of rope force was performed by tensiometric method and remote transferring of measurement signal. According to the results of research, by the increase of longitudinal slope, more tractive force is used for overcoming the terrain slope than for overcoming the traction resistance. In downhill skidding, the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) acts in the skidder travel direction and hence its value is higher than the traction resistance. Torque distribution depends on the skidder wheel vertical load. In uphill skidding, torques increase proportionally to the vertical component of rope forces and adhesive weight of the skidder. In downhill skidding, the skidder <b>wheel</b> <b>torques</b> are negative, because they are not used for achieving wheel tractive force and instead, the transmission of torque through the transmission system causes skidder’s braking performance. The skidder’s need for braking arises under influence of the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) that acts {{in the direction of the}} skidder travel and under its effect the traction resistances are overcome. It can be concluded that in case of downhill skidding we cannot speak of achieving real tractive force because the skidder pulls the load only by its weight, and the transmittion from engine to wheels is not used for achieving the tractive force...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is derived {{that describes the}} planar, non-linear response of a continuous band circulating about two rotating wheels. A closed form analysis of the non-linear steady response leads to elliptic integral solutions for the equilibrium band geometry and tension.

50|$|The 2007 Delica D:5 {{uses the}} same {{electronically}} controlled four-wheel drive system that is used on the new Outlander, which tailors front and rear <b>wheel</b> <b>torque</b> split to the driving conditions. Delica also features the same selector dial next to the shift selector that allows the driver to switch between three drive modes: 2WD, 4WD AUTO and 4WD LOCK. Mitsubishi's skid-preventing Active Stability Control (ASC) system is also present. Mitsubishi has refined the Delica's four-wheel drive management software from the Outlander by increasing the proportion of torque directed to the rear wheels during uphill driving and reducing it during smaller steering maneuvers in 4WD mode because of the vehicle's difference in wheelbase and weight compared to the Outlander. The results are better hill-climbing performance and cornering stability. Also, in LOCK mode the system senses when wheels on the diagonally opposite corners {{are in danger of}} spinning without traction during vehicle operation at low speeds. By activating the brake traction control function at lower speeds than the system in the Outlander, Mitsubishi improved the vehicle's all-terrain performance at low speeds.|$|E

50|$|Vehicle wheels may lock-up due to {{excessive}} <b>wheel</b> <b>torque</b> over tire-road friction forces available, caused by too much hydraulic line pressure. The ABS monitors wheel speeds and releases pressure on individual wheel brake lines, rapidly pulsing individual brakes to prevent lock-up. During heavy braking, preventing wheel lock-up helps the driver maintain steering control. Four channel ABS systems have an individual brake line {{for each of}} the four wheels, enabling different braking pressure on different road surfaces. Three channel systems are equipped with a sensor for each wheel, but control the rear brakes as a single unit. For example, less braking pressure is needed to lock a wheel on ice than a wheel which is on bare asphalt. If the left wheels are on asphalt and the right wheels are on ice, during an emergency stop, ABS detects the right wheels about to lock and reduces braking force on the right front wheel. Four channel systems also reduce brake force on the right rear wheel, while a three channel system would also reduce force on both back wheels. Both systems help avoid lock-up and loss of vehicle control.|$|E

In this paper, acontrol strategy is presented with the aim to control an electric vehicle equipped with in-wheel motors.

The steady-state control aims to enhance vehicle handling, while the transient control increases lateral stability during limit manoeuvers.

A steering control strategy where the torque difference between the left and right wheels is the function of the handwheel angle inputs and the error between the expected yaw rate and measured yaw rate is first presented.

50|$|The Concept One is {{designed}} to be the best electric supercar, not a supercar with electric motors. The independent drive system and low mounted batteries are specially designed for the driver to adjust. The whole car is developed around the powertrain and battery-pack. Gear changes or clutches are not needed and the reaction time is instant. The batteries can be located in the floor, together with all the other heavy propulsion components in order to achieve a low center of gravity. Thanks to the All <b>Wheel</b> <b>Torque</b> Vectoring System the driver can choose how he wants the car to behave - he can choose between over-steering, under-steering or a neutral handling, adjust the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) intensity and a whole range of other driving parameters. Each wheel is powered by a separate 12,000 rpm, 250 kW liquid-cooled permanent magnet motor for an overall 1088 hp and 1600 Nm of torque. The vehicle achieves the speed range from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.8 seconds with a limited maximum speed of 305 km/h. The batteries are also designed to be economic - one charge can operate the car for around 510 km (320 miles), and needs to recharge for only 30 min (with an 200 kW power supply station).|$|E
5000|$|The {{architecture}} of an AWD/4WD {{system can be}} described by describing its possible operating modes. A single vehicle may {{have the ability to}} operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. Mohan describes the modes as follows:Two Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque split ratio is 0:100. Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode - Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).:Part-time Mode - The front and rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for ‘part-time’ use in off-road or loose surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to either axle depending on the road condition and the weight over the axles. :Full-time Mode - Both axles are driven at all times but an inter-axle differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the inter-axle differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’. :On-Demand Mode - In this mode the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or <b>wheel</b> <b>torque,</b> as described in the section on traction control systems.In addition to these basic modes there could be implementations that combine these modes. The system could have a clutch across the center differential, for example, capable of modulating the front axle torque from a Full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential to the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode ...|$|E
