They meet King Hrothgar, <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> hero to slay Grendel, a hideously malformed troll-like creature with appalling strength and cunning.

25|$|Some countries, {{including}} the Czech Republic, require that an alien <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> visa on entry be {{in possession of}} a valid visa upon exit. To satisfy this formal requirement, exit visas sometimes need to be issued. Russia requires an exit visa if a visitor stays past the expiration date of their visa. They must then extend their visa or apply for an exit visa and are not allowed to leave the country until they show a valid visa or have a permissible excuse for overstaying their visa (e.g., a note from a doctor or a hospital explaining an illness, missed flight, lost or stolen visa). In some cases, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can issue a Return-Home certificate that is valid for ten days from the embassy of the visitor's native country, thus eliminating the need for an exit visa.|$|E

Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio, the ballet Javotte, the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces. In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, [...] "Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> festival to himself... there are Masses, all of which are interesting.

500|$|Defending Flynn's personality, Levi {{explained}} that [...] "Deep down, Flynn {{has a good}} core, although that characteristic is brought out of him through the purity, love and naivet√© of Rapunzel." [...] The actor concluded that [...] "These are two very different characters that end up learning a lot from each other on a rather crazy adventure." [...] According to Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, Flynn [...] "teaches [...] about courage". Rob Vaux of Mania.com described the character's relationship with Rapunzel as a [...] "partners-in-crime sort of chemistry, filled with mischief and the odd pratfall while establishing a rhythm wholly their own." [...] Rapunzel eventually convinces Flynn to go by his birth name, Eugene Fitzherbert, which Conny Eisfeld described in her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) The Art of Adapting Fairy Tales as [...] "more humane". Stephen D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide called Flynn [...] "a charismatic bad boy", comparing him to Sinbad from DreamWorks' [...] (2003). Similarly, The New York Times Brooks Barnes felt that [...] "Making the leading man an unlikable thief is a subtle yet startling twist for Disney, and Flynn ... is glib {{in a way that}} many people now associate with DreamWorks." [...] On Flynn's thievery, Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum determined that the character [...] "only steals because he's basically a nice-guy underachiever <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> better outlet for his leadership abilities". According to Tison Pugh, author of The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past, Flynn [...] "amalgamates the comedy-action hero with the swashbuckling romantic sensations of Errol Flynn, layering them over a fairy-tale hero attributed with comedic lines that undermine the romantic nostalgia of the film's setting", while serving as a source of comic relief at times. Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times believes that Flynn carries [...] "most of the [...] modern humor". Likewise, Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail described Flynn as the film's [...] "main source of action, humour and, eventually, romance".|$|E

2500|$|Debt bondage is {{the most}} common form of slavery today. It is a {{condition}} in which a person ‚Äúpledges him or herself against a loan of money, but the length and nature of the service is undefined, and the labor does not diminish the original debt.‚Äù [...] Debt bondage was included and defined as a form of slavery under the 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery. However, its many modern forms continue to include pawning, peonage, and worker debt. In India, debt bondage has been illegal since 1976; however, due to widespread poverty in the country, it continues to exist, as a man may need a loan to finance a wedding, funeral, medicine, fertilizer, or a fine. Because the interest rates on these debts as so high, debts are often inherited and children may replace their fathers or siblings. Debt bondage can also be incurred by specific industries ‚Äì quarrying, carpet-making, agriculture, and fisheries ‚Äì where the cost of equipment and supplies falls on the worker <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> loan to pay for them.|$|E
