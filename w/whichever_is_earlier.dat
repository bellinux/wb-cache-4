50|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the British Admiralty court system, which expanded significantly in the late seventeenth century, was to handle wage disputes between hired seamen {{on the one side}} and captains, owners, and merchants on the other. Ambiguous wage agreements led to many of these disputes. To improve the clarity of merchant wage contracts, the Act mandated that such contracts include the specified principals of agreement, the wages, the date of signing on, and advance pay. Wages were to be paid, unless contrary terms appeared in the written agreement, upon final discharge or within thirty days of the ship’s entry at a customs house (<b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>earlier).</b> Seamen promised obedience, duty, and service. Typically, merchant wage contracts specified seamen’s responsibilities while the ship was at port. Seamen were generally required to stay on board until the ship was completely unloaded. However, any agreement relating to food, drink, or privileges was ordinarily left to custom and not included in the formal contract.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Objectives: To {{study the}} effect of ethanolic extract of the leaf of Plectranthus amboinicus on the healing of burn wounds in wistar rats and compare it with silver {{sulfadiazine}} treated group. Materials and Methods: Five groups of rats {{were used in the}} study. Partial thickness burn wounds were made on each rat under ketamine anesthesia. The wounds in the five groups of rats were treated topically with petroleum base, silver sulfadiazine, 1 %, 2 % and 3 % ointment of ethanolic extract of Plectranthus amboinicus, respectively, once daily for 21 days or till complete healing <b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>earlier.</b> The wound contraction rate and period of epithelization were monitored. Results: The rate of wound contraction was significantly more in Plectranthusamboinicustreated groups in comparison to the control. The mean period of epithelization was significantly decreased in Plectranthus amboinicus treated group when compared to control (P < 0. 01) and silver sulfadiazine (P = 0. 02) treated group. Conclusion: The ethanolic extract of Plectranthusamboinicuspromoted healing of burn wound in wistar rats...|$|R

The building was open from 11am to 3pm and then from dusk, or 7pm <b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>earlier,</b> until midnight daily, except Sunday. If the weather was unsuitable for observing the observatory would close at 10pm. Members of the PPI were allowed free admission on presentation of their membership cards. The general public were allowed in from the beginning of September to the end of April on a Monday, Thursday and Saturday between 7pm and 11pm. However, they had to purchase a ticket beforehand at a cost of two pence which could only be used on the day and at the hour specified, with a maximum of twenty tickets issued for each hour. If the weather did not allow for telescope viewings the ticket could be exchanged for another one offering another day and time free of charge. Friday evenings during the winter were set aside for teachers and trainee teachers within the burgh boundaries to use the telescope.|$|R

40|$|Background. In a {{cross-sectional}} study of musculoskeletal disorders, women employed in highly repetitive manual work (garment assembly) {{were found to}} have approximately double the risk observed in a population with more varied tasks (hospital work). It was suspected that this estimate might be biased if garment workers with musculoskeletal pain were more likely than others to leave employment. Methods. Retrospective information on date of first onset of symptoms and years employed to date of pain onset, or to survey date (<b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>earlier),</b> <b>was</b> used to calculate age and calendar period-specific rates of onset, conditional on remaining employed until the survey. Results. These rates, and the relative risk for garment work, increased over the 20 -year period preceding the year of the survey. The trend was not explained by age or length of employment, or by any known changes in work demands that might have caused a true increase in incidence density. Conclusions. In the absence of longitudinal cohort data, alternative explanations for these results cannot be excluded. However, with specified assumptions, the most plausible appears to be a healthy worker selection effect acting differ-entially between high and low exposure groups. This effect would have caused the smallest bias in the prevalence in the year immediately before the survey, and a better estimate of the true relative risk would be approximately five. Where date of onset has been obtained, this method may be used in other cross-sectional studies to estimate and reduce the magnitude of selection bias in a survivor population, if longitudinal data cannot be collected...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To compare {{isoflurane}} with midazolam for sedation of ventilated patients. DESIGN [...] Randomised control study. Setting [...] Intensive {{care unit}} in university teaching hospital. PATIENTS [...] Sixty patients aged 18 - 76 who required mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS [...] Sedation with either 0. 1 - 0. 6 % isoflurane in an air-oxygen mixture (30 patients) or a continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam 0. 01 - 0. 20 mg/kg/h (30 patients). Sedation was assessed initially and hourly thereafter on a six point scale. Incremental intravenous doses of morphine 0. 05 mg/kg were given for analgesia as required. The trial sedative was stopped {{when the patient}} was judged ready for weaning from ventilatory support or at 24 hours (<b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>earlier).</b> END POINT [...] Achievement of a predetermined level of sedation for {{as much of the}} time as possible. MAIN RESULTS [...] Isoflurane produced satisfactory sedation for a greater proportion of time (86 %) than midazolam (64 %), and patients sedated with isoflurane recovered more rapidly from sedation.
