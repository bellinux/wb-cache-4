5|$|According to {{the terms}} of Pixar's initial seven-film deal with Disney, all {{characters}} created by Pixar for their films were owned by Disney. Furthermore, Disney retained the rights to make sequels to any Pixar film, though Pixar retained the right of first refusal to work on these sequels. In 2004, when the contentious negotiations between the two companies made a split appear likely, Michael Eisner, Disney chairman at the time, put plans in motion to produce Toy Story 3 at a new Disney studio, Circle 7 Animation. Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, indicated a willingness to return, even if Pixar <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> board.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{started the}} 1967 season with Columbus. He {{believed}} that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> the major league club because the Pirates already {{had a number of}} African American players; he felt that the team did not want to alienate white fans. Ellis was sent down to the Macon Peaches of the Southern League, which Ellis believed was due to the length of his hair. Ellis said that he was promoted back to Columbus after shaving his head. He had a 2–0 win-loss record with Macon and a 5–7 record with Columbus.|$|E

5|$|In September 2006, Stock {{toured the}} Canadian Maritimes with MainStream Wrestling, where she once again {{wrestled}} Kyle Kruze, the MSW Atlantic Canadian Champion, {{and beat him}} in all three of their matches.

5|$|In the film, {{most of the}} {{numerous}} acts of violence are committed off-screen.

5|$|Music took on {{a pivotal}} and {{permanent}} role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become {{a regular part of}} his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalogue of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.|$|E

5|$|One of the WWF's main storylines in 1994 was Ted DiBiase's {{creation}} of a stable known as the Million Dollar Corporation.

5|$|Since Palmyra <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> {{the main}} trading route (which {{followed}} the Euphrates), the Palmyrenes secured the desert route passing their city.

The Palmyrene route connected the Silk Road with the Mediterranean, and was used almost exclusively by the city's merchants, who maintained a presence in many cities, including Dura-Europos in 33 BC, Babylon by AD 19, Seleucia by AD 24, Dendera, Coptos, Bahrain, the Indus River Delta, Merv and Rome.|$|E

5|$|Aediles were {{officers}} {{elected to}} conduct domestic affairs in Rome, and often assisted the higher magistrates. The office <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> the cursus honorum, and therefore did not mark {{the beginning of}} a political career. Every year, two curule aediles and two plebeian aediles were elected. The Tribal Assembly, while under the presidency of a higher magistrate (either a consul or praetor), elected the two curule aediles. While they had a curule chair, they did not have lictors, and thus they had no power of coercion. The Plebeian Council (principal popular assembly), under the presidency of a plebeian tribune, elected the two plebeian aediles. Aediles had wide-ranging powers over day-to-day affairs inside the city of Rome, and over the maintenance of public order. They had the power over public games and shows, and over the markets. They also had the power to repair and preserve temples, sewers and aqueducts, to maintain public records, and to issue edicts. Any expenditure of public funds, by either a curule aedile or a plebeian aedile, had to be authorized by the senate.|$|E
