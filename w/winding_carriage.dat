60|$|Anna and Franceska {{insisted on}} walking with Mr. White and Sir Robert, and they fairly frisked in the delicious air of sea and {{mountain}} after being so long cramped on board ship, stopping continually with screams of delight over violets or anemones, or the views that unfolded {{themselves as they}} went higher and higher. The path Mr. White chose {{was a good deal}} steeper than the <b>winding</b> <b>carriage</b> road cut out of the mountain side, and they arrived before the mules with Mrs. Grinstead and her brother, at the Italian garden, with a succession of broad terraces protected and adorned with open balustrades, with vases of late blooming flowers at intervals, and broad stone steps, guarded by carved figures, leading from one to another.|$|E
5000|$|The house, {{which stands}} in 4 acres of ground, has a {{pleasing}} exterior, its colouring of white {{standing out in}} distinct relief against the surrounding verdure. It is approached by a short, <b>winding</b> <b>carriage</b> drive, {{on either side of}} which are several excellent specimens of trees…In the grounds a croquet court has been marked out, and space left for other amusements, whilst beneath the shade of the trees the patients are able to enjoy the fresh air …Behind the house is an orchard surrounding a fish pond, making an ideal setting for a Manor House ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1870s an {{accommodation}} house known as Foot's was located about 18 miles from Bathurst, about half {{way along the}} journey and {{at the start of}} the Bridle Track section. In 1872 the first of the improvements were made to the narrow track at Hawkins Hill, where the steep climb of the hill was replaced with a <b>winding</b> <b>carriage</b> track climbing around the hill. Miners had set up tents along the Rivers adjacent to the road and many Chinese with their vegetable plots could be seen along the track. At the foot of Hawkins Hill was the locality of Lower Turon and here an Inn known as Braggs Inn was located. Nine miles south of Hill End was a mining locality on the Bridle Track called the Root Hog.|$|E
50|$|The fruits {{are mostly}} berries, fleshy drupes, or nuts. Some are adapted to <b>wind</b> <b>carriage,</b> {{but most are}} {{dispersed}} by mammals and birds. Chinese jujube is {{the fruit of the}} jujube tree (Ziziphus zizyphus) and is a major fruit in China.|$|R
50|$|The ferry {{utilised}} {{a single}} supporting steel cable that bore {{the weight of}} the carriage, with a looped drive cable that was driven by two hand-powered wheels, one at each side of the harbour. At peak times, operators were placed at both sides to <b>wind</b> the <b>carriage,</b> but it was attended by a single operator during quieter parts of the summer tourist season.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the meterological conditions showed that the first outbreaks of myxomatosis in S. E. England in 1953 could have resulted from <b>wind</b> <b>carriage</b> of insects infected with myxoma virus from northern France. South-easterly winds on the night 11 - 12 August would have carried the insects 120 - 160 km from the DÃ©partements of Nord, Pas de Calais and Somme across the English Channel to near Edenbridge, Kent. The flight would have taken 6. 5 - 8. 5 h at wind speeds of 15 - 22 km h- 1. On the night 11 - 12 August, temperatures increased with height (inversion) up to 500 m; at ground level temperature was around 19 degrees C and at 500 m was 25 degrees C. Insects would have travelled {{up to the top}} of the inversion arriving on 12 August as the inversion declined. Two or possibly three generations of infection would have taken place before the disease was seen around the middle of September 1953. The most likely insect was the mosquito Anopheles atroparvus which breeds along the coastal marshes of England and northern France and which has been shown experimentally and in the field to transmit myxoma virus mechanically...|$|R
60|$|On {{the left}} {{you see a}} church, {{standing}} in a very high position, with a still steeper ascent than the one I have been describing, leading up to it. On the right is a <b>winding</b> road for <b>carriages,</b> which leads up, by a tolerably gentle ascent, to the great square.|$|R
2500|$|As The WB {{pushed for}} market {{exclusivity}} for its local affiliates as the network increased its national distribution beyond the Tribune Company's television stations and the superstation feed of its Chicago affiliate (and Tribune flagship station) WGN-TV, Sinclair decided to <b>wind</b> down <b>carriage</b> agreements that the station had with cable providers located {{outside of the}} Indianapolis market. [...] The station remains available on cable systems on the Indiana side of the Terre Haute market, which until 2017 {{did not have an}} over-the-air CW affiliate, though this is expected to end with WTTV's CBS affiliation. CW network programming is only available in the area on the third digital subchannel of WTHI-TV.|$|R
5000|$|WVTV {{continued}} to be an independent station until March 1997, when The WB was pushing for more national distribution beyond the Tribune Company's broadcast stations and the superstation feed of Tribune-owned WGN. After Sinclair struck a large affiliation deal with The WB for several of the UPN affiliates and independent stations it either owned or controlled, WVTV finally picked up the WB affiliation in March 1997 and changed its on-air branding to [...] "WB 18". With The WB's drive to have stations in other markets take the network and pushing market exclusivity for those stations, Sinclair {{made the decision to}} begin <b>winding</b> down <b>carriage</b> agreements with providers outside of the Milwaukee and Green Bay markets, ending WVTV's status as a regional superstation. Sinclair also wanted to push viewership to WCGV, which had been a UPN affiliate since 1995.|$|R
60|$|The Carabidæ consist chiefly {{of seven}} {{peculiar}} genera of Anchomenini comprising fifty-one species, and several endemic species of Bembidiinæ. They are highly peculiar and {{are all of}} small size, and may have originally reached the islands in the crevices of the drift wood from N.W. America which is still thrown on their shores, or, more rarely, {{by means of a}} similar drift from the N.-Western islands of the Pacific.[75] It {{is interesting to note that}} peculiar species of the same groups of Carabidæ are found in the Azores, Canaries, and St. Helena, indicating that they possess some special facilities for transmission across wide oceans and for establishing themselves upon oceanic islands. The Staphylinidæ present many peculiar species of known genera. Being still more minute and usually more ubiquitous than the Carabidæ, there is no difficulty in accounting for their presence in the islands by the same means of dispersal. The Nitidulidæ, Ptinidæ, and Ciodidæ being very small and of varied habits, either the perfect insects, their eggs or larvæ, may have been introduced either by water or <b>wind</b> <b>carriage,</b> or through the agency of birds. The Curculionidæ, being wood bark or nut borers, would have considerable facilities for transmission by floating timber, fruits, or nuts; and the eggs or larvæ of the {321} peculiar Cerambycidæ must have been introduced by the same means. The absence of so many important and cosmopolitan groups whose size or constitution render them incapable of being thus transmitted over the sea, as well as of many which seem equally well adapted as those which are found in the islands, indicate how rare have been the conditions for successful immigration; and this is still further emphasized by the extreme specialisation of the fauna, indicating that there has been no repeated immigration of the same species which would tend, as in the case of Bermuda, to preserve the originally introduced forms unchanged by the effects of repeated intercrossing.|$|R
60|$|It was grand, it was inspiring--to us, to {{see those}} long lines of <b>carriages</b> <b>winding</b> down the lanes, joining one to another at the cross roads till at last all the granges from the {{northern}} end of the county were united in one mighty column advancing on the picnic ground, where orators awaited our approach with calm dignity and high resolve. Nothing more picturesque, more delightful, more helpful has ever risen out of American rural life. Each of these assemblies was a most grateful relief from the sordid loneliness of the farm.|$|R
40|$|Calm water {{towing tank}} {{experiments}} consisting of resistance tests and static and dynamic planar motion mechanism (PMM) tests are performed for a surface combatant with primary {{focus on the}} effects of hurricane scale headwinds. The experiments are designed {{to gain a better understanding}} of the physics of ship response to wind and to provide a validation dataset for an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) -based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code used for computing both air and water flow around a ship. Hurricane scale wind speeds are chosen to maximize the measurable effect of wind on ship forces and motions for a more definitive analysis and comparison with CFD. The geometry is the 1 / 48. 9 scale fully appended ONR Tumblehome model 5613, which has length L = 3. 147 m and is equipped with a superstructure. Tests are performed in a 3. 048 × 3. 048 × 100 m towing tank with wind generated by a custom built <b>wind</b> <b>carriage</b> towed ahead of the ship model. Air-stream velocity measurements indicate a maximum relative wind speed magnitude of 9. 38 m/s with 6 - 7 % uniformity and RMS values of approximately 4. 5 %. The effects of three wind speeds on static and dynamic forces, moment, and motions are analyzed. Results show that wind contributes significantly to surge force (approximately 46 % at Fr = 0. 2). Resistance data shows agreement with CFD computations with errors averaging approximately 4 %. The drag coefficient above water is approximately 0. 3 and generally decreases with increasing ship speed. Sway force and yaw moment are largely affected when the ship experiences oblique orientation to the flow. Forces and moment exhibit quadratic scaling with wind speed. Roll is the most sensitive motion to wind and is counteracted by it up to 1. 8 ° for PMM test conditions. In addition, harmonic amplitudes of forces and moment data from dynamic tests are used to determine hydrodynamic derivatives for all three wind conditions following a mathematical model. The effect of wind on hydrodynamic derivatives is significant with changes on the order of 10 - 100 %...|$|R
60|$|In {{some places}} the dike seemed to widen, {{so as to}} make room for houses upon the top of it. There were snug little taverns, where the captains and crews of the vessels that were sailing by could stop and refresh themselves, when wind or tide bound in their vessels, and now and then a shop or store of some kind, or a row of pretty, though very queer-looking, cottages. At one place there was a ferry landing. The ferry house, {{together}} with the various buildings appertaining to it, was {{on the top of the}} dike, and a large pier, with a snug and pretty basin by the side of it, below. There was a flight of stairs leading up from the pier to the ferry house, and also a <b>winding</b> road for <b>carriages.</b> At the time that the steamer went by this place, the ferry boat was just coming in with a carriage on board of it.|$|R
60|$|They {{passed through}} several very {{suspicious}} places without any molestation. The Misses Popkins, {{who were very}} romantic, and had learnt to draw in water colors, were enchanted with the savage scenery around; it was so like what they had read in Mrs. Radcliffe's romances, they should like of all things to make sketches. At length, the carriage arrived {{at a place where}} the road wound up a long hill. Mrs. Popkins had sunk into a sleep; the young ladies were reading the last works of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Byron, and the dandy was hectoring the postilions from the coach box. The Alderman got out, as he said, to stretch his legs up the hill. It was a long winding ascent, and obliged him every now and then to stop and blow and wipe his forehead with many a pish! and phew! being rather pursy and short of <b>wind.</b> As the <b>carriage,</b> however, was far behind him, and toiling slowly under the weight of so many well-stuffed trunks and well-stuffed travellers, he {{had plenty of time to}} walk at leisure.|$|R
5000|$|... "A {{remarkable}} {{gateway to}} the Dolomites is the majestic gorge, directly opposite Botzen, known as the Eggen Thal. This suffers nothing by comparism with the other portals. Indeed, to its extraordinary vestibule may be awarded {{the primacy of the}} picturesque. A mighty strip of porphyry, forty miles in length, thirteen in breadth and several thousand feet in height stretches along the western border of the Dolomites and its huge, purplish walls form a conspicuous feature in the landscapes near Meran and Botzen. One section of its blood-red cliffs, just east of the latter city, is perforated by a deep gash, several miles in length, from which emerges a tumultuous torrent. This gash is called the Eggen Thal. Into its sombre shadow <b>winds</b> a <b>carriage</b> road constructed at great cost and with enormous difficulty, which gradually ascends the cañon, passing beneath vast, overhanging precipices, crossing repeatedly the tortuous stream by means of massive bridges and even taking refuge within tunnels, at points where some concession to the opposition of the raging tunnels becomes essential. It is a solemn entrance, especially when one has some acquaintance with the Dolomite peaks which lie beyond, and knows what weird and awful shapes they can assume. On this account, the Eggen Thal is probably the most appropriate avenue of approach to those mysterious mountains. It is a corridor of time, that leads us from old igneous rocks, forged in the earths fiery furnace when our globe was young, to coral reefs, on which the ocean waves once broke in glittering spray, but which now sparkle in the frosty air, ten thousand feet above their early home. At times one looks up almost timidly between these jaws of ruddy porphyry toward the narrow streak of blue, so far away. It seems like a celestial river, whose noiselessness, limpidity and calm present a great contrast to the maddened stream beside us, as our deal of heaven differs from the storms and sorrows of this earthly life." ...|$|R
