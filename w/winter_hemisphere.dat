25|$|Ionization depends {{primarily}} on the Sun and its activity. The amount of ionization in the ionosphere varies greatly {{with the amount of}} radiation received from the Sun. Thus there is a diurnal (time of day) effect and a seasonal effect. The local <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere</b> is tipped away from the Sun, thus there is less received solar radiation. The activity of the Sun is associated with the sunspot cycle, with more radiation occurring with more sunspots. Radiation received also varies with geographical location (polar, auroral zones, mid-latitudes, and equatorial regions). There are also mechanisms that disturb the ionosphere and decrease the ionization. There are disturbances such as solar flares and the associated release of charged particles into the solar wind which reaches the Earth and interacts with its geomagnetic field.|$|E

50|$|Brewer-Dobson {{circulation}} is a {{model of}} atmospheric circulation, proposed by Alan Brewer in 1949 and Gordon Dobson in 1956, which attempts to explain why tropical air has less ozone than polar air, even though the tropical stratosphere is where most atmospheric ozone is produced. It is a simple circulation model that posits the existence of a slow current in the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere</b> which redistributes air from the tropics to the extratropics. The Brewer-Dobson circulation is driven by atmospheric waves and may be speeding up due to climate change.|$|E

50|$|Another {{large-scale}} {{feature that}} significantly influences Stratospheric Circulation is the breaking planetary waves resulting in intense quasi-horizontal mixing in the midlatitudes.

This breaking is caused due to a highly non-linear interaction between the vertically propagating planetary waves and the isolated high potential vorticity region known as Polar Vortex.

50|$|The Sq current {{depends on}} season. The summer vortex is {{intensified}} {{compared with the}} winter vortex and reaches into the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> A longitudinal dependence of the Sq current exists which {{is related to the}} inclined dipole component of the internal magnetic field, but probably also to nonmigrating tidal waves from below. In the course of the 11-year solar cycle, the amplitude of Sq increases by a factor of more than two from sunspot minimum to sunspot maximum. Two thirds of this increase may result from the enhancement of the electric conductivity with solar activity. The rest is probably due to the increase of the wind speed caused by the temperature increase with increasing solar activity. During the night, the electron density of the ionospheric E-layer diminishes much more strongly than that of the F-layer. Therefore, the height center of the dynamo region shifts upward.|$|E

50|$|The {{first term}} in (3) {{on the right}} is the global mean of the exospheric {{temperature}} (of the order of 1000 K). The second term P20 represents the heat surplus at lower latitudes and a corresponding heat deficit at higher latitudes (Fig. 2a). A thermal wind system develops with wind toward the poles in the upper level and wind away from the poles in the lower level. The coefficient ΔT20 ≈ 0.004 is small because Joule heating in the aurora regions compensates that heat surplus even during quiet magnetospheric conditions. During disturbed conditions, however, that term becomes dominant, changing sign so that now heat surplus is transported from the poles to the equator. The third term (with P10 = sin φ) represents heat surplus on the summer hemisphere and is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the summer into the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere</b> (Fig. 2b). Its relative amplitude is of the order ΔT10 ≃ 0.13. The fourth term (with P11(φ) = cos φ) is the dominant diurnal wave (the tidal mode (1,−2)). It is responsible for the transport of excess heat from the daytime hemisphere into the nighttime hemisphere (Fig. 2d). Its relative amplitude is ΔT11≃ 0.15, thus on the order of 150 K. Additional terms (e.g., semiannual, semidiurnal terms and higher order terms) must be added to eq.(3). However, they are of minor importance. Corresponding sums can be developed for density, pressure, and the various gas constituents.|$|E
30|$|The global {{circulation}} {{of the middle}} atmosphere tends to produce polar vortices in the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere</b> (Brewer 1949; Dobson 1956; Dunkerton and Delisi 1986; Schoeberl et al. 1992; Fisher et al. 1993), isolating the polar air from that at lower latitudes—the reason, for example, that the ozone holes form preferentially over the poles. While downwelling air dominates the middle atmosphere in the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> the summer hemisphere is dominated by upwelling (see Fig.  2). Adiabatic cooling of the rising air in the polar summer mesosphere produces the lowest temperatures found anywhere in the Earth’s environment (Reid 1989; Lübken 1999; Singer et al. 2003).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{have looked}} for {{enhancements}} of the O/N 2 ratio in data {{measured by the}} Dynamics Explorer 2 (DE 2) satellite in the middle latitudes of the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> based on a prediction that {{was made by the}} National Center for Atmospheric Research thermosphere/tonosphere general circulation model (NCAR-TIGCM) that such increases occur. The NCAR-TIGCM predicts that these enhancements should be seen throughout the low latitude region and in many middle latitude locations, but that the enhancements in O/N 2 are particularly strong in the middle-latitude, evening-to-midnight sector of the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> When this prediction was used to look for these effects in DE 2 NACS (neutral atmosphere composition spectrometer) data, large enhancements in the O/N 2 ratio (approx. 50 to 90 %) were seen. These enhancements were observed during the main phase of a storm that occurred on November 24, 1982, and were seen in the same region of the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere</b> predicted by the NCAR-TIGCM. They are partially the result of the depletion of N 2 and, as electron loss is dependent on dissociative recombination at F(sub 2) altitudes, they have implications for electron densities in this area. Parcel trajectories, which have been followed through the NCAR-TIGCM history file for this event, show that large O/N 2 enhancements occur in this limited region in the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere</b> for two reasons. First, these parcels of air are decelerated by the antisunward edge of the ion convection pattern; individual parcels converge and subsidence occurs. Thus molecular-nitrogen-poor air is brought from higher to lower heights. Because neutral parcels that are found a little poleward of the equatorial edge of the eveningside convection pattern are swept inward {{toward the center of the}} auroral oval, the enhancements occur only in a very limited range of latitudes. Second, nitrogen-poor air is transported from regions close to the magnetic pole in the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> During geomagnetic storms, enhanced meridional winds are driven by the increased pressure-gradient force that is associated with intensified Joule heating in the auroral oval. These pressure-driven winds decrease rapidly on the dayside beyond the auroral oval where the parcels originate, limiting the region into which the parcels can be transported. Thus these two processes drive values of O/N 2 in a limited region of the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> and reinforce only in the evening sector, causing large changes in this region...|$|E

40|$|In this research, we used {{numerical}} simulation {{to study the}} effect of interhemispheric field-aligned currents (IHCs), going between two conjugate ionospheres in two hemispheres, on the equivalent ionospheric currents (EICs). We computed the maps of these EICs In two hemispheres during summer-winter conditions, when {{the effect of the}} IHCs is especially significant. The main results may be summarized as follows. In <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> the IHCs may significantly exceed and be a substitute for the local R 1 currents, and they may strongly affect the magnitude, location, and direction of the EICs In the nightside winter auroral ionosphere. While in summer polar cap the EICs tend to flow sunward, and in winter polar cap the EICs turn toward dawn due to the effect of the IHCs. The well-known reversal {{in the direction of the}} EICs in the vicinity of the midnight meridian, in <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> is observed not at the polar caps boundary (as usually expected) but equatorward of this boundary in the region of the IHCs location.

30|$|Another {{interesting}} feature {{observed during}} this storm is the well-pronounced hemispheric asymmetry in the nighttime Ne and VTEC enhancement in both ~ 23 and 01 LT sectors. The asymmetry is usually {{explained by the}} seasonal impact due to the seasonal changes in the thermospheric circulation. It is known that in summer the daytime background (solar-induced) circulation is directed equatorwards, and it is poleward in the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere</b> (e.g., Fuller-Rowell et al. 1996; Fuller-Rowell 2011). With the onset of a geomagnetic storm, the high-latitude heating drives a global wind surge from both polar regions toward the equator. Consequently, in the summer hemisphere the storm-time daytime circulation coincides with the background one, and it opposes in the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> The storm-time changes in the global circulation lead {{to changes in the}} neutral composition and the expansion of the neutral composition bulge to low latitudes (e.g., Fuller-Rowell 2011). On the nightside, the background and the storm-induced circulations are both directed equatorward, which leads {{to the fact that the}} composition disturbance can reach much lower latitudes. These storm-time alterations are known to often provoke ionospheric positive storms in the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere,</b> whereas negative storms occur more often in the summer hemisphere (e.g., Prölss 1995; Danilov 2013). However, the June 2015 storm occurred just during the summer solstice time, but we observed stronger effect in the summer hemisphere, which is contrary to the commonly observed features. One can notice in Figs.  2, 3, and 4 that the quiet-time levels also show the hemispheric asymmetry, with slightly larger VTEC and Ne values in the NH (i.e., the summer hemisphere) than in the SH (i.e., the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere).</b> This may confirm the seasonal feature of the observed asymmetry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The neutral gas {{temperature}} and circulation of the thermosphere are calculated for December solstice conditions near solar cycle maximum using NCAR’s thermospheric genera 1 circulation mode 1 (TGCM). High-latitude heat and momentum sources significantly alter the basic solar-driven circulation during solstice. At F-region heights, the increased ion density {{in the summer}} hemisphere results in a larger ion drag momentum source for the neutral gas than in the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> As a result there are larger wind velocities and a greater tendency for the neutral gas to follow the magnetospheric convection pattern in the summer hemisphere than in the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere.</b> There is about three times more Joule heating in the summer than the <b>winter</b> <b>hemisphere</b> for moderate levels of geomagnetic activity due to the greater electrical conductivity in the summer E-region ionosphere. The results ofseveral TGCM runs are used to show that at F-region heights {{it is possible to}} linearly combine thesolar-driven and high-latitudedriven solutions to obtain the total temperature structureand circulation to within l& 20 %. In the lower thermosphere, however, non-linear terms cause significant departures and a linear superposition of fields is not valid. The F-region winds at high latitudes calculated by the TGCM are also compared to the meridional wind derived from measurements by the FabryyPerot Interferometer (FPI) and the zonal wind derived fro...|$|E
