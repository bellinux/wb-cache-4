5|$|In 25BC, an army under Aulus Terentius Varro Murena <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Salassi in the Aosta Valley. At {{some time}} between 25 and 7BC – either {{following}} the Aosta campaign or, more likely, {{in the course}} of the conquest of Raetia in 15BC – a campaign also subjugated the Celtic tribes of the Valais and opened the Great St Bernard Pass.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, the New Zealand {{government}} {{set aside}} Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry {{was aware that}} native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and kiwi from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> nascent kakapo population within 6 years.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{structures}} {{within an}} 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including {{the entire community}} of Richmond, were obliterated. A pressure wave snapped trees, bent iron rails, demolished buildings, grounded vessels, and scattered fragments of Mont-Blanc for kilometres. Hardly a window in the city proper survived the blast. Across the harbour, in Dartmouth, there was also widespread damage. A tsunami created by the blast <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> community of Mi'kmaq First Nations people {{who had lived in}} the Tufts Cove area for generations.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{population of}} Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and caused them to seek food in areas where they were more vulnerable to hunting.|$|E
5|$|After the war Alvarez was {{involved}} in the design of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He {{was involved}} in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, he developed the Alvarez hypothesis which proposes that the extinction event that <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.|$|E
5|$|At {{a special}} sitting of Parliament on 28 August 1939, Rhodesia {{determined}} {{to stand by}} Great Britain {{in the event that}} war should break out, as was expected. Of a white population of just 65,000, only 10,000 were fit and available for active service. It was decided not to create a full Rhodesian formation: if it were <b>wiped</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> colony's future prosperity would be put at risk. Instead mostly small groups of Rhodesians were distributed throughout the British Army, Navy and Air Force. In the Defence Report of 1939, it was stated that forces would be trained and organised not only for internal security and defence but also to defend British interests in service outside its borders.|$|E

5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been <b>wiped</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 1958, the Tories won what {{is still}} the largest {{majority}} (in terms of percentage of seats) in Canadian federal political history, winning 208 seats to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning 8 and Social Credit <b>wiped</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> Progressive Conservatives won {{a majority of the}} votes and of the seats in every province except British Columbia (49.8%) and Newfoundland. Quebec's Union Nationale political machine had given the PC party little support, but with Quebec voters minded to support Diefenbaker, Union Nationale boss Maurice Duplessis threw the machinery of his party behind the Tories.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{left the}} Flames {{as a free}} agent {{following}} the playoff run, opting to sign a four-year, US$12 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings. He later admitted that he did not truly wish to leave the Flames, but facing financial uncertainty with the 2004–05 NHL lockout looming, Conroy chose to accept the guaranteed contract. The lockout <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> first year of the deal, but he returned in 2005–06 to reach the 20-goal mark for the third time and 60 points {{for the second time in}} his career. During that season, he joined the United States national team for a second time, playing in the 2006 Winter Olympics. He appeared in six games, scoring one goal and five points for the eighth place Americans.|$|E

5|$|Many of Coffin's {{theories}} and principles {{can be seen}} in practice in her most famous creation, Harry and Ruth du Pont's gardens at their Winterthur estate. Her work on the gardens began in 1929 and became the biggest commission of her career. It was very fortuitously timed for her, as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fortunes of many of her clients and brought to an end the era of commissioning elaborate gardens for large country estates. Coffin had somewhat better luck with her investments and the enormous fortune of the du Ponts insulated the family from the worst of the Great Depression, permitting work on Winterthur to continue throughout the downturn. With the money from her investments and the fees from the du Ponts for the Winterthur commission, Coffin was able to maintain two homes, a maid and a chauffeur despite the general economic decline.|$|E
5|$|Not long after, {{the legend}} continues, {{a group of}} Sakalava (or, by some accounts, Vazimba) warriors were {{preparing}} to attack a village north of Alasora called Ambohipeno. Ralambo {{announced that it would}} be sufficient to throw a rotten egg at the warriors, and Kelimalaza would take care of the rest. According to oral history, the egg was thrown and hit a warrior in the head, killing him on contact; his corpse fell onto another warrior and killed him, and this corpse fell onto another and so forth, until the warriors had all been destroyed, forevermore confirming the power of Kelimalaza as the protector of the kingdom {{in the minds of the}} Merina populace. Similarly, at the besieged Imerina village of Ambohimanambola, invoking Kelimalaza was said to have produced a massive hailstorm that <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> enemy warriors.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Hokies {{had even}} less success {{than they did}} in the air. Branden Ore, Tech's {{starting}} tailback, earned 42yards in 20shortrushes during the game. With a long run of eight yards, Ore was kept in check by Georgia's defense. The only other Hokie to achieve positive yardage on the ground was backup tailback Kenny Lewis, who only managed five yards. Glennon was sacked three times, once fumbling the ball. These sacks <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> 11 rushing yards he managed to gain during his scrambles for yardage. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech was aided by excellent field position, enabling them to score three offensive touchdowns. Tech's average starting field position in that quarter was the Georgia 48-yard line, allowing for easy scores even for a struggling offense.|$|E

5|$|Reshef sent another tank {{company to}} rescue the infantrymen. The tanks {{advanced}} towards the Chinese Farm from the south. As they neared the farm and the village, a downpour of anti-tank and artillery fire forced the company to retreat. Nathan kept pleading with Rehsef to send additional support, unaware he was facing superior Egyptian forces after entering the administrative bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. With no help coming, the unit commander had his men carry the wounded and attempted to leave the battlefield, tasking two sections of heavy machine guns with providing cover to the force. As the Israelis slowly made {{their way back to}} their lines, a group of Egyptian tanks intercepted and <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Israeli force.|$|E
5|$|The first {{nationalist}} incursion following UDI came in March 1966, when {{four small}} groups of ZANLA insurgents crossed the Zambezi near Chirundu. One team of seven cadres contacted the BSAP near the northern town of Sinoia on 28 April 1966 and was <b>wiped</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> police killing all seven without taking casualties. On 16 May another of the ZANLA groups murdered a farmer, Johannes Viljoen, and his wife at their farm just north of Hartley. 1 Commando and the police were deployed on Operation Pagoda, which ended on 18 September 1966, the BSAP having done most of the work; as the local police commanders were reluctant {{at this time to}} sign control over to the army, the RLI had been given little opportunity to act.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} {{focuses on}} the invasion and land battles of Iwo Jima. The player commands the United States Marine Corps against the Imperial Japanese Army, who are occupying the islands {{as part of the}} Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II. The game is menu-based and only allows the player to use four command functions; move, attack, land and pass. Depending on the difficulty set, the game lasts 32 to 36 turns and can only be won by eliminating all Japanese forces from the island before the final turn ends. During the game, the enemy may fortify their positions, launch air strikes against the United States Navy fleet or may perform suicide attacks if their unit is about to be <b>wiped</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> player also has the ability to order air strikes against the enemy, if weather permits.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} to the environment; 200square miles (700km²) of low-lying rainforest and pine and evergreen oak woodlands were greatly damaged in southern Mexico. Strong waves produced severe beach erosion in some locations. The erosion affected two nesting cycles for the Olive Ridley turtle, destroying about 40million eggs. Nearly 806,000 nests were affected, and about 50% of these were <b>wiped</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> deadliest and most intense hurricane to hit southern Mexico since 1959, the hurricane was the first documented hurricane strike on Pacific coral reefs. Crop damage was extreme, and 400,000 bags of coffee were lost. In {{the days after the}} hurricane, soybean and wheat prices increased. In all, Hurricane Pauline had a large effect on fauna in Southern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In {{the morning}} of December 31, the 4th Marine Battalion {{returned}} to the crash site with the entire force and the American graves were located and their corpses were dug up. At about 3 pm, a single U.S. helicopter arrived on the battlefield to evacuate the casualties, but they only picked up {{the bodies of the}} four American crewmen, while South Vietnamese casualties were forced to wait for another helicopter to arrive. At 4 pm, Major Nguyễn Văn Nho ordered the 4th Marine Battalion to carry their casualties back to the village, instead of continuing to wait for the helicopters. As the 4th Marine Battalion began their return march, three Viet Cong battalions, with artillery support, suddenly attacked them from three directions. The battalion's commanding and executive officers were immediately killed and air support was not available. Two Marine companies managed to fight {{their way out of the}} ambush and back to Bình Giã, but the third was overrun and almost completely <b>wiped</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> fourth company desperately held out at a hilltop against Viet Cong artillery barrages and large infantry charges, before slipping out through the enemy positions at dawn. The 4th Marine Battalion of 426 men lost a total of 117 soldiers killed, 71 wounded and 13 missing. Among the casualties were 35 officers of the 4th Marine Battalion killed in action, and the four American advisers attached to the unit were also wounded. Backed by U.S. Air Force bombers, on January 1 three battalions of ARVN Airborne reinforcements arrived, they were too late as most of the Viet Cong had already withdrawn from the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The {{breakout}} {{began as}} soon as the weather allowed the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing to provide air cover on 1 December. As the soldiers formed a convoy and tried to leave the perimeter, the PVA 241st Regiment immediately swarmed over the American forces, with three other regiments closing in. Left with no choice, the covering aircraft dropped napalm right in front of RCT-31, causing casualties among both Chinese and US troops. The resulting firestorm <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> blocking Chinese company, allowing the convoy to advance. As the front of RCT-31 made their way forward, heavy small arms fire caused many members of the rear guard to seek shelter below the road instead of protecting the trucks. Chinese fire also killed or wounded those already in the trucks as well as the drivers, who viewed the job as a form of suicide. Slowly, the convoy approached a roadblock under Hill 1221 in the late afternoon. Several parties tried to clear Hill 1221, but after taking part of the hill, the leaderless soldiers continued out onto the frozen reservoir instead of returning to the column. As Faith led an assault on the roadblock, he was hit by a Chinese grenade and subsequently died of his wounds. The convoy managed to fight past the first road block, but as it reached the second at Hudong-ni, RCT-31 disintegrated under Chinese attacks. About 1,050 soldiers out of the original 2,500 managed to reach Hagaru-ri, and only 385 survivors were deemed able-bodied. The remnants of RCT-31 were formed into a provisional army battalion {{for the rest of the}} battle.|$|E
