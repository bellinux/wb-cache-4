Shortly after the port guard boat's departure, the port quarter boat, with around twelve <b>women</b> <b>and</b> five crew aboard, was being readied for lowering into the water when it, too, was rushed by members of the crew.

No sooner was it launched when it was overwhelmed by men, who leapt into the water and clambered into the boat; all but one of these were crew members. With his boat now full, Baalham disregarded Luce's instructions to pick up <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children, and drifted away. Meanwhile, the upended port quarter boat had been righted, but despite Luce's efforts to give women passengers priority, it was again rushed by crew and male passengers, who thrust aside the waiting <b>women</b> <b>and</b> cut the boat adrift from the ship while it was only partially filled.|$|E
