5|$|In {{that same}} year, Edmund Grey, {{the son of}} a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see his {{childhood}} friend, Angelique. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will because she believed Dimitri <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he will stay with Angelique, she destroys the will {{in order to keep the}} estate for her daughter. Edmund accuses Dimitri of stealing the will and files a lawsuit to have Hugo's body exhumed in order to perform a DNA test. Dimitri believes Edmund is lying about everything and is infuriated by the lawsuit. The hatred between the two deepens even more. Eventually, the truth about what Helga did is revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past behind them and they bond as brothers. They develop an extremely close and loving relationship, but they also continue to have a standing rivalry.|$|E
5|$|Olivia worries it {{will happen}} again, and though she {{attempts}} to ward off sleep, she next dreams that she helps a woman murder her husband at a restaurant. They interview the wife, who tells them she became so convinced her husband <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her that she became angry and stabbed him. The team posits that while no one is actually causing the incidents, they are happening as Olivia has seen them. At the restaurant, the owner tells them a blond man with a scar named Nick Lane (David Call) {{was sitting in the}} same place as Olivia was in her dream, and was also seen in the video surveillance from the first crime scene. Walter posits that because she never sees him in her dreams, it was Lane, not Olivia, causing the people's deaths. Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude's Mental Hospital, who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident, but left after the visit of a mysterious man. The doctor described him as hyperemotive, meaning those near him adopt his emotions. Olivia and Peter soon learn that as a child, Lane was treated with the nootropic drug Cortexiphan in drug trials, and believes himself to be a recruit in the upcoming war between the two universes.|$|E
5|$|For {{eight months}} over 1875–76, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain {{on a tour}} of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The prince had planned an all-male group and {{intended}} to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by his wife that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him for another man: Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Veltroni {{resigned}} {{as leader of}} the party after being elected Mayor of Rome. In May 2006, Veltroni was confirmed Mayor of Rome, easily defeating former Minister of Agriculture Gianni Alemanno, of National Alliance, obtaining an unprecedented 61.4% of the valid votes against the 37.1% achieved by his main opponent. The percentage of votes that supported Veltroni's second term in office was a record in local elections in Rome. Shortly before this confirmation, Veltroni had declared that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> politics {{at the end of his}} second term as Mayor.|$|E
25|$|Opening acts for {{the band}} {{included}} the bands Free, Taste and an R rock act called Delaney & Bonnie. Because Clapton liked the soulful, folksy-sounding blues of Delaney & Bonnie, he began spending {{most of his time}} with them instead of Blind Faith, letting Winwood take a more prominent role in the band. Clapton even began sitting in on their opening sets, sometimes simply playing percussion, and showing more interest in them than his own band. Baker has since said it was obvious that Clapton <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the band as soon as the tour was over.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 Miika Partala {{announced}} that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the band as did Janne-Jussi Kontoniemi. They decided to play the remaining gigs in Deuteronomium. During June 2000 they played three gigs in Germany. June 20 they played at Heavy und Biker club, Oelsnitz/Erzebirgen with death metal band Sacrificium. The black metal fans that showed up weren't pleased {{when they found out}} Deuteronomium is a Christian band. June 30 they played at club Che in Stuttgart with Sacrificium and Acoustic Torment. The third and last gig was played at the countryside of Gotha, Freakstock festival with speed/power metal band Seventh Avenue. That gig marked the end of Deuteronomium's active era.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, Soltani signed with VVV-Venlo, who were then playing in the Eerste Divisie, the second highest {{division}} in the Netherlands. In his first season, he made 19 appearances, scoring 3 goals for the club. He would build on those numbers in his second season, making 30 appearances and scoring 7 goals, and leading the club to promotion to the Eredivisie. In the 2007–08 season, Soltani scored 3 goals in 28 appearances for the club. On 30 March 2008, {{it was reported that}} Soltani <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> VVV-Venlo {{at the end of his}} contract and return to France to be closer to his family. However, he decided to remain in the Netherlands and instead joined ADO Den Haag at the start of the 2008–09 season.|$|E
25|$|The {{rift between}} Gordon and Sievers climaxed on 14 July 1721 when, at a banquet commemorating {{the battle of}} 'Hango Head,' a violent quarrel broke out {{between the two men}} in the {{presence}} of the Tsar. Gordon complained about the Dane’s behaviour towards him and pointed out that, as Seivers was responsible for the appointments of lieutenants and all inferiors, he was appointing the best officers and men to the Danish and Dutch commanders. The General-Admiral, Count Apraxin, did his best to justify the actions of Rear Admiral Sievers and maintained that Gordon had falsely accused him of partiality when dividing the officers and men. During his conversation he referred to Gordon as ‘your admiral’ to Peter the Great which was not well received. As Sievers <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Tsar’s service at the end of the campaign, it was left like that. The next day Peter called the two admirals together and made them drink a glass of wine together hoping that this would end their bickering.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 2007 Palermo was {{involved}} in a controversial away Sicilian derby, suspended for 30 minutes during the second half and followed by violence outside the Catania stadium in which policeman Filippo Raciti was killed by a small explosive launched by a Catania hooligan. This was followed by a two-weeks stop to all football leagues and national team matches in the whole country. Successively to these events Palermo, then clearly third-placed, did not manage to achieve a single victory, and dropped down to sixth position in the Serie A. Club chairman Maurizio Zamparini became more critical of Guidolin and finally sacked him on April 23, 2007 following a 3-4 home defeat to third-last placed Parma which extended the run of poor results to 11 games without a single win. Assistant coach Renzo Gobbo and youth team coach Rosario Pergolizzi, appointed as caretaker coaches at Guidolin's place, led the team for two matches, a 2-1 away win at Livorno in their debut which ended the negative run and two further defeats, including an upset 3-2 away loss against last-placed team Ascoli, already relegated to Serie B at the time, which left the rosanero in seventh place, the last UEFA Cup spot, only three points above Atalanta. The events led Zamparini to revoke Guidolin's dismissal and call him back for the remaining two matches. Guidolin's return brought two victories, to Siena and Udinese, ending the season in fifth place, obtaining thus qualification to the UEFA Cup 2007-08 for the third consecutive time and breaking its previous record of 53 points of two years before. On May 31, 2007 Palermo chairman Maurizio Zamparini announced Stefano Colantuono as new rosanero coach for the 2007–08 season. The first two signings for the new season, midfielder Giulio Migliaccio from Atalanta and goalkeeper Samir Ujkani from Anderlecht, were announced on June 8. Contemporarily, team captain Eugenio Corini, whose contract was due to expire within a few days, announced he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Palermo. Palermo's moves in the summer market included notable signings such as Boško Janković and Fabrizio Miccoli to replace Andrea Caracciolo and David Di Michele, sold to Sampdoria and Torino respectively. A fairly unimpressive start in the season, including a shock UEFA Cup elimination against Czech minnows FK Mlada Boleslav, however convinced Zamparini to sack Colantuono after a crush 5–0 loss to Juventus, re-calling Guidolin {{at the helm of the}} rosanero. Guidolin's fourth spell as Palermo boss proved to be even more unsuccessful, as Palermo struggled in the league, falling down to thirteenth place with concerns of being unexpectedly involved in the relegation battle. A 3–2 home loss to Genoa, the third in a row for Palermo, followed by Guidolin's controversial attacks against the supporting fanbase and the club management, brought in to Colantuono being reinstated as rosanero boss on March 24, 2008.|$|E

500|$|Overmars {{made his}} debut for Barcelona against Arsenal in the Amsterdam Tournament in August 2000. He lasted 45 minutes and was {{substituted}} after sustaining an ankle injury. His first competitive start came {{at home to}} Málaga on 8 September 2000. His performance in the match started off well, then faded before coming {{back in the second}} half, opined Andrés Astruells in El Mundo Deportivo. He scored his first goal for the club at home to Racing de Santander on 23 September 2000; it involved him dribbling the ball around the goalkeeper. Barcelona made an indifferent start to the 2000–01 season and by February 2001, journalist Sid Lowe commented it looked improbable that Lorenzo Serra Ferrer would remain as manager of the club. Wenger was touted as his replacement after reportedly meeting with Gaspart. Overmars believed his former manager <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Arsenal and revealed that, [...] "Barcelona have asked for lots of information about Wenger.

[...] In La Liga, Overmars scored the team's seventh goal in their 7–0 win against Athletic Bilbao in March 2001; his performance was rated four stars out of five by El Mundo Deportivo.|$|E
