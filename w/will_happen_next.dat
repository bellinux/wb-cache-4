5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each {{day three}} videos from the {{internet}} are shown, they are unusual and often not sports related. Often, the last video will be paused in the middle to pose a multiple-choice question to the hosts about what they think <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b> Although rare, some videos are fake.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b> For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E

But Emma refuses to believe Ingrid when she warns her that Gold only wanted to hurt her for his own self-benefits. Emma notices that the image is an {{illusion}} as she tries to touch Ingrid, so she returns to the car and speeds off to the mansion. As Emma arrives at the place, Gold sets up the hat to absorb her and her powers in a closed room. Emma waits for Gold at the other side, and before she opens the door, Gold appears behind her, telling Emma that everything will be fine once her powers are gone, and that she will be able to live a normal life. Emma then thanks Gold, not knowing <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next</b> as she ponders about opening the door.|$|E

50|$|As a parody, {{it is kind}} of {{predictable}} {{knowing what}} <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> the <b>next</b> episode. The only thing the viewer has to do is follow the political news. For example, in 2004, Andrés Manuel López Obrador had problems with the law, confronting a desafuero judge, so in the show all the trouble was parodied for months.|$|R
500|$|According to Chahi, he was {{inspired}} by his 1999 trip to Mount Yasur's crater in Vanuatu. The scenery, {{and the power of}} the volcano, which was extremely active at the time, fascinated and scared him. Chahi, still intending to make another video game [...] "before [...] died", hoped that his next project could convey the: [...] "ambivalence of Nature, beautiful and potentially violent at the same time". Becoming more and more interested in the world's natural forces, Chahi went on to visit different volcanoes, including Dolomieu crater on Reunion Island, and a volcano in the Indian Ocean. Once the development was underway, Montpellier even recorded audio from a real volcano for inclusion in the game. Nature and cycle were some of the most important key elements of the game. The team intended to create different cycles and loops that would result in different kinds of interaction between the environments. For example, the tide cycle and eruption cycle changes dynamically, and it impacts the growth of plants and the lives of the villagers. According to Chahi, the cycle allows players to anticipate what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
500|$|It is {{considered}} to have [...] "one of the most shocking twists on Black Mirror", as Jenelle Riley of Variety puts it, some time before the third series started. Writing before the third series, Margaret Lyons of The New York Times said it is [...] "the most outright disturbing" [...] episode of Black Mirror. Right after it aired, Cocks deemed it [...] "the single darkest episode of Black Mirror so far" [...] and considered its twist to be [...] "nothing short of genius". Sims stated that it [...] "is, by a significant margin, the most disturbing episode Black Mirror has produced". Although he praised the twist as [...] "a smart one, brilliantly concealed and smartly revealed," [...] he criticized it because [...] "once the point is made, it is made over and over again." [...] Lambie praised its [...] "fearsome pace" [...] and highlighted [...] "its subtle approach", with sparse dialogue, that gives [...] "the events and performances greater impact". He concluded: [...] "its horror-infused drama leaves us unsure whom we can trust or what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next,</b> and its last act is truly gut-wrenching". Monahan wrote that the twist was unpredictable and the episode [...] "was an exciting and efficient piece of narrative rug-pulling".|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} launch, Ian Bogost {{describes}} Play the News as [...] "very casual", and fears {{that it can}} be summarised as simple quizzes. He claims that the game has some potential to engage people with news, [...] "by making them think about what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next</b> and by creating a natural reason to read stories one otherwise might not". The game won in May 2009 the first [...] "Knight News Game Awards", awarded by the association Games for Change. It rewards [...] "news game", games that [...] "enhances people's ability to make decisions in a democracy".|$|E

It was mixed by Tony Espie (The Avalanches, New Buffalo, Robert Palmer), at 001 Studios in Melbourne. Cyclic Defrosts Vaughan Healey described a typical gig as [...] "a bewildering ride through dynamic tempo changes, finger clicks and swapped instruments.
