5|$|Turgut Reis {{was laid}} up again on 30 October 1918, and was {{refitted}} at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard from 1924 to 1925. After returning to service, {{she served as}} a stationary training ship based at Gölcük. At the time, she retained only two of her originally six 28cm guns. She was decommissioned in 1933 and was thereafter used as a barracks ship for dockyard workers, a role she filled until 1950, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> be broken up at Gölcük. By 1953, the ship had been broken down into two sections, and these were sold to be dismantled abroad. Demolition work was finally completed between 1956 and 1957.|$|E
5|$|Heian {{women were}} {{traditionally}} excluded from learning Chinese, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised in her erudite father's household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics {{and managed to}} acquire fluency. She married in her mid-to late twenties and {{gave birth to a}} daughter before her husband died, two years after they were married. It is uncertain <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> write The Tale of Genji, but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, Murasaki was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Shōshi at the Imperial court, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Shōshi to the Lake Biwa region. Scholars differ on the year of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1031.|$|E
5|$|Alongside her singing, Malouma {{has also}} fought to {{safeguard}} her country's music, urging {{the government to}} create a music school, forming her own foundation in support of musical heritage, and in 2014 creating her own music festival. She has also been active in politics since the 1990s, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> campaign for more democracy. She was elected a senator in 2007, the first politician in her caste, but was arrested the following year after a coup d'état. When elections were again held in 2009, she became a senator for the opposition Ech-Choura party where she was given special responsibilities for the environment. This led in 2011 to her appointment as the IUCN's Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa. In December 2014, she announced she was moving from the opposition to join the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, where she felt she could {{be more effective in}} contributing to the country's progress. Her work has been recognized by the French, who decorated her as a Knight of the Legion of Honor, and the Americans, whose ambassador to Mauritania named her a Mauritanian Woman of Courage.|$|E

Her painting style changed in 1947, turning from small landscapes and portraits into a bold, subjective abstraction <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> make constructions from bits of wood and other materials that washed up on the beach near her home; most often her constructions reflected the area around her North Fork home, but sometimes the pieces reflected her travels to the Caribbean and abroad.|$|E

25|$|While {{the green}} glazed ware {{continues}} to be Atzompa's staple product, {{there has been some}} innovation in the pottery tradition here. In the 1970s, a local potter by the name of Dolores Porras gained notoriety when she went against convention and pioneered the production of multicolored glazed pottery. Porras taught herself how to paint on clay pieces, starting with red and white washes. Later she added blues, greens, grays and oranges. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> produce these pieces, she was considered to be crazy. However, her pieces began to sell and other potters began to imitate her work. Later on, she introduced the use of lead-free glazes. Today, her pieces are part of Atzompa's pottery traditions even though she herself is outsold by younger potters who produce cheaper and better wares.|$|E

25|$|Yvonne Bédard {{was born}} in the Six Nations Indian Reserve in Brantford {{as a member of the}} Iroquois Nation. On May, 1964, Mrs. Bédard married a non-Indian, begetting two {{children}} with him. Mrs. Bédard and her spouse lived together off the Reserve until June 23, 1970, when they separated. Mrs. Bédard returned with her two children to the Reserve to live in a house bequeathed to her by her mother, Carrie Williams. Since Mrs Bédard had married a non-Indian, she was no longer listed in the Registry as an Indian. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> occupy the house on the reserve, the Six Nations Band Council passed a resolution ordering Mrs. Bédard to dispose of the property within the next six months, during which time she could live there. The Council latter adopted two additional resolutions allowing Mrs. Bédard to live in the house for another six months, and then another two months, but no longer than that. In order to act in accordance with the Council's resolutions, Mrs. Bédard eventually transferred ownership of the property to her brother (a registered member of the Band) who was granted a Certificate of Possession of the property on March 15, 1971, by the Minister of Indian Affairs as required by the Indian Act. Mrs. Bédard and her children, with her brother's consent, remained to occupy the premises without rent. On September 15, 1971, the Six Nations Band Council passed Resolution 15, requesting the Brantford District Supervisor to serve notice to Mrs. Bédard that she shall quit the Reserve. Mrs. Bédard would later lose her status as an Indian shortly after taking the Six Nations Band Council to Court, slightly before she could deliver her statement of claim against the Council.|$|E
