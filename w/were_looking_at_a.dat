The uncertainty over TSR-2 led to the Australians selecting an adapted version of the F-111 in 1963. The RAF were asked to evaluate the F-111 as a cheaper option for the strike aircraft requirement, although the incoming Labour government denied it planned to cancel the British aircraft. This denial was reversed in April 1965, when TSR-2 was cancelled and a decision taken {{to look into the}} option of acquiring up to 110 F-111s instead.|$|E
500|$|David Crane and Marta Kauffman began {{developing}} {{three new}} television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom Family Album was cancelled by CBS in 1993. Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about [...] "six {{people in their}} 20s making their way in Manhattan" [...] to NBC, since {{they thought it would}} fit best there. Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series Dream On. The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when the future was [...] "more of a question mark." [...] They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed [...] "everybody knows that feeling", and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time. The team titled the series Insomnia Cafe, and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.|$|E
500|$|In his 1961 article [...] "The Abstract Sublime", {{originally}} published in ARTnews, the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes Friedrich's 1809 painting The Monk by the Sea, Turner's The Evening Star and Rothko's 1954 Light, Earth and Blue as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, [...] "Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us {{on the threshold of}} those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail—a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape—is no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> sunset or a moonlit night." ...|$|E

We knew it as though he had shouted it at us. His chest expanded time after time, as if it could not contain the beating of his heart.

60|$|After sitting {{a little}} time upon the stone bench, Rollo and Jennie rose and resumed their walk. The alley was {{extremely}} broad, {{and it was almost}} filled with parties of ladies and gentlemen, and with groups of children, who were walking to and fro, some going out toward the Triumphal Arch, and some returning. Rollo and Jennie, as they walked along, said very little to each other, their attention being almost wholly absorbed by the gay and gorgeous scene which surrounded them. At length they perceived that, at a little distance before them, the people were separating to the right hand and to the left, and going round in a sort of circuit; and, on coming to the place, they found that the great basin, or pond of water, which Mr. Holiday had described to them, was there. This pond was very large, much larger than Rollo had expected from his father's account of it. It was octagonal in form, and was bordered all around with stone. There were a number of children standing in groups on the brink, at different places; some were watching the motions of the gold fish that were swimming in the water, and others <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> little ship which a boy was sailing on the pond. The boy had a long thread tied to the bow of his ship; and when the wind had blown it out upon the pond to the length of the string, he would pull it back to the shore again, and then proceed to send it forth on another voyage.|$|E
6000|$|Persons who are imaginative almost {{invariably}} think of numerals {{in some form}} of visual imagery. If the idea of six occurs to them, the word [...] "six" [...] does not sound in their mental ear, but the figure 6 in a written or printed form rises before their mental eye. The clearness of the images of numerals, and the number of them that can be mentally viewed at the same time, differs greatly in different persons. The most common case is to see only two or three figures at once, and in a position too vague to admit of definition. There are a few persons in whom the visualising faculty is so low that they can mentally see neither numerals nor anything else; and again there are a few in whom it is so high as to give rise to hallucinations. Those who are able to visualise a numeral with a distinctness comparable to reality, and to behold {{it as if it were}} before their eyes, and not in some sort of dreamland, will define the direction in which it seems to lie, and the distance at which it appears to be. If they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> ship on the horizon at the moment that the figure 6 happened to present itself to their minds, they could say whether the image lay to the left or right of the ship, and whether it was above or below the line of the horizon; they could always point to a definite spot in space, and say with more or less precision that that was the direction in which the image of the figure they were thinking of, first appeared.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{could be}} more {{striking}} than {{the appearance of the}} above four leaves, each with their tentacles pointing truly to the two little masses of the phosphate on their discs. We might imagine that we <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> lowly organised animal seizing prey with its arms. In the case of Drosera the explanation of this accurate power of movement, no doubt, lies in the motor impulse radiating in all directions, and whichever side of a tentacle it first strikes, that side contracts, and the tentacle consequently bends towards the point of excitement. The pedicels of the tentacles are flattened, or elliptic in section. Near the bases of the short central tentacles, the flattened or broad face is formed of about five longitudinal rows of cells; in the outer tentacles of the disc it consists of about six or seven rows; and in the extreme marginal tentacles of above a dozen rows. As the flattened bases are thus formed of only a few rows of cells, the precision of the movements of the tentacles is the more remarkable; for when the motor impulse strikes the base of a tentacle in a very oblique direction relatively to its broad face, scarcely {{more than one or two}} cells towards one end can be affected at first, and the contraction of these cells must draw the whole tentacle into the proper direction. It is, perhaps, owing to the exterior pedicels being much flattened that they do not bend quite so accurately to the point of excitement as the [page 247] more central ones. The properly directed movement of the tentacles is not an unique case in the vegetable kingdom, for the tendrils of many plants curve towards the side which is touched; but the case of Drosera is far more interesting, as here the tentacles are not directly excited, but receive an impulse from a distant point; nevertheless, they bend accurately towards this point.|$|E

I should tell you I am well and happy, and [...] want for nothing. I do not exactly make money, or I should send a [...] remittance; but I am well cared for, have friends, live in a [...] beautiful place and climate, such as we have dreamed of together, and [...] no pity need be wasted on me. In such places, you understand, it is [...] easy to live, and live well, but often hard to make sixpence in [...] money. Explain this to my father, he will understand. I have no more [...] to say; only linger, going out, like an unwilling guest. God in [...] heaven bless you. Think of me at the last, here, on a bright beach, [...] the sky and sea immoderately blue, and the great breakers roaring [...] outside on a barrier reef, where a little isle sits green with palms.
