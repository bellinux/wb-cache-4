500|$|Some {{officers}} of the 52nd recorded their experiences in the regiment. One of the most notable was the Reverend William Leeke who, as a young ensign, carried the Regimental Colours at Waterloo. He believed that the actions taken by Sir John Colborne (Lord Seaton) and the 52nd to defeat the Imperial Guard {{at the close of}} the battle had been unjustly overlooked in official dispatches and histories, and wrote his memoirs so that [...] "the truth, with regard to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> the 52nd had achieved at Waterloo, [...] see the light". In 1866 his two-volume work The History of Lord Seaton's Regiment, (the 52nd Light Infantry) at the Battle of Waterloo was published, and has served as a primary source for most Waterloo historians since. Also to publish memoirs, although less successfully, was Reginald Wilberforce, grandson of slavery abolitionist William Wilberforce, who wrote, in 1894, An Unrecorded Chapter of the Indian Mutiny; on publication, the book was criticised by his fellow {{officers of}} the 52nd for its inaccuracy.|$|E
500|$|At {{an early}} age, she was {{introduced}} by her parents to blues music, jazz and art rock, which, she told Rolling Stone in 1995, would later influence her: [...] "I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker, to Howlin' Wolf, to Robert Johnson, {{and a lot of}} Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart. So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the way we are as we get older is a result of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> when we were children." [...] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was [...] "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection." [...] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205"). [...] Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as [...] "lazy journalism." [...] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is [...] "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing". Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : [...] "She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leeke also {{lamented that}} Wellington's despatches had unfairly {{made no mention}} of Colborne's vital command, and the 52nd's [...] "daring feat". His memoirs were partly {{inspired}} by what he felt to be a [...] "very great injustice [...] has been done to Lord Seaton and the 52nd Light Infantry, which regiment he commanded at Waterloo, by those who have attempted, in subsequent years, to write the history of that great battle", and that he considered [...] "the truth, with regard to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> the 52nd had achieved at Waterloo, ought to see the light".|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence {{had first}} {{arrived at the}} Spade Ranch in 1909 {{at the age of}} {{thirteen}} and grew up observing and working for its owners. In 1908 Bixby's father James, an eastern professor who had moved west for a position at the Spade School, filed on and moved to a section of land four miles (6km) east of the Spade Ranch Headquarters. On March 3, 1909 the rest of the Bixby family arrived at the depot in Ellsworth. From the back of the wagon, as they freighted north from Ellsworth, Lawrence led their milk cow, Old Roanie, and as they passed the Spade Ranch store, Mike Peterson saw them from the front porch. The Spade Foreman laughed when he saw the Bixby piano in the wagon. [...] "I'll just give them six months," [...] he said. Bixby's mother Jennie worked as a ranch cook at the Spade Headquarters Cookhouse. Lawrence would later recall, [...] "Every time some old drunken cook drank up the extract, the foreman would send someone after mother. I used to go up and help her at the cookhouse. I rode Old Plunger and had an eleven dollar Sears Roebuck saddle." [...] In March 1909 James took Lawrence to a cattle sale near Hay Springs, Nebraska. There they bought 28 head of heifers for $467.00. This was the start of Bixby's herd {{and with the help of}} a neighbor they trailed the cattle south for the Spade. They stayed the first night at Newton's Ranch and the next at Sam Green's. [...] "Mr. Green couldn't read nor write," [...] Lawrence wrote, [...] "but he would tell us wonderful stories about Quantrill's Raiders. We stopped at the Spade and branded our heifers with the J Lazy B but before long Newton came with the sheriff and said he was short two white-faced heifers. We had no way to prove <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> had happened, so we had to see them go". James chose the tranquil name of Cloverleaf Ranch for their new homestead but in the first year a rattlesnake bit their dog Spot, James killed a wolf and a neighbor threatened to contest Lawrence's sister Ina's homestead filing unless they gave him a cow, calf and a spool of wire.|$|E
