5|$|Du Bois was bitterly {{disappointed}} {{that many of}} his colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid not support him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas working class <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks</b> supported him enthusiastically. After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances. His primary concern was world peace, and he railed against military actions, such as the Korean War, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 {{the city}} adopted a {{commission}} form of government, which had three members elected by at-large voting. Considered to be progressive, {{as it would}} reduce the power of ward bosses, this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power, as only the majority could gain election of at-large candidates. In addition, poor <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks</b> had already been disenfranchised. Mobile {{was one of the}} last cities to retain this form of government, which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of their choice. But Alabama's white yeomanry had historically favored single-member districts in order to elect candidates of their choice.|$|E

5|$|In {{his address}} to the state {{legislature}} in January 1898, Bradley advocated {{the repeal of the}} state's Separate Coach Law, which provided separate streetcars for <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> He appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond the janitorial jobs they usually received. He named Edward E. Underwood as the first black person on the board of trustees for Kentucky State College (later the University of Kentucky). Because of his devotion to black advancement, Bradley was the only white person included in William Decker Johnson's 1897 compilation Biographical Sketches of Prominent Negro Men and Women of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks</b> exploded {{in five days}} of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
5|$|In chess {{tournaments and}} matches, the {{frequency}} with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks; with an even number of players, each receives one extra white or black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites, or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks,</b> and plays both White and Black against each opponent.|$|E

Analysis of census results shows that, in England and Wales only, 237,000 people stated their ethnicity as Mixed <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>Black</b> Caribbean, 189,000 as Mixed <b>White</b> <b>and</b> Asian, 156,000 as Other Mixed, <b>and</b> 79,000 Mixed <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>Black</b> African.|$|R

5|$|On March 3, in {{an effort}} to defuse the racial {{tensions}} caused by the sit-ins, Mayor West announced the formation of a Biracial Committee to seek a solution to the city's racial strife. The committee included the presidents of two of the city's black universities, but did not include any representatives from the student movement. The committee met several times over the next month and delivered its recommendations in a report on April 5. The committee recommended to partially integrate the city's lunch counters. Each store would have one section that was for whites only and another section for <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> This solution was rejected by the student leaders, who considered the recommendations to be morally unacceptable and based upon a policy of segregation. Less than a week after the Biracial Committee issued its report, the sit-ins resumed and the boycott of downtown businesses was intensified.|$|E
5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks</b> competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a juror would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, as anyone who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E
25|$|Research {{shows that}} {{segregation}} {{along racial lines}} contributes to public goods inequalities. <b>Whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks</b> are vastly more likely to support different candidates for mayor than <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks</b> in more integrated places, which makes them less able to build consensus. The lack of consensus leads to lower levels of public spending.|$|E

25|$|These {{seemingly}} contradictory trends {{were driven}} by the heavy, ongoing Hispanic and Asian immigration wave {{of the past four}} decades. For <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks,</b> these immigrants (and, increasingly, their U.S.-born children who are now of marrying age) have enlarged the pool of potential spouses for out-marriage.

25|$|By the 1960s, {{civil rights}} {{organizations}} were helping interracial couples {{who were being}} penalized for their relationships to take their cases to the Supreme Court. Since Pace v. Alabama, the court had declined {{to make a judgment}} in such cases. But in 1964, the Warren Court decided to issue a ruling {{in the case of an}} interracial couple from Florida who had been convicted because they had cohabited. In McLaughlin v. Florida, the Supreme Court ruled that the Florida state law which prohibited cohabitation between whites and non-whites was unconstitutional and based solely on a policy of racial discrimination. However, the court did not rule on Florida's ban on marriage between whites and non-whites, despite the appeal of the plaintiffs to do so and the argument made by the state of Florida that its ban on cohabitation between <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks</b> was ancillary to its ban on marriage between <b>whites</b> <b>and</b> <b>blacks.</b> However, in 1967, the court did decide to rule on the remaining anti-miscegenation laws when it was presented with the case of Loving v. Virginia.|$|E
