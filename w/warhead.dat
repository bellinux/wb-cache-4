5|$|The {{events of}} the game unfolds {{successively}} from the viewpoints of four different <b>Warhead</b> protagonists. The first one is Gene, {{a young man who}} becomes amnesic after the Arks accident. He is the son of professor Alvin, one of the builders of the Arks, who disappeared some time after the accident. While searching for his sister Aliz kidnapped by a strange creature, Gene is mutated into a <b>Warhead</b> and watches his arm turning into a weapon during a battle against some Otellos. He is assisted by a small floating companion named Pake; and is later joined by the <b>Warhead</b> Kilroy, who was an assistant to professor Alvin; and Meme, a mysterious but determined, optimistic young female <b>Warhead.</b>|$|E
5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the <b>warhead.</b> There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the <b>warhead</b> reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional <b>warhead</b> was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Bond infiltrates the circus, {{and finds}} that Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures {{with a nuclear}} <b>warhead,</b> primed to explode at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament, {{in the belief that}} the bomb was an American one that was detonated by accident, leaving the West's borders open to Soviet invasion. Bond deactivates the <b>warhead</b> and then he returns to India, joining an assault on Khan's palace.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>Warheads</b> Extreme Sour Hard Candy, the <b>Warheads</b> brand encompasses several other types of candy — <b>Warheads</b> Extreme Sour Hard Candy Mini Size (previously known as [...] "Juniors"), <b>Warheads</b> SuperSour Spray, <b>Warheads</b> Sour Jelly, <b>Warheads</b> SuperSour DoubleDrops, <b>Warheads</b> Sour Chewy Cubes, <b>Warheads</b> Sour Dippers, <b>Warheads</b> Sour Coolers, and <b>Warheads</b> Sour Twists. For a while, special [...] "HOT" [...] versions of the candy were also available but proved to be less popular. <b>Warheads</b> also distributed a fizzy version of their signature <b>Warheads.</b>|$|R
2500|$|As of January 2017, the Federation of American Scientists {{estimated}} that Russia has approximately 1,765 deployed strategic <b>warheads,</b> and another 2,700 non-deployed strategic and deployed and non-deployed tactical <b>warheads,</b> plus an additional 2,510 <b>warheads</b> awaiting dismantlement. Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces controls its land-based nuclear <b>warheads,</b> while the Navy controls the submarine based missiles and the Air Force the air-launched <b>warheads.</b> Russia's nuclear <b>warheads</b> are deployed in four areas: ...|$|R
25|$|In 2014, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{released}} a report, stating {{that there are}} a total of 2,530 <b>warheads</b> kept in reserve, and 2,120 actively deployed. Of the <b>warheads</b> actively deployed, the number of strategic <b>warheads</b> rests at 1,920 (subtracting 200 tactical B61s as part of Nato nuclear weapon sharing arrangements). The amount of <b>warheads</b> being actively disabled rests at about 2,700 <b>warheads,</b> which brings the total United States inventory to about 7,400 <b>warheads.</b>|$|R
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the <b>warhead</b> that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' <b>warhead,</b> several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the <b>warhead</b> hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 he {{attended}} the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. In the course of discussing a small nuclear <b>warhead</b> for the Mark 45 torpedo, he started a discussion {{on the possibility of}} developing a physically small one-megaton nuclear <b>warhead</b> for the Polaris missile. His counterpart in the discussion, J. Carson Mark from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at first insisted it could not be done. However, Dr. Mark eventually stated that a half-megaton <b>warhead</b> of small enough size could be developed. This yield, roughly thirty times that of the Hiroshima bomb, was enough for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke, who was present in person, and Navy strategic missile development shifted from Jupiter to Polaris {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the <b>warhead</b> and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a <b>warhead</b> and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the <b>warhead.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the {{stockpile}} included 5,886 strategic <b>warheads</b> and 1,120 tactical weapons. The strategic weapons included 1,490 ICBM <b>warheads,</b> 2,736 submarine-launched {{ballistic missile}} <b>warheads,</b> 1,660 bomber weapons such as strategic B61 and B83 gravity bombs, AGM-86 ALCM and several hundred spare <b>warheads.</b> The tactical weapons consist of 800 tactical B61 gravity bombs and 320 nuclear <b>warheads</b> for Tomahawk missiles.|$|R
50|$|Estimates of Pakistan's {{stockpile}} of nuclear <b>warheads</b> vary. The most recent analysis, {{published in the}} Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 2010, estimates that Pakistan has 70-90 nuclear <b>warheads.</b> In 2001, the U.S.-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimated that Pakistan had built 24-48 HEU-based nuclear <b>warheads</b> with HEU reserves for 30-52 additional <b>warheads.</b> In 2003, the U.S. Navy Center for Contemporary Conflict estimated that Pakistan possessed between 35 and 95 nuclear <b>warheads,</b> with a median of 60. In 2003, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace estimated a {{stockpile of}} approximately 50 weapons. By contrast, in 2000, U.S. military and intelligence sources estimated that Pakistan's nuclear arsenal may be as large as 100 <b>warheads.</b>|$|R

The three who reach the city are taken prisoner, and Flagg orders one of them executed for his defiance. As the other two are being prepared for a public execution, one of Flagg's most loyal followers, the Trashcan Man, arrives with a nuclear <b>warhead</b> salvaged from a military base.

5|$|For an answer, McElroy {{turned to}} the Re-entry Body Identification Group (RBIG), a {{sub-group}} of the Gaither Committee led by William E. Bradley, Jr. that had been studying the issue of penetrating a Soviet ABM system. The RBIG had delivered an extensive report on the topic on 2 April 1958 which suggested that defeating a Soviet ABM system would not be difficult. Their primary suggestion was to arm US missiles {{with more than one}} <b>warhead,</b> a concept known as Multiple Re-entry Vehicles (MRV). Each <b>warhead</b> would also be modified with radiation hardening, ensuring only a near miss could damage it. This would mean that the Soviets would have to launch at least one interceptor for each US <b>warhead,</b> while the US could launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile. If the Soviets added more interceptors to counter the increased number of US warheads, the US could counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own. The cost balance was always in favor of the offense. This basic concept would remain the primary argument against ABMs for the next two decades.|$|E

5|$|After Milrow was conducted, {{there was}} {{continued}} {{pressure on the}} part of environmental groups against going forward with the larger Cannikin test, while the Federation of American Scientists claimed that the <b>warhead</b> being tested was already obsolete.

5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous <b>warhead</b> required it to be fired from a grounded frame, called the M-30 (single frame, four round; later double frame, 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck.

50|$|The Layner missile is {{a highly}} {{advanced}} derivative of the three-stage liquid-propelled R-29RMU Sineva SLBM, which was accepted into service in 2007. While many technical details are not disclosed, {{it is known that}} the missile is capable of carrying up to twelve low-yield nuclear <b>warheads</b> called MIRVs capable of striking several targets individually. This is twice the number of <b>warheads</b> the solid-propellant RSM-56 Bulava SLBM can carry, and, unlike those of the Sineva SLBM, these <b>warheads</b> can be of a mixed set with various yields. While it shares flight characteristics with the Sineva, the Layner is equipped with improved systems to overcome anti-ballistic missile shields. The missile can carry ten low-yield <b>warheads</b> with penetration aids, eight low-yield <b>warheads</b> with more penetration aids, four medium-yield <b>warheads</b> with penetration aids.|$|R

5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise missiles {{in that they are}} designed to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition is intended to be expended in an attack and has a built-in <b>warhead.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moltke and Goeben {{were also}} armed with four 50cm (20in) torpedo tubes; one fore, one aft, and {{two on the}} broadside, with 11 torpedoes stored. The torpedoes were of the G/7 model, which weighed 1,365kg (3,010lb) and carried a <b>warhead</b> {{weighing}} 195kg (430lb). The torpedoes had a maximum range of 9,300m (10,200yd) at 27knots (50km/h), and 4,000m (4,400yd) when set at 37knots (69km/h).|$|E
5|$|Nike Zeus was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (ABM) system {{developed}} by the US Army during the late 1950s and early 1960s, designed to destroy Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile warheads before they could hit targets in the United States. It was designed by Bell's Nike team, and was initially based on the earlier Nike Hercules anti-aircraft missile. The original Zeus A, given the tri-service identifier XLIM-49, was designed to intercept warheads in the upper atmosphere, mounting a 25 kiloton W31 nuclear <b>warhead.</b> During development, the concept changed to protect a much larger area and intercept the warheads at higher altitudes. This required the missile to be greatly enlarged into the totally new design, Zeus B, mounting a 400 kiloton W50 <b>warhead.</b> In several successful tests, the B model proved itself able to intercept warheads, and even satellites.|$|E
50|$|On August 30, 2007, six cruise {{missiles}} armed with W80-1 <b>warheads</b> were mistakenly loaded onto a B-52 and flown from Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, {{on a mission}} to transport {{cruise missiles}} for decommissioning. It was not discovered that the six missiles had nuclear <b>warheads</b> until the plane landed at Barksdale, leaving the <b>warheads</b> unaccounted for over 36 hours. This was the first time since 1968 that nuclear <b>warheads</b> were publicly revealed to have been transported on a US bomber. The munitions crews involved in mistakenly loading the nuclear <b>warheads</b> at Minot were temporarily decertified from performing their duties involving nuclear munitions.|$|R

5000|$|Each {{submarine}} carries up to sixteen Trident II D-5 missiles, {{which can}} each carry up to twelve <b>warheads,</b> for {{a maximum of}} 192 <b>warheads</b> per vessel. However, the British government announced in 1998 that each submarine would carry only 48 <b>warheads</b> (halving the limit specified by the previous government), which is {{an average of three}} per missile. However one or two missiles per submarine are probably armed with fewer <b>warheads</b> for [...] "sub-strategic" [...] use causing others to be armed with more.|$|R
5|$|Purpose built munitions {{are more}} {{elaborate}} in flight and control capabilities, <b>warhead</b> size and design, and on-board sensors for locating targets. Some loitering munitions use a human operator to locate targets whereas others, such as IAI Harop, can function autonomously searching and launching attacks without human intervention.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} considered using {{a hydrogen}} bomb for the project, but the United States Air Force vetoed this idea {{due to the}} weight of such a device, {{as it would be}} too heavy to be propelled by the missile which would have been used. It was then decided to use a W25 <b>warhead,</b> a small, lightweight <b>warhead</b> with a relatively low 1.7 kiloton yield. By contrast, the Little Boy bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of some 13–18 kilotons. The W25 would be carried by a rocket toward the hidden side of the Moon, near the terminator, where it would detonate on impact. The dust cloud resulting from the explosion would be lit by the Sun and therefore visible from Earth. According to Reiffel, the Air Force's progress in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles would have made such a launch feasible by 1959.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} underwater protection {{was replaced}} by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo <b>warhead.</b> It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ships' increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.|$|E
50|$|Between 1940 and 1996, the U.S. {{spent at}} least $ in present-day terms on nuclear weapons development, {{including}} platforms development (aircraft, rockets and facilities), command and control, maintenance, waste management and administrative costs. It is estimated that, since 1945, the United States produced more than 70,000 nuclear <b>warheads,</b> {{which is more than}} all other nuclear weapon states combined. The Soviet Union/Russia has built approximately 55,000 nuclear <b>warheads</b> since 1949, France built 1110 <b>warheads</b> since 1960, the United Kingdom built 835 <b>warheads</b> since 1952, China built about 600 <b>warheads</b> since 1964, and other nuclear powers built less than 500 <b>warheads</b> all together since they developed their first nuclear weapons. Until November 1962, the vast majority of U.S. nuclear tests were aboveground. After the acceptance of the Partial Test Ban Treaty, all testing was regulated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout.|$|R
50|$|The joint {{draft treaty}} on {{reduction}} and limitation of strategic offensive arms reflects the earlier understanding on establishing ceilings {{of no more}} than 1,600 strategic offensive delivery systems and 6,000 <b>warheads</b> as well as agreement on subceilings of 4,900 on the aggregate of ICBM and SLBM <b>warheads</b> and 1,540 <b>warheads</b> on 154 heavy missiles.|$|R
25|$|Chinese nuclear <b>warheads</b> were {{produced}} from 1968 and thermonuclear <b>warheads</b> from 1974. It is also thought that Chinese <b>warheads</b> {{have been successfully}} miniaturised from 2200kg to 700kg {{through the use of}} designs obtained by espionage from the United States. The current number of weapons is unknown owing to strict secrecy, but it is thought that up to 2000 <b>warheads</b> may have been produced, though far fewer may be available for use. China is the only nuclear weapons state to have guaranteed the non-first use of nuclear weapons.|$|R
