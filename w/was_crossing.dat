5|$|The Battle of the Raz de Sein was a naval {{engagement}} of the blockade of Brest during the French Revolutionary Wars between a French and Royal Navy ships {{of the line}} on 21 April 1798. The British blockade fleet under Admiral Lord Bridport had sailed from St Helens on 12 April and {{on the morning of}} 21 April <b>was</b> <b>crossing</b> the Iroise Passage when sails were spotted to the east. Three ships were detached in pursuit, led by the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Mars under Captain Alexander Hood. As the British ships approached their quarry a third sail was sighted to the southeast close to the coastline and moving north towards Brest.|$|E
5|$|The tornado entered Hale County west of Sawyerville, {{continuing}} {{to move through}} sparsely populated rural areas. North of Sawyerville, the tornado strengthened to EF3 intensity as it <b>was</b> <b>crossing</b> Alabama State Highway 14. Reaching estimated maximum winds of , the tornado continued on its northeast track, crossing County Roads 18 and 21, Alabama State Highway 69, and County Road 29 as it moved south and east of the small communities of Harper Hill and Ingram. The tornado caused extensive structural damage through this area, consisting of many mobile homes and site-built homes being either heavily damaged or destroyed. A church in the area was heavily damaged, vehicles were tossed and destroyed, and thousands of trees were downed as well.|$|E
5|$|While Debby <b>was</b> <b>crossing</b> Saint Lucia, its strongest {{thunderstorms}} {{were located}} {{north and east}} of the center due to wind shear. A station in Martinique reported hurricane-force winds, and about 20,000people on the island lost power. After entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, Debby attained peak winds of , although continued wind shear caused the storm to dissipate on September11. In Puerto Rico, one person died due to high waves. The storm caused power outages and flooding in the Dominican Republic. Throughout its path, Debby killed nine people.|$|E

30|$|The charts {{generated}} {{were examined}} {{to see which}} boundary <b>was</b> <b>crossed.</b> If the upper boundary <b>was</b> <b>crossed,</b> it implied that knees with anterolateral incision were preferred by the patients. If the lower boundary <b>was</b> <b>crossed,</b> it implied that knees with midline incision were preferred. If none of the two boundaries <b>were</b> <b>crossed,</b> it implied that patients did not prefer any one knee over the other. This method allowed us to conclude the trial {{as soon as the}} boundary <b>was</b> <b>crossed.</b> The upper boundary <b>was</b> <b>crossed</b> after charting the preferences of 19 patients; however, at that point the last patient was already recruited and so was allowed to complete the trial.|$|R

5|$|While slowly {{crossing}} Guam, Pamela produced {{winds of}} over 185km/h (115mph) {{across the entire}} island over a six-hour period, causing widespread heavy damage. Typhoon-force winds were reported for 18hours, and tropical storm-force winds were reported for 30hours. As the eye <b>was</b> <b>crossing</b> the island, the winds rapidly vacillated between gusts of 150km/h (90mph) to calmness {{in the span of}} a few minutes; this created a large pressure gradient that caused additional damage. The typhoon dropped a total of 856mm (33.7in) of rainfall, including 690mm (27in) in a 24-hour period, on the island. This contributed to May 1976 being Guam's wettest month on record.|$|E
5|$|At around 2:50p.m., the B-10 rifles on {{the west}} bank managed to open a breach in the barbed wire {{surrounding}} the fort, and also destroyed other significant targets, such as the observation equipment. Meanwhile, combat engineers were breaching further openings using Bangalore torpedoes, under heavy small arms fire and hand grenades. The battalion's main assault force <b>was</b> <b>crossing</b> at the same time. The main assault force then funneled through the breaches and entered the Israeli trenches. The Israeli command in Northern Sinai kept receiving frantic calls for help from the fort's radio operator, and gunfire could also be heard. The Egyptians captured the southern sector of the fort by 3:05p.m.. Five minutes later, the assault force moved against the northern sector of the fort. Within fifteen minutes, the Egyptians were in control of the fort. The power generator inside the fort was destroyed, and all electricity and communication lines leading to the fort were severed. At 3:30p.m., Maj. Gen. Khaled was informed that Lahtzanit had been seized and that Israeli soldiers had been captured. The Israelis reported losing radio contact with the fort at around 4:00p.m.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army's pace was {{dictated}} by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, {{had the advantage of}} superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard <b>was</b> <b>crossing</b> a defile when it was almost cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard's army had a respite from attack because while it hugged the coast and had gone round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin's army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always within striking distance, and waiting for an opportunity to attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.|$|E

5|$|The weather {{system from}} which Hurricane Alex {{developed}} was first discernible as a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June17, 2010. Over {{the next few}} days, most of its associated thunderstorm activity was embedded within the ITCZ. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned it {{as a candidate for}} tropical cyclone formation on June20, while it <b>was</b> <b>crossing</b> the Windward Islands into the southeastern Caribbean Sea; at the time, some upper-level wind shear was present, leading to conditions only marginally favorable for development. The system moved through the Caribbean, and on June21, it developed {{to the extent that the}} NHC assessed a 50%chance of development into a tropical depression within 48hours. The next day, however, the feature deteriorated as thunderstorm activity spread across the Greater Antilles, although the upper-level regime remained favorable for eventual redevelopment.|$|E
