5|$|The {{incident}} {{has also}} {{become something of a}} cultural symbol representative of the North American video game crash of 1983, often cited as a cautionary tale about the hubris of poor business practices, despite suggestions that the burial allowed the company to <b>write</b> <b>off</b> the disposed-of material for tax relief purposes.|$|E

Schyster hit a <b>Write</b> <b>Off,</b> however, and got the pin.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of season two's nineteenth episode, the writers had decided Helen's fate. Originally, the {{character}} {{was going to die}} on her wedding night, but the creative team felt they could use her more in the mythology. Gough explains the idea Helen still had Clark's blood, she knew his secret, and her relationship with Lex was too good to <b>write</b> <b>off.</b> The creative team kept Helen's true motivations a secret to Vaugier, which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character as if there were no ulterior motives.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill for}} the plane {{remained}} unpaid. In 1914 Vickers reminded Mawson, who had apparently forgotten the outstanding debt. Mawson wrote to Vickers director Sir Trevor Dawson in November 1916, requesting the company <b>write</b> <b>off</b> the bill as a donation. His company buoyed by armaments contracts, Dawson agreed. The next expedition to take a plane to the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 Quest Expedition, but the Avro Baby remained grounded owing to missing parts. Not until 16November 1928—when Hubert Wilkins and Carl Ben Eielson flew for 20minutes around Deception Island, {{just over a year}} before Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd's first flight over the South Pole—was a plane airborne in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|The debt {{payments}} weighed {{heavily on}} the Senators. For several years, Bryden tried to reschedule the debt on the arena. There were various attempts at filing tax losses to <b>write</b> <b>off</b> the debt, all rejected by the federal government. In 2002, Ogden went bankrupt. It had re-invented itself as Covanta Energy and failed {{not long after the}} Enron scandal. This led to the Senators filing for bankruptcy on January 9, 2003, when it could not arrange financing to pay all it owed to Covanta, becoming due because of Covanta's bankruptcy.|$|E

5|$|Uzbekistan remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with Uzbek officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration. The country prefers not to pursue economic and political integration as of now. Russian officials have stated that integration with {{the country would be}} slow and analysts state that as Russian influence and trade increases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan it may persuade Uzbekistan to join in the future. Uzbekistan began its integration process when Russia announced it would <b>write</b> <b>off</b> USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the CIS Free Trade Area in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E
5|$|Giles Guthrie, a {{respected}} aviator, merchant banker {{and director of}} British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new management structure. Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed about the financial arrangements {{of the company and}} Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was able to have the government <b>write</b> <b>off</b> the outstanding debt, inject additional cash into the company, and permit the purchase of a smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been given access to the full report.|$|E
5|$|Jobs was {{intrigued}} by Berg's concept of a workstation and contemplated starting a higher education computer company {{in the fall of}} 1985, amidst increasing turmoil at Apple. Jobs' division did not release upgraded versions of the Macintosh and most of the Macintosh Office. As a result, sales plummeted, and Apple was forced to <b>write</b> <b>off</b> millions of dollars in unsold inventory. Apple's chief executive officer (CEO) John Sculley ousted Jobs from his day-to-day role at Apple, replacing him with Jean-Louis Gassée in 1985. Later that year, Jobs began a power struggle to regain control of the company. The board of directors sided with Sculley while Jobs took a business visit to Western Europe and the Soviet Union on behalf of Apple.|$|E

5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond {{is a very}} good shot and the best in the Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to <b>write</b> <b>off</b> his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|The IMF forced Madagascar's {{government}} to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization {{of the economy}} when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized {{over the course of}} the 1980s. The political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of IMF and World Bank assistance. Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to <b>write</b> <b>off</b> half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration. Having met a set of stringent economic, governance and human rights criteria, Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the Millennium Challenge Account in 2005.|$|E
5|$|James made a {{surprise}} return to TNA {{as a fan}} favorite, {{after a year and}} a half absence from the company, on January 30, 2015, during the tapings of Impact Wrestling in Glasgow, Scotland. James would then have several confrontations with Bram over his actions towards her real life fiancé, Magnus. On the April 24 episode of Impact Wrestling, James retired from wrestling to focus on becoming a full-time mother, but James Storm talked her into having one more match. On the June 3 episode of Impact Wrestling, James declined an offer by Storm to join The Revolution, which resulted in him intentionally shoving her onto a train track in the storyline, which sparked controversy. This was done to <b>write</b> <b>off</b> James from television, as she had no more dates set with the company at the time. James made her return on the July 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, confronting Storm and challenging him to a mixed tag team match. On the July 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, James and Magnus defeated Storm and his partner Serena, when James pinned Serena.|$|E
