5|$|In 1964–65 {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in Shanina arose in the Soviet press, largely due to the publication of her diary. The newspaper Severny Komsomolets asked Shanina's contemporaries to <b>write</b> <b>what</b> they knew about her. Streets in Arkhangelsk, Shangaly and Stroyevskoye were named after her, and the village of Yedma has a museum dedicated to Shanina. The local school where she studied in 1931–35 has a commemorative plate. In Arkhangelsk, regular shooting competitions were organized among members of the paramilitary DOSAAF sport organisation for the Roza Shanina Prize, while Novodvinsk organized an open shooting sports championship in her memory. The village of Malinovka in Ustyansky District started to hold annual cross-country ski races for the Roza Shanina Prize.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might not have been able to <b>write</b> <b>what</b> would become his greatest works.|$|E

25|$|He {{became a}} member of the Royal Galician Academy in 1933, and shortly after that, in 1935, he was forced into exile by the Spanish {{government}} to the Spanish city of Badajoz, in Extremadura, where he worked as a civil servant. It was then where he began to <b>write</b> <b>what</b> would become his key work, Sempre en Galiza. In 1936 he gained a seat at the Spanish parliament, this time representing the Popular Front coalition, which included the Galicianist Party.|$|E
25|$|Campbell's {{conversion}} to Catholicism {{inspired him to}} <b>write</b> <b>what</b> some {{consider to be the}} finest spiritual verse of his generation. Campbell's translations of the Catholic mystical poetry by St. John of the Cross were lavishly praised by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, who considered them, in some ways, superior to the original Spanish. Campbell also wrote travel guides and children's literature. He began translating poetry from languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Among the poets he translated were Francisco de Quevedo, Fernando Pessoa, Manuel Bandeira and Rubén Darío. Some of Campbell's translations of the symbolist verse of Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud have appeared in modern anthologies.|$|E

25|$|By November Verdi and Strepponi left Italy {{to spend}} the winter of 1851/52 in Paris, where he {{concluded}} {{an agreement with the}} Paris Opéra to <b>write</b> <b>what</b> became Les vêpres siciliennes, his first grand opera, although he had adapted his earlier I Lombardi into Jerusalem for the stage. Including work on Trovatore, other projects consumed him, but a significant event occurred in February, when the couple attended a performance of Alexander Dumas filss The Lady of the Camellias. What followed is reported by Verdi's biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz who states that the composer revealed that, after seeing the play, he immediately began to compose music for what would later become La traviata.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, Lawrence's {{business}} manager and attorney Fanny Holtzmann {{was looking for}} a new property for her client when the 1944 Margaret Landon book Anna and the King of Siam was sent to her by the William Morris agent who represented Landon. He thought a stage adaptation of the book would be an ideal vehicle for the actress. Holtzmann agreed, but proposed a musical version would be better. Lawrence wanted Cole Porter to write the score, but when he proved to be unenthused by the suggestion, Holtzmann sent the book to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Rodgers initially demurred because he felt Lawrence's vocal range was limited and she had a tendency to sing flat. But he realised the story had strong potential, and the two men agreed to <b>write</b> <b>what</b> ultimately became The King and I.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, two young Irish poets, Michael Smith (born 1942) and Trevor Joyce (born 1947) founded the New Writers Press {{publishing}} {{house and a}} journal called The Lace Curtain. Initially this was to publish their own work and that of some like-minded friends (including Paul Durcan, Michael Hartnett and Gerry Smyth), and later to promote the work of neglected Irish modernists like Brian Coffey and Denis Devlin. Both Joyce and Smith have published considerable bodies of poetry in their own right. Among the other poets published by the New Writers Press were Geoffrey Squires (born 1942), whose early work was influenced by Charles Olson, and Augustus Young (born 1943), who admired Pound and who has translated older Irish poetry, as well as work from Latin America and poems by Bertolt Brecht. Younger poets who <b>write</b> <b>what</b> might be called experimental poetry include Maurice Scully (born 1952), and Randolph Healy (born 1956). Many of these poets along with many younger experimentalists have performed their work at the annual SoundEye Festival in Cork, which has been recognised as an important event not just for Irish poetry, but for innovative work internationally.|$|E

25|$|Halley's {{visits to}} Newton in 1684 thus {{resulted}} from Halley's debates about planetary motion with Wren and Hooke, {{and they seem}} to have provided Newton with the incentive and spur to develop and <b>write</b> <b>what</b> became Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Halley was at that time a Fellow and Council member of the Royal Society in London (positions that in 1686 he resigned to become the Society's paid Clerk). Halley's visit to Newton in Cambridge in 1684 probably occurred in August. When Halley asked Newton's opinion on the problem of planetary motions discussed earlier that year between Halley, Hooke and Wren, Newton surprised Halley by saying that he had already made the derivations some time ago; but that he could not find the papers. (Matching accounts of this meeting come from Halley and Abraham De Moivre to whom Newton confided.) Halley then had to wait for Newton to 'find' the results, but in November 1684 Newton sent Halley an amplified version of whatever previous work Newton had done on the subject. This took the form of a 9-page manuscript, De motu corporum in gyrum (Of the motion of bodies in an orbit): the title is shown on some surviving copies, although the (lost) original may have been without title.|$|E

500|$|Chasing Vermeer is Blue Balliett's first {{published}} book. Its original purpose {{was a book}} to read to her class for fun. She realized that a mystery about [...] "real" [...] art issues had not been written since E.L. Konigsburg's From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and desired to <b>write</b> <b>what</b> she wished to read. Chasing Vermeer took about five years to complete, as Balliett was also a teacher and parent. She compared writing the book to weaving, as she first wrote mainly about art, but then incorporated the pentominoes and classroom scenes, creating many different levels to read on. She admits that it ended up more complex than she had thought it would be.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{said of his}} work, [...] "while thrillers may not be Literature with {{a capital}} L, it is {{possible}} to <b>write</b> <b>what</b> I can best describe as 'thrillers designed to be read as literature. He named Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Eric Ambler and Graham Greene as influences. William Cook in the New Statesman considered James Bond to be [...] "the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature. As a boy, Fleming devoured the Bulldog Drummond tales of Lieutenant Colonel H. C. McNeile (aka [...] "Sapper") and the Richard Hannay stories of John Buchan. His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain... In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age." [...] Umberto Eco considered Mickey Spillane to have been another major influence.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Fey was {{the head}} writer and a {{performer}} on the television show Saturday Night Live (SNL).

NBC Entertainment president Kevin Reilly felt that [...] "Fey was using the news setting as a fig leaf for her own experience and [...] encouraged her to <b>write</b> <b>what</b> she knew." [...] The show was subsequently reworked to revolve around an SNL-style sketch show. After being presented to Reilly once more, the show was set to air during the 2005–2006 television season. Just before the deal went through, however, the show was nearly brushed aside by Anthony Lewis and Jack Melcher, two NBC executives who fought the idea, fearing that Fey's removal from SNL {{would result in a}} severe cut to the show's ratings.|$|E

[...] "Daughter", [...] "Dissident", and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town" [...] are three storytelling songs. [...] "Daughter" [...] {{tells the story of a}} child who is abused by her parents because they do not understand her learning disability; [...] "Dissident" [...] tells the story of a woman who takes in a political fugitive; and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town" [...] tells the story of an old lady who has been stuck in a small town her whole life.|$|E

The concept for [...] "Terms of Endearment" [...] was [...] "about the fifth or sixth idea" [...] Amann came up with for the show. Amann's original idea was to <b>write</b> <b>what</b> he described as [...] "Rosemary's Baby in reverse".
