40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the change in spatial use in {{wine-growing}} areas of Semič hill situated in the south-east of Slovenia. In {{the first part of}} the thesis I presented the legislation related to spatial planning and the purpose of use of the current municipal spatial plan in the municipality of Semič. In this part of the thesis I also presented wine-growing regions and areas of Slovenia on the basis of which we found out that Semič belongs to the Sava lowlands wine-growing district and to Bela Krajina wine-growing region. There are disperse wine-growing settlements ranging from vineyard <b>cottages</b> to <b>weekend</b> <b>cottages</b> and houses. Our findings were confirmed by visiting the actual area where we could verify the actual use of the buildings and spatial use in general. The structure of a plot is long and narrow since it is meant for a building to be situated at the side of a road and a wineyard beneath or below the cottage. On the basis of the analyses we found out that many former vineyard cottages have been transformed into <b>weekend</b> <b>cottages</b> or even houses. We made an analysis of changes in land use and found that the entire part, which lies on the street Vajdova built, it remains higher use of space in the original condition as it was at the time the Franciscan cadastre. In future it will be growing area Semiška hill more carefully planned settlement in order to preserve the original appearance of the landscape, but care must be taken to build on the infrastructure appropriately equipped areas...|$|R
