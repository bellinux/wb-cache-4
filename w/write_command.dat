25|$|To {{interrupt}} a read burst by a <b>write</b> <b>command</b> is possible, {{but more}} difficult. It can be done, if the DQM signal {{is used to}} suppress output from the SDRAM so that the memory controller may drive data over the DQ lines to the SDRAM {{in time for the}} write operation. Because the effects of DQM on read data are delayed by 2 cycles, but the effects of DQM on write data are immediate, DQM must be raised (to mask the read data) beginning at least two cycles before <b>write</b> <b>command,</b> but must be lowered for the cycle of the <b>write</b> <b>command</b> (assuming the <b>write</b> <b>command</b> is intended to have an effect).|$|E

25|$|Use of {{the data}} bus is {{intricate}} and thus requires a complex DRAM controller circuit. This is because data written to the DRAM must be presented in the same cycle as the <b>write</b> <b>command,</b> but reads produce output 2 or 3 cycles after the read command. The DRAM controller must ensure that the data bus is never required for a read and a write at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Pipelining {{means that}} the chip can accept a new command before it has {{finished}} processing the previous one. For a pipelined write, the <b>write</b> <b>command</b> can be immediately followed by another command without waiting for the data {{to be written into}} the memory array. For a pipelined read, the requested data appears a fixed number of clock cycles (latency) after the read command, during which additional commands can be sent.|$|E

50|$|When a bank is open, {{there are}} four <b>commands</b> permitted: read, <b>write,</b> burst terminate, and precharge. Read and <b>write</b> <b>commands</b> begin bursts, which can be {{interrupted}} by following commands.|$|R
25|$|Both {{read and}} <b>write</b> <b>commands</b> require a column address. Because each chip accesses eight bits of data at a time, there are 2048 {{possible}} column addresses thus requiring only 11 address lines (A0A9, A11).|$|R
2500|$|A <b>write</b> <b>command</b> is {{accompanied}} by the data to be written driven on to the DQ lines during the same rising clock edge. It {{is the duty of}} the memory controller to ensure that the SDRAM is not driving read data on to the DQ lines {{at the same time that}} it needs to drive write data on to those lines. [...] This can be done by waiting until a read burst has finished, [...] by terminating a read burst, or by using the DQM control line.|$|E
2500|$|Once the row {{has been}} {{activated}} or [...] "opened", {{read and write}} commands are possible to that row. Activation requires a minimum amount of time, called the row-to-column delay, or tRCD before reads or writes to it may occur. [...] This time, rounded up to the next multiple of the clock period, specifies the minimum number of wait cycles between an active command, and a read or <b>write</b> <b>command.</b> [...] During these wait cycles, additional commands may be sent to other banks; because each bank operates completely independently.|$|E
2500|$|A modern {{microprocessor}} with a cache {{will generally}} access memory in units of cache lines. [...] To transfer a 64-byte cache line requires eight consecutive accesses to a 64-bit DIMM, which {{can all be}} triggered by a single read or <b>write</b> <b>command</b> by configuring the SDRAM chips, using the mode register, to perform eight-word bursts. A cache line fetch is typically triggered by a read from a particular address, and SDRAM allows the [...] "critical word" [...] of the cache line to be transferred first. [...] ("Word" [...] here refers to {{the width of the}} SDRAM chip or DIMM, which is 64 bits for a typical DIMM.) [...] SDRAM chips support two possible conventions for the ordering of the remaining words in the cache line.|$|E
50|$|As in {{previous}} SDRAM encodings, A10 {{is used to}} select command variants: auto-precharge on read and <b>write</b> <b>commands,</b> and one bank vs. all banks for the precharge command. It also selects two variants of the ZQ calibration command.|$|R
50|$|The {{commands}} {{correspond to}} standard DRAM access cycles, such as row select, precharge, and refresh <b>commands.</b> Read and <b>write</b> <b>commands</b> include only column addresses. All commands include a 3-bit FB-DIMM address, allowing up to 8 FB-DIMM modules on a channel.|$|R
50|$|Read and <b>write</b> <b>{{commands}}</b> can be combined, or piggy-backed, with {{commands to}} get and set attributes. This ability reduces {{the number of times}} a high-level storage system has to cross the interface to the OSD, which can improve overall efficiency.|$|R

50|$|Force Unit Access (FUA) is an I/O <b>write</b> <b>command</b> {{option that}} forces written data {{all the way}} to stable storage. FUA write {{commands}} (WRITE DMA FUA EXT 3Dh, WRITE DMA QUEUED FUA EXT 3Eh, WRITE MULTIPLE FUA EXT CEh), in contrast to corresponding commands without FUA, write data directly to the media, regardless of whether write caching in the device is enabled or not. FUA <b>write</b> <b>command</b> will not return until data is written to media, thus data written by a completed FUA <b>write</b> <b>command</b> is on permanent media even if the device is powered off before issuing a FLUSH CACHE command.|$|E
30|$|Before {{starting}} a transaction t, a client c must select the server s that will receive and execute t’s commands; other servers {{will not be}} involved in t’s execution. Each data item in the server’s database is a tuple (x,v,i), where x is the item’s unique identifier, v is x’s value and i is the value’s version. We assume that read and <b>write</b> <b>commands</b> on database tuples are atomic operations. When s receives a read command for x from c, it returns the current value of x (or the most up-to-date value if the database is multiversion) and its corresponding version. <b>Write</b> <b>commands</b> are locally stored by c. It is only during transaction termination that updates are propagated to the servers.|$|R
