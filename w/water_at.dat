5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches <b>water</b> <b>at</b> either ends. The 1829 map, however, {{shows it}} {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This {{is confirmed by}} {{a map of the}} island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and disconnected from the <b>water</b> <b>at</b> its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on new land.|$|E

50|$|Metabolic advantages: By feeding in {{the warm}} surface <b>waters</b> <b>at</b> night and {{residing}} in the cooler deep waters during the day they can conserve energy.

That same year, 1799, an all-platinum kilogram prototype was fabricated with the objective that it would equal, as close as was scientifically feasible for the day, the mass of one cubic decimetre of <b>water</b> <b>at</b> 4°C. The prototype {{was presented to the}} Archives of the Republic in June and on December 10, 1799, the prototype was formally ratified as the kilogramme des Archives (Kilogram of the Archives) and the kilogram was defined as being equal to its mass. This standard stood for the next 90 years.|$|E

5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the <b>water</b> <b>at</b> the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent.

5|$|After {{this day}} of fierce fighting, which has been {{described}} as the hardest-fought action of the whole Sinai campaign, the Anzac Mounted Division's advance was effectively stopped. Chauvel ordered the division to return to <b>water</b> <b>at</b> Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Further, the Anzac Mounted Division had lost a significant proportion of their strength; over 300 casualties, including eight officers and 65 other ranks killed.|$|E
