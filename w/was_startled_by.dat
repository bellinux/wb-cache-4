5|$|Field's {{government}} <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> Britain's {{announcement in}} October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date {{was set for}} Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised {{that it was going}} to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} written {{record of an}} {{earthquake}} felt in the NMSZ was from a French missionary traveling up the Mississippi with a party of explorers. At 1 p.m., on Christmas Day 1699, at a site near the present-day location of Memphis, the party <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> {{a short period of}} ground shaking.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} {{the image on the}} shroud are not easily seen with the naked eye, but they can be more clearly {{revealed}} through photography. In May 1898 Italian photographer Secondo Pia was allowed to photograph the shroud. He took the first photograph of the shroud on 28 May 1898. Pia <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> the visible image of the negative plate, implying that the shroud is effectively a negative of some kind. Pia was at first accused of doctoring his photographs, but he was vindicated in 1931 when another photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, photographed the shroud and obtained results similar to Pia's. In 1978, ultraviolet photographs were taken of the shroud.|$|E

500|$|Between 1959 and 1984, London {{contained}} the largest concentration of serial killers in the world, {{as the city}} <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> 29 murders. [...] During that time period, up to six serial killers may have been operating in London, though three were convicted for 13 of the killings: Gerald Thomas Archer (the [...] "London Chamber Maid Slayer"), Christian Magee (the [...] "Mad Slasher") and Russell Johnson (the [...] "Balcony Killer"), with the other 16 murders still unsolved as of August 2015.|$|E
500|$|Maximilian von Browne {{commanded}} the Austrian troops. Following the indecisive Battle of Lobositz in 1756, he {{was replaced by}} Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, Maria Theresa's brother-in-law. Frederick <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> Lobositz; he eventually re-grouped for another attack in June 1757. The Battle of Kolin that followed was a decisive victory for Austria. Frederick lost one third of his troops, and before the battle was over, {{he had left the}} scene. [...] However, later that year he won a spectacular victory against the Austrians at Leuthen, which secured Prussian control of Silesia {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the novel came in 1959, when Achebe heard {{the story of a}} Chief Priest being imprisoned by a District Officer. He drew further {{inspiration}} a year later when he viewed a collection of Igbo objects excavated from the area by archaeologist Thurstan Shaw; Achebe <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> the cultural sophistication of the artifacts. When an acquaintance showed him a series of papers from colonial officers (not unlike the fictional Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger referenced at the end of Things Fall Apart), Achebe combined these strands of history and began work on Arrow of God in earnest. Like Achebe's previous works, Arrow was roundly praised by critics. A revised edition was published in 1974 to correct what Achebe called [...] "certain structural weaknesses".|$|E

500|$|Seifert's {{performance}} in the game received high praise from reviewers. GameSpot's Justin Clark felt that the performance [...] "anchored" [...] the game. Katie Smith of Adventure Gamers wrote that Seifert is convincing in the role, particularly with small details such as body language, but <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> the lack of emotion. Game Informers Wallace echoed similar remarks, noting that Seifert [...] "nailed the role". Rock, Paper, Shotguns Smith wrote that [...] "the whole thing might collapse" [...] without Seifert's [...] "convincing" [...] performance. IGN's Albert named the acting [...] "believable", stating that Seifert's performance is [...] "appropriately both grounded and absurd". Joe Donnelly of Digital Spy wrote that Seifert's performance {{has the potential to}} inspire similar games, and Andy Kelly of PC Gamer called the performance [...] "understated, realistic, and complex". Burns of VideoGamer.com felt generally impressed by Seifert's performance, but noted some [...] "occasional bad acting".|$|E
2500|$|As the Partnair {{aircraft}} {{passed over}} the water at its planned cruising attitude of 22 000 feet, a Norwegian F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jet passed by it. The fighter pilot <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> the sudden appearance of the aircraft and contacted Oslo air traffic control. [...] He believed that the radar data were false and that the aircraft was closer to his jet than his on-board computer had indicated.|$|E
2500|$|Dick recounted {{that as the}} sun glinted off {{the gold}} pendant, the {{reflection}} caused the generation of a [...] "pink beam" [...] of light that mesmerized him. He came to believe the beam imparted wisdom and clairvoyance, and also believed it to be intelligent. On one occasion, Dick <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> a separate recurrence of the pink beam. It imparted the information to him that his infant son was ill. The Dicks rushed the child to the hospital, where his suspicion was confirmed by professional diagnosis.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 September, Chamberlain flew to Bad Godesberg for {{his second}} meeting with Hitler. He said {{he was willing to}} accept the cession of the Sudetenland to Germany. He <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> Hitler's response: Hitler said that cession of the Sudetenland was not enough and that Czechoslovakia (which he had {{described}} as a [...] "fraudulent state") must be broken up completely. Later in the day, Hitler resiled, saying {{that he was willing to}} accept the cession of the Sudetenland by 1 October. On 24 September, Germany issued the Godesberg Memorandum, demanding cession by 28 September, or war. The Czechs rejected these demands, France ordered mobilization and Britain mobilized its Navy.|$|E
2500|$|Faith Cole MacLean and her husband, actor Douglas MacLean, were Taylor's neighbors, and Faith {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have seen Taylor's killer. The couple <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> a loud noise at 8pm. MacLean went to her front door and saw someone emerging {{from the front door}} of Taylor’s home who she said was dressed, [...] "like my idea of a motion picture burglar". She recalled this person paused for a moment before turning and walking back through the door, as if having forgotten something, then re-emerged and flashed a smile at her before disappearing between the buildings. MacLean decided she had heard a car back-fire. She also told police interviewers this person looked [...] "funny" [...] (like movie actors in makeup) and may have been a woman disguised as a man.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} Brightside Bridge, this carries Weedon Street, which links Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Common. This bridge is {{downstream}} of Brightside Weir. The bridge is {{mentioned in the}} records of the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864 as follows: [...] "The watchman on duty near Brightside Bridge had a very narrow escape. When passing the bridge he <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> a singular sound as though the steam from a distant engine had suddenly been let off, and immediately after the flood came rushing down. The water rose rapidly over the bridge and the road. To escape he mounted the wall, intending to walk along it to some place of safety; but in another moment he felt the wall tremble beneath him. He then jumped off it, and rushed through the waters nearly breast high towards the Midland railway, which he succeeded in reaching, and down which he walked to Sheffield".|$|E

2500|$|El Greco {{regarded}} {{color as}} the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting ("I hold the imitation of color to be the greatest difficulty of art."—Notes of the painter in one of his commentaries). He declared that color had primacy over drawing; thus his opinion on Michelangelo was that [...] "he was a good man, but {{he did not know how}} to paint". Francisco Pacheco, a painter and theoretician who visited El Greco in 1611, <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> the painter's technique: [...] "If I say that Domenico Greco sets his hand to his canvases many and many times over, that he worked upon them again and again, but to leave the colors crude and unblent in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity?" [...] Pacheco asserts that [...] "El Greco believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature".|$|E
2500|$|The antagonists Grendel and Grendel's {{mother are}} portrayed by Crispin Glover and Angelina Jolie, respectively. Glover had {{previously}} worked with Zemeckis in Back to the Future, when he portrayed George McFly. Zemeckis had found Glover tiresome on set, {{because of his}} {{lack of understanding of}} shooting a film, but realized this would not be a problem as on a motion capture film he could choose his angles later. Glover's dialogue was entirely in Old English. Jolie had wanted to work with Zemeckis, and had read the poem years before but could not remember it well until she read the script and was able to recall basic themes. The actress recounted her first impression of her character's appearance by saying [...] "...I was told I {{was going to be a}} lizard. Then I was brought into a room with Bob, and a bunch of pictures and examples, and he showed me this picture of a woman half painted gold, and then a lizard. And, I’ve got kids and I thought 'That's great. That's so bizarre. I'm going to be this crazy reptilian person and creature.'" [...] Jolie filmed her role over two days when she was three months pregnant. She <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>by</b> the character's nude human form, stating that for an animated film [...] "I was really surprised that I felt that exposed." ...|$|E
