40|$|In this paper, {{the optimal}} <b>working</b> <b>schemes</b> for {{wireless}} sensor networks with multiple base stations and wireless energy transfer devices are proposed. The wireless energy transfer devices also work as data gatherers while charging sensor nodes. The wireless sensor network is firstly divided into sub networks according {{to the concept of}} Voronoi diagram. Then, the entire energy replenishing procedure is split into the pre-normal and normal energy replenishing stages. With the objective of maximizing the sojourn time ratio of the wireless energy transfer device, a continuous time optimization problem for the normal energy replenishing cycle is formed according to constraints with which sensor nodes and wireless energy transfer devices should comply. Later on, the continuous time optimization problem is reshaped into a discrete multi-phased optimization problem, which yields the identical optimality. After linearizing it, we obtain a linear programming problem that can be solved efficiently. The working strategies of both sensor nodes and wireless energy transfer devices in the pre-normal replenishing stage are also discussed in this paper. The intensive simulations exhibit the dynamic and cyclic <b>working</b> <b>schemes</b> for the entire energy replenishing procedure.

40|$|Computer-aided free-response {{mathematics}} {{assessments are}} becoming increasingly important vehicles in supporting the notion of “learning through assessment”. Hence, having a marking engine that is able to assess each step in a scheme of constructed responses (or <b>working</b> <b>scheme)</b> is a vital requirement for a mathematics computer-aided system that offers free-response assessments. Existing computational solutions for assessing the correctness of intermediate steps do so by limiting the responses to be entered stepwise, and not all at once, with the delivery of qualitative feedbacks to steps that are incorrect. In this paper, we propose our marking engine that is able to execute a stepwise assessment of responses in a <b>working</b> <b>scheme</b> that closely emulates the marking practices of a typical human.

40|$|Existing {{computational}} {{solutions for}} stepwise correctness checking of free-response solution schemes consisting of equations only consider providing qualitative feedbacks. Hence, this research intends {{to propose a}} computational model of a typical stepwise correctness checking of a scheme of student-constructed responses normally (usually) performed by a human examiner with the provision of quantitative feedbacks. The responses are worked solutions on solving linear algebraic equations in one variable. The proposed computational model comprises of computational techniques of key marking processes, and has enabled a marking engine prototype, which has been developed based on the model, to perform stepwise correctness checking and scoring of the response of each step in a <b>working</b> <b>scheme</b> and of the <b>working</b> <b>scheme</b> as well. The assigned numeric score of each step, or analytical score, serves as a quantitative feedback to inform students {{on the degree of}} correctness of the response of a particular step. The numeric score of the <b>working</b> <b>scheme,</b> or overall score, indicates the degree of correctness of the whole <b>working</b> <b>scheme.</b> Existing computational solutions that are currently available determine response correctness based on mathematical equivalence of expressions. In this research, the degree of correctness of an equation is based on the structural identicalness of the constituting mathtokens, which is evaluated using a correctness measure formulated in this research. The experimental verification shows that the evaluation of correctness by the correctness measure is comparable to human judgment on correctness. The computational model is formalized mathematically by basic concepts from Multiset Theory, while the process framework is supported by basic techniques and processes problem of this research. The data used are existing worked solutions on solving linear algebraic equations in one variable from a previous pilot study as well as new sets of test of correctness shows that the computational model is able to generate the expected output. Hence, the underlying computational techniques of the model can be regarded as correct. The agreement between the automated and the manual marking methods were analysed in terms of the agreement between the correctness scores. The method agreement analyses were conducted in two phases. The analysis in Phase I involved a total of 561 working schemes which comprised of 2021 responses and in Phase II a total of 350 working schemes comprising of 1385 responses were used. The analyses involved determining the percent agreement, degree of correlation and degree of agreement between the automated and manual scores. The accuracy of the scores was determined by calculating the average absolute errors present in the automated scores, which are calibrated by the average mixed errors. The results show that both the automated analytical scores and the automated overall scores exhibited high percent agreement, high correlation, high degree of agreement and small average absolute and mixed errors. It can be inferred that the automated scores are comparable with manual scores and that the stepwise correctness checking and scoring technique of this research agrees with the human marking technique. Therefore, the computational model of stepwise quantitative assessment is a valid and reliable model to be used in place of a human examiner to check and score responses to similar questions used in this research for both formative and summative assessment settings...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the organisation, {{the conditions}} {{and the success of}} cooperation of knowledge-intensive work within a transnational company. For this purpose, the work of a team of German and British research and development engineers in a European aircraft company was investigated. Based on a discussion about the characteristics of communication- and knowledge-intensive work and the organisation of cross-border work, this study assumes that conflicting organisational requirements have to be integrated within transnational knowledge work. While there is need to integrate the knowledge-intensive activities of a company beyond its borders, transnational work is also determined by national industrial relations' schemes as well as educational systems. Both exert influence on labour organisation in specific ways, and thus generate differences in the work organisation between countries. The interdependency of these conflicting organisational constraints has been analysed in the systems of work organisation and control, the way how competence is used within work and conditions of work for engineers at both national sites. Thus, two national <b>working</b> <b>schemes</b> have been identified, which differ in each of the investigated dimensions. The study also shows that the interaction of these national working models generates specific conflicts for transnational cooporation among German and British engineers. These conflicts are solved by means of organisational strategies based on the characteristics of knowledge-intensive and personal work including aspects of self-control and scope for development of own decision-making within the work. Both national <b>working</b> <b>schemes</b> differ in these strategies...|$|R
