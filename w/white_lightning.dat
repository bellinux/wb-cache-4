The train then inclines into a 90° banked curve that dives back to the ground, sending riders back in the direction they came. Several small hills lead the ride to the final brake run and subsequently the station.|$|E

Upward, on the right, led giant steps of cliff and bench and {{weathered}} slope to the fir-bordered and pine-fringed crags standing dark and bare against the stormy sky. Massed inky clouds were piling across the peaks, obscuring the highest ones. A fork of <b>white</b> <b>lightning</b> flashed, and, like the booming of an avalanche, thunder followed.|$|E

60|$|While {{the storm}} continued, {{no one seemed}} {{inclined}} to sit down, but they collected in little groups under the central skylight, where they stood in a yellow atmosphere, looking upwards.

60|$|Then {{she burst}} in upon them; the tornado and the cyclone raged; the thunder rolled and crashed; and the <b>white</b> <b>lightning</b> of her wrath flashed upon the two, {{as if it}} would scathe and annihilate them, as they stood before her. Neither of them had ever known or {{imagined}} anything like this. It had been long since Mrs Keswick had had an opportunity of exercising that power of vituperative torment, which had driven a husband to the refuge of a reverted pistol; which had banished, for life, relatives and friends; and which, {{in the shape of a}} promissory curse, had held apart those who would have been husband and wife; and now, like the long stored up venom of a serpent, it burst out with the direful force given by concentration and retention.|$|E
60|$|He {{glared at}} her a moment through the dusk, and the next instant she felt his arms about her and his lips on her own lips. His kiss was like <b>white</b> <b>lightning,</b> a flash that spread, and spread again, and stayed; and it was {{extraordinarily}} as if, while she took it, she felt each thing in his hard manhood that had least pleased her, each aggressive fact of his face, his figure, his presence, justified of its intense identity and made one with this act of possession. So had she heard of those wrecked and under water following a train of images before they sink. But when darkness returned she was free. She never looked about her; she only darted from the spot. There were lights {{in the windows of}} the house; they shone far across the lawn. In an extraordinarily short time--for the distance was considerable--she had moved through the darkness (for she saw nothing) and reached the door. Here only she paused. She looked all about her; she listened a little; then {{she put her hand on}} the latch. She had not known where to turn; but she knew now. There was a very straight path.|$|E
60|$|The day {{was pushing}} aside the boughs of darkness, hunting. The poor moon would be caught when the net was flung. Siegmund {{went out on}} the balcony to look at it. There it was, like a poor white mouse, a half-moon, {{crouching}} on the mound of its course. It would run nimbly over to the western slope, then it would be caught in the net, and the sun would laugh, like a great yellow cat, as it stalked behind playing with its prey, flashing out its bright paws. The moon, before making its last run, lay crouched, palpitating. The sun crept forth, laughing to itself as it saw its prey could not escape. The lightning, however, leaped low off the nest like a bird decided to go, and flew away. Siegmund no longer saw it opening and shutting its wings in hesitation amid the disturbance of the dawn. Instead there came a flush, the <b>white</b> <b>lightning</b> gone. The brief pink butterflies of sunrise and sunset rose up from the mown fields of darkness, and fluttered low in a cloud. Even in the west they flew in a narrow, rosy swarm. They separated, thinned, rising higher. Some, flying up, became golden. Some flew rosy gold across the moon, the mouse-moon motionless with fear. Soon the pink butterflies had gone, leaving a scarlet stretch like a field of poppies in the fens. As a wind, the light of day blew in from the east, puff after puff filling with whiteness the space which had been the night. Siegmund sat watching the last morning blowing in across the mown darkness, till the whole field of the world was exposed, till the moon was like a dead mouse which floats on water.|$|E
50|$|Balmont's {{next two}} books {{collected}} the poetry written during {{and in the}} wake of the First Russian revolution events. Inspired by Walt Whitman, whom he was translating at the time, Balmont gathered his civic verse into the ecollection Poems (Стихотворения, 1906), which was immediately confiscated by the police. Songs of the Avenger (Песни мстителя, 1907), containing direct calls for the assassination of the Tsar, was banned in Russia and came out in Paris. Evil Charms (Злые чары, 1906) was banned for its allegedly anti-religious sentiments. In 1907-1912 Balmont travelled continuously. Snakes' Flowers (Zmeinye tsvety. 1910) and The Land of Osiris (Krai Ozirisa, 1914) collected his travel sketches. Then came the Russian folklore-orientated Firebird. Slav's Svirel (Жар-птица. Свирель славянина, 1907), Birds in the Air (Ptitsy v vozdukhe, 1908), Green Vertograd. Words Like Kisses (Зелёный вертоград. Слова поцелуйные, 1909) and The Glow of Dawns (Zarevo zor', 1912). In Ancient Calls (Зовы древности, 1909) Balmont adapted poems and inscriptions from a variety of ancient sources. Both critics and fellow poets (close friend Bryusov among them) saw these post-1905 books as manifesting a deep creative crisis, of which the poet himself, apparently, remained unaware. Vladimir Markov later argued that Green Vertograd marked the start of a new ascent in Balmont's lyrical poetry, based on the reworking of folkloric material (mostly but not exclusively Russian in origin). A somewhat better reception awaited <b>White</b> <b>Lightnings</b> (Белые зарницы, 1908) and Luminous Sea (Морское свечение, 1910), collecting his essays on Russian and foreign authors.|$|R
