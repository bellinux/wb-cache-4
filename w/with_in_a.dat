However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built {{before it can be}} re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different manner.|$|E

40|$|Let A be any set of {{positive}} integers and n ∈ N. A composition of n <b>with</b> parts <b>in</b> <b>A</b> is an ordered collection {{of one or}} more elements <b>in</b> <b>A</b> whose sum is n. A palindromic composition of n <b>with</b> parts <b>in</b> <b>A</b> is a composition of n <b>with</b> parts <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>in</b> which the summands are the same in the given or <b>in</b> reverse order. <b>A</b> Carlitz (palindromic) composition of n <b>with</b> parts <b>in</b> <b>A</b> is a (palindromic) composition of n <b>with</b> parts <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>in</b> which no adjacent parts are the same. In this paper, we study the generating functions for several counting problems for compositions, palindromic compositions, Carlitz compo-sitions, and Carlitz palindromic compositions <b>with</b> parts <b>in</b> <b>A,</b> respectively. Our theorems contain many previously known results as special cases, as well as many new results. We also prove some of our results using direct counting arguments.

40|$|We {{survey results}} on {{holomorphic}} functions (of one complex variable) <b>with</b> values <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complex topological vector space hinting to their extension {{to the case}} of several complex variables.

The theory of α-differentiable functions (due to N. Teodorescu, and extended by F-H. Vasilescu, to functions <b>with</b> values <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Fréchet space) is briefly reviewed as related to areolar derivatives. We present a selection of results on holomorphic functions <b>with</b> values <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complex Banach space with an emphasis on the boundary behavior of vector-valued holomorphic functions.

25|$|During first {{instance}} proceedings, {{a decision on}} apportionment of costs forms part of the main decision of the Opposition Division. The main decision however only deals with the obligation on the party or parties concerned to bear costs (apportionment), whereas the actual amounts to be paid by one party to another are dealt with in another decision, namely a decision on the award (fixing) of costs. A decision on the award of costs is taken only after a decision apportioning the costs has been taken and if a request is submitted to that effect. When a Board of Appeal has to rule on an apportionment of costs, both the apportionment of costs and the fixing of costs to be apportioned are dealt <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single decision.|$|E
25|$|DRDO cooperates {{with the}} state owned Ordnance Factories Board for {{producing}} its items. These have led to issues of marginal quality control for some items, and time consuming rectification. Whilst these are common {{to the introduction of}} most new weapons systems, the OFB has had issues with maintaining the requisite schedule and quality of manufacture owing to their own structural problems and lack of modernization. The DRDO has played a vital {{role in the development of}} this ability since the role of private organizations in the development of small arms and similar items has been limited. A significant point in case is the INSAS rifle which has been adopted by the Indian Army as its standard battle rifle and is in extensive service. There have been issues with rifle quality in usage under extreme conditions in the heat, with the OFB stating that it will rectify these troubles with higher grade material and strengthening the unit. Prior troubles were also dealt <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar manner. In the meantime, the rifle has found favour throughout the army and has been ordered in number by other paramilitary units and police forces.|$|E
25|$|During Blake's {{training}} as a professional copy engraver with James Basire during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was stippling, which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, line engraving. Etching was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background. All traditional methods of engraving and etching were intaglio, which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a burin to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> web of crosshatched lines, before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the printing press.|$|E
