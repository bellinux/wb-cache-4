5|$|A {{secondary}} cutoff {{named the}} Slate Creek or Kinney Cutoff breaks {{from the main}} trail near the Lombard Ferry on the Green River, and meets the Sublette cutoff on Slate Creek Ridge at Emigrant Springs. This route <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> longer than the Sublette, but {{had the advantage of}} only 10 waterless miles rather than the 45 endured on the Sublette trail.|$|E
5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located farther west, experienced similar winds; however, damage <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of the dock and sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E

5|$|At least 110,000of the nation's 56million {{people were}} left homeless. Additionally, 2,742,666people or 537,152families were {{directly}} affected by the typhoon. Approximately 200,000dwellings were damaged, including roughly 39,000 that were destroyed. Furthermore, 208people were hurt. The Philippine Red Cross reported that 207people died on land in the Philippines, which <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> lower than the agency's earlier reports suggesting a death toll of 233. Nationwide, damage to infrastructure totaled $228million (1988 USD) and damage to agriculture totaled $40million. Across the Philippines, damage totaled $268million.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 17th century, {{possibly}} around 1600, a new hall was built in stone to replace the older timber-framed one; it was positioned to the south, replacing the earlier 15th-century extension. The new hall <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> anachronistic, having only one floor, unlike most new halls from this period which had two storeys. The old hall was then probably adapted for use as a service area.|$|E

5|$|Bergen Street {{opened on}} March 20, 1933, {{as the first}} station of the IND Culver Line. Service began {{one month after the}} {{expansion}} of the IND into Brooklyn to Jay Street–Borough Hall. The station's construction was expedited in order to both connect with and compete with the Bergen Street and Smith Street streetcar lines of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). Construction <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> stalled due to delays in the delivery of steel flues for the ventilation system.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem paid {{taxes on}} wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were {{organized}} into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented {{the village in}} the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).|$|E
5|$|Between 1989 and 1991, Rahl {{installed}} planking {{and guard}} rails {{on the southern}} half of the bridge, which was then opened to the public. He allowed bungee jumping off the bridge until a January 1992 court order held that it violated zoning laws. One person tried to bungee jump off the bridge without a restraining cord. The bridge <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> damaged by a fire in mid-1999, but it was repaired by September of that year.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} an attempt {{has been made}} to {{estimate}} the incidence of federal taxes, for the fiscal year 1978 - 79, on households belonging to different income-brackets. All the major direct and indirect taxes have been studied. The tax system turns out to <b>be</b> <b>slightly</b> progressive for the country as a whole. For urban areas, it <b>is</b> <b>slightly</b> progressive, and for rural areas it <b>is</b> <b>slightly</b> regressive. Indirect taxes, a major source of the federal government tax revenue, <b>are</b> generally <b>slightly</b> regressive. ...|$|R

5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old wool {{industry}} in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> smaller {{than it had been}} in the mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E
5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> longer on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's first {{possession}} of the half <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> more successful than Wake Forest's, as the Yellow Jackets drove inside the Deacons' 30-yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball. Again, however, the Tech defense stumbled. Facing a fourth down inside the Wake Forest red zone, Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball. Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line. The play {{was typical of the}} third quarter, which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E

5|$|Hōshō <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> {{damaged by}} a single bomb or aerial rocket hit when the Allies {{attacked}} Kure again in July 1945. Information is scarce {{on the extent of}} the ship's involvement in the action, but it appears the carrier's participation was minimal, as it embarked no aircraft at the time. Hōshō was repaired within 15 days, but the termination of hostilities in September 1945 found the carrier still docked at Kure.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Oklahoma ranked 45th in {{physicians}} {{per capita}} and slightly {{below the national}} average in nurses per capita, but <b>was</b> <b>slightly</b> over the national average in hospital beds per 100,000 people and above the national average in net growth of health services over a 12-year period. One of the worst states for percentage of insured people, nearly 25 percent of Oklahomans between the age of 18 and 64 did not have health insurance in 2005, the fifth-highest rate in the nation.|$|E
