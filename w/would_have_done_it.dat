500|$|All {{but two of}} {{the drum}} tracks are {{composed}} of samples performed by drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig.

Shields believes that listeners are unable to tell the difference between Ó Cíosóig's live drumming and the drum loops aside from the tracks intended to have an obviously [...] "sampled" [...] sound, like the dance-oriented [...] "Soon". The album makes extensive use of samples, with Shields stating, [...] "Most of the samples are feedback. We learnt from guitar feedback, with lots of distortion, that you can make any instrument, any one that you can imagine".|$|E

Conditions did not ease; Shackleton {{recorded}} 31 December as the [...] "hardest day we have had". On {{the next day he}} noted that, having attained 87°6½′S, they had beaten North and South polar records. That day, referring to Marshall and Adams, Wild wrote: [...] "if we only had Joyce and Marston here instead of those two grubscoffing useless beggars we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> [...] easily." [...] On 4 January 1909, Shackleton finally accepted that the Pole was beyond them, and revised his goal to the symbolic achievement of getting within 100geographical miles of the Pole. The party struggled on, at the borders of survival, until on 9 January 1909, after a last dash forward without the sledge or other equipment, the march ended. [...] "We have shot our bolt", wrote Shackleton, [...] "and the tale is 88°23'S". They were 97.5geographical miles from the South Pole. The British flag was duly planted, and Shackleton named the polar plateau after King Edward VII.|$|E

The person who can sit through this and not feel the tears welling up to his eyes is strangely callous to human grief and emotion." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was open in its praise of the film and its portrayal of the subject through good acting, but it also noted the technical faults with film continuity. The reviewer wrote, [...] "It was noticed that the old lady's bag was brought on immediately, already packed, {{when she left the}} son's house and when she left the home. It looks planned beforehand – similar incidents have hurt the excellence of a number of this company's superior films.

When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> either.

500|$|Massengale argues that, {{given that}} music is so {{important}} in the Epistles, and that Bellman had more than enough musical skill to write a tune, {{it is remarkable that}} all or almost all the tunes are borrowed. He suggests that this [...] "seems to indicate that Bellman wanted to preserve some vestige of the borrowing." [...] That the borrowing was not just about saving effort or making up for absent skill, Massengale argues, is demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} amount of work Bellman had to put into the melodies for Epistles 12 ("Gråt Fader Berg och spela") and 24 ("Kära Syster!") was [...] "surely tantamount to the production of new melodies." [...] Borrowing was accepted, even encouraged at the time, but that does not explain why Bellman <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> so consistently. The [...] "poetic possibility", Massengale suggests, is that Bellman wished to exploit the humorous contrast between a melody of one type and a story of another, or between an existing image associated with the melody, and a fresh one presented in an Epistle. In addition, Bellman was able to use what his audience knew to be borrowed music to reinforce the historical flavour of the Epistles, introducing exactly the kind of ambiguity that he was seeking.|$|E
500|$|During the {{following}} winter Joyce, with Wild's help, printed {{copies of the}} expedition book Aurora Australis, edited by Shackleton. About 25 or 30 copies of the book were printed, sewn and bound. Otherwise Joyce was busy preparing equipment and stores for the next season's journey to the Pole in which, in view of his experience, he fully expected to be included. However, various mishaps had {{reduced the number of}} ponies to four, so Shackleton cut the southern party to that number. One of those dropped was Joyce, on advice from expedition doctor Eric Marshall, who noted that Joyce had a liver problem and the early stages of heart disease. Frank Wild, who along with Marshall and Jameson Adams was selected for the southern journey, wrote in his diary after the party's bid to reach the Pole had fallen short: [...] "If we only had Joyce and Marston here instead of these two useless grub-scoffing beggars" [...] – (Marshall and Adams)– [...] "we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> easily." [...] Joyce showed no particular resentment at his exclusion; he assisted the preparatory work and accompanied the polar party on the southward march for the first seven days. In {{the following}} months he took charge of enhancing the depots, to ensure adequate supplies for the returning southern party. He deposited a special cache of luxuries at Minna Bluff, together with life-saving food and fuel, earning Wild's spontaneous praise when the cache was discovered.|$|E
500|$|Arts, which Playford {{showed no}} {{personal}} interest in, and regarded as [...] "frills not fundamentals" [...] and [...] "non-productive", became a more prominent issue among the emerging middle-class. For his attitude, Playford was often mocked by his opponents and critics for his [...] "philistinism". The Nation derisorily quipped that [...] "It is axiomatic that the Premier draws his orchard spray {{gun at the}} mention of the word 'culture'". Sir Arthur Rymill, an LCL member of the upper house, criticised the demolition of the Theatre Royal, lobbied Playford for increased funding without success, pointing out that world-class performing arts venues were generally subsidised by the government. Hurtle Morphett, a former State President of the LCL, quipped that if Playford [...] "had wanted to convert the Art Gallery on North Terrace into a power house he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> without hesitation". In the 1960s, the Adelaide Festival started, while the Australian Dance Theatre and the State Theatre Company of South Australia was founded in the capital, with minimal assistance from Playford's government. The festival was well-received despite the effect of censorship in a state well known for social conservatism. With the success of the festival, public interest in arts increased, and with increasing calls for government funding, particularly from Dunstan, Playford finally agreed to fund the [...] "non-productive area" [...] in 1963 by allocating funding for the eventual building of the Festival Centre.|$|E

500|$|Cher's {{music plays}} {{a large role}} in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", Chris Carter having written the episode after {{spending}} a summer listening to Cher records and developing a fixation on the singer. Carter knew that Cher's half-sister Georganne LaPiere was a major X-Files fan, and Carter learned through LaPiere that Cher herself was intrigued by the show and would be interested in making an X-Files guest appearance. Sitcom star Roseanne Barr also expressed an interest in guesting on The X-Files, and Carter wrote the part of Shaineh Berkowitz specifically for her. Barr, however, was unavailable at the time of shooting—her projected role was filled by Pattie Tierce— while Cher passed on the proffered cameo appearance performing as herself, a decision for which she later expressed regret: [...] "I wanted them to ask me to come on and act—then they just wanted me to come on and sing ... Just to come on and be myself wasn't anything I'd want to do until I saw [...] " [...] — [...] "Had I [...] the quality of [...] I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> in a heartbeat." [...] Cher did authorize the use of three of her tracks on the episode's soundtrack including [...] "Walking in Memphis" [...] heard at the episode's conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator Tracey Bell—filmed in longshot or from the back or overheard—as Cher. Although Bell was credited for the role, Cher's fans responded to the episode's premiere with online speculation as to whether the singer had pseudonymously appeared in the episode. [...] Tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself. These casting choices went against a long-standing tradition on The X-Files of only casting actors who were not well-known.|$|E

After accepting her request, Clemons went to New York and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "Hair". Before Clemons started work on the song, she explained the lyrics to him. [...] "It made so much sense," [...] he said. [...] "It's a story about growing up." [...] She gave him few instructions about how to play on the song, saying [...] "'We'll put the tape on and you just play. Play from your heart. Play what you feel.'". The recording was finished by 3:00 am, after a few takes. Clemons added that he was surprised for [...] "getting paid for this. I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> for free. I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money." [...] According to the sheet music [...] published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time. It is composed in the key of F major, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals span from F3 to F5, and the song follows a basic sequence of F–C–Dm–B as its chord progression.|$|E

The VMA performance {{was the first time}} Jay-Z and Keys performed the song together. Shaheem Redi of MTV News commented on the performance that, [...] "Their set was elegant and 'hood at the same time, and it was such a powerful moment". Ryan Brockington of the New York Post wrote [...] "Alicia's buttery voice and Jay-Z's impeccable stage presence made for an audio adrenaline overload" [...] and placed the performance third on his list of the [...] "top six performances" [...] from the MTV VMAs. For the performance Jay-Z wore his signature Yankees cap and Keys wore all black while playing the piano. During the MTV VMA performance images of locations in New York, such as the Empire State Building and the Apollo Theatre, were shown on an overhead screen behind Jay-Z and Keys. Towards the end of the performance rapper Lil' Mama got up onto the stage uninvited and posed with Jay-Z and Keys while they were finishing the final verse of the track. Lil' Mama said she did not mean to disrespect either performer but the song had her [...] "emotions running high", adding that [...] "in that moment I came up onstage to celebrate my two icons singing about NY."
