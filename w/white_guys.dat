500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Liquorice" [...] {{contains}} [...] "Harlem-street-slang-derived wordplay", {{which comes}} from Banks' origin, Harlem (for example: [...] "skrilla" [...] means [...] "money", and [...] "ye" [...] stands for [...] "cocaine"). The song is also inspired by interracial dating; Banks explained: [...] "I date lots of <b>white</b> <b>guys.</b> It's still seen as slightly taboo in African American culture, but I thought, 'Let me put this in your face and tell it how it is.'" ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Eric Goldman {{praised the}} performances of John Slattery and Peyton List, and said the episode [...] "took three of the show's best characters and rocked their worlds in very different ways, telling three separate stories that were all utterly involving and moving, and delivering one of the show's best episodes ever in the process. This show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of...". Roger Friedman of Forbes called the LSD sequences with Jane and Roger to be [...] "so well-written {{they were kind of}} transcendent". Salon writer Nellie Engoron acclaimed the episode, while pointing out that [...] "with this episode’s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters, we’re reminded that while the 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth, like a drunk, no historical change walks a straight line. For all the claims that Don and others have made that the “kids” increasingly hold the cards, the real truth (if we’re telling it) is that older <b>white</b> <b>guys</b> like Bert and Roger never truly lost power, even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory." ...|$|E

500|$|Māori {{academic}} Rawiri Taonui {{agreed that}} the film portrays indigenous people as being simplistic and unable to defend themselves without the help from [...] "the <b>white</b> <b>guys</b> and the neo-liberals." [...] Another author remarked that while the white man will fix the destruction, he will never feel guilty, {{even though he is}} directly responsible for the destruction." [...] Likewise, Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of Die Zeit in Germany, said the film perpetuates the myth of the [...] "noble savage" [...] and has [...] "a condescending, yes, even racist message. Cameron bows to the noble savages. [...] However, he reduces them to dependents." [...] Slavoj Žižek argued that [...] "the film enables us to practise a typical ideological division: sympathising with the idealised aborigines while rejecting their actual struggle." [...] The Irish Times carried the comment that [...] "despite all the thematic elements from Hinduism, one thing truly original is the good old American ego. Given its Hollywood origins, the script has remained faithful to the inherent superiority complex, and has predictably bestowed the honor of the 'avatar' not on the movie’s native Na’vis, but on a white American marine." [...] Similarly, positing that [...] "the only good humans [...] are dead—or rather, resurrected as 'good Navi'", a writer in The Jerusalem Post thought that the film was inadvertently promoting supremacy of one race over another.|$|E
500|$|The fictional company Isodyne Energy, who is {{involved}} with nuclear testing in the desert, {{was influenced by the}} real life 1940s companies such as Radiodyne, General Atomic or the beginnings of the Jet Propulsion Lab, [...] "all of which were in L.A. in the '40s, and were developing the space program and were developing nukes." [...] Additionally, the season avoids depicting real life Hollywood stars from the 1940s because [...] "the focus would shift from story to: does that person look or sound like an actor?" [...] Instead, the character Whitney Frost is depicted as an actress [...] "who will have a part to play in our larger storyline." [...] The season introduces the Council of Nine, based on the Secret Empire, who [...] "meet at the Arena Club, which is like this social club of <b>white</b> <b>guys.</b> They're just the guys who sort of run the world. They have orchestrated assassinations. We insinuate that they orchestrated the 1929 Stock Market crash." [...] Members of the Council include powerful businessmen Calvin Chadwick and Hugh Jones, and their influence extends to [...] "high levels of the government" [...] as seen with War Department veteran Vernon Masters. Despite close similarities between the 'A' symbol of the Arena Club and a Hydra symbol introduced in the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fazekas stated that she [...] "would not say" [...] there was a connection between the Council and Hydra.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} several {{university}} studies, for instance, Eric Lott's critical essay, [...] "All the King's Men: Elvis Impersonators and White Working-Class Masculinity," [...] published in Harry Stecopoulos and Michael Uebel, eds., Race and the Subject of Masculinities (Duke University Press, 1997). The author, professor of American Studies at the University of Virginia, {{has also written}} a long piece on Elvis impersonators and the EPIIA (Elvis Presley Impersonators International Association) {{to be published in}} his next book. For this paper, he interviewed many impersonators and draws parallels with minstrelsy. [...] "It is indeed one place minstrelsy ends up; where 19th-century <b>white</b> <b>guys</b> imitated what they thought of as slave culture and Elvis took from R & B performers, the impersonators copy the copy, if you will—it's minstrelsy once-removed." [...] In her paper, [...] "Women Who 'Do Elvis'", Case Western Reserve University researcher Francesca Brittan deals with female Elvis Presley impersonators and finds them to be [...] "campy, cheeky, and often disturbingly convincing." [...] According to Marjorie Garber's academic study, Vested Interests: Cross-dressing and Cultural Anxiety (1992), Elvis impersonation is so insistently connected with femininity that it is [...] "almost as if the word 'impersonator', in contemporary popular culture, can be modified either by 'female' or by 'Elvis.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Christgau {{has named}} Louis Armstrong, Thelonious Monk, Chuck Berry, the Beatles, and the New York Dolls as his top five artists of all time. In a 1998 obituary, he called Frank Sinatra [...] "the {{greatest}} {{singer of the}} 20th century". Christgau readily admits to having prejudices and generally disliking genres such as heavy metal, art rock, progressive rock, bluegrass, gospel, Irish folk, and jazz fusion. [...] "I admire metal's integrity, brutality, and obsessiveness", Christgau wrote in 1986, [...] "but I can't stand its delusions of grandeur, the way it apes and misapprehends reactionary notions of nobility". He has {{said he is not}} [...] "encyclopedic" [...] about popular music; Wolk wrote that [...] "there are not a lot of <b>white</b> <b>guys</b> in their 60s waving the flag for Lil Wayne's Da Drought 3, especially not in the same column as they wave the flag for a Willie Nelson/Merle Haggard/Ray Price trio album, an anthology of new Chinese pop, Vampire Weekend, and Wussy (who? Well, if Christgau gave 'em an A, maybe you'd best find out)." [...] In his 2000 Consumer Guide book, Christgau said his favorite rock album was either The Clash (1977) or New York Dolls (1973), while his favorite record in general was Monk's 1958 Misterioso. In July 2013, during an interview with Esquire magazine's Peter Gerstenzang, Christgau criticized the voters at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, saying [...] "they're pretty stupid" [...] for not voting in the New York Dolls.|$|E
