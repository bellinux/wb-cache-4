25|$|The {{formaldehyde}} {{surrounding the}} shark, Hirst says, {{is the process}} of death and decay. Though formaldehyde is used as a preservation means, over time, the object being preserved will soon wilt, flake, and wrinkle. Because the sculpture itself was made in 1991, the shark is very much rotting and deformed due to the formaldehyde taking its toll on the corpse. With the corpse rotting away, it symbolizes that no matter how well we take care of ourselves or how timeless <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are, our mind will start to fade away and we slowly will begin to forget.|$|E

500|$|By December 1972, having {{recorded}} Machine Head, Made in Japan and the yet to {{be released}} Who Do <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> <b>We</b> Are with Deep Purple, Gillan finally decided the workload had driven him to exhaustion. Unlike some band members, he was unhappy about Made in Japan, and disliked live albums in general. He tended {{to go into the}} studio after the rest of the band had recorded and finished the backing tracks, particularly for Who Do <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> <b>We</b> Are, to lay down his vocals separately. He had been continually at loggerheads with Blackmore, disagreeing about music regularly, which culminated in Gillan writing [...] "Smooth Dancer" [...] about him. While on tour in Dayton, Ohio, he sat down and wrote a resignation letter to the band's managers, stating he intended to leave the band, effective from 30 June 1973.|$|E

500|$|Waters {{was drawn}} to the Victorian era because of the (mis)understandings of what social norms existed during the period. As she stated, [...] "I find it a {{fascinating}} period because it feels very close to us, and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange: many of the things <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> know about it are stereotypes, or simply wrong." [...] Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage, Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde, and Chris Hunt, who wrote Street Lavender, an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era. She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender, with a plot similar to My Secret Life by [...] "Walter".|$|E
500|$|The Kazon were {{inspired}} by Los Angeles gangs, and were referenced in a [...] "shorthand 'Crips' and 'Bloods' fashion".

[...] While discussing the Kazon's original inspiration, Taylor viewed them as a way [...] "to address the tenor of our times and what [...] was happening in our cities and recognizing a source of danger and social unrest". Piller further described the premise for the Kazon as rooted in gang violence and warfare by clarifying: [...] "Our intention was to create a sort of disorganized anarchy, them-against-them as much as them-against-us." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} Just Dance {{led to the}} {{development}} of a sequel, Just Dance 2, which focused on adding new features and refinements to the game—such as improvements to its motion tracking system, new game modes, and support for downloadable content. Sales of Just Dance 2 surpassed that of the original; with over 5 million copies as of January 2011, it was the best-selling third-party title for the Wii. Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon." [...] Poix felt that [...] "there's a pressure within Ubisoft to keep Just Dance enormous, and <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can make it enormous.

500|$|After a Week 8 bye, Hester caught four {{passes for}} 42 yards {{and had an}} 11-yard run against the Detroit Lions. He {{eventually}} lost his kick return duties to Danieal Manning, but began receiving more playing time as a wide receiver. Between Week 12 and 15, Hester caught 17 passes for 250 yards and one touchdown. David Haugh of the Chicago Tribune regarded Hester as the team's [...] "biggest threat in the passing game." [...] He concluded the season by catching 51 passes for a team high 665 yards. Unlike his previous two seasons in the NFL, Hester did not record a single touchdown return and only averaged 6.2 yards per punt return. Lovie Smith commented on Hester {{at the end of}} the season by saying, [...] "I know his returns dropped off a little bit this year, but his plate was full there for a while. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have a happy medium now for him as a punt returner and continuing to develop as a receiver."

500|$|Initially, {{the game}} had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark {{received}} many alterations throughout the development process. Lead Art Director Wil Overton {{explained that they}} [...] "wanted {{to bring her back}} in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her up a bit and make her more iconic." [...] However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, {{which was one of the}} first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, [...] "It was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the UK in December 1972, with a special offer price of £3.10, {{the same as a}} typical single LP from that period. It reached number 16 in the charts. The cover was designed by Glover and featured a colour photo of the band on the front and rear covers, and black and white photos in the inside gatefold. The release in the US was delayed until April 1973, because Warner Bros. wanted to release Who Do <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> <b>We</b> Are first. They were motivated into releasing it due to a steady flow of UK imports being purchased, and it was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 6 in the charts. Warner Brothers also released [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] as a single, coupling the live recording on Made in Japan with the studio version on Machine Head, and it reached number 4 in the Billboard charts. A recording of [...] "Black Night" [...] from the Tokyo gig, one of the encores that was not on the album, was released as the B-side to the single [...] "Woman from Tokyo" [...] in Europe, and as a single in its own right in Japan.|$|E
500|$|The Romanian writer {{also spent}} the Dada period issuing {{a long series}} of manifestos, which were often {{authored}} as prose poetry, and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by [...] "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected [...] "the language of a sophisticated savage". Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for [...] "compress what we think and feel", and, according to Hans Richter, the genre [...] "suited Tzara perfectly." [...] Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs. His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: [...] "Dada means nothing", adding [...] "Thought is produced in the mouth." [...] Tzara indicated: [...] "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none." [...] In addition, Tzara, who once stated that [...] "logic is always false", probably approved of Serner's vision of a [...] "final dissolution". According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that [...] "as long as we do things the way <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society." ...|$|E

Sheffield added that, in the song, by comparison, [...] "she reminds you what a smart job she normally does of keeping the tempo jumping." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine believed [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was one of the}} songs on Fearless that expanded on the success of Swift's eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006), because of how prominently its hook stands out. Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter said [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was ostentatious in regards to Swift's crossover potential. Nick Catucci of New York magazine read an article posted in The New York Times, which stated Swift [...] "quickly established herself as the most remarkable country music breakthrough artist of the decade", and opted his own opinion, based on the song. Catucci said, [...] "And indeed, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> got a little fairy dust in our eyes listening to 'You're Not Sorry' [...] isn't the stuff of redneck women but earnest suburban princesses," [...] despite that he had listened to better songs in the past decade. Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette compared [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] to a [...] "chanteuse a la Tori Amos".|$|E
