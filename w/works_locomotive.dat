50|$|The {{railroad}} purchased another {{diesel locomotive}} in 2006 and dubbed it #3502. It wears {{the colors of}} the Chicago and North Western Railway. #3502 started construction at the Chicago Locomotive Works, but was finished by the Merrick Light Railway Works after CLW went under (CLW had a history of trying to scam the railroad). Both diesels, built in the style of an EMD GP60M, continue to operate weekdays during summer and weekends during winter and early spring. A third diesel, #4, built in 2005 by volunteer Tom Waterfall in the style of a Davenport Locomotive <b>Works</b> <b>locomotive,</b> is used in work train service, and also sees use as a yard switcher. The restored 2-spot operates weekends from late spring until the end of fall.|$|E
50|$|High-speed trains diesel-hydraulic {{multiple}} units of classes VT 08 and VT 12.5 were operated in the 1950s and 1960s. Class 515 accumulator railcars occasionally operated {{on the line}} from 1956 to 1989. Class VT 24 diesel {{multiple units}} operated some local services from 1964 to 1980. Class 628 DMUs operated school transport around noon from the 1980s onwards. Class 220 diesel-hydraulic locomotives hauled services between the Neustadt and Hochspeyer from 1967 to 1973. Some of the freight trains, which in the past ran between Ludwigshafen and Schifferstadt and between Neustadt and Hochspeyer were hauled by class 212 and 218 diesel locomotives. Diesel locomotives of classes V 60 and V 90 are used for the operation of the sidings that are not electrified. A private <b>works</b> <b>locomotive</b> is used for the shunting in Neidelfels.

5000|$|The Gilded Age iron {{industrialist}} {{and railroad}} president Robert Habersham Coleman {{decided that a}} 4-mile (7-kilometer) narrow-gauge railroad {{to the top of}} nearby Governor Dick Mountain would provide an additional tourist draw, and a 0.6-mile (1 kilometer) spur at milepost 0.75 could service the Pennsylvania National Guard rifle ranges nearby. [...] The line was built to the rare (in North America) and very narrow gauge of 24 in. Locomotives, apart from an early and unsuccessful H. K. Porter, Inc 0-4-4 Forney locomotive, were three 4-4-0 [...] "American" [...] types (#11, #12 and #15) built by Baldwin Locomotive <b>Works.</b> <b>Locomotive</b> #12 was ordered on 22 June 1889 and built in only 8 days to be ready for anticipated Independence Day crowds after the Porter Forney wheelbase proved too rigid for reliable service on small-radius curves. The Baldwin locomotives featured lagged smokeboxes and were the only [...] gauge 4-4-0s ever operated in North America; although Baldwin built a [...] gauge 4-4-0 for the Ferrocarril de Tacubaya of Mexico City in 1897.Rails weighing [...] were spiked onto the 4 in face of ties 3 ft long. A turntable, engine-house, water tank, runaround track, and storage tracks were near the junction with the Cornwall & Lebanon at Mount Gretna. Return loops were built near the rifle range and around Governor Dick peak. During the summer of 1889 passengers were carried in one conventional coach and 7 open-sided observation cars boarded from long foot-boards running along the length of either side of the car. Two more observation cars were added when locomotive #15 was purchased for the summer of 1890. [...] At first the railroad was popular, but the tourist trade declined after the novelty had died down. The loop around Governor Dick was dismantled after the summer of 1896, but the railroad continued operation for the National Guard rifle range. A serious accident in 1915 killed off that traffic. One of the observation cars overturned on a sharp curve when a large number of guardsmen attempted to board simultaneously {{from one side of the}} car. [...] There were some serious injuries, and the tiny railroad ceased operation in the summer of 1916, shortly after its parent company's purchase by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The narrow-gauge equipment was loaded aboard standard gauge cars on 14 September 1916.|$|E
