5|$|The Ottomans invaded Wallachia and Moldavia {{at the end}} of 1474. Matthias sent {{reinforcements}} {{under the}} command of Blaise Magyar to Stephen the Great. Their united forces routed the invaders in the Battle of Vaslui on 10 January 1475. Fearing a new Ottoman invasion, the Prince of Moldavia swore fealty to Matthias on 15 August. Sultan Mehmed II proposed peace but Matthias refused him. Instead, he stormed into Ottoman territory and captured Šabac, an important fort on the river Száva, on 15 February 1476. During the siege, Matthias barely escaped capture while he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> fortress from a boat.|$|E

5|$|Our Friends in the North was {{originally}} {{written by the}} playwright Peter Flannery for the theatre, {{while he was a}} writer in residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). The idea came to Flannery while he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> rehearsals for the company's production of Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2 at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic. The original three-hour long theatre version of Our Friends in the North, directed by John Caird and featuring Jim Broadbent and Roger Allam among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at The Other Place in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then playing at The Pit, a studio theatre in the Barbican Centre in London. In its original form, the story went up only to the 1979 general election and the coming to power of the new Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in Rhodesia, chronicling UDI, the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy. This plot strand was dropped from the televised version, although the title Our Friends in the North, a reference to how staff at BP in South Africa referred to the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, remained.|$|E
25|$|The first {{intended}} day for escape was 6 April, but {{the appearance}} of HMS Convict and other Royal Navy ships and customs officers quickly led to a postponement.

Chaos followed and electricity in the capital was shut off for nearly an hour. There were no casualties and minimal damage. The security forces were unable to bring down the aircraft prompting much criticism from the public and opposition political parties.|$|E

25|$|In late 1966, the Central Intelligence Agency had human {{intelligence}} reports of three American {{prisoners of war}} being held in northern Laos. The names received matched American personnel records. However, the CIA seniors contemplated an attempt to bribe prison guards that spooked the communists; the prisoners were relocated. In early December 1966, a Pathet Lao defector {{was brought in to}} Thakhek, Laos by a CIA military intelligence team that <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> Ho Chi Minh Trail. Under interrogation, the defector told of a prison camp in a cave near the Lao village of Ban Naden. It purportedly contained a captive Air America employee. In a year of picking up vague reports about this camp, this was the first detailed information. Debriefing elicited the information that there were about 40 guards at the camp, and about the same number of prisoners to be rescued.|$|E
25|$|Will Smith {{conceived}} {{this story}} when he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> television show called I Shouldn't Be Alive with his brother-in-law Caleeb Pinkett. It was originally not {{a science fiction}} story but about {{a father and son}} crashing their car in the mountains or some remote region, with the son having {{to go out and get}} rescue for his father. Smith then decided to change the setting to 1000 years in the future, which imposed a higher budget. The film was also intended to be the first in a trilogy. Smith had his production company Overbrook contact Gary Whitta (who was then known for his script for The Book of Eli) with a simple log line for a film: a father and son crash landed on Earth 1000 years after it had been abandoned by humankind. Impressed with his idea and excited about the opportunity to work with him, Whitta fleshed out Smith's idea and pitched it to him, subsequently becoming the first employee on the project.|$|E
25|$|With Lérida captured, {{new orders}} arrived from Napoleon to seize Tortosa. The new {{commander}} in Catalonia, Marshal Jacques MacDonald was {{ordered by the}} emperor to cooperate with Suchet. In July, Suchet sent a force close to Tortosa while he assembled his siege equipment at Mequinenza. At the beginning of August, Henry O'Donnell led 2,500 Spanish regulars to Tortosa. On 3 August, O'Donnell marched out of Tortosa to attack Laval's division, which <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> city. The Spanish troops broke through the first defensive line but were unable to defeat the French and had to retreat. O'Donnell subsequently returned to Tarragona. Soon afterward, Suchet chased away the Army of Valencia which was threatening the force in front of Tortosa. By mid-August, MacDonald and 16,000 soldiers were finally cooperating with Suchet. Laval died of fever at Mora de Rubielos on 6 September 1810. His name is on the Arc de Triomphe on Column 36.|$|E

25|$|The Allies {{successfully}} {{wrapped up}} {{the siege of}} Alessandria on 21 July and the Siege of Mantua on 30 July. These important events released 30,000 Coalition troops for field operations. Suvarov placed Konrad Valentin von Kaim with 14,000 Austrians to guard the west of Piedmont and Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak with 11,000 more to observe the alpine passes into Switzerland to the north. Klenau with 5,000 troops at Sarzana <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> southeast side of Genoa. Kray was ordered to join the main army as quickly as possible. The rest of Suvorov's army was deployed {{in the area of}} Alessandria and Tortona. In the meantime, Chasteler was seriously wounded by a canister shot on 17 July during the siege of Alessandria and replaced by another Austrian, Anton von Zach. Despite the pain of his injury, Chasteler produced a new plan for ousting the French from the Ligurian mountains. This plan was put on indefinite hold when the news of the impending French offensive became known.|$|E
25|$|Also as {{previously}} mentioned, longtime Los Angeles Dodgers' broadcaster Vin Scully called the 1988 World Series {{for a national}} television audience on NBC with Joe Garagiola. Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Kirk Gibson <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At {{some point during the}} game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and Scully, observed that Gibson was nowhere to be found. This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda that he was available to pinch hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings. Bob Costas, who, along with Marv Albert, hosted NBC's World Series pre-game coverage and handled post-game interviews, made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers' clubhouse (especially Tommy Lasorda). After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a post-game interview with Marv Albert) sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas. While Kirk Gibson was taking practice swings in the Dodgers' clubhouse during Game 1, Orel Hershiser set up the hitting tee for his teammate. Along the way, Costas could hear Gibson's agonized-sounding grunts after every hit. Costas said that the 1988 Dodgers possibly had the weakest hitting line-up in World Series history.|$|E

500|$|On Inflikted, Max was the group's {{songwriter}} and lyricist. At {{the time}} of the album recording, he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> same four movies almost every day: Apocalypse Now, City of God, A Clockwork Orange, and La Haine. Max revealed to Revolver that he wanted to do something different, and it gave him a lot of ideas.

500|$|It {{was around}} this time that Watt {{arranged}} for a major test of the CH system at Bawdsey with many aircraft involved. Dowding had been promoted to Chief of Fighter Command, and was on hand to watch. Things did not go well; for unknown reasons the radar did not pick up the approaching aircraft until they were far too close to arrange interception. Dowding <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> screens intently {{for any sign of}} the bombers, failing to find one when he heard them pass overhead. Bowen averted total disaster by quickly arranging a demonstration of his system in the Red Tower, which picked out the aircraft as they re-formed [...] away.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing.

Potter said that choosing to cover [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was easy {{because she is}} [...] "big-voiced". She elaborated: [...] "As I <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> video, I was watching for the visual candy. Then I slowly began {{falling in love with}} the song."
