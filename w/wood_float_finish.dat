40|$|This {{paper was}} written to {{contribute}} to study of the post-medieval cultural landscape, especially the industrial landscape. It observes changes of landscape and settlement, which were affected by industrial activities {{in the middle of}} Šumava Mountain region. The reason why the landscape pattern has changed were industrial activities and also fabrication of Vchynicko-tetovský floating channel {{at the turn of the}} 18 th and 19 th century. Forests in this region were previously used mainly by glass and iron works, but the industrial activities and settlement culminated in the exploitation of the forests just because of oportunity of the <b>wood</b> <b>floating.</b> Formating and function of the channel was business intention of prince Schwarzenberg, who could due to floating of Vydra river and then other two rivers called Otava and Vltava fill the gap in the market with firewood in Prague. The landscape was already in the first decennium of the 19 th century reformated negatively, namely in forest crops. The number of colonies of woodworkers increased.

Rather, under fixed rates, monetary policy had to be adjusted to stabilize the exchange rate, flattening the demand curve and thereby increasing the output response and reducing the price response to aggregate supply shocks. Following the shift to floating, monetary policy was freed, steepening the demand curve and increasing price volatility relative to output volatility.

50|$|In Australia, plaster or cement render that {{is applied}} to {{external}} brickwork on dwellings or commercial buildings can be one or two coats. In two coat render a base coat is applied with a common mix of 4 parts sand to one part cement and one part dehydrated lime and water to make a consistent mortar. Render is applied using a hawk and trowel and pushed on about 12 mm thick to begin. For two coat, some plasterers apply two full depth bands of render (one {{at the base of}} the wall and one around chest height) which are screed plumb and square and allowed to dry while applying the first coat over the remaining exposed wall. The render is then scratched to provide a key for the second coat. This method allows the rest of the wall to be rendered and screed off without the need to continually check if the second coat is plumb. Alternatively, both coats can be applied with the plasterer using a t-bar to screed the final coat until it is plumb straight and square. The first method is generally used where quality of finish is at a premium. The second method is quicker but can be several millimeters out of plumb. The second coat can be a slightly weaker mix 5/1/1, or the same as the base coat with maybe a water proofer in the mix added to the water to minimize efflorescence (rising of salts). Some plasterers used lime putty in second coat instead of dehydrated lime in the render. The mortar {{is applied to}} about 5 mm thick and when the render hardens is screeded off straight. A <b>wood</b> <b>float</b> or plastic float is used to rub down the walls. Traditionally, water is splashed on walls using a coarse horsehair plasterers brush followed by immediately rubbing the float in a circular or figure 8 motion although a figure of 8 can leave marks. Many modern plasterers use a hose with a special nozzle with a fine mist spray to dampen walls when rubbing up (using a <b>wood</b> <b>float</b> to bring a consistent finish). Using a hose brings a superior finish and is more consistent in colour as there is more chance in catching the render before it has a chance to harden too much. After the work area is floated, the surface is finished with a wet sponge using the same method as <b>floating</b> with a <b>wood</b> <b>float,</b> bringing sand to the surface to give a smooth consistent finish.|$|R

50|$|Generally, kaolin {{deposits}} {{have been}} covered with colored sequences of sand. In some quarries, we can observe red, green and some times black sands. The black color {{might be due}} to the existence of pyrite and organic materials. Sometimes fossil <b>woods</b> (<b>floated</b> branches and trunks of trees) can be found and with the coarse size of pebbles (several millimeters) are evidence of a high energy transportation. This type of sand can have some influences on the leaching by mineral and organic acids produced by pyrite and organic materials, of the lower kaolin deposits. Thiry has found that generally these kaolins contain rather well-ordered kaolinite. Obviously, the level of crystallization can control technical properties of kaolinite as well as the structural impurities.The high energy current can interrupt the continuity of the settled layers of kaolin and reduce the simplicity of the estimation methods.|$|R

A higher value of Manning’s n indicates that a channel is rough and thereby creates more friction as the water moves through the channel. This friction causes a loss in energy and consequentially a reduction in flow velocity. A smaller n value has the opposite effect. The Manning’s n value for common materials, such wood or cement can be found in literature. The observed channel material is Portland cement concrete.
