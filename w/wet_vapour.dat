50|$|Protection against {{interstitial}} condensation {{is necessary}} in heated or cooled buildings depending on the climate where they are located and other factors. This is done primarily by means of preventing exfiltration (air leakage into the assemblies); controlling indoor moisture at its sources through ventilation, heating, insulation, dehumidification; and using an impervious vapour barrier (vapour check) on the warm side of the insulation, i.e., inside the assembly on a heated building and outside on a cooled building. Buildings that are both heated and cooled should not have vapour barriers {{on both sides of}} the assemblies. Vapour barriers are problematic because they difficult to install perfectly and greatly reduce the ability of a cavity to dry out when it does get <b>wet.</b> <b>Vapour</b> barriers are used in conjunction with a housewrap, a vapour permeable but water resistant membrane, so that one side of the cavity is permeable to allow drying.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} problem solved in {{this article}} is the calculation of thermodynamic parameters such as final temperature, distribution of the liquid and dry saturated vapour phases of the substance that are considered to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, and pressure of the system of several reaction products after adding to the system a certain amount of heat or the thermal effect released during rapid exothermic reaction in a closed volume that occurs so fast that it can be considered to be adiabatic, and when the volume of liquid reagents is several orders of magnitude less than the volume of the reactor. The general multi-substance problem is reduced to a theoretical problem for one substance of calculation thermodynamic parameters of system after adding a certain amount of heat that gives theoretically rigorous isochoric calculation. In this article, we substantiate our view that isochoric pass of calculation is more robust compared to seemingly more natural isobaric pass of calculation, if the later involves quite not trivial calculation of the adiabatic compression of a two-phase system (liquid – dry saturated vapour) that can pass itself into another kind of state (liquid – <b>wet</b> saturated <b>vapour),</b> which requires, apparently, more complex descriptions compared with isochoric calculation because the specific heat capacity of <b>wet</b> saturated <b>vapour</b> can be negative...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{the passage}} of the {{refrigerant}} through the condenser of a refrigerator, it generally undergoes the processes of desuperheating, condensation and sub-cooling. One of the important criteria in condenser design is to locate the points where superheated refrigerant vapour changes to saturated vapour and subsequently from <b>wet</b> <b>vapour</b> to saturated liquid. The present paper discusses the analysis of wire-and-tube condenser under normal operating conditions of free convection using FEM where Galerkin’s weighted residual method is used to minimise the errors. Refrigerant R- 134 a is considered for the study and the condenser components are divided into several elements where the state of refrigerant is predicted. The effects of ambient temperature and mass flow rates of the refrigerant are also determined. This is used to find out the length of tube required for phase change for its initiation and completion. The methodology adopted is validated against the simulation data available in the literature for both sensible and latent heat transfer. The analysis also leads to the information about the adequacy of the number of tubes for complete condensation of the refrigerant vapour under given operating conditions. It is found that for a certain mass flow rate of refrigerant, sub-cooling does not occur at some higher ambient temperatures, thus showing the inefficiencies of the heat exchanger. The methodology {{can be used as a}} design tool for the design of wire-and-tube condenser of a small refrigerator. The derating of condenser under abnormal ambient conditions can also be predicted...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the performance}} of energy systems that recover power from low grade heat {{is one of the most}} important requirements for reducing their investment cost and optimising system efficiency. The aim of this work was to study, model and analyse an Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system using a twin screw expander to generate the power output, with HFC- 245 fa, as the working fluid. A software package (Power Plant Performance Prediction Program), simulating ORC system performance was therefore prepared for this purpose. Major components were represented by proper units and relations between the system’s constituents defined. The preferred analytical procedure depends on both the system complexity and the requirements of the study. In this case, the whole cycle was simulated in order to obtain a good understanding of its behaviour with the aim of estimating its optimum operating conditions. The procedure adopted was to start from a basic case and then improve it, in a realistic way, in order to evaluate the system potential. Performance indicators, like thermal efficiency, specific net output, total UA and surface of the heat exchangers, as well as the relative cost of the system all need to be taken into account but it is impossible to optimise all of them simultaneously. The design value for these parameters is therefore a matter of choice, or compromise. Efficiencies of ORC systems were calculated based on the assumption that the working fluid entered the expander as <b>wet</b> <b>vapour.</b> For the heat source and sink conditions chosen for this study, the overall cycle efficiency was estimated as approximately 6...|$|E
40|$|A {{parameterized}} {{method is}} developed to diagnose {{the air quality}} in Beijing and other cities with an index termed (parameters linking air-quality to meteorological elements PLAM) derived from a correlation between PM 10 and relevant weather elements based on the data between 2000 and 2007. Key weather factors for diagnosing the air pollution intensity are identified and included in PLAM that include atmospheric condensation of water <b>vapour,</b> <b>wet</b> potential equivalent temperature, and wind velocity. It is found that the poor air quality days with elevated PM 10 are usually associated with higher PLAM values, featuring higher temperature, humidity, lower wind velocity, and higher stability compared to the averaged values in the same period. Both 24 [*]h and 72 [*]h forecasts provided useful services for {{the day of the}} opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games and subsequent sport events. A correlation coefficient of 0. 82 was achieved between the forecasts and (air pollution index API) and 0. 59 between the forecasts and observed PM 10, all reaching the significant level of 0. 001, for the summer period.

40|$|International audienceMeasurements of {{evaporation}} {{were made}} from July to November 1999 using the eddy correlation method on two wetland types ? wet grassland and reedbeds ? in south west England. The evaporative water use of a reed bed exceeded that of the grassland wetland by 15 % (or 50 mm over the 5 months). The evaporation rates at both sites exceed of the Penman Potential Evaporation estimates calculated for this area. The difference between sites results from the higher roughness length of the reed bed and the lower effective surface resistance of the reed/open water assemblage. At the grassland site, {{a significant relationship between}} the surface resistance and water table level has been demonstrated. The water table at this site is managed to maintain the plant diversity and allow some agricultural access. This regime specifies a water table below the surface during the summer period, which results in higher surface resistances and lower evaporation. The results have important implications for local water resources management, especially where wetlands are maintained by pumping from rivers or groundwater.

30|$|Single {{crystalline}} {{zinc oxide}} (ZnO) nanowires are usually grown by <b>wet</b> chemical and <b>vapour</b> transport methods. The latter are performed at {{temperatures in the}} 850 to 1400 °C range [1, 2]. Lower temperature (400 °C) metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxial growth of vertically well-aligned ZnO nanorods has been also reported in [3]. Another kind of nanowires, Si and GaAs, are grown by vapour-liquid-solid deposition (VLS) using gold nanoparticle catalysts [4, 5]. Notably, III to V nano-whiskers have been grown on III to V substrates by metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) [6, 7]. This approach relies on annealing a thin Au film to form the seed particles [8]. In this way, a homogeneous whisker width distribution is obtained, the mean size {{of which could be}} controlled by the thickness of the Au layer and the way this layer transforms to nanoparticles. A similar approach to form ZnO nanostructures is reported herein, but using r.f. magnetron sputtering in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions, as a first step towards size-, shape- and position-controlled nanowires, similarly to what Samuelson and coworkers [9] started in GaAs in 2001. Our approach aims at obtaining nanostructures with low level of impurities for future studies on the correlation between defects and transport and photonic properties.|$|R
40|$|Small scale {{geothermal}} {{power generation}} has, until recently, been inhibited by {{the relatively high}} cost of the power plant. Developments {{in the design and}} manufacture of screw machines have made it possible to modify standard mass produced air compressors to act as expanders in place of turbines in ORC units of up to approximately 500 kWe output. Such machines have adiabatic efficiencies close to those of turbines of similar output but with a number of advantages. These include the ability to enhance the cycle efficiency by admitting <b>wet</b> <b>vapour,</b> direct coupling to standard 3 -phase generators, and the elimination of traditional lubricating systems. Combining them with standard heat exchangers has made it possible to manufacture small ORC systems for cost effective power production at outputs of as little as 20 - 50 kWe. An experimental unit, containing all these features, has been designed, built and tested. Preliminary results showed good agreement with performance predictions with the screw expander achieving an adiabatic efficiency of 74 % at an output of only 22 kW. This compares well with turbines of similar power. A detailed design study has shown that a 50 kW air cooled system, receiving heat from brine at only 100 oC can be built and installed for a total cost of only $ 1500 - 2, 000 /kWe of net output, if water cooled and approximately $ 2, 500 /kWe of net output if air cooled. Extrapolating these figures to a 200 kW unit, it is estimated that such screw driven ORC units are 30 % cheaper than recently publicized low cost, turbine driven systems...|$|E
40|$|Comparison of {{material}} usage {{and cost of}} two types of cross-flow steam condensers is reported in this study {{which can be used}} for water desalination in conjunction with a parabolic trough solar energy concentrator plant. Traditional shell and tube condensers (where steam flows inside the tubes) and surface condensers (where steam flows in the shell and cooling water flows in the tubes) are considered in this study. It has been found that the energy production from the PTC of dimensions 4. 5 m × 4. 8 m with an aperture area of 21. 6 m 2 was 19. 4 kW. It has been calculated that the distilled water production capacity of the solar energy harnessing system per day is 55. 6 l, assuming solar irradiance to be 0. 9 kW m- 2 and the efficiency of solar energy harnessing system as 50 % if the sun is available for four hours. The cooling water input temperature was assumed to be 30 °C. The minimum length required for a SS 304 tube of Ø 9. 5 mm was 7. 16 m for the traditional condenser and 1. 30 m for the surface condenser. The efficiency of the traditional condenser reduced due to the formation of a condensed water layer {{on the surface of the}} tube, as it acts as a thermal barrier. However, in the surface condenser, efficiency was enhanced due to easy condensation while increasing the system pressure. Further, efficiency is enhanced due to density separation of <b>wet</b> <b>vapour</b> by changing the flow direction near the wet sump. Fabrication cost and maintenance cost are also found to be less in the surface condenser. As such, it can be concluded that use of surface condenser is the most cost effective method, which uses a smaller amount {{of material}} making the condenser smaller and lighter...|$|E

40|$|The sensor is {{a device}} that {{converts}} a form of energy concerning which the information is sought, called the measurand, to a form (electrical) in which it can be usefully processed or interpreted. Sensors rely on physical or chemical phenomena and materials where those phenomena appear to be useful. Those phenomena may concern the material itself or its geometry. Hence, the major innovations in sensors come from new materials, new fabrication techniques or both. Normally, thin film sensors are realized by depositing a sensing film on a suitable substrate. There could be many combination of metals and insulating materials being deposited depending upon the application or sensing requirements. In general, sensors for various applications are fabricated {{using a variety of}} liquid phase technologies (also called as wet methods) and gas phase technologies (also called as dry methods) of deposition. Hence sensor fabrication technology requires various combination of processing technologies and newer materials. In the present work, an attempt is made to design and fabricate a thin film based pressure sensor using a combination of wet and dry deposition techniques. The diaphragm, used for sensing the pressure is coated with a hard anodic coating (Al 2 O 3) using a wet technology, viz. pulse hard anodizing technique, for electrical insulation requirement. The piezo-resistive strain sensing films were deposited onto this coating by dry method, namely, DC Magnetron sputtering technique [...] Chapter 01 gives a brief overview of sensors, their classification, principles of sensing,characteristics, materials used in the fabrication of sensors like conductors and insulators, the components of a sensor.

40|$|A {{thermally}} grown oxide (TGO) {{such as the}} alumina scale {{formed on}} a bondcoat enhances the oxidation and corrosion resistance of thermal barrier coating (TBC) - bondcoat-superalloy substrate systems. As the external alumina scale lies between the thermal barrier coating and bondcoat, its first spallation and subsequent TBC delamination become critical. Once the external alumina scale spalls, it will spall together with the TBC, leaving the system with no temperature barrier protection. Operational factors such as thermal cycling conditions, water vapour in the oxidation atmosphere, and alloying elements comprising the bondcoat system affect alumina scale adherence. Another problem that arises {{for the majority of}} bondcoat systems, &# 946; (Ni,Pt) Al and MCrAlY (M=Metal), are rich in aluminium. This causes aluminium to diffuse into the substrate, enriching it with aluminium during service, transforming phases in the substrate alloying system. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop bondcoat materials that promote formation of a strongly adherent TGO, but have an aluminium content near the substrate composition. Cyclic oxidation experiments were performed with Ni-Al, Ni-Pt-Al, and Ni-Pt-Al-Ir alloys in dry air and air- 12 %H 2 O. Thermal cycles of 1 hr at 1200 OC and 10 minutes at 80 OC were carried out in flowing gases at a total pressure of 1 atm. Experiments in N 2 - 12 %H 2 O were performed only on Ni-Al binary alloys. Binary Ni-Al cast alloys were tested for fundamental study purposes, while Ni-Pt-Al and Ni-Pt-Al-Ir cast alloys were intended to be models for aluminide coatings, with attention focused on &# 947;+&# 947;' -Ni-(20 to 23) Al. Comparisons were made with &# 946;-Ni- 50 Al, as it forms an external alumina scale and was found to have the smallest weight loss rate during testing of binary alloys. Assessments of Pt and Pt-Ir additions, with and without hafnium, to the &# 947;+&# 947;' binary alloy were made. Compared to binary alloys, platinum was found to reduce the total weight loss caused by scale spallation. Experiments in air- 12 %H 2 O led to more rapid weight loss than in dry air. This was due to enhanced spallation. However, the degradation rate was slower than in platinum-free alloys exposed to the same atmosphere. Partial replacement of platinum with iridium was found to improve alloy scale adherence during exposure in both dry and wet air. Addition of 1 wt% hafnium was found to reduce oxide thickness and increase the oxide adherence simultaneously. The hafnium addition was essential in order to reduce spallation rate in <b>wet</b> air. Water <b>vapour</b> in the presence of oxygen generally increased the spallation rate. It weakened the oxide metal interface, causing subsequent spallation to be increased, but only if the gas had access to the alloy-scale interface.

40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{estimates}} that buildings account for 40 % {{of the global}} energy use. The IPCC believes substantial improvements to building efficiency can be implemented easily by improving building enclosures through increased levels of insulation, optimizing glazing areas and minimizing infiltration of outside air. Building enclosure design encompasses {{a wide range of}} parameters but the transport of heat, air and moisture through the enclosure is of primary importance. In predominantly cold Canadian climates, adequate thermal insulation, effective air barriers, and proper moisture control are crucial for energy savings and durability of the structure. For decades, standard construction practice in Canada dictated a polyethylene sheet behind the interior drywall layer to serve as a vapour barrier for assemblies with traditional fibre-based cavity insulation. If the polyethylene sheet was sealed carefully enough it had the added benefit of reducing air leakage. Unfortunately, vapour barriers place the emphasis on the wrong moisture transport mechanism; air leakage can have 10 times or greater the <b>wetting</b> potential than <b>vapour</b> diffusion. Regardless, code enforcement personnel continued (and continue in some areas) to require vapour barriers in all climates, all assemblies, and all occupancies. To do so, they overrule the provision in Part 5 of The National Building Code of Canada that states vapour barriers are not required if it can be shown that the uncontrolled vapour diffusion will not affect the operation of the building and systems, or {{the health and safety of}} the occupants. Foam plastic insulations perform better than fibre-based insulation in terms of the combined resistance to transmission of heat, air and vapour. This research investigated several types of open cell and closed cell spray polyurethane foam insulation in a variety of assembly configurations both in lab tests and hygrothermal simulations. The simulations were extrapolated to seven Canadian climate categories and three levels of interior relative humidity. The goal was to determine which spray polyurethane foam applications required the addition of a dedicated vapour barrier layer beyond what the foam itself could provide. The moisture content of the oriented strand board sheathing layer (OSB) in the tested and modelled assemblies was used as the performance evaluation point because during wintertime vapour drives, the wood sheathing is the most likely condensing surface. Prolonged high moisture content (greater than 20 %) in wood and wood products in wall assemblies leads to mould growth and decay. By this measure, if the wood sheathing moisture contents stay within the safe range (less than 19 %) a vapour barrier is not necessary. The results are presented in Table 7 - 4. The performance of assemblies containing closed cell spray foam was excellent for all climates and humidity levels. Their performance was equivalent to traditional wall assemblies incorporating a polyethylene sheet vapour barrier. The performance of assemblies with open cell spray foam was equivalent to traditional wall assemblies containing no vapour barrier. Open cell spray foam and fibreglass batt both require additional vapour control layers with all but the mildest Canadian climates with the lowest interior humidities. However, in those mild climates with low interior humidities, the only vapour control layer required was a medium permeance latex paint with primer. <br...|$|R
