5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling {{that it was the}} first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet of the Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
5|$|The American Chess Congress' final {{proposal}} {{was that the}} winner of a tournament {{to be held in}} New York in 1889 should be regarded as world champion for the time being, but must be prepared to face a challenge from the second or third placed competitor within a month. Steinitz wrote that he would not play in the tournament and would not challenge the winner unless the second and third placed competitors failed to do so. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not quite as planned: Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws, and Weiss then <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to his work for the Rothschild Bank, conceding the title to Chigorin.|$|E
5|$|Although 52 {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only 43 could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Riggs clinched the third pole position of his career, and his third consecutive at Lowe's Motor Speedway, {{with a time of}} 28.203 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kahne, his Evernham Motorsports teammate, and held the pole position until Riggs' lap. Kurt Busch originally qualified in third, but his car's right-rear shock absorber was found to have violated NASCAR regulations during the post-qualifying inspection because it did not bounce back. Busch was required to start from 42nd position after using a provisional. As a result, Casey Mears inherited third, Sadler fourth, and Harvick fifth. Burton, Martin, Clint Bowyer, Reed Sorenson and Johnson rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Kenseth, a Chase for the Nextel Cup driver, qualified eleventh, while Earnhardt took 16th and Kyle Busch 18th. The nine drivers who failed to qualify were Elliott, Kevin Lepage, Derrike Cope, Chad Chaffin, Hermie Sadler, Kirk Shelmerdine, Kenny Wallace (who crashed on his first timed lap), Morgan Shepherd (who elected not to set a lap time), and Carl Long (who crashed while attempting to record a timed lap). After the qualifier Riggs said that his team knew his car was good, and achieved a good draw by recording his lap time {{in the latter half of}} the session. He stated when returning to the track, his team <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into a rhythm of starting and finishing in a top position.|$|E

25|$|After {{a period}} {{fighting}} in Gallipoli, he collapsed after falling ill with dysentery and {{was put on}} a ship bound for England to recover, {{when he woke up}} he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to action as soon as possible, and asked to be let off the ship in Malta where he stayed in hospital to recover. His hospitalisation coincided with the Battle of Sari Bair, which saw a large number of his comrades killed. Upon returning to action, he was informed that his company had been chosen to hold the final lines during the evacuation of Suvla. As such, he was the penultimate man to be evacuated from Suvla Bay, the last being General Frederick Stanley Maude.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 the American Chess Congress {{started work}} on drawing up {{regulations}} {{for the future}} conduct of world championship contests. Steinitz supported this endeavor, as {{he thought he was}} becoming too old to remain world champion. The proposal evolved through many forms (as Steinitz pointed out, such a project had never been undertaken before), and resulted in the New York 1889 tournament to select a challenger for Steinitz, rather like the more recent Candidates Tournaments. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not quite as planned: Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws; and neither wanted to play a match against Steinitz – Chigorin had just lost to him, and Weiss <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to his work for the Rothschild Bank. The third prizewinner Isidore Gunsberg was prepared to play Steinitz for the title in New York, and Steinitz won their match in 1890–91. This experiment was not repeated and the 1894 match in which Steinitz lost his title was a private arrangement between the players.|$|E

I've missed out on what was a huge goal for me to accomplish in this short period of time, but still the desire I had previous to this, it's still there." [...] Essentially saying that his (relatively) slow times in the 100 and 200 meters were the result of too short a period to train and prepare, Thorpe announced he will continue training, setting as his (new) goal qualifying for the World Championships in 2013.|$|E

500|$|The {{conspiracy}} came {{apart when}} {{two of the}} thieves turned state evidence and Alexander was exonerated in court.

Evidence also suggests that Babcock was involved with the swindles by the corrupt Washington contractors' ring and with those who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> at Columbus Alexander, an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration. [...] In 1876 Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House under public pressure due to Babcock's unpopularity. Babcock continued in government work, and became Chief Light House Inspector.

500|$|Prior to the race, Team Penske driver Will Power was {{the points}} leader with 377 points, with his primary {{championship}} rival Dario Franchitti 42 behind in second and Scott Dixon third. Ryan Briscoe was fourth on 292 points, and Ryan Hunter-Reay was sixth points adrift in fifth position. Having dominated the previous {{running of the}} Indy Edmonton, Power felt he could repeat the success and believed it would be [...] "very competitive" [...] in the qualifying session and [...] "very tough" [...] in the race. With seven races remaining in the season after the race (two on road courses and four on oval tracks), Franchitti said he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into the championship battle after he retired with a gearbox problem in the Iowa Corn Indy 250 and hoped he would perform well in Edmonton.|$|E
500|$|When Jenette Kahn became DC {{editor in}} 1976, she redeveloped the company's {{struggling}} titles; during her tenure, the Joker would {{become one of}} DC's most popular characters. While O'Neil and Adams' work was critically acclaimed, writer Steve Englehart and penciller Marshall Rogers's eight-issue run in Detective Comics #471–476 (August 1977-April 1978) defined the Joker for decades to come with stories emphasizing the character's insanity. In [...] "The Laughing Fish", the Joker disfigures fish with a rictus grin resembling his own (expecting copyright protection), and is unable to understand that copyrighting a natural resource is legally impossible. Englehart and Rogers' work on the series influenced the 1989 film Batman, and was adapted for 1992's [...] Rogers expanded on Adams' character design, drawing the Joker with a fedora and trench coat. Englehart outlined how he understood the character by saying that the Joker [...] "was this very crazy, scary character. I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the idea of Batman fighting insane murderers at 3 a.m. under the full moon, as the clouds scuttled by." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{then joined}} Don Carthel's West Texas A University staff as a {{volunteer}} quarterbacks coach in 2006, commenting, [...] "About a year after I retired from playing, I decided that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to college, where I had the greatest time of my life, and {{to get involved with}} college football." [...] He also admitted that he was unprepared for the NFL when he was drafted back in 1998. In April 2008, ESPN described Leaf as having come to terms with his past. [...] He said at the time, [...] "When playing football became a job, it lost its luster for me. I kind of got out of the spotlight, and life's never been this good." [...] But in November 2008 he was put on indefinite leave, and resigned the next day, from his coaching position at West Texas A for allegedly asking one of his players for a pill to help him deal with pain in his wrist from past injuries. Leaf's usage of painkillers dates back to 2002, when he took Vicodin from a boxing promoter after attending a match in Las Vegas. Leaf described the event as what [...] "started about an eight-year run of off-and-on Opioid abuse that took my life to the very bottom".|$|E
500|$|According to Cynthia Lennon, {{when the}} group walked past the Maharishi {{on the way to}} their taxis he looked [...] "very biblical and {{isolated}} in his faith". The Maharishi reportedly said, [...] "Wait, talk to me". After leaving the ashram, the taxis kept breaking down, leading the Beatles to wonder if the Maharishi had placed a curse on them. The car that the Lennons were in suffered a flat tyre and the driver left them, apparently to find a replacement tyre, but did not return for hours. After it grew dark the Lennons hitchhiked a ride to Delhi and took the first available flight back to London, during which John drunkenly recounted a litany of his numerous infidelities to Cynthia. The Harrisons were not ready to go home, so they travelled to other Indian cities and spent time with Ravi Shankar. Harrison said when he got dysentery he thought it might have been due to a spell cast by the Maharishi, but he recovered after Shankar gave him some amulets. Harrison later said he had never intended to stay for {{the second half of the}} course in Kashmir and that he thought Lennon <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to his relationship with Ono.|$|E

Mark also noticed that Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) had taken an interest in Kate and he did not like the idea of Kate moving on with Kyle. McGregor explained that Mark thought Kyle was an idiot and when he saw him with Kate, it forced Mark {{to come up with a}} plan to get closer to his ex-girlfriend. McGregor said, [...] "He comes up with a reason to summon her to the station - which Kate sees right through!" [...] Mark later asked Lucas for his advice, but Lucas was not much help. Both Kate and Mark <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> together and Brewer said, [...] "They both have a lot of history, such as the lie that Kate told to protect Rebecca and then Mark does something which really hurts Kate, and this prevents them from moving forward."

500|$|... "You're Gonna Love Tomorrow" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by Larry Shaw. Filming for the episode was scheduled to begin on July7,2008. The episode {{is the first to}} fully employ the five-year jump, which was introduced in the final two minutes of the fourth season finale. While developing the fifth season, Cherry began brainstorming ways to revamp the series. He stated: [...] "The soap tends to build up, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to where we were that very first season, where it's just the problems of some ordinary women and they were small and relatable." [...] Cherry credits the producers of Lost for the idea of the time jump. The writers hoped the time jump would also help them avoid repeating mistakes they made during the show's poorly received second season, during which they relied heavily on storylines from the previous season. Cherry said that the time jump would be permanent, with executive producer Bob Daily clarifying that some brief flashback scenes would be used to enhance the storytelling and provide context for current plot lines. [...] Cherry had originally wanted to do a ten-year jump, mostly to age the young characters into their teenage years in order to open up more storyline possibilities.|$|E
500|$|Odubade {{opted to}} stay at Eastbourne Borough ahead of the 2005–06 season, and {{subsequently}} started in the club's {{first game of the}} season, scoring the only goal of the game in a 1–0 away win against Bishop's Stortford. Odubade scored his second goal of the season a week later, scoring the opening goal of the match as Eastbourne lost 3–2 against Basingstoke Town, as well as scoring in the club's 2–1 home loss to Weston-Super-Mare. After scoring three goals in the club's first five matches of the season, Odubade failed to score again until November 2005 – scoring Eastbourne's goal in a 1–1 draw against Carshalton Athletic. He also scored and assisted a goal in the club's 3–2 away victory against Farnborough Town at Cherrywood Road. Odubade impressed in the club's FA Cup run during the same season, helping the club take Oxford United to a replay in November 2005. After impressing Oxford manager Brian Talbot in the two ties, Odubade joined Oxford two months later for a fee of £25,000 on an 18-month contract. On joining Oxford, Odubade said [...] "It brings a tear to my eye just the thought of leaving Eastbourne. But I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into the Football League and I just feel I am very lucky to have this second chance". In total, Odubade played 40 times for Eastbourne Borough in all competitions, scoring 20 goals.|$|E
500|$|On May 30, 2010—five {{years to}} the day after Holloway's disappearance—Stephany Flores Ramírez, a 21-year-old {{business}} student, was reported missing in Lima, Peru. She was found dead three days later in a hotel room registered in Van der Sloot's name. On June 3, Van der Sloot was arrested in Chile on a murder charge and extradited to Peru the next day. On June 7, Peruvian authorities said that Van der Sloot confessed to killing Flores after he lost his temper because she accessed his laptop without permission and found information linking him to Holloway. Police chief César Guardia related that Van der Sloot told Peruvian police that he knew where Holloway's body was and offered to help Aruban authorities find it. However, Guardia stated that the interrogation was limited to their case in Peru, and that questions about Holloway's disappearance were avoided. On June 11, Van der Sloot was charged in Lima Superior Court with first-degree murder and robbery. On June 15, Aruban and Peruvian authorities announced an agreement to cooperate and allow investigators from Aruba to interview Van der Sloot at Miguel Castro Castro prison in Peru. In a September 2010 interview from the prison, Van der Sloot reportedly admitted to the extortion plot, stating: [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> at Natalee's family—her parents have been making my life tough for five years." [...] On January 11, 2012, Van der Sloot pleaded guilty to murdering Ramírez and was sentenced to 28 years in prison.|$|E
