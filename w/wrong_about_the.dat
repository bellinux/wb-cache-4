He filled in details of Lake Tanganyika, Lake Mweru, and the course of many rivers, especially the upper Zambezi, and his observations enabled large regions to be mapped which previously had been blank. Even so, the farthest north he reached was {{the north end of}} Lake Tanganyika – still south of the Equator – and he did not penetrate the rainforest of the River Congo any further downstream than Ntangwe near Misisi.|$|E
25|$|Most {{historians and}} medical experts {{now believe that}} Garfield {{probably}} would have survived his wound had the doctors attending him been more capable. Unfortunately for Garfield, most American doctors of the day {{did not believe in}} anti-sepsis measures or the need for cleanliness to prevent infection. Several inserted their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet, and one doctor punctured Garfield's liver in doing so. Also, self-appointed chief physician D. Willard Bliss had supplanted Garfield's usual physician, Jedediah Hyde Baxter. Bliss and the other doctors who attended Garfield had guessed <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> path of the bullet in Garfield's body. They had erroneously probed rightward into Garfield's back instead of leftward, missing the location of the bullet but creating a new channel which filled with pus. The autopsy not only discovered this error but revealed pneumonia in both lungs and a body that was filled with pus due to uncontrolled septicemia.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{or perhaps}} because of the Bitburg controversy, in 1985 a {{campaign}} had been started to build a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust in Berlin. It was felt by at least some Germans that there was something <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Chancellor and the President of the United States honoring the memory of the SS men buried at Bitburg while there was no memorial to any of the people killed in the Holocaust. The campaign to build a Holocaust memorial, which Germany until then lacked, was given a major boost in November 1989 by the call by television journalist Lea Rosh to build the memorial at the site for the former Gestapo headquarters. In April 1992, the City of Berlin finally decided that a Holocaust memorial could be built. Along the same lines, in August 1987, protests put a stop to plans by the City of Frankfurt to raze the last remains of the Frankfurt Jewish Ghetto in order to redevelop the land, arguing that the remnants of the Frankfurt ghetto needed to be preserved.|$|E
500|$|Cotton {{had not yet}} {{given up}} on his parishioner. With the {{permission}} of the court, Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at his home, where the recently arrived Reverend John Davenport was also staying. [...] All week the two ministers worked with her and, under their supervision, she had written out a formal recantation of her unsound opinions that had formerly brought objection. [...] Hutchinson stood at the next meeting, on Thursday, 22 March, and read her recantation in a subdued voice to the congregation. [...] She admitted to having been <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> soul and spirit, <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> resurrection of the body, wrong in prophesying the destruction of the colony, wrong in her demeanour toward the ministers, and, most remarkably, agreed that sanctification could be evidence of justification (a covenant of works) [...] "as it flowes from Christ and is witnessed to us by the Spirit". [...] Had the trial ended there, she would have likely remained in good standing with the Boston church, and had the possibility of returning some day.|$|E

Most typically, he appears as an ideological combatant. He seems to be selling himself to the nation's conservatives as an attractive spokesman. He's got enough talent to do it.

[...] However he is less impressed with Bates's remarks about the [...] "intellectual inferiority" [...] of the natives, and observes that Bates was <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fertility of tropical soils, which are often poor: the luxuriant growth results from rapid recycling of nutrients.

500|$|When Linnaeus reached Harderwijk, {{he began}} working towards a degree immediately; at the time, Harderwijk was known for {{awarding}} [...] "instant" [...] degrees after {{as little as a}} week. First he handed in a thesis on the cause of malaria he had written in Sweden, which he then defended in a public debate. His dissertation, submitted on 23 June, was titled Dissertatio medica inauguralis in qua exhibetur hypothesis nova de febrium intermittentium causa ("Inaugural thesis in medicine, in which a new hypothesis on the cause of intermittent fevers is presented"). He concluded that malaria arose only in places with clay-rich soil. He is now known to have been <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cause, not having a microscope good enough to see malarial parasites, which were spread by mosquitoes breeding in the water that collected in ruts and puddles. But he was right in predicting that traditional Chinese medicine, including the use of wormwood (Artemisia), is a potential source of antimalarial drugs; Artemisinins, derived from wormwood, are now the principal antimalarial drugs.|$|E

500|$|By June1995 Williamson {{brought the}} Scary Movie script to his agent, Rob Paris, {{to put out}} for sale. Paris warned him {{that the level of}} {{violence}} and gore in his script would make it [...] "impossible" [...] to sell. [...] Following the script's purchase by Miramax, Williamson was required to remove much of the gorier content, such as graphic depictions of the internal organs of gutted murder victims [...] "rolling" [...] down their legs. However, once Craven was secured as director, he was able to bring much of the excised content back. Williamson was going to remove a scene in the school bathroom featuring Sidney, as he felt it was awkward and out of place in the film. Craven insisted the scene should remain, as he felt it developed the character and her relationship with her deceased mother. [...] Williamson later confirmed that he was glad that Craven proved him <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> scene. Dimension Films head Bob Weinstein realized while reviewing the script that there were thirty pages (approximately thirty on-screen minutes) without a murder, so he instructed Williamson to have another character killed.|$|E
