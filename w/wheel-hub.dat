2500|$|No.72 Fenchurch was {{purchased}} by the Bluebell Railway in 1964. After much initial use, the locomotive was retired for overhaul in 1970, and returned to traffic in 1972 for its centenary. [...] However, it was withdrawn in 1975, and with a new firebox re-entered service in 1980, running until 1988. At its next overhaul, the need to replace one pair of the original wrought iron wheels due to the detection of cracks in a <b>wheel-hub</b> meant the locomotive was not returned to traffic until 2001. [...] Although carrying an A1X boiler, the smokebox was rebuilt during that overhaul such that it now looks very similar to its original A1 form.|$|E

60|$|Martin {{had learned}} the {{contrivance}} from Joe at the Shelly Hot Springs. The old <b>wheel-hub,</b> fixed {{on the end of}} the upright pole, constituted the plunger. Making this, in turn, fast to the spring-pole attached to the kitchen rafters, so that the hub played upon the woollens in the barrel, he was able, with one hand, thoroughly to pound them.|$|E
50|$|For their Ultra-Lightweight class (50 cc) Grand Prix race bikes {{during the}} 1964, 1965 and 1966 race seasons, Honda re-introduced the 1920s format of cable-actuated caliper rim brakes with shoes/blocks {{directly}} {{acting on the}} aluminium rim-sides (alloy wheel rim), creating almost a 'consumable' item from the wheels, but dispensing with heavy conventional brake components, and allowing for experimentation with lightweight airflow-smoothing discs covering the <b>wheel-hubs</b> and centre-part of the spokes.|$|R
5000|$|There are two Swift Folder frames, one is low-volume Chromoly {{manufacturing}} by Human Powered Machines of Eugene, Oregon, {{which also}} makes work bikes and trailers. The other is manufactured from TIG welded aluminium alloy in Taiwan and marketed by Xootr, while the fork is [...] "chromoly" [...] steel. The frame is generally built to common [...] "industry-standard" [...] sizes and threads, and can accommodate {{a wide variety}} of gear systems, brakes and other components. The rear fork spacing can accommodate most standard road and mountain bike <b>wheel-hubs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Winlaton {{was once}} at {{the centre of the}} local steel industry. Ambrose Crowley, a Quaker nail-manufacturer, moved in 1691 to Winlaton. He set up {{furnaces}} and forges there and on the River Derwent at Winlaton Mill. The river was ideally suitable for tempering steel, as the sword-makers of Shotley Bridge also found. Crowley not only produced high-quality nails, but also iron goods such as pots, hinges, <b>wheel-hubs,</b> hatchets and edged tools. He could also make heavy forgings, such as chains, pumps, cannon carriages and anchors up to four tons in weight. The Crowley works were regarded as the largest manufactory of the kind in Europe. The gates for Buckingham Palace were also forged in Winlaton.|$|R
50|$|One Rooikat {{was turned}} into a {{conventional}} vehicle electric drive technology demonstrator (CVED) and displayed at AAD2006 in Cape Town in September of that year. The CVED project involved LMT, HIT, IAD, Nezrotek, Hotchinson (France), Kessler Magnet Motor (Germany) and MTU (Germany). VEG Magazine reported in 2006 the vehicle was fitted with a power supply control system feeding eight <b>wheel-hub</b> mounted M67/0 electric units and a two-phase pneumatic gearbox.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} in detail a computational {{investigation of a}} newly-conceived scheme of hydraulic active racing motorcycle suspension and its design application based on a computer-aided control of damping fluid. Through ad hoc tests on a full-scale model setup and the theoretical approach of a non linear 8 th-order suspension scheme, this study gives enhancement of the damping fluid active control on the feedback branch of the entire control system for significant improvement of the suspension response to typical road inputs. Briefly, the fluid flow in suspension dampers - generated through well-suited high-pressure hydraulic circuit - shall be conveniently controlled in direction and magnitude by a linear regulator system which is capable to start up - timely concatenated - a solenoid valves-set in order to realize the prescribed relationship between the damping load and the (proportional and time-dependent) variation of fluid flow. A set of two accelerometers, <b>wheel-hubs</b> positioned, shall {{be used by the}} linear digital regulator for feedback control of the solenoid valves working...|$|R
5000|$|The PowerCore SunCruiser is a solar-powered {{road vehicle}} of the Bochum University of applied Sciences, {{which was built}} to compete at the World Solar Challenge in 2013.

50|$|Lauda charged {{after the}} 4 runners {{ahead of him}} and he climbed to 4th after Hunt had a <b>wheel-hub</b> failure and retired on the 11th lap; {{and then he was}} able to inherit 3rd after he passed Pryce, who had fuel leaking into his cockpit and could not drive at race pace. Reutemann, who was almost 2 minutes ahead of Laffite, who was nearly a minute ahead of Lauda - held onto the lead to record his only victory of the year; and became the first (and so far last) Argentine driver since Juan Manuel Fangio to win the German Grand Prix. Laffite {{finished}} second, which equalled the struggling Williams team's highest ever finish with Piers Courage in 1969; and Depailler, whom Lauda had been fighting for the lead with earlier and was a lap down in 9th place- caught up to and started to push Lauda and attempted unsuccessfully to unlap himself; he finished close behind Lauda's ill-handling 3rd-placed Ferrari. Pryce finished an excellent 4th, followed by Australian future world champion Alan Jones in Graham Hill's Embassy-Hill car, with Dutch Le Mans winner Gijs Van Lennep in an Ensign rounding out the last points finishing slot in 6th place.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the study of bolted joints undergoing fretting damage. The analysis has been prompted by an investigation into failures of <b>wheel-hub</b> assemblies in earth moving equipment. In such applications, premature failures of the wheels initiating at the <b>wheel-hub</b> connection is observed in service. Fretting fatigue and wear induced by flexural loading at the <b>wheel-hub</b> bolted joints are often deemed to be responsible for damage initiation and crack propagation. Ad hoc analytical formulations have been developed and implemented by the authors in order to capture the mechanisms which govern these phenomena. In this article we present a semi-analytical boundary element modelling technique, which combined with contact asymptotic techniques (BEM/CA) can be employed to assess the strength of bolted connections subjected to flexural loadings...|$|E
40|$|Concepts for {{electric}} mobility {{differ significantly from}} today's conventionally powered vehicles. Therefore they create new boundary conditions for those systems. The batteries and electric motors of these vehicles and their mechanical, thermal and electric characteristics {{have an effect on}} the development process. In this paper the process chain is shown from the load assumptions to the validation process through the example of a <b>wheel-hub</b> motor as a traction concept. Computational and experimental procedures for structural durability approval are described...|$|E
40|$|The complex {{design and}} loading {{conditions}} of the <b>wheel-hub</b> assembly and decisive safety demands make it necessary to proof the wheel fasteners under reliable, service-like testing conditions. In this paper main parameters, the function and fatigue life of wheel fasteners and consequences for testing are described and discussed. The test procedure {{is based on the}} Biaxial Wheel Test Method, whereby the existing load program "Eurocyclex" was extended by additional braking and torsional force sequences. The test requirement and some typical test results are presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{electric}} vehicles with wheel hub drives, fault tolerance of the drives is a desirable feature. This paper reports on design, implementation and tests of a fault tolerant multiphase <b>wheel-hub</b> drive system. Most suitable topologies of motor and converter are selected, and a model-based fault detection is described. In addition, {{the handling of}} faults {{in order to avoid}} unwanted braking or oscillating torque is discussed. The complete fault-tolerant wheel hub drive is tested on a test bench, and experimental results from a test in a concept car demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution...|$|E
40|$|The Influence of Fretting Corrosion on the Fatigue Life of <b>Wheel-Hub</b> Assemblies of Commercial Vehicles. The {{phenomena}} of fretting corrosion is influencing the fatigue behavior or {{the reduction of}} fatigue material properties of assembly interconnections. The following text shows the general effects of fretting fatigue on specimen. Results {{of the behavior of}} two different materials under constant and variable amplitude loading are shown as well as the influence of the design of the wheel-hub-assembly of commercial vehicles. For the simulation of operational field usage the biaxial wheel test procedure was used...|$|E
40|$|As {{fatigue damage}} {{is a local}} phenomenon, the design of {{components}} must put emphasis on local supportable stress/strain values. In critical areas of components, because of local stress/strain concentrations and appertaining stress/strain gradients, much higher local values can be allowed than the usual design data obtained with unnotched specimens. Only the knowledge of these local values can realize light-weight design exploiting the material limits. Using component examples like pressure vessels, gears and <b>wheel-hub</b> assemblies, different variants of local concepts, i. e. strain and stress based methods, are presented for assessing their structural durability. For this, an interaction of numerical and experimental procedures, supported by experience, is necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} of the existing components, which are built of several adjacent components (wheel, hub, bearings, bolts etc.), can change greatly the properties, above all due {{to the influence of}} neighbouring components with differing levels of rigidity, changing pre-tension ratios of the bolt and shrinkage fit connections, different thicknesses of the layers of paint and different temperatures. The complex, coincidental, multi-axial loads negatively affect the durability, which can lead to various failure mechanisms. With the help of standardised, accelerated load programmes and incorporating special event loads, the experimental simulation in 2 and 4 axial <b>wheel-hub</b> test rigs (Biaxial Wheel Test Rig) is performed in order to find an optimum solution in the early development phases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPure {{electric}} vehicle {{has become the}} representative of new energy source auto because of its low level of environmental pollution, noise, high efficiency, availability of multiple energy resources, and ability of energy feedback. Pure {{electric vehicle}} is driven by motor, with no reduction gears in the scope of fixed torque and fixed power. It can also generate torque in the low speed scope, and can work under the way of fixed power using field-weakening control in the high speed scope. This paper analyzes {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of traditional drive mode, motor-driving axle combined drive mode, motor-driving axle integrated drive mode, and <b>wheel-hub</b> motor drive mode. The electric wheel driving vehicle gradually becomes a new direction of pure electric vehicle relying on its great advantage in the 4 driving modes...|$|E
40|$|Flexible-wheel (FW) {{suspension}} {{concept has}} been regarded {{to be one}} of the novel technologies for future planetary surface vehicles (PSVs). This study develops generalised models for fundamental stiffness and damping properties and power consumption characteristics of the FW suspension with and without considering <b>wheel-hub</b> dimensions. Compliance rolling resistance (CRR) coefficient is also defined and derived for the FW suspension. Based on the generalised models and two dimensionless measures, suspension properties are analysed for two FW suspension configurations. The sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effects of the design parameters and operating conditions on the CRR and power consumption characteristic of the FW suspension. The modelling generalisation permits analyses of fundamental properties and power consumption characteristics of different FW suspension designs in a uniform and very convenient manner, which would serve as a theoretical foundation for the design of FW suspensions for future PSVs...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of railway vehicles {{depends on the}} wheelset configuration, i. e. solid axle wheelset or independently rotating wheels (IRWs). The self-centring behaviour, peculiar of the solid axle wheelset, makes this kind of wheelset very suitable for tangent track running at low speed: {{the absence of the}} self-centring mechanism in the IRWs may lead to anomalous wheel/rail wear, reduced vehicle safety and passengers’ discomfort. On the contrary, during negotiation of the sharp curves typical of urban tramways, solid axle wheelsets produce lateral contact forces higher than those of IRWs. This paper illustrates an electronic differential system to be applied to tramcar bogies equipped with <b>wheel-hub</b> motors which allows switching from solid axle in tangent track to IRWs in sharp curve (and vice versa). An electro-mechanical vehicle model is adopted for the design of the control system and for the evaluation of the vehicle dynamic performances...|$|E
40|$|Electric vehicle {{power train}} {{concepts}} with <b>wheel-hub</b> or close-to-wheel propulsion {{open up a}} whole new area of vehicle control possibilities. The DLR robotic concept vehicle ROMO allows the evaluation of these possibilities using integrated chassis control. With its electric drive train it is possible to recuperate kinetic energy during braking process. Using only the electric motors for braking, an increased mass of electric drives & energy storage would be necessary in order to comply to legal passenger vehicle braking regulations. Therefore, the combination of friction based brake and electric motor brake can be advantageous. In this paper, object oriented models (Modelica) of a permanent magnet synchronous machine driven electro-hydraulic disc brake and an in-wheel direct driven traction motor are presented. Furthermore, two torque blending algorithms of an electro-hydraulic disc brake and an in-wheel permanent magnet synchronous machine are evaluated. One algorithm is based on a dynamic control allocation using real-time capable quadratic programming, the other is a feed forward control based on heuristic considerations. Finally, four comparison methods are presented and applied to evaluate the performance of the used torque blending...|$|E
