5|$|The Germans finally flanked the American {{forces at}} dusk, {{capturing}} them. Only one American, a forward artillery observer, was killed, while 14 were wounded: German casualties totaled 92. The Germans paused, believing the woods {{were filled with}} more Americans and tanks. Only when SS-Standartenführer Joachim Peiper and his Panzer tanks arrived at midnight, twelve hours behind schedule, did the Germans learn the nearby woods <b>were</b> <b>empty.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 1917, the German Army began a {{withdrawal}} from its {{positions in the}} Somme sector to the Hindenburg Line. Gellibrand was in temporary command of the 2ndDivision, which at this time was opposite the village of Warlencourt. Patrols from the 6thInfantry Brigade found Warlencourt empty and occupied it unopposed. The 24thInfantry Battalion kept {{in contact with the}} Germans as they pulled back. On 13 March, the 24thInfantry battalion—now responsible for the entire brigade front—found Grévillers empty and occupied it. By 17 March 1917, the trenches in front of Bapaume <b>were</b> <b>empty</b> and the 6thInfantry Brigade occupied its northern suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Implacable {{launched}} strikes {{every two}} and a quarter hours {{for the remainder of}} 14 June. These generally comprised five Avengers armed with bombs and four Fireflies with rockets and cannon. The final attack of the day was made by twelve Seafires which dive-bombed fuel tanks on Moen island. While several of the tanks were cracked open, it appeared that they <b>were</b> <b>empty.</b> This attack {{was the first time that}} Seafires had been used as fighter bombers in the Pacific. The British aircraft were fired on by Japanese anti-aircraft guns throughout the day, and reported finding few worthwhile targets. All of the strikes were escorted by Seafires, but no Japanese aircraft were encountered in the air. During the night of 14/15 June two Avengers operated over the atoll in an attempt to prevent the Japanese from repairing the airfield on Moen; these aircraft were fired on and tracked by searchlights but did not suffer any casualties.|$|E

5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that <b>were</b> <b>empty</b> lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlements in}} the middle Mississippi Valley {{were built in the}} 10th century by the people of the Mississippian culture, who constructed more than two dozen platform mounds within the area of the future European-American city. These were related {{to the center of the}} culture at the very large complex of Cahokia Mounds, on the east side of the Mississippi River. The Mississippian culture ended for unknown reasons in the 14th century and these sites <b>were</b> <b>empty</b> for some time. Siouan-speaking groups such as the Missouria and the Osage migrated from the eastern Ohio Valley to the Missouri Valley. They lived in villages along the Missouri and Osage rivers. Both groups competed with northeastern tribes such as the Sauk and the Meskwaki, and all four groups confronted the earliest European explorers of the middle Mississippi Valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{tax system}} was {{partially}} reformed in 1881, allowing for direct payment of road taxes instead of relying totally on the statute-labor system. The first road district {{larger than the}} township level was created in Bay County in 1883 under Public Act278. This road district encompassed eight townships and provided for better coordination and planning of road construction. Other county systems were created in 1893 with passage of legislation which allowed other counties to {{follow the lead of}} Bay County. By 1900, the plank roads were generally abandoned. While a few were still in good repair, most consisted of rotting logs with intermittent patches of gravel. Toll houses <b>were</b> <b>empty</b> shacks, and the ditches were clogged with duck ponds. Only 23 of the original 202plank roads chartered by the state were still in operation.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its history, Tell Brak was an {{important}} trade center; it was an enterpot of obsidian trade during the Chalcolithic, as it was situated on the river crossing between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. The countryside was occupied by smaller towns, villages and hamlets, but the city's surroundings <b>were</b> <b>empty</b> within three kilometers. This was {{probably due to the}} intensive cultivation in the immediate hinterland, in order to sustain the population. The city manufactured different objects, including chalices made of obsidian and white marble, faience, flint tools and shell inlays. However, evidence exists for a slight shift in production of goods toward manufacturing objects desired in the south, following the establishment of the Uruk colony.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the advance units of the Leningrad Front arrived at Tallinn early on 22 September, German troops had {{practically}} abandoned {{the city and the}} streets <b>were</b> <b>empty.</b> The last German unit to leave Tallinn that morning was the 531st Navy Artillery Battalion. Before embarkation, all stationary artillery and armaments, special equipment, guns that could not be evacuated, ammunition, the telephone exchange, the radio broadcast house, locomotives and railroad cars, and the railway were destroyed. The Tallinn power plant was fired upon from the sea and the Old City Harbour was destroyed. The retreating German units had no combat contact with the Red Army in Tallinn. The Government of Estonia had failed to concentrate the Estonian soldiers retreating from the Narva and Emajõgi fronts, as the units were scattered and mixed with the German detachments withdrawing towards Latvia. Therefore, the government lacked significant military forces to repulse the Soviet forces concentrated around Tallinn. The units securing the national capital and the government were led by Rear Admiral Johan Pitka. Troops of the Leningrad Front seized Tallinn on 22 September. Jüri Uluots, acting President of Estonia, evacuated to Sweden. In the following days, several pro-independence Estonian battle groups attacked the Soviet troops in Harju and Lääne counties without success.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, Convair (then still Consolidated-Vultee) {{developed}} streamlined pods, {{looking like}} oversize drop tanks, that were mounted {{on each side}} of the B-36's fuselage to carry spare engines between bases.

More than two million pesos were owed to the troops. Whole units lacked adequate uniforms and boots. Armament was in a bad state and there was a shortage of horses.|$|E
25|$|The German 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment, 3rd Fallschirmjäger Division finally flanked and {{captured}} the American platoon at dusk, when they ran low on ammunition and {{were planning to}} withdraw.

25|$|If {{the lock}} <b>were</b> <b>empty,</b> the boat {{would have had}} to wait 5 to 10 minutes while the lock was filled. For a boat {{travelling}} upstream, the process is reversed; the boat enters the empty lock, and then the chamber is filled by opening a valve that allows water to enter the chamber from the upper level. The whole operation will usually take between 10 and 20 minutes, {{depending on the size of}} the lock and whether the water in the lock was originally set at the boat's level.|$|E
25|$|Occupy Mexico did {{not achieve}} {{the level of}} {{popularity}} it gained in other areas.

In contrast, an anti-violence movement led by Javier Sicilia during the time that the Occupy protests occurred, drew thousands onto the streets of Mexico City. The Occupy Movement was almost entirely ignored by Mexico's mainstream politicians. By late January 2012, most of the tents <b>were</b> <b>empty</b> and only a few protesters remained outside the Stock Exchange.|$|E
