However, {{due to the}} invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq which took place under the Bush Administration, as well as <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>call</b> an increased anti-Muslim rhetoric from the Republican Party after the September 11 attacks, support for the Republican Party among American Muslims has declined sharply.|$|E

This figure, sometimes known as a Pashupati, has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva. If this can be validated, it would be evidence that some aspects of Hinduism predate the earliest texts, the Veda.|$|E

This period began <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>call</b> the Second Summer of Love, a movement credited with a reduction in football hooliganism: instead of fights, football fans were listening to music, taking ecstasy, and joining the other club attendees in a peaceful movement that has been compared to the Summer of Love in San Francisco in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ideology}} {{and practice of}} family honor varies from country to country. Individuals of certain cultures are often unaware or discerning in their understanding of differing cultural traditions. Many fail to grasp the concept of honor {{as the basis for}} traditions such as defending one's honor or their family's. Some cultures value family honor more than others. Many times a family's honor may overpower the actions or beliefs of the individual. However, a theme that is common within many traditions is the respecting of elders. Children of the family are to respect their elders who have earned <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>call</b> a [...] "badge of 'honor'" [...] representative of their age. Once an individual has lived throughout life for several years, they have earned this badge of honor and should be shown respect teaching their young the cultural traditions that have deemed them honorable.|$|E

Rather, each person is fit to be righteous or wicked. Jeremiah implied this in [...] "From the mouth of the Most High, neither evil nor good come forth." [...] Accordingly, sinners, themselves, cause their own loss. It is thus proper for people to mourn for their sins and for the evil consequences that they have brought upon their own souls. Jeremiah continues that since free choice is in our hands and our own decision prompts us to commit wrongs, it is proper for us to repent and abandon our wickedness, for the choice is in our hands. This is implied by [...] "Let us search and examine our ways and return [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1919 Bible Conference was a {{significant}} theological milestone, arguably the first scholarly conference in Adventist history (its attendees were the best-trained group of leaders and educators up to that time), but {{the significance of the}} discussions about Ellen White were not recognized until the rediscovery of the conference transcripts in 1973. Led by A. G. Daniells, the discussion occurred within the context of issues related to prophetic interpretation, and how to relate to change after her death. What has become known historically as the Fundamentalist movement had an influence on the 1919 Bible Conference as it was reaching its heyday during the 1920s. Many members held fundamentalist views and at conference it served to polarize Adventist theology into <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>call</b> [...] "liberal" [...] and [...] "conservative" [...] camps that continue to impact the church today. Today's views were evident at the 1919 Conference and remain today.|$|E
2500|$|In Thomas Barnett's paradigm, {{the world}} is divided into a [...] "connected core" [...] of nations enjoying {{a high level of}} {{communications}} among their organizations and individuals, and those nations that are disconnected internally and externally.

If the state is occupied, or in civil war, another paradigm comes into play: the leviathan, a first-world military force that takes down the opposition regular forces. Leviathan is not constituted to fight local insurgencies, but major forces. Leviathan may use extensive swarming at the tactical level, but its dispatch is a strategic decision that may be made unilaterally, or by an established group of the core such as NATO or ASEAN.|$|E

2500|$|In late December 2014, {{treasure}} hunting divers Kevin Dykstra and Frederick Monroe alerted {{media outlets}} {{that they found}} indisputable proof of Le Griffons location.

There are [...] "no cables, no cabin, and no smokestacks," [...] no mechanical devices of any kind, and a carving {{on the front of}} the ship strongly resembles 17th-century French carvings of griffins, Dykstra says. [...] On January 2, 2015, Frederick Monroe told an interviewer for public radio that he believed Le Griffon was built in Canada, below Niagara Falls, and brought to the upper Great Lakes. [...] He went on to say that the wreck is [...] "the one that got in the way." [...] Their claim was quickly debunked when Michigan authorities dove down on June 9, 2015 after receiving the coordinates to verify its authenticity. [...] Michigan state maritime archaeologist Wayne R. Lusardi presented evidence that the wreck was, in fact, a tugboat due to its [...] length and presence of a steam boiler.|$|E

60|$|It {{occurred}} to Wyllard that Gregory had, at least, made no great success of farming; but that occupation, as practiced on the prairie, demands {{a great deal}} more than quickness and <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>call</b> brilliancy from the man who undertakes it. He must, as they say out there, possess the capacity for staying with it--the grim courage to hold fast the tighter under each crushing blow, when the grain shrivels under the harvest frost, or when the ragged ice hurtling before a roaring blast does the reaping. It was, however, evident that this girl had an unquestioning faith in Gregory Hawtrey, and once more Wyllard felt compassionate towards her. He wondered if she would have retained her confidence had Hawtrey spent those four years in England instead of Canada, for it was clear from the contrast between her and her picture that she had grown in many ways since she had given her promise to her lover. He had said what he could in Hawtrey's favor, but now he felt that something was due to the girl.|$|E
