5|$|A new remastered and {{expanded}} version of Live And Dangerous {{was released in}} 2011. As well as the full album, remastered by Andy Pearce and Matt Wortham, it featured two additional tracks that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used,</b> and a DVD with the Rainbow Theatre footage. The sleeve notes were written by Malcolm Dome and included a debate of exactly {{how much of the}} album was live, and what was overdubbed.|$|E
5|$|According to the Luftwaffe {{order of}} battle dated 7 September, the nearest date covered by the list, the three Air Fleets {{contained}} 1,895 aircraft. Luftflotte 2 had 1,311 machines including; 533 Bf 109s, 107 Bf 110s, 51 reconnaissance and 484 medium bomber aircraft. A further 120 Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers were on the {{order of battle}}, but <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E
5|$|Additional takes of {{the song}} were {{recorded}} at De Lane Lea Studios on December 21, 1966, which closely followed the earlier arrangement. However, both Hendrix and Redding had problems with missed notes and the takes <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used,</b> except for a backing track that Hendrix later overdubbed at the Olympic Studios on March 29 or early April 1967.|$|E

5|$|At {{the first}} {{performances}} of Parsifal {{problems with the}} moving scenery during the transition from scene 1 to scene 2 in act 1 meant that Wagner's existing orchestral interlude finished before Parsifal and Gurnemanz arrived at the Hall of the Grail. Engelbert Humperdinck, who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars of music to cover this gap. In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Camillan era, {{they fought}} {{in a shallow}} phalanx formation, {{supported}} by light troops. In most battles triarii <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. They {{were meant to be}} used as a decisive force in the battle, thus prompting an old Roman saying: 'It comes down to the triarii' (res ad triarios venit), which meant carrying on to the bitter end.|$|E
5|$|Following their hiatus, which {{commenced}} {{after the}} release of , the band reconvened in late 2006 to write songs for Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. The band sought a new sound on the album, causing the recording process to be different from prior albums; Melbourne's Sing Sing studios <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> and Nick DiDia was no longer the producer.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, for example, {{the species}} almost became extinct in East Anglia, where the {{chemicals}} were most widely used; in western and northern {{parts of the}} country, where the pesticides <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used,</b> there were no declines. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds bought its Coombes Valley nature reserve in Staffordshire {{because it was the}} only Eurasian sparrowhawk breeding site left in the English Midlands.|$|E
5|$|Statistical {{analysis}} {{was applied to}} discover more specific drivers of peace. Specifically, the research team looked for indicators that were included and excluded from the index that had high levels of correlation with the overall score and rank of countries. Among the statistically significant indicators that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in the analysis were the functionality of a country's government, regional integration, hostility to foreigners, importance of religion in national life, corruption, {{freedom of the media}} and GDP per capita.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} roadway {{that became}} today's M-95 started in Sagola and run northward to M-15 (today US 41/M-28). M-45 was extended by 1927 to replace portions of M-12 that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in US 2. It {{would later be}} extended in 1932 to the state line south of Kingsford. The total of M-45 was converted to M-95 in 1934 as a realignment near Witch Lake is completed.|$|E

5|$|The team {{departed}} {{aboard the}} Rimutaka {{and during the}} voyage conducted training drills on the ship's deck; for this the forwards were coached by the team's captain, Dave Gallaher, with help from Cunningham. Vice-captain and first five-eighth Billy Stead {{was in charge of}} the backs, and consequently the services of the New Zealand Rugby Union-appointed coach Jimmy Duncan <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used.</b>|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons where the {{animation}} was produced by Film Roman. Up until this point, Film Roman had mostly worked on Garfield and Friends and Bobby's World episodes, and <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to {{the speed with which}} The Simpsons episodes were produced. However, they quickly adjusted. Film Roman went on to do the animation {{for the rest of the}} series and eventually The Simpsons Movie. Previously, the animation was produced by Klasky Csupo.|$|E
5|$|Virtually all the Turkish Army {{commander}}s, down {{to company}} commander level, were very experienced, being {{veterans of the}} Balkan Wars. But their command structure was weaker at the non-commissioned officer (NCO) level, with only one NCO in each company. One advantage that the Turkish Army had over the New Zealanders, at the time, was their hand grenades, which <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> by the British forces.|$|E

5|$|Although {{helicopters}} <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in Mozambique to {{the same}} extent as they were in Vietnam, the Alouette III was the most widely used, although the Puma was also used with great success. Other aircraft were employed: for air support the T6 and the Fiat G.91 were used; for reconnaissance, the Dornier Do 27. In the transport role, the Portuguese Air Force used mainly the Nord Noratlas and the C-47. The Portuguese Navy also made extensive use of patrol boats, landing crafts, and inflatable Zodiacs.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} in February 2007 {{placed the}} initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $3 billion, or $1,150 {{per square foot}} ($12,380 per square meter). However, the tower's total estimated construction cost had risen to $3.9 billion by April 2012, making it the most expensive building {{in the world at}} the time. The tower's construction was partly funded by approximately $1billion of insurance money that Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks. The State of New York provided an additional $250million, and the Port Authority agreed to give $1billion, which would be obtained through the sale of bonds. The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds, with a 56percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015; however, the proceeds of these increases <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to pay for the tower's construction.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi had {{selected}} {{a number of}} songs from his own record collection for the film's soundtrack, which <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in the film due to {{the high costs of}} licensing the songs. The film was initially scored by singer Dan Hicks, who became involved with the production of the film in 1974. Because of the delay of the film's release, Hicks' label released the material from these sessions under the title It Happened One Bite. When the film was released in 1982, it had been rescored by John Madara.|$|E
50|$|Almost all Protestant churches {{practice}} communion {{under both}} kinds. One marked distinction in many Protestant churches <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>using</b> a chalice for the wine, but rather individual communion cups. In some churches wine <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>used,</b> but rather grape juice (see Alcohol in Christianity).|$|R
50|$|There {{is a lack}} of Italian {{influence}} in the Maltralian dialect, unlike Standard Maltese, for example ċaw (bye) <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> but saħħa <b>is,</b> awguri <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> but nifraħlek or nixtieqlek ir-riżq are. However, these Semitic expressions are still present in Standard Maltese.|$|R

5|$|During the 1960s {{a series}} of cost {{reductions}} were introduced on the line, after major reorganizations between 1965 and 1970; the last commuter train for the workers to the plants went on 25 May 1968, while on 31 May 1970 the last passenger train {{in connection with the}} ferries went on Rjukan Line, being replaced with bus. In 1972 Norsk Transport applied to terminate passenger transport with the railway ferry, since they were operating trips with only passengers and no cargo. The application was declined by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, but in 1978 they permitted that the Saturday afternoon and Sunday departures be terminated—these <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to transport freight trains. By the mid eighties passenger numbers had fallen dramatically, and in 1985 the department gave in and permitted the termination of passenger services with Storegut and Ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong {{when he arrived}} at the fight in prime {{condition}} and with aggression, determination and desire. The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E
5|$|However Butlin did {{not remain}} celebrating for long; he {{required}} a further $2.25 million (2011:£) {{to complete the}} camp, and {{to make matters worse}} American tourists <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to the holiday camp mentality so the venture held little interest. In an attempt to save the camp, Butlin sold the hotel leases to an American firm. By November 1950, the subsidiary company handling the Caribbean resort was ordered to be wound up by a court. Butlin admitted defeat and focused his efforts back in Europe. In the late 1940s Butlin had successfully opened hotels outside the Skegness and Ayr camps, so he now saw his opportunity to expand into this market. Butlin began acquiring hotels in Saltdean, Blackpool and Cliftonville.|$|E
