Raw and broiled patties were analyzed for proximate composition, color, Instron compression and cooking loss. Broiled pork patties containing zein were evaluated by a sensory panel;Dry- and <b>wet-milled</b> germ flour addition at the 5 % level decreased cooking losses, 9 and 7. 5 %, respectively, when compared to control patties. Zein addition to ground pork reduced cooking loss 4. 2 % when compared to ground pork without zein. Corn gluten meal addition to pork did not influence yield.

One limitation of continual administration of DCU for in vivo studies is the compound's poor oral bioavailability. This phenomenon is mainly attributed to its poor dissolution rate and low aqueous solubility. Previously, <b>wet-milled</b> DCU nanosuspension {{has been reported to}} enhance the bioavailability of DCU. However, the prosperities and limitations of <b>wet-milled</b> nanosuspension have not been fully evaluated. Furthermore, the oral pharmacokinetics of DCU in rodent are such that the use of DCU to understand PK/PD relationships of sEH inhibitors in preclinical efficacy model is less than ideal. In this study, the limitation of orally delivered DCU nanosuspension was assessed by a surface area sensitive absorption model and pharmacokinetic modeling. It was found that dosing DCU nanosuspension did not provide the desired plasma profile needed for PK/PD investigation.

40|$|One of the {{intermediates}} in {{the production}} of X-ray contrast agents at GE Healthcare Lindesnes, commonly referred to as an aromatic amine, is subject to a crystallization. Crystallization parameters such as size, size distribution and morphology have a strong impact on the subsequent filtration step {{in the production}}, where aromatic amine crystals are separated from the mother liquor. Seeding is a technique that allows for control of important crystal properties. The focus of this study is how variation of seeding parameters affects the crystallization behaviour of the aromatic amine, and how this can be connected to filtration abilities. In this work, crystallization experiments have been carried out in a batch reactor followed by Nutsche filtration tests. Concentration of solute aromatic amine and chord lengths of particles have been measured through UV spectrophotometry and FBRM respectively. Samples of final crystals and filter cakes were analyzed in SEM. In general, experiments were performed in a synthetic solution based on composition data from the production. Three seeding materials form the basis of this work; untreated, <b>wet-milled</b> and dry-milled seeds respectively. All materials have been applied at varying seeding ratios: 0. 3, 1. 7 and 3. 3 g seeds/ 100 g final crystals. Extent of crystal growth was assumed independent of seeding ratio for untreated seeding. Growth on seed particles was most evident for dry-milled seeding. Secondary nucleation was most predominant for <b>wet-milled</b> seeding and was assumed proportional to seeding ratio for all applied materials. A slurry addition of dry-milled seeds resulted in a slightly better filtration performance than a dry addition. <b>Wet-milled</b> seeding yielded a better filtration performance than untreated seeding at all tested seeding ratios. In terms of total surface area of seeds, a critical point was found at 1 m^ 2 seeds/ 100 g final crystals, where average specific cake resistance was reduced significantly. Untreated seeding was performed at varying degrees of supersaturation. Seeding at a medium supersaturation indicated a high rate of secondary nucleation when no further HCl was added. A twofold increase in size of new-born crystals could be observed when seeding at a high supersaturation compared to a medium supersaturation. A transition from a synthetic to a process solution caused slightly improved filtration performances...|$|R

50|$|Even though corn <b>wet-milling</b> {{has been}} used for years to produce food products, animal feed and fuel, {{research}} in this field is still going on to make the process more and more efficient. Studies have shown that the steeping time can be decreased from 40 hours to 6-8 hours if enzymes like protease are added and the milling is modified to a two-stage procedure. This even eliminates the need of sulphur dioxide. The yield were found to be equivalent to the conventional process.In a similar study, it was shown that adding phytic acid degrading enzyme reduced the steeping time. Phytic acid is present in the corn which largely ends up in corn steep liquor. Adding phytic acid degrading enzymes along with cellulose can decrease the steeping time.Effect of drying was tested on the final yield of corn <b>wet-milling</b> and it was found that decreasing the initial moisture content of corn and increasing the drying air temperature decreased the yield.

40|$|A laboratory-scale {{process is}} {{presented}} for {{the manufacture of}} starch and gluten from wheat. Main feature {{of this process is}} that whole wheat kernels are crushed dry between smooth rolls prior to wet disintegration in excess water in such way that gluten formation is prevented and fibres can be removed by sieving. Centrifugation of the endosperm suspension yields a dough which can be separated into starch and gluten using an established batter process. The results suggest that starch recovery is increased in comparison to a conventional wheat flour process without a concomitant decrease in protein recovery. Although starch purification was omitted, a total starch with a low protein content is obtained. On the other hand, the protein content of the gluten fraction is rather low due to difficulties in removing thestarch.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{compares the}} modifications {{induced by the}} heat-moisture treatment of native starch (HMT) and by the hot-air drying of corn on <b>wet-milled</b> starch granules. High temperatures applied during both corn drying and HMT reduced the swelling capacity of granules, increased the starch gelatinization temperatures and decreased their residual enthalpy. Pasting behaviour of pre-treated starch showed a decrease of peak and breakdown viscosity when corn drying and HMT temperatures increased. Microscopic analysis showed that after hydrothermal treatment, starch granules extracted from corn dried at lower temperature swell more significantly than those extracted from corn dried at higher temperature. All these changes suggest the occurring of structural modifications within starch granules during high-temperature pre-treatments. At similar temperatures and initial moisture contents, HMT affected the physicochemical and functional properties of cornstarch more dramatically than hot-air drying. Differences induced by these two treatments were attributed to the availability of water around granules during these two pre-treatment procedures. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The study consisted of a 5 -day pre-period and two sections of 28 days each. Each of those two sections was composed of an introductory 7 -day period and three periods of 7 days each. Five kinds of bread were fed. These included the following: (1) bread with no bran supplement; (2) bread with <b>wet-milled,</b> fine-ground corn bran; (3) bread with <b>wet-milled,</b> coarse-ground corn bran; (4) bread with dry-milled, fine-ground corn bran; and (5) bread with dry-milled, coarse-ground corn bran. Results indicated that fecal transit times were shorter, fecal wet weights were greater, and fecal percent moisture was greater, for subjects when fed the wet milled rather than the dry milled brans. Electron microscopy indicated that sharper margins of dry milled brans might cause intestinal mucosa wall damage. ^ In Study II comparative effects of feeding the same corn brans on histological changes of gastrointestinal tract of 60 weanling mice were measured.

Five commercial <b>wet-milling</b> processes, namely Martin, Batter, Alfa-Laval/Raisio, Hydrocyclone and High-Pressure Disintegration (HD), have been employed to co-produce wheat starch and vital gluten. Martin and Batter are the traditional processes, whereas Alfa-Laval/Raisio, Hydrocyclone and HD are the modern-day processes. In the traditional processes, separation of starch and gluten starts with a stiff dough or batter with optimally developed gluten and proceeds with kneading and/or screening to separate starch granules from gluten mass. In the modern-day processes, however, separation starts with a sheared flour-water or dough-water dispersion with partially developed gluten and proceeds with centrifugation to separate starch granules from gluten network. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the pasting properties of starches and breadmaking qualities of vital glutens isolated from RBS- 98 wheat flour by three different laboratory <b>wet-milling</b> methods, namely highly sheared flour-water dispersion (HS-FWD), moderately sheared dough-water dispersion (MS-DWD) and dough-washing (Martin), which respectively represent the commercial <b>wet-milling</b> processes of HD, Hydrocyclone and Martin.

Because cross-linking could inhibit starch swelling and maintain starch granule integrity, the rice ball contain cross-linked rice flour could improve the texture and cooking loss. 本研究採用八十六年第二期之台梗糯一號與台中糯七十號原料米為試驗材料，以三種STMP(sodium trimetaphosphate) 濃度分別對米澱粉與溼磨米穀粉進行交鏈化反應，來探討不同交鏈化試劑濃度對米澱粉、溼磨米穀粉及其湯圓製品之影響。 在交鏈化米澱粉方面，米澱粉之交鏈化可提升其起始糊化溫度與回昇黏度，降低其裂解黏度、溶解度、膨潤力、在DMSO的溶解度與透光率。 在交鏈化溼磨米穀粉方面，米穀粉由於存在之蛋白質等成分會與交鏈化試劑STMP作用，而形成交鏈，使交鏈米穀粉之裂解黏度較交鏈化米澱粉為低。 在湯圓製品方面，蒸煮過久的湯圓，因其澱粉顆粒因過度膨潤而崩裂，使其蒸煮流失率會增加，並使湯圓質地上的硬度、膠質感與咀嚼性降低，內聚性與彈性增加。而含有部分交鏈化米穀粉的湯圓，因交鏈化能抑制澱粉顆粒的膨潤，維持澱粉顆粒的完整，故能改善造成湯圓久煮後的咀嚼性不佳等之特性。中文摘要……………………………………………………… [...] 1 英文摘要……………………………………………………… [...] 2 壹、 前言……………………………………………………… [...] 4 貳、 文獻整理………………………………………………… [...] 6 一、 稻米的分類與結構…………………………………… [...] 6 二、 交鏈澱粉……………………………………………… [...] 10 1. 交鏈化的原理…………………………………………. 10 2. 交鏈化的程序與試劑…………………………………. 10 3. 交鏈澱粉的性質………………………………………. 13 4. 影響交鏈化反應的因子………………………………. 18 5. 交鏈程度的測定………………………………………. 21 參、 研究目的………………………………………………… [...] 22 肆、 材料與方法……………………………………………… [...] 23 一、 原料…………………………………………………… 23 二、 實驗單元……………………………………………… 23 三、 實驗架構……………………………………………… 24 四、 樣品製備……………………………………………… 25 1. 溼磨米穀粉之製備…………………………………… 25 2. 米澱粉之分離………………………………………… 25 3. 交鏈化米穀粉及米澱粉之製備……………………… 25 五、 實驗方法…………………………………………… [...] . 26 1. 基本成分分析……………………………………… [...] 26 2. 理化特性分析……………………………………… [...] 26 (1) 連續糊化黏度之測定…………………………… 26 (2) 示差掃描熱分析………………………………… 27 (3) 溶解度與膨潤力的測定………………………… 27 (4) 在DMSO的溶解度…………………………… [...] 28 (5) 澱粉糊的透光率………………………………… 28 (6) 磷含量之測定…………………………………… 28 (7) 光學顯微鏡的觀察……………………………… 29 (8) 掃描式電子顯微鏡之觀察……………………… 29 3. 產品的品質評估……………………………………. 30 (1) 純湯圓的製作…………………………………… 30 (2) 含 30 %交鏈化米穀粉之湯圓的製作…………… 30 (3) 湯圓之蒸煮與蒸煮流失率的測定……………… 30 (4) 質地分析………………………………………… 31 (5) 產品色澤分析…………………………………… 31 4. 統計分析……………………………………………. 32 伍、 結果討論………………………………………………… 33 一、 STMP濃度對糯性米澱粉理化特性之影響…………. 33 1. 對米澱粉連續糊化黏度變化之影響………………. 33 2. 對米澱粉糊化行為變化之影響……………………. 38 3. 對米澱粉溶解度與膨潤力之影響 ……………… [...] . 39 4. 對米澱粉於DMSO溶解度之影響………………… 44 5. 對澱粉糊透光率之影響……………………………. 44 6. 對米澱粉光學顯微鏡照相圖之影響………………. 47 7. 對米澱粉掃描式電子顯微鏡照相圖之影響………. 47 8. 對磷含量之影響……………………………………. 52 二、 STMP濃度對糯性米穀粉理化特性之影響…………. 54 1. 對溼磨米穀粉基本化學成分之影響……………… 54 2. 對溼磨米穀粉連續糊化黏變化之影響…………… 54 3. 對溼磨米穀粉糊化行變化之影響………………… 60 4. 對溼磨米穀粉膨潤力與溶解度之影響…………… 60 三、 對湯圓產品品質的影響………………………………. 64 1. 對湯圓產品質地上之影響………………………… 64 2. 對湯圓產品蒸煮流失率之影響…………………… 67 3. 對湯圓產品色澤上之影響………………………… 69 陸、 結論………………………………………………………. 71 柒、 參考文獻…………………………………………………. 7...|$|R
40|$|Preparation of drug {{nanoparticles}} via {{wet media}} milling (nanomilling) {{is a very}} versatile drug delivery platform and is suitable for oral, injectable, inhalable, and buccal applications. Wet media milling followed by various drying processes has become a well-established and proven formulation approach especially for bioavailability enhancement of poorly water-soluble drugs. It has several advantages such as organic solvent-free processing, tunable and relatively high drug loading, and applicability to a multitude of poorly water-soluble drugs. Although the physical stability of the <b>wet-milled</b> suspensions (nanosuspensions) has attracted a lot of attention, fundamental understanding of {{the process has been}} lacking until recently. The objective of this review paper is to present fundamental insights from available published literature while summarizing the recent advances and highlighting the gap areas that have not received adequate attention. First, stabilization by conventionally used polymers/surfactants and novel stabilizers is reviewed. Then, a fundamental understanding of the process parameters, with a focus on wet stirred media milling, is revealed based on microhydrodynamic models. This review is expected to bring a holistic formulation-process perspective to the nanomilling process and pave the way for robust process development scale-up. Finally, challenges are indicated with a view to shedding light on future opportunities...|$|R
