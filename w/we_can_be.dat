5|$|The {{challenge}} {{may come}} from working outside in the elements. It could be 50 degrees when we rehearse and 50 below on game day, we're working under the pretext that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> doing this in snow or rain... In a normal indoor environment we have seven minutes to install the stage and get it camera ready. That can be stretched to nine minutes. It's the same time frame for this.|$|E
25|$|Because the one-off {{intercalation}} of 30 days happened {{sometime before}} the Nawruz of AD 1129, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> confident {{that in that}} Julian year, 498 YZ began on 12 February by the Qadimi reckoning, but 14 March by the recently introduced Shahanshahi.|$|E
25|$|If these {{dates are}} revised, the {{divergence}} times estimated from molecular data will change as well. However, the relative divergence times {{are unlikely to}} change. Even if we can't tell absolute divergence times exactly, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> pretty sure that the divergence time between chimpanzees and humans is about sixfold shorter than between chimpanzees (or humans) and monkeys.|$|E

25|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} to localize individual poems by studying the geography, flora, and fauna to which they refer. This approach usually does not yield firm results. For example, there are no wolves in Iceland, but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sure that Icelandic poets {{were familiar with the}} species. Similarly, the apocalyptic descriptions of Völuspá have been taken as evidence that the poet who composed it had seen a volcanic eruption in Iceland - but this is hardly certain.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril. There may still be {{disputes}} about exactly how much is naturally occurring, but what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> scientifically certain of is that our continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us {{to a point of}} no return. And unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this country, we are condemning future generations to global catastrophe.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{contemporary}} account written in early 1862, Ward {{and his brother}} arrived in Shanghai, China in 1860 {{for the purpose of}} trading, perhaps as an extension of their father's New York office. This may be true, but given Ward's activities in the 1850s it is almost certain that Ward had ulterior motives for his return. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sure he had little respect for the Shanghai business practices, which he dismissed as “lying, swindling and smuggling”. Their arrival coincided with a buildup of Taiping forces in the area.|$|E
60|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{saddening}} things in life that, try as <b>we</b> may, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> never <b>be</b> certain of making people happy, whereas <b>we</b> <b>can</b> almost always <b>be</b> certain of making them unhappy.|$|R

25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E
25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything is that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, {{and that we can}} say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
25|$|None of us {{can ever}} forget how in that last Easter Sunday of his life, the Holy Father, marked by suffering, came once more to {{the window of the}} Apostolic Palace and one last time gave his blessing Urbi et Orbi. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sure that our beloved pope is {{standing}} today at the window of the Father's house that he sees us and blesses us. Yes, bless us, Holy Father. We entrust your dear soul to the Mother of God, your Mother, who guided you each day and who will guide you now to the eternal glory of her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E

50|$|P1: If {{experiencing}} as much {{pleasure as}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>is</b> {{all that matters}} to us, then if we will experience more pleasure by doing x than by doing y, {{we have no reason}} not to do x rather than y.|$|R
25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable. Even {{if we do not}} know exactly what is going to come next, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> fairly certain that, for example, 'e' will be far more common than 'z', that the {{combination}} 'qu' will be much more common than any other combination with a 'q' in it, and that the combination 'th' will be more common than 'z', 'q', or 'qu'. After the first few letters one can often guess the rest of the word. English text has between 0.6 and 1.3 bits of entropy per character of the message.|$|E
25|$|Philosophy is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, {{can be expected to}} achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).|$|E

500|$|Hamilton won {{the opening}} race in Australia, {{but managed to}} finish only fifth after a {{qualifying}} penalty and a botched pit stop in Malaysia. The season began well for Kubica, as he qualified second in Australia and finished second in Malaysia. Kubica predicted his team could maintain their momentum into the third race: [...] "I'm confident that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> very competitive here as well." ...|$|E
500|$|All <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{certain of}} is that, {{if there was}} a bishop of Llanbadarn in 601 – and {{possibly}} 720 – there appears to have been none in later years (though note the later use of the style [...] "bishop" [...] during Gerald of Wales's visit in 1188). But that did not diminish the power and influence of the clas at Llanbadarn Fawr. By the middle of the ninth century the clas was clearly the wealthiest in the province. The renowned Asser, scholar and adviser to Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, may have been educated at Llanbadarn Fawr. If this is correct it would be a strong indication that Llanbadarn's reputation for learning was well-founded.|$|E

500|$|Michael Schumacher {{admitted}} to having mixed feelings after the race, having been in second position until the race's last laps. The Mercedes driver stated: [...] "I would obviously have loved to finish there [...] and be on the podium again. But {{even if it did}} not work out in the very end, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> happy about the result and the big fight we put in." [...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh, {{but on the other hand}} I started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|The trophies were {{presented}} to the winning crews by the five-time Olympic gold medallist Steve Redgrave. OUWBC's winning president Chitty said [...] "It's a really special moment, something I've been working towards for three years" [...] while her counterpart Reid accepted that Cambridge [...] "didn't get off to [...] best start and Oxford did" [...] and that the conditions were [...] "pretty horrendous around the halfway mark with the wind against the tide and some pretty high waves". [...] Oxford's stroke Davies said: [...] "I'm so glad <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> role models to all the young women out there." [...] Cambridge's coach Baker noted [...] "We’ve got a young crew that {{has come a long}} way and they raced their best ... We’ve improved quite a lot, but it just wasn’t good enough".|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Grand Met {{merged with}} Guinness, a major drinks concern, {{and the new}} company was named Diageo. In 1999 Walsh {{returned}} to England, and was elected {{chief operating officer of}} Diageo in January 2000, and CEO in September 2000. He took over a company that had stagnated since its merger three years earlier, and that The Economist deemed [...] "mediocre". As head of Diageo he transformed the consumer goods company into a streamlined premium drinks business. Walsh said:"While Diageo had positions in drinks, that leadership was marginal – capital was not limitless. My view, supported by colleagues on the board, was that we should focus on where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a global leader. We couldn't aspire to that in food – that slot was taken by the Unilevers and Nestlés and Krafts of this world – but we could command that position in premium drinks." ...|$|E
