5|$|As ununennium is {{the lightest}} undiscovered element, {{it has been}} the target of {{synthesis}} experiments by both German and Russian teams in recent years. The Russian experiments were conducted in 2011, and no results were released, strongly implying that no ununennium atoms were identified. From April to September 2012, an attempt to synthesize the isotopes 295Uue and 296Uue was made by bombarding a target of berkelium-249 with titanium-50 at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany.

5|$|During the mid-1990s, NSB had {{initiated}} {{a program to}} replace the traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new, tilting multiple units. This had led {{to the order of}} sixteen Class 73 four-car units for the three mainline routes on the Bergen, Dovre and Sørland Lines. To supplement this, on 14 November 1996 the board of NSB decided to purchase seven tilting diesel multiple units for the Røros and Rauma Lines. In particular, the aging Di3 locomotives would be retired <b>within</b> <b>five</b> years, and NSB was reluctant to purchase new diesel locomotives for passenger trains. The failure of the Di6, which were returned to the manufacturer Siemens, further motivated NSB to avoid locomotive-hauled trains.|$|E
5|$|Firm {{evidence}} for specific early {{performances of the}} play is scant.

Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.|$|E
