40|$|Using a {{three-dimensional}} model of affect, {{we compared the}} affective consequences of manipulating intensity, rate, and pitch height in music and speech. Participants rated 64 music and 64 speech excerpts on valence (pleasant-unpleasant), energy arousal (awake-tired), and tension arousal (tense-relaxed). For music and speech, loud excerpts <b>were</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> more pleasant, energetic, and tense than soft excerpts. Manipulations of rate had overlapping effects on music and speech. Fast music and speech <b>were</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> having greater energy than slow music and speech. However, whereas fast speech <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> less pleasant than slow speech, fast music <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> <b>as</b> having greater tension than slow music. Pitch height had opposite consequences for music and speech, with high-pitched speech but lowpitched music associated with higher ratings of valence (more pleasant). Interactive effects on judgments were also observed. We discuss {{similarities and differences between}} vocal and musical communication of affect, and the need to distinguish between two types of arousal: energy and tension. 11 page(s...|$|R
