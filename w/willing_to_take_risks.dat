Although no single individual can be credited with creating the modern salegy genre, Jaojoby ranks among the earliest originators of the nascent musical style. A desire for greater freedom to write songs and further develop the syncretic modern salegy style led Jaojoby to leave Los Matadores in 1975 for The Players, another regional band that was less well-established but more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>risks.</b> The band was managed by a Chinese shopkeeper who provided them with a sound system and generator. The band toured northwestern Madagascar {{for the next four years}} with increasing success, recording two 45rpm singles and performing in Mahajanga, Diego-Suarez, and other towns and villages throughout the region before disbanding in 1979.|$|E

25|$|The First Intifada (1987–93) {{would prove}} another {{watershed}} in Palestinian nationalism, as it brought the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza {{to the forefront}} of the struggle. The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) (al-Qiyada al Muwhhada) mobilised grassroots support for the uprising. In 1987 The Intifada caught the (PLO) by surprise, the leadership abroad could only indirectly influence the events., A new local leadership emerged; the UNLU comprising many leading Palestinian factions. The disturbances initially spontaneous soon came under local leadership from groups and organizations loyal to the PLO that operated within the Occupied Territories; Fatah, the Popular Front, the Democratic Front and the Palestine Communist Party. The UNLU was the focus of the social cohesion that sustained the persistent disturbances. After King Hussein of Jordan proclaimed the administrative and legal separation of the West Bank from Jordan in 1988, the UNLU organised to fill the political vacuum. During the intifada Hamas replaced the monopoly of the PLO as sole representative of the Palestinian people. Some Israelis had become tired of the constant violence of the First Intifada, and many were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>risks</b> for peace. Some wanted to realize the economic benefits in the new global economy. The Gulf War (1990–1991) did much to persuade Israelis that the defensive value of territory had been overstated, and that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait psychologically reduced their sense of security.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary critics {{believed}} that Fender's handling {{of a limited}} bowling side while Surrey captain in the 1920s, and his achievements in taking the county to [...] high positions in the County Championship, made him the best captain in England. Teammates and opponents praised his captaincy skills, and described him as the best [...] they had known. His Times obituary stated: [...] " [...] was a sharp captain, quick to observe the slightest opportunity of advantage and ready to gamble {{on his ability to}} exploit it. His keen eye for weakness in an opponent and ability to extract and employ the best powers of his own players caused him often, and with reason, to be described as the best county captain who never captained England. No more flexible thinker on cricket ever lived." [...] Always <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>risks</b> in order to win, Fender's main objective was to surprise the opposition; legends grew of his successful ploys. Prior to Fender, few county captains displayed tactical imagination; Fender inspired his teams to play forceful, entertaining cricket which made him and his Surrey team very popular. His leadership was often specifically commented on by the press, an unusual occurrence in county cricket reports. In particular, his declarations often were the subject of attention and controversy—he often declared, contrary to orthodox tactics at the time, before his side had built up a big lead or even before they reached the opposition's first innings total. One of his favoured approaches was for the batsmen in the lower middle-order to hit out at the bowling, no matter the state of the match; if successful, the team either quickly consolidated a position of strength or regained the initiative if earlier batsmen had failed. Fender also used non-regular bowlers in an attempt to unsettle batsmen. His innovative approach included the introduction of [...] caps with larger peaks to shade his players' eyes from the sun, and he recruited a baseball coach to improve their throwing.|$|E

40|$|Although {{several studies}} have {{investigated}} on commercial farmers’ risk preferences, there is still lack {{of information on the}} risk attitudes and risk preferences of smallholder farmers in South Africa. Risks associated with the adoption of new agricultural technology need to be explored in order to address the transition from homestead food gardening to smallholder irrigated farming. This study seeks to understand risk perception of smallholder irrigation farmers by linking constraints to commercialisation, adoption of new agricultural technologies and risk preferences of smallholder farmers in the former Ciskei Homelands of the Eastern Cape. A total of 101 respondents were surveyed, consisting of 38 smallholder farmers and 63 homestead food gardeners in the Eastern Cape. Questionnaires were used to record household activities, socio-economic and institutional data as well as household demographics through personal interviews. The probit results indicated that older farmers are less risk averse thus more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>risk.</b> The risk analysis indicates that farmers who are employed elsewhere are more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>risk</b> as income is playing a major role in risk preferences. The results also prove that factors such as tenure system and years in farming have a major influence on farmers’ decision <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>risk</b> and adopt new agricultural technology. According to the multi-logit model the major factors influencing technology adoption and risk taking are household size, water rate and type of irrigation system used by the farmers. This study provides useful practical insights for policy makers, farm advisers and researchers in the design of effective and efficient policies, programmes and projects which can affect the adoption of technology, increase smallholder farmers capacity to manage risk and drive growth in the food market...|$|R

2500|$|Richie Benaud was a leg-spin bowler who {{had taken}} 49 Test wickets (34.41) when he left England in 1956, but grabbed 23 wickets (16.83) India, {{including}} his first three 5 wicket innings and his best Test bowling figures of 7/72. His cricket improved in South Africa in 1957-58 where he took 30 wickets (21.93) and another four 5 wicket hauls and made 329 runs (54.83) with two centuries.

Neil Harvey was vice captain and Australia's best batsman and the [...] "red-hot favourite for the captaincy", but had lost to Peter May by a crushing 345 runs when he led an Australian XI against the tourists and this must have affected their decision. Benaud had been picked as vice-captain to Arthur Morris for the Second Test against England in 1954-55, but Morris sought advice from more senior players and Ian Johnson returned for the next Test. In 1958 Benaud was made captain of New South Wales, but had yet to lead them in a Sheffield Shield match when he was made the national captain, but accepted the challenge with energy. A great believer of the saying [...] "practice makes perfect" [...] he trained himself and the team and honed their athletic advantage over the visitors. In particular he heightened their already formidable fielding skills, which he used to dry up the runs of the England batsmen, and their catching became phenomenal. He also encouraged quick running between the wickets to steal runs and unsettle the England bowlers. In the field his tactical genius proved decisive with cunning bowling changes and inventive fields, though he was happy to take advice from the more experienced Harvey and other players. His reputation reached such heights that a simple field change would torment batsmen who tried to work out what he was doing. In the Fourth Test [...] "he moved short leg round a couple of yards...there was no reason for the move other than to apply psychological pressure. He was a master at upsetting the concentration of batsmen" [...] Always aggressive and <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>risks</b> he proved {{to be one of the}} greatest captains in cricket and won his first five Tests series as captain, the sixth he drew to retain The Ashes. As a player, he grew into the role, becoming the first cricketer to make 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests and his 248 wickets was an Australian record until beaten by Dennis Lillee. When he retired he became a famous broadcaster and journalist and would sometimes jokingly depreciate his captaincy, saying that [...] "the hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss at the right time", but in 1958-59 he lost the toss in the first four Tests and still won three the regain The Ashes.|$|E
