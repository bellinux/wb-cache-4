5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> getting through {{a thick layer of}} fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E

5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E

25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the Qing, {{reasoning}} that the Russians <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time annexing territory settled by many Han people, reduced its many restrictions on Han settlement within Qing territory. This policy spurred an anti-Chinese Greater Mongolia nationalism among a few Mongols.|$|R
5|$|General Buford {{recognized}} the importance of the high ground directly to the south of Gettysburg. He knew that if the Confederates could gain control of the heights, Meade's army <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> dislodging them. He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge, and Seminary Ridge (proceeding west to east toward the town). These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town, Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Early that morning, Reynolds, who was commanding the Left Wing of the Army of the Potomac, ordered his corps to march to Buford's location, with the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) to follow closely behind.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1809, Napoleon {{crossed the}} Danube {{not far from}} Vienna and {{attacked}} Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> just holding out. Nansouty could only get one of his brigades, Saint-Germain's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne charging, as they had done all day long, in a desperate attempt to stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.|$|E

50|$|The {{height of}} the land mass above sea level also plays an {{important}} role, especially after ice sheets <b>have</b> been established. <b>A</b> higher elevation allows ice sheets to remain with more stability, but a lower elevation allows ice sheets to develop more readily.

5|$|In the {{following}} 1994–1995 NBA season, Rodman {{clashed with the}} Spurs front office. He was suspended {{for the first three}} games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19games. After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49games. Normally, he would not have qualified for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team. In the 1995 NBA Playoffs, the 62-win Spurs with reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner Robinson entered the Western Conference Finals and were considered favorites against the reigning champions Houston Rockets who had only won 47games. It was thought that Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> asserting himself versus Robinson and Rodman, who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams. However, neither Robinson nor Rodman, who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers by sitting down on the court, could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{believe that}} the doors were small so prisoners <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time getting out, {{minimizing}} {{an attack on a}} security guard.

25|$|The {{years of}} {{dictatorship}} were gruesome. Apart {{from the students}} that got 7 {{years in prison for}} toasting to freedom which led directly to the foundation of Amnesty International in 1961, in 1968 students would spend the whole night greasing streets and sidewalks with soap so the mounted police <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> chasing them down to break a demonstration. It is said that a student dared a policeman to get his shoes and feet wet chasing after a cigarette lighter, thrown in the duck pond, while he had the license for it in his pocket. In those days one needed a permit to own a cigarette lighter, as imposed by Salazar to protect the matches industry.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a number of criticisms of the premium support model. Some have raised concern about risk selection, where {{insurers}} find ways to avoid covering people expected to have high health care costs. Premium support proposals, such as the 2011 plan proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R–Wis.), have aimed to avoid risk selection by including protection language mandating that plans participating in such coverage must provide insurance to all beneficiaries and are not able to avoid covering higher risk beneficiaries. Some critics are concerned that the Medicare population, which has particularly high rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> choosing between competing health plans. Robert Moffit, a senior fellow of The Heritage Foundation responded to this concern, stating that while there may be research indicating that individuals have difficulty making the correct choice of health care plan, there is no evidence to show that government officials can make better choices. Henry Aaron, one of the original proponents of premium supports, has recently argued that the idea should not be implemented, given that Medicare Advantage plans have not successfully contained costs more effectively than traditional Medicare and because the political climate is hostile to the kinds of regulations that would be needed to make the idea workable.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July, Archduke Charles {{finally decided}} not to fight the enemy near the Danube and retreated to the higher ground {{overlooking}} the Marchfeld. This was a major decision, as it meant that the earlier plan to man the 16 redoubts next to the Danube and fight the enemy there was abandoned. Instead, Archduke Charles occupied both the Bisamberg heights and the Wagram plateau behind the Russbach river, covering the retreat routes to Bohemia and Moravia respectively, thus occupying a sound strategic position. Although the army was {{not strong enough to}} occupy both positions and no earthworks were provided for the new position, it was thought that, given that the two heights were placed at an angle to one another, any enemy force attacking would find itself placed between two pincers. There was perhaps further justification for this choice on a tactical level: the broken and wooded terrain in the immediate proximity of the Danube was adapted to fighting in open order formations, which were insufficiently mastered by his men, and at which the French were adept. This was, without a doubt, one of the bitter lessons that the Austrians learned at Aspern and Essling. But above all, the cautious Archduke Charles was unwilling to take the risk of committing his forces in such an advanced position, knowing that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> extricating them, should retreat have become necessary. He also planned not to face the enemy on the flat plains of the Marchfeld, an ideal cavalry terrain, where the numerically superior French horse would quickly gain the upper hand. The two influential staff officers, Wimpffen and Grünne, had been actively advocating for this position for weeks and this time Charles finally acquiesced to their point of view.|$|E

[...] The strategy made sense; coming into the film, Spielberg had made 20 films which grossed a domestic total of $2.8 billion, while Cruise's resume featured 23 films and $2 billion in domestic revenues.

Despite the outward optimism, as a more adult-oriented, darker film than typical blockbusters, the studio held different box office expectations for the movie than they would a more family friendly film. Entertainment Weekly projected the film would gross $40 million domestic in its opening weekend, and Variety predicted that the high concept storyline would not appeal to children and would render it a [...] "commercial extra-base hit rather than a home run." ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the course}} of the last half century, a number of {{practices}} were developed that connect foresight with governance. From the early development of technological forecasting and anticipatory democracy, to municipal and regional (local) approaches and futures commissions, to the more recent development of transition management, integrated governmental foresight, and to the cutting-edge in networked/crowd sourced approaches, traditions and discourses that link foresight and governance have evolved considerably. The purpose of this article is to review these various traditions and discourses to understand the context within which different approaches can be valuable, and expand the basis by which we can develop Anticipatory Governance strategies. Not all strategies are appropriate in all contexts, however, a major proposition in this paper is that we can design strategy mixes that can combine a number of traditions and discourse in creative ways that allow practitioners to address complex, fuzzy and wicked challenges that singular approaches <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time addressing successfully. governance, public policy, foresight, complexity, desig...|$|R
