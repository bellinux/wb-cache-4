25|$|However, {{steam engines}} {{can also be}} {{classified}} according to their cylinder technology (simple-expansion, compound, annular etc.). One can therefore sometimes find examples of engines which were classified under both methods, such as the compound <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> (compound being the cylinder technology and <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> being the connection method). Over time, as most engines became direct-acting but cylinder technologies were growing more complex, engines began to be classified solely according to their cylinder technology instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} these three boats, the 4,600-ton Puritan, built in 1887, was fitted with the largest <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engine ever built. She {{was also the first}} {{steamboat}} built for service on Long Island Sound to have a steel hull. The second was a smaller vessel, the 3,800-ton Plymouth, built in 1889. As it was decided that the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engine had reached its practical limit in Puritan, Plymouth was installed with a more modern triple expansion engine instead. The last of the three vessels was the 5,300-ton Priscilla, built in 1894, which had a double compound engine and Scotch boilers. All three of these vessels were considered in their day to be the epitome of elegance and sophistication and gave many years of service on Long Island Sound.|$|E
25|$|Steeple engines were tall like <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engines, {{but much}} {{narrower}} laterally, saving both space and weight. Because of their height and high centre of gravity, they were, like walking beams, {{considered to be}} less appropriate for oceangoing service, but they remained highly popular for several decades, especially in Europe, for inland waterway and coastal vessels.|$|E

50|$|H-drive {{was first}} {{developed}} by Hub van Doorne of the Dutch truck maker DAF. It was a derivative of their Trado conversion {{to produce a}} 6×4 off-road truck from a commercial 4×2 chassis. The Trado used a bogie rear suspension for both sets of rear wheels. This suspension, best known through the Scammell Pioneer of 1927, uses a single central axle, or driveshaft, that in turn drives two <b>walking</b> <b>beams</b> (balanceur, in Dutch) one on each side. The wheels are supported by overhung stub axles. The conversion added the <b>walking</b> <b>beams</b> {{to the ends of}} the original truck beam axle. From that point, the drive between the axles of each side was separated side by side.|$|R
25|$|The {{piston rods}} {{connected}} {{to a pair of}} grasshopper beams (one for each cylinder) mounted above the boiler. A connecting rod near the piston end of the <b>walking</b> <b>beams</b> drove the rear axle's wheels, where it also {{connected to a}} coupling rod to drive the front wheels.|$|R
25|$|Most early marine engines had {{the same}} {{cylinder}} technology (simple expansion, see below) {{but a number of}} different methods of supplying power to the crankshaft (i.e. connection mechanism) were in use. Thus, early marine engines are classified mostly according to their connection mechanism. Some common connection mechanisms were side-lever, steeple, <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> and direct-acting (see following sections).|$|E
25|$|Because the {{cylinder}} was placed above the crankshaft {{in this type}} of engine, it had a high center of gravity and was therefore deemed unsuitable for oceangoing service, so that its use was largely confined to vessels plying inland waterways. As marine engines grew steadily larger and heavier through the course of the century, the high center of gravity of square crosshead engines became increasingly impractical, leading to their abandonment by the 1840s in favor of the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engine.|$|E
25|$|After the Vanderbilt takeover, an {{increasing}} {{percentage of the}} company's contracts came from Vanderbilt himself, who from this point had most of his new steamboats and steamships engined there, just as most of his shipbuilding contracts {{went to the same}} firm, that of his trusted nephew, Jeremiah Simonson. Vanderbilt brought his own ideas to the field of marine steam engineering. Defying the prevailing wisdom, he began powering oceangoing steamships with American <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engines, believing that their relative lightness of construction, economy of operation and low maintenance requirements made them preferable to the low center-of-gravity, but more complex, British-designed side-lever and oscillating types. Other American marine engine manufacturers quickly followed his example, and walking beams became the preferred engine type for oceangoing American sidewheel steamships until the introduction of the much more economical surface condensing compound engine in the early 1870s.|$|E
30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that both simple-walking exercise and <b>beam</b> <b>walking</b> accelerate functional recovery compared to natural recovery. As expected for acquisition movement exercise was more effective than simple-walking exercise for improving beam-walking performance. The difference in effectiveness between beam-walking and treadmill exercisemay derive from the difference in task difficulty, rather than task similarity. There {{is a possibility that}} beam –walking task needs delicate control of hindlimb rather than treadmill walking. Therefore treadmill training is thought to affect the functional recovery of <b>beam</b> <b>walking</b> task less than <b>beam</b> <b>walking</b> training. It is difficult to strictly discriminate motor recovery from motor learning. However, in clinical rehabilitation, functional training is thought that the sum of spontenous neuronal recovery and motor relarning and neuronal reorganization by exercise (Hosp and Luft 2011). Our result suggested that <b>beam</b> <b>walking</b> exercise has more accelerative effect than treadmill exercise in functional recovery.|$|R
50|$|This {{principle}} of divided drive already being {{established for the}} front of the Trado, it was a minor step for van Doorne to divide the drive to the rear wheels as well. The DAF YA-328 used <b>walking</b> <b>beams</b> where the axle {{was no more than a}} pivot and the drive was supplied entirely by external longitudinal drive shafts, one on each side. As was usual for heavy vehicles of this period, the final drives and right-angle drive to the stub axles were combined through a worm gear box. This also had he advantage that it is easy to connect such boxes in series, using the rear end of the worm shaft as an output.|$|R
50|$|<b>BEAM</b> <b>walking</b> robots contain Nv networks, which {{consist of}} NV neurons {{each of which}} is a very simple {{oscillator}} setup. The most common form of BEAM walker is the master slave Bicore, which uses two suspended Bicore arrangements.|$|R
25|$|The {{second major}} {{parameter}} {{to be considered}} is the output frequency of the power source. As the heat is predominantly generated in {{the surface of the}} component it is important to select a frequency which offers the deepest practical penetration depth into the material without running the risk of current cancellation. It will be appreciated that as only the skin is being heated time will be required for the heat to penetrate to the centre of the component and that if too much power is applied too quickly it is possible to melt the surface of the component whilst leaving the core cool. Utilising thermal conductivity data for the material and the customers specified homogeneity (physics) requirements regarding the cross sectional ∆T it is possible to calculate or create a model to establish the heat time required. In many cases the time to achieve an acceptable ∆T will exceed what can be achieved by heating the components one at a time. A range of handling solutions including conveyors, in line feeders, pusher systems and <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> feeders are utilised to facilitate the heating of multiple components whilst delivering single components to the operator at the required time cycle.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Walking</b> <b>beam</b> engines {{remained}} {{popular with}} American shipping lines and excursion operations {{right into the}} early 20th century. Although the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engine was technically obsolete in the later 19th century, it remained popular with excursion steamer passengers who expected to see the [...] "walking beam" [...] in motion. There were also technical reasons for retaining the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engine in America, as {{it was easier to}} build, requiring less precision in its construction. [...] Wood could be used for the main frame of the engine, at a much lower cost than typical practice of using iron castings for more modern engine designs. Fuel was also much cheaper in America than in Europe, so the lower efficiency of the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engine was less of a consideration. The Philadelphia shipbuilder Charles H. Cramp blamed America's general lack of competitiveness with the British shipbuilding industry in the mid-to-late 19th century upon the conservatism of American domestic shipbuilders and shipping line owners, who doggedly clung to outdated technologies like the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> and its associated paddlewheel long after they had been abandoned {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>walking</b> <b>beam,</b> {{also known}} as a [...] "vertical beam", [...] "overhead beam", or simply [...] "beam", was another early {{adaptation}} of the beam engine, but its use was confined almost entirely to the United States. After its introduction, the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> quickly became the most popular engine type in America for inland waterway and coastal service, and the type proved to have remarkable longevity, with <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engines still being occasionally manufactured as late as the 1940s. In marine applications, the beam itself was generally reinforced with iron struts that gave it a characteristic diamond shape, although the supports on which the beam rested were often built of wood. The adjective [...] "walking" [...] was applied because the beam, which rose high above the ship's deck, could be seen operating, and its rocking motion was (somewhat fancifully) likened to a walking motion.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between dynamic balance tests and various physical fitness tests in preschool children. The subjects were 22 preschool children (age, 5. 0 + 0. 4 years; height, 107. 3 + 5. 7 cm; weight, 17. 9 + 3. 4 kg). Dynamic balance was assessed by walking the length of a balance beam several times (beam height, 30 cm; width, 10 cm; length, 200 cm) and walking a pathway (width, 10 cm; length, 200 cm). Physical fitness was assessed with activities such as a 25 -meter run, continuous bilateral hopping, upright hand standing, standing long jump, and catching a ball. Significant moderate or high correlations were found between the dynamic balance tests (r = 0. 57), between <b>walking</b> the balance <b>beam</b> and continuous bilateral hopping tests (r = 0. 47) and catching a ball tests (r = 0. 71), and between walking a pathway and catching a ball tests (r = 0. 57). In conclusion, both <b>walking</b> a balance <b>beam</b> and pathway showed a relationship to coordination. Walking a balance beam successfully was also positively correlated with agility. However, the relationships between these two dynamic balance tests were not as high. Hence, <b>walking</b> a balance <b>beam</b> may be related to a different ability than what is needed to walk a pathway...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Walking</b> <b>beam</b> engines were {{a type of}} {{paddlewheel}} {{engine and}} were rarely used for powering propellers. They were used primarily for ships and boats working in rivers, lakes and along [...] the coastline, but were a less popular choice for seagoing vessels because the great height of the engine made the vessel less stable in heavy seas. They were also of limited use militarily, because the engine was exposed to enemy fire and could thus be easily disabled. Their popularity in the United States was due primarily {{to the fact that}} the <b>walking</b> <b>beam</b> engine was well suited for the shallow-draft boats which operated in America's shallow coastal and inland waterways.|$|E

40|$|Dystonia is a {{neurological}} disorder characterized by excessive involuntary muscle contractions {{that lead to}} twisting movements. The exaggerated movements have been studied and have implicated basal ganglia as the point of origin. In more recent studies, the cerebellum has also been identified as the possible target of dystonia, {{in the search for}} alternative treatments. Tiagabine is a selective GABA transporter inhibitor, which blocks the reuptake and recycling of GABA. The study of GABAergic drugs as an alternative treatment for cerebellar induced dystonia has not been reported. In our study, tiagabine was i. p. injected into kainic acid induced, cerebellar dystonic adult rats, and the effects were compared with non-tiagabine injected and sham-operated groups. <b>Beam</b> <b>walking</b> apparatus, telemetric electromyography (EMG) recording, and histological verification were performed to confirm dystonic symptoms in the rats on post-surgery treatment. Involuntary dystonic spasm was observed with repetitive rigidity, and twisting movements in the rats were also confirmed by a high score on the dystonic scoring and a high amplitude on the EMG data. The rats with tiagabine treatment were scored based on motor amelioration assessed via <b>beam</b> <b>walking.</b> The result of this study suggests and confirms that low dose of kainic acid microinjection is sufficient to induce dystonia from the cerebellar vermis. In addition, from the results of the EMG recording and the behavioral assessment through <b>beam</b> <b>walking,</b> tiagabine is demonstrated as being effective in reducing dystonic spasm and may be a possible alternative therapeutic drug in the treatment of dystonia...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Hoffmann (H) {{reflexes}} were elicited {{from the}} soleus (SOL) muscle while subjects walked {{on a treadmill}} and on a narrow beam (3. 5 cm wide, raised 34 cm from the floor). The speed of walking on the treadmill was selected for each subject o match the background activation level of their SOL muscle during <b>beam</b> <b>walking.</b> The normal reciprocal activation pattern of the tibialis anterior and SOL muscles in treadmill walking {{was replaced by a}} pattern dominated by co-contraction on the beam. In addition, the step cycle duration was more variable and the time spent in the swing phase was reduced on the beam. The H-reflexes were highly modulated inboth tasks, the amplitude being high in the stance phase and low in the swing phase. The H-reflex amplitude was on average 40 % lower during <b>beam</b> <b>walking</b> than treadmill walking. The relationship between the H-reflex amplitude and the SOL EMG level was quantified by a regression line relating the two variables. The slope of this line was on average 41 % lower in <b>beam</b> <b>walking</b> than treadmill walking. The lower H-reflex gain observed in this study and the high level of fusimotor drive observed in cats performing similar tasks suggest that the two mechanisms which control the excit-ability of this reflex pathway (i. e. fusimotor action and control of transmission at the muscle spindle to moto-neuron synapse) may be controlled independently...|$|R
5000|$|In 1872, George Brayton {{applied for}} a patent for his [...] "Ready Motor", a {{reciprocating}} constant-pressure engine. The engine was a two-stroke and produced power on every revolution. Brayton engines used a separate piston compressor and piston expander, with compressed air heated by internal fire as it entered the expander cylinder. The first versions of the Brayton engine were vapor engines which mixed fuel with air as it entered the compressor {{by means of a}} heated-surface carburetor. The fuel / air was contained in a reservoir / tank and then it was admitted to the expansion cylinder and burned. As the fuel/air mixture entered the expansion cylinder, it was ignited by a pilot flame. A screen was used to prevent the fire from entering or returning to the reservoir. In early versions of the engine, this screen sometimes failed and an explosion would occur. In 1874, Brayton solved the explosion problem by adding the fuel just prior to the expander cylinder. The engine now used heavier fuels such as kerosene and fuel oil. Ignition remained a pilot flame. Brayton produced and sold [...] "Ready Motors" [...] to perform a variety of tasks like water pumping, mill operation, running generators, and marine propulsion. The [...] "Ready Motors" [...] were produced from 1872 to sometime in the 1880s; several hundred such motors were likely produced during this time period. Brayton licensed the design to Simone in the UK. Many variations of the layout were used; some were single-acting and some were double-acting. Some had under walking beams; others had overhead <b>walking</b> <b>beams.</b> Both horizontal and vertical models were built. Sizes ranged from less than one to over 40 horsepower. Critics of the time claimed the engines ran smoothly and had a reasonable efficiency.|$|R

The later definition only uses the term for engines which apply their power directly to the crankshaft via the piston rod and/or connecting rod.

40|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{has been}} shown to have unique properties that make it a more suitable cerebral fuel under various neuropathological conditions (e. g., starvation, ischemia, and traumatic brain injury (TBI).
