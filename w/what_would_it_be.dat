500|$|During an {{interview}} with Kerrang!, Lee revealed the inspiration of [...] "My Heart Is Broken"; [...] "A {{good friend of mine}} heads up an organization in New York that rescues victims of sex trafficking. My husband and I got involved and were really moved and horrified. As I was writing the song I was putting myself in that place – <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> like to be trapped? Threatened? Alone? Unable to tell anyone what was happening because you're afraid of what would happen?" ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> like if I did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E
500|$|As Pausch {{walked into}} the {{standing}} ovation, he {{tried to stop the}} applause, get the audience to sit down, and begin the speech by commenting [...] "make me earn it", to which one member of the audience responded [...] "you did". He then commented on the irony of his [...] "last lecture" [...] in a series that used to be the [...] "Last Lecture" [...] series, but was renamed [...] "Journeys": [...] "It's wonderful to be here. What Indira didn’t tell you is that this lecture series used to be called the 'Last Lecture'. If you had one last lecture to give before you died, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be?</b> I thought, damn, I finally nailed the venue and they renamed it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am an old fool--an old fool!' Dragomiroff began piteously. 'I did {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> all new to me. We reason with them in Little Russia.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Singh has an {{interest}} in Greek poetry. He was asked in an interview, [...] "If you were to choose a profession other than law, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> and why?". He responded [...] "One thing I would have liked to be is an academic specialising in Greek poetry. I love Greek poetry. I can read Ancient Greek but never had the chance to develop my interest." [...] Singh is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Singh has also expressed his views writing in The Guardian on how 'Asians should not be prejudged because of the way we look' following a personal experience on the London Underground following the 7 July 2005 London bombings.|$|E
60|$|And if he did, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> {{to see a}} woman going by? There {{are women}} enough in the world, Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks--too many; {{they are at the}} bottom of all that goes wrong in it, though, for the matter of that, they create {{business}} for lawyers. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to see a woman going by, even though she were going secretly? They are all secret. Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well.|$|E
6000|$|ISABEL (peeping over FLORRIE'S shoulder). But {{then this}} bit under the glass {{looks like that}} bit out of the glass! If we could break this bit under the glass, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> like? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of <b>what</b> use <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> {{for me to}} complain? In view of {{all that}} has {{happened}} we have been remarkably fortunate in getting away alive, and consequently there is very much to be thankful for." ...|$|R
60|$|CHR. I know <b>what</b> I <b>would</b> obtain; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ease for my heavy burden.|$|R
6000|$|These things tormented me, and {{my partner}} too, night and day; nor did we {{consider}} that the captains of ships have no authority to act thus; and if we had surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer the destroying us, or torturing us, but <b>would</b> <b>be</b> accountable for <b>it</b> when they came into their own country. This, I say, gave me no satisfaction; for, if they will act thus with us, <b>what</b> advantage <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to us {{that they would be}} called to an account for it? or, if we were first to <b>be</b> murdered, <b>what</b> satisfaction <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to us to have them punished when they came home? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> {{to me if}} the {{worthless}} bark were saved, {{while my}} father and his friend were abandoned to the frightful fate that befell the patron and that unhappy peasant of Berne!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is of you I am thinking, Mother," [...] said Ernest tenderly. [...] "I can't {{have your}} burden added to. You deny {{yourself}} {{too much and}} work too hard now. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> if you took the care of those children upon yourself?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{prospect}} was {{a dreary}} one, for {{if they had}} had so many discomforts to endure hitherto, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> during the next four months on that bleak plateau? For themselves, however, they were indifferent in this respect, as it was already known the party on shore would be shortly relieved.|$|E
6000|$|... "And to what end?" [...] {{she asked}} sharply. [...] "If you are, as I understand, to shut {{yourself}} forever in your cell within the four walls of an abbey, then of <b>what</b> use <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> were your prayer to be answered?" ...|$|R

60|$|Say <b>what</b> they <b>would,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{evident that}} Albinia Ferrars had cast in her lot with Edmund Kendal, {{and that her}} {{energetic}} spirit and love of children animated her to embrace joyfully the cares which such a choice must impose on her.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Stanley {{decided to}} treat that as irrelevant. [...] "There {{ought to be}} a Censorship of Books. We want it badly at the present time. Even WITH the Censorship of Plays there's hardly a decent thing to which a man can take his wife and daughters, a {{creeping}} taint of suggestion everywhere. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> without that safeguard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do, my dear," [...] {{said the}} husband. [...] "I shall be obliged and {{grateful}} {{if you will}} remember what I have said." [...] Then he left her, and she sat alone, first in the dusk {{and then in the}} dark, for two hours, doing nothing. Was this to be the life which she had procured for herself by marrying Mr. Kennedy of Loughlinter? If it was harsh and unendurable in London, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> in the country? ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{paused at}} the gate, {{and looked back at}} the wide domain and fine old house. He pitied them, and the simple-hearted, honest tenantry, for being the {{heritage}} of such a family, and the possession of one so likely to misuse them, instead of training them into the means of conferring benefits on them, on his country. What would not Philip himself do if those lands were his,--just what was needed to give his talents free scope? and <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to see his beautiful Laura their mistress? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None {{should know}} better than thyself that a trader, like any other traveller, becomes acquainted with strange bedfellows," [...] replied Bacri, with a quiet smile. [...] "As to a warlike spirit, of <b>what</b> use <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> in a despised Israelite to display such?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of <b>what</b> use <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be,</b> my son? No {{good can}} come of searching out these poor lands. You cannot benefit the miserable Kablunets. Perhaps they are savage and fierce; {{and you are}} sure to meet with dangers by the way. Worse--you may die!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “For you—or for myself? Yet <b>it</b> couldn’t have <b>been</b> selfish. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> have <b>been</b> to me {{that you}} {{remained}} in the world? I never expected to see you again. I even composed a most beautiful letter of farewell. Such a letter as no woman had ever received.” ...|$|R
60|$|On this Captain Giles remarked easily {{that the}} fellow {{had no doubt}} gone off to look after my old job. The Chief Steward, who had been leaning against the wall, brought his face of an unhappy goat nearer {{to the table and}} {{addressed}} us dolefully. His object was to unburden himself of his eternal grievance against Hamilton. The man kept him in hot water with the Harbour Office as to the state of his accounts. He wished to goodness he would get my job, though in truth <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be?</b> Temporary relief at best.|$|E
60|$|For {{years now}} he had thought of little else than Beatrice. To win her he would have given all his wealth, ay, thrice over, if that were possible. To win her, to know her his by right and his alone, ah, that would be heaven! His blood quivered and his mind grew dim when he thought of it. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to see her {{standing}} by him as she stood now, and {{know that she was}} his wife! There is no form of passion more terrible than this. Its very earthiness makes it awful.|$|E
6000|$|He {{took his}} {{punishment}} like a brave man indeed, and went about his daily occupations with a steadfast face, but his bold behaviour did not lessen its weight. He had {{promised not to}} go away till Ida was married and he would keep the promise, but in his heart he wondered how he should bear the sight of her. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to see her, to touch her hand, to hear the rustle of her dress and the music of her beloved voice, and to realise again and yet again that all these things were not for him, that they had passed from him into the ownership of another man? ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet {{even when}} I would have {{continued}} the flight came {{the thought that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> cowardly to thus desert a comrade; that as captain of the Minute Boys duty demanded that I stand by {{every member of the}} company, however great their peril, yet of <b>what</b> avail <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{continued}} Rushing River, {{still more}} solemnly, and scorning {{to notice the}} remark, [...] "of course Rushing River and his braves could follow if they chose. They could do anything. But of <b>what</b> use <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be?</b> As well might we follow the moose-deer when it has got a long start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to him,' said Kate, with energy, 'but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{that to me}} I {{would rather}} die than take.' ...|$|R
60|$|Surely, if ever Death {{looked out}} of a woman's eyes it {{looked out of}} hers, {{and it seemed to}} him that such a deed might trouble her {{conscience}} little; that she might consider it in the light of an execution, and not as a murder. Bah! he could not bear to think of it. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to drink his wine one day and then feel a hand of fire gripping at his vitals because poison had been set within the cup; or, worse still, if anything could be worse, to wake at night and find a stiletto point grating against his backbone? Little wonder that Montalvo slept alone and was always careful to lock his door.|$|E
6000|$|... "God's {{messenger}} to you, Edward Howard," [...] said Dallas, fixing his keen eye {{upon him}} solemnly; [...] "to you, Edward Howard, who have thrown away talents, hope, and health--who have blasted {{the heart of}} your wife, and beggared your suffering children. To you I am the messenger of your God--by me he offers health, and hope, and self-respect, and the regard of your fellow-men. You may heal the broken heart of your wife, and give back a father to your helpless children. Think of it, Howard: what if it were possible? Only suppose it. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> again to feel yourself a man, beloved and respected as you once were, with a happy home, a cheerful wife, and smiling little ones? Think how you could repay your poor wife for all her tears! What hinders you from gaining all this?" ...|$|E
60|$|Carley took to {{the trail}} below where West Fork emptied its golden-green waters into Oak Creek. The red walls seemed to dream and wait under the blaze of the sun; the heat lay like a blanket over the still foliage; the birds were quiet; only the murmuring stream broke {{the silence of the}} canyon. Never had Carley felt more the {{isolation}} and solitude of Oak Creek Canyon. Far indeed from the madding crowd! Only Carley's stubbornness kept her from acknowledging the sense of peace that enveloped her--that and the consciousness of her own discontent. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> like to come to this canyon--to give up to its enchantments? That, like many another disturbing thought, had to go unanswered, to be driven into the closed chambers of Carley's mind, there to germinate subconsciously, and stalk forth some day to overwhelm her.|$|E
25|$|The Gammaverse, {{a rather}} idyllic version of our world, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like if the planet's {{inhabitants}} made careful {{use of its}} resources.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} mind it, my dear, {{if there were}} {{confidence}} and happiness. <b>What</b> matter <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to me whether you had your money now or hereafter, so {{that you might have}} it in the manner that would be most beneficial to you? I wish he would be open with me, and tell me everything." ...|$|R
