5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (<b>where</b> <b>only</b> United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E

5|$|After Croatia {{launched}} the Battle of the Barracks to capture JNA facilities in Croatia on 14–15 September, the JNA launched a small-scale operation against Vukovar {{to relieve the}} city garrison. At the same time, it began large-scale mobilization in preparation for its campaign in Croatia. It was met with widespread refusal of mobilised personnel to report to their designated units, desertions and an overall lack of enthusiasm for the campaign. This resulted in low troop availability, forcing the JNA to deploy fewer infantry units. Response to the mobilisation was particularly poor in Central Serbia, <b>where</b> <b>only</b> 26 percent of those called up reported for service.|$|E
5|$|As for tournaments <b>where</b> <b>only</b> {{one of the}} Big Four has competed, this is {{the only}} {{category}} where {{the rest of the field}} has a positive ratio, winning 186 of the 262 tournaments (71%) played overall. However, it must be noted that this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008, the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where just one of them has competed.|$|E

Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis.

5|$|In 1998, the team's {{first season}} as a Pirates affiliate, the Sounds {{finished}} last in the American Conference East Division with a 67–76 record. The Sounds were led by manager Trent Jewett who {{would go on to}} win 320games from 1998 to 2000 and 2003 to 2004, placing him first on the all-time wins list for Sounds managers. The Sounds experienced their longest winning streak in franchise history when they won 15consecutive games from June 2 to June 20, 1999. Overall, the team improved from the previous year, putting together an 80–60 record, but their second-place finish left them out of the PCL playoffs <b>where</b> <b>only</b> division winners advance to the postseason.|$|E

Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak.

5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause.

In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go <b>where</b> <b>only</b> the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
