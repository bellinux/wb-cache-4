5|$|As a senator, McGovern was an {{exemplar of}} modern American liberalism. He became most {{known for his}} outspoken {{opposition}} to the growing U.S.involvement in the Vietnam War. He staged a brief nomination run in the 1968 presidential election as a stand-in for the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy.
