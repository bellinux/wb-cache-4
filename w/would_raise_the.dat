Chico picked up endorsements from unions that represented, among others, police officers, firefighters, laborers, painters, operating engineers, iron workers, roofers, and sheet metal workers.|$|E

5|$|Rogers {{learned from}} {{questioning}} the prisoners that a French and Indian war party {{had just arrived}} at Carillon, and that the two forts were garrisoned by a thousand regulars. Concerned that the escaped sleds <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> alarm, Rogers immediately ordered a return to their last camp. His council disapproved of the return by the same route (a violation of Rogers' own ranging guidelines), but he overruled them, citing the need for speed and the deep snow. By early afternoon they had returned to their camp, rested, and {{were on their way}} south.|$|E
50|$|For example, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office {{estimated}} that the payroll tax (levied on all wage earners) has a higher multiplier (impact on GDP) than does the income tax (which is levied primarily on wealthier workers). In other words, <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> payroll tax by $1 {{as part of an}} austerity strategy would slow the economy more than <b>would</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> income tax by $1, resulting in less net deficit reduction.|$|R

In November 2012 the High Court turned down Bamber's application for a judicial review of that decision. The following year di Stefano was sentenced in the UK to 14 {{years in prison for}} having fraudulently presented himself as a lawyer. As of December 2013 Bamber's defence team was said to be preparing a fresh submission.|$|E
5|$|The duckers of Aylesbury {{would buy}} eggs from the breeders, or {{be paid by}} a breeder to raise the ducks on their behalf, and <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> ducklings in their homes between November and August as a {{secondary}} source of income. Duckers were typically skilled labourers, who invested surplus income in ducklings.

5|$|The {{estimated}} construction cost did {{not include}} the R$38.1million required for adding temporary bleachers, which were removed after the World Cup was over. They were set on one of the sides and on the north and south ends. The addition of the bleachers <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> stadium's capacity up to 72,000 seats, but would necessitate the relocation of VIP areas and television equipment reducing capacity. Corinthians paid for additional temporary infrastructure required exclusively for the World Cup, which was estimated to cost between R$60million and 100million.|$|E

5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it set the {{standard}} for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson's career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs. John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> bar for other directors and producers.|$|E
5|$|Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich {{framed the}} McKinley Tariff that <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> tariff even higher, {{including}} making some rates intentionally prohibitive. At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison {{attempted to make}} the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add reciprocity provisions, which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports. The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production. Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to {{the reputation of the}} Billion-Dollar Congress.|$|E
5|$|The outcome has two versions. In {{the first}} version, Nikola Jurišić {{rejected}} the offer to surrender on favourable terms, and the Ottomans retreated. In the second version, {{the city was}} offered terms for a nominal surrender. The only Ottomans who {{would be allowed to}} enter the castle would be a token force who <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman flag. In either case, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and returned homeward instead of continuing towards Vienna as previously planned. He had been delayed nearly four weeks, and during this time a powerful army had been collected in Vienna, which Suleiman had not the intention to face. According to historian Paolo Giovio, Charles arrived with an imperial army at Vienna on 23 September, too late for fighting the Ottomans since Suleiman already withdrew. By their defense of Kőszeg, Nikola Jurišić and his men had saved Vienna from a siege.|$|E

5|$|Lenin had {{not wanted}} {{to return to the}} Russian Empire, fearing arrest. He changed his opinion when Tsar Nicholas II {{accepted}} a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, with Lenin believing that these would protect him from the Okhrana. Thus, Lenin and his wife returned to Russia in cognito via Sweden and Finland, moving between different safe houses in St. Petersburg, from which he monitored events and wrote up many of his ideas on the progress of the revolution. He was invited to join the editorial board of Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maxim Gorky's wife M.F. Andreyeva, and used this as a vehicle to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and also advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for the revolution to succeed. However, after the armed Moscow Uprising failed, Lenin began to urge the party to stand in elections for the Duma, believing that this <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> party's public profile. At a Bolshevik Congress in Tampere, Finland, Lenin first met young Bolshevik Joseph Stalin. He also changed his mind {{on the issue of the}} Mensheviks, and began calling for reconciliation between the party's two factions. Members of both groups met at the 4th Party Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in April 1906 where the Mensheviks condemned Lenin for supporting bank robberies and encouraging violence. The Congress resulted in the election of a new Central Committee comprising 7 Mensheviks and 3 Bolsheviks.|$|E

25|$|SAS bought Swedair in 1993, but {{allowed it}} to enter {{receivership}} in 1994. Meanwhile, SAS {{was working on a}} major fleet replacement project to replace its Fokker F28 Fellowships with larger Boeing 737s. This <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> size of the smallest jetliners from 80 to 120 passengers, too large for many of the smallest routes.

25|$|In his 1613 book Opticorum Libri Sex Belgian Jesuit mathematician, {{physicist}} and architect François d'Aguilon described how some charlatans cheated {{people out of}} their money by claiming they knew necromancy and <b>would</b> <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> specters of the devil from hell to show them to the audience inside a dark room.
