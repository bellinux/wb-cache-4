The geometry of the forged bevel gear are divided into characteristic features and mapped to the main dimensions of the preform design.

The surface of punch tip is designed using the section profile described by a Bezier curve with five control points which are related to the preform and the forged part geometry simultaneously. The forming process was analyzed via the FEM simulation. The die stress was also calculated to prevent die failure and improve tool life.

40|$|Purpose: The Purpose of {{this paper}} is to obtain {{suitable}} convection and contact heat transfer coefficient forone-time finite element analysis in the <b>warm</b> <b>forging</b> process. Design/methodology/approach: To do this, the temperature of the tool used in the operation was measured witha thermocouple and repeated finite element analysis(FEA) was performed using the experimentally calculatedcontact and cooling heat transfer coefficient. Also the surface temperature of the active tool was obtained bycomparing the measurement and analysis results and finally the contact heat transfer coefficient for one-time FEAwas completed by comparing the surface temperature between the repeated FEA and one-time FEA results. Findings: The acceptable convection heat transfer coefficients are from 0. 3 to 0. 8 N/mm/s/K and the contactheat transfer coefficient of 6 ~ 9 N/mm/s/K is appropriate for the <b>warm</b> <b>forging</b> process with flow-typelubrication conditions.

40|$|Aluminium-based alloys {{present a}} number of {{interesting}} properties, such as lower density, corrosion resistance, thermal and electrical conductivity and good recyclability. For this reason, {{there is a strong}} trend in increasing the use of these alloys, particularly in the automotive industry [1, 2]. However, aluminium alloys show poor formability at room temperature, and the production of complex components requires a series of high temperature forming processes, such as <b>warm</b> and hot <b>forging,</b> extrusion and hot sheet metal forming [3]. Forming aluminium in these conditions subjects the tools to severe adhesive wear and galling, leading to increased energy needs, shorter tool life, lower part quality and increased cost. In this work, the wear mechanisms generated by aluminium alloys on forming tools have been studied by means of linear reciprocating sliding tests, performed in an Optimol SRV equipment. Balls of two different compositions (AA 2017 and 99 % pure aluminium) were slid against DIN 1. 2344 (AISI H 13) tool steel samples with various surface finishes at temperatures up to 450 ºC. The resulting wear tracks were studied by means of confocal microscopy and electron microscopy (SEM/BSE). The main results show that the observed wear mechanisms are extremely dependent on the system temperature, ranging from pure abrasive wear to formation of layers of compacted aluminium debris and gross aluminium transfer in the form of lumps. The choice of aluminium alloy can be very relevant on the wear behaviour of the system. On the other hand, tool surface finish has a limited effect on material transfer. [1] Miller W S, et al.

40|$|Wear of dies is {{a serious}} problem in the forging industry. The {{materials}} used for the dies are generally expensive steel alloys and the dies require costly heat treatment and surface finishing operations. Degeneration of the die profile implies rejection of forged components and necessitates resinking or replacement of the die. Measures which reduce wear of the die can therefore aid in the reduction of production costs. The work reported here is the first phase of a study of the causes of die wear in forging production where the batch size is small and the machine employed is a light hammer. This is a problem characteristic of the medium and small scale area of the forging industry where the cost of dies is a significant proportion of the total capital investment. For the same energy input and under unlubricated conditions, die wear {{has been found to be}} sensitive to forging temperature; in cold forging the yield strength of the die material is the prime factor governing the degeneration of the die profile, whilst in hot forging the wear resistance of the die material is the main factor which determines the rate of die wear. At an intermediate temperature, such as that characteristic of <b>warm</b> <b>forging,</b> the die wear is found to be less than that in both cold and hot forging. This preliminary study therefore points to the fact that the forging temperature must be taken into account in the selection of die material.

Reduction {{of the risk of}} these failures, or an improvement of tool service life, can be obtained by a proper choice of die material, as well as by tuning the forging cycle parameters. To this aim industrial practice and experience can be helpful, but at the moment estimation of tool life can not be achieved neither by experimental technique, nor by simulation software.
