Students should be taught how to write well when they arrive in language classes. Having selected a topic, {{the students}} examine and explore the theme from as large a variety of viewpoints as their background and imagination make possible. Another strategy is that the students prepare an Outline before writing the paper. The comparison between the two mentioned thought provoking techniques was carried out between the two class groups –students of Islamic Azad University of Dezful who were studying “Writing 2 ” as their main course. Each class group was assigned to write five compositions separately in different periods of time. Then a t-test for each pair of exams between the two class groups showed that the t-observed in each pair {{was more than the}} t-critical. Consequently, the first hypothesis which states those who utilize Brainstorming as a thought provoking technique in prewriting phase are more successful than those who outline the papers before writing was verified...|$|E
40|$|Writing in {{a foreign}} {{language}} is both complex and fascinating, whether viewed {{from the perspective of a}} teacher or a student. My teacher-interest in the <b>writing</b> <b>skill</b> <b>stems</b> from the fact that in my experience it is the most difficult skill to develop successfully. As a non-native user of English and a foreign-language student, on the other hand, I often feel that especially when writing in order to accomplish a specific goal, we have insufficient tools to write successfully. Transmitting information is easier than getting things done. Consequently, in this paper I concentrate on the genre which tends to be most disliked by both teachers and students – formal letters, with the specific focus on letters of complaint. It is this type of letters that each of us may need to write in real life. This type of a letter is interesting as the writer has to combine a number of skills. In order to write successfully it is not enough to master the use of grammar and lexis, a writer has to be aware of the cultural and social context in which the text will function. I believe the genre approach to teaching writing allows students to develop all sub-skills necessary to become proficient writers. In this paper attention will be first given to Common features of formal letters, then to a brief explanation of what genre approach is. The second half of the paper covers some of the of the major problems learners may encounter when writing formal letters (motivation, cultural and linguistic issues). The “problem” section is followed by a number of practical solutions...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there are}} a number of studies on English <b>writing</b> <b>skills,</b> the {{relation}} among metalearning, cognitive holding power and <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> is not well understood. Thus, this study investigated the relation among metalearning capacity (high versus low) and cognitive holding power (CHP; first-order versus second-order) in explaining the English Language <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> of Egyptian pre-service teachers. We constructed and validated new measures of metalearning and English <b>writing</b> <b>skills,</b> and adapted an existing measure of CHP for use with our Egyptian sample. Participants with high metalearning capacity demonstrated better <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> than those with low metalearning capacity. In addition, participants with second-order CHP exhibited better <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> than those with first-order CHP. The two factors made independent contributions (i. e., did not interact) because, we argue that metalearning operates at the level of the individual learner whereas CHP is an attribute of the larger instructional environment (as orchestrated by the teacher). These findings generalize and extend our current understanding of the role of metalearning and CHP in developing <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> to a new population, and establish the utility of newly developed and adapted instruments and adapted instruments.

40|$|Teaching college {{students}} the <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> that APA format requires remains {{a difficult task}} for instructors. Developing engaging APA style activities is a task instructors struggle to help their students master (Smith 2 ̆ 6 Eggleston, 2001). One approach in {{a study conducted by}} Stewart, Myers, 2 ̆ 6 Culley facilitated active learning with the use of short in-class writing assignments, microthemes, to improve students’ learning and <b>writing</b> <b>skills.</b> Through the use of microthemes nonhonor students were comparable to honor microtheme students’ ability to improve their <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> and application of material acquired 10 weeks earlier.
