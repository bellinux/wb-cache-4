40|$|The {{title of}} this {{monograph}}y is Discourses of Writing in the Curriculum of the A-course in Swedish. The aim of this monograph is to find wich forms and discourses of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are emphasized and premiered in the curriculum for the first course in Swedish during secondary education in Sweden, grades 10 - 12. What kind of writing are presented to the students and what potentially miss due to the selection? Is any form of writing presented more thoroughly or as {{more important than any}} other in the curriculum? The professor of linguistics, Roz Ivanic, has formed different discourses of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> she has found being used in education of writing. With these discourses of writing  I have applied them on the curriculum and then been able to see wich forms of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are premiered. By using close reading as a method of analyze I have been able to interpret the curriculum. I have connected close reading as a method with the hermeneutic analysis tradition. The discourses of writing is my tool and my theory wich holds different forms of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are connected to earlier science of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> I present as a background in the monograph. The conclusion I have reached are that the curriculum holds four discourses of <b>writing.</b> <b>That</b> means that the form of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> are presented to the students are a writing to imitate other types of texts, a grammatical correct spelling, a thotoughly processed text and knowledge about their own mental process that is activated during writing. The diskourse of <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> is presented as the most important in the curriculum is the skills discourse of <b>writing.</b> <b>That</b> leads to a form of writing in grammatically correct writing and prepares the students to adjust to a <b>writing</b> <b>that</b> is presented mainly in higher forms of education...|$|R

Other historians <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> substantial British forces remained uncommitted during the battle. Mungo Melvin <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> although the 7th Armoured Division changed its organisation to a flexible combined arms structure, which was not done by the other British armoured divisions until after Operation Goodwood, neither the 131st Infantry Brigade nor the balanced divisional reserve of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion were employed well.|$|E

[...] Spivak <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> Freud's analysis is not culturally receptive and <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> Freud's psychoanalysis is an [...] "occupational hazard".

5|$|Elements of {{the game}} were criticized. Sullivan found some side {{missions}} repetitive, and Sliwinski was disappointed {{with some of the}} boss battles. Miller <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> some Shadow of Mordor features are too complex and inaccessible for new players or those unwilling to use strategy. Critics disagreed about the Nemesis system. Miller <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> the system fell flat in the game's final hours; according to VanOrd, the system was unappealing until the game's second half. Carter found the unskippable cutscenes after a player died annoying.|$|E

Antoniu also <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> Gibbs-Smith did not check the French patents claimed by Coandă in 1910 and 1911, describing the retractable gear, leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank, and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote.|$|E

Sen further <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> maintaining a [...] "strictly chronological order" [...] have meant postponing publication, and alternatively Gupta [...] "sacrificed" [...] chronological order to accommodate the short notice period.

5|$|Jacob's staff: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{scholar and}} {{politician}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095), an antiquarian who pursued studies of archaeological finds, unearthed an ancient crossbow-like mechanism from a garden in Jiangsu which had on its stock a graduated sighting scale in minute measurements. He <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> while viewing {{the whole of}} a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing {{a small part of}} the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated. Shen <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> this was similar to mathematicians who used right-angled triangles to measure height. Joseph Needham writes that what Shen had discovered was Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which was not known in Europe until the medieval French Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) described it in 1321.|$|E

She also <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> mystery {{is not confined}} by sex to women but instead by situation, and that it pertains to any slave. She thinks it disappeared during the eighteenth century when men however briefly considered women to be peers. She quotes Arthur Rimbaud, who <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> hopefully one day, women can become fully human beings when man gives her her freedom.|$|R

5|$|Other {{species of}} macaw {{have also been}} mentioned, but many never {{received}} binomials, or are considered junior synonyms of other species. Williams and Steadman defended the validity of most named Caribbean macaw species, and <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> each Greater and Lesser Antillean island probably had its own endemic species. Olson and Maíz doubted {{the validity of the}} hypothetical macaws, and that all Antillean islands once had endemic species, but <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> the island of Hispaniola would be the most likely place for another macaw species to have existed because of the large land area, though no descriptions or remains of such are known. They <b>wrote</b> <b>that</b> such a species could have been driven to extinction before the arrival of Europeans. The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean is only likely to be further resolved through palaeontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.|$|E

Corrigan <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> that autumn Haking [...] "earned a high reputation in the British Offensive which ended the war" [...] whilst Simpson <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> “(h)is promise before the First World War was never realised during it, but he undoubtedly showed far more skill with the soldiers of 1918 than with those under his command in 1915-16”.|$|R
