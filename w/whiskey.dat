5|$|Ireland once {{dominated}} the world's market for <b>whiskey,</b> producing 90% of the world's <b>whiskey</b> {{at the start}} of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality <b>whiskey</b> bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands) and tariffs on Irish <b>whiskey</b> across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of Irish <b>whiskey</b> worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of <b>whiskey</b> drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish <b>whiskey.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many farmers {{distilled}} their {{corn harvest}} into <b>whiskey,</b> increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, <b>whiskey</b> {{was used as}} a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on <b>whiskey,</b> Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion {{demonstrated}} that the new national government had the will and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws, though the <b>whiskey</b> excise remained difficult to collect. The events contributed {{to the formation of}} political parties in the United States, a process already underway. The <b>whiskey</b> tax was repealed in the early 1800s during the Jefferson administration.|$|E

50|$|<b>Whiskeys</b> made {{entirely from}} malted barley {{distilled}} {{in a pot}} still within a single distillery {{are referred to as}} single malt <b>whiskeys,</b> a style also very commonly associated with Scotch whisky. These may be double or triple distilled.|$|R

5|$|The {{population}} of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790. Among the {{farmers in the}} region, the <b>whiskey</b> excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners. <b>Whiskey</b> was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills. Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into <b>whiskey,</b> which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A <b>whiskey</b> tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers. Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier, so <b>whiskey</b> often served as a medium of exchange. For poorer people who were paid in <b>whiskey,</b> the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.|$|E
5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. <b>Whiskey</b> became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, <b>whiskey</b> was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn <b>whiskey</b> was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E

50|$|Single pot still <b>whiskeys,</b> {{which are}} {{historically}} unique to Ireland, {{are similar to}} single malts {{in that they are}} produced solely from pot still distillate. However, in contrast to malts which only use malted barley in the mash, single pot still <b>whiskeys</b> are produced from a mixed mash which contains both malted and unmalted barley.|$|R

5|$|Older {{accounts}} of the <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the <b>whiskey</b> tax in the western counties of every other state in Appalachia (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia). The <b>whiskey</b> tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, where {{no one could be}} convinced to enforce the law or prosecute evaders. In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General Edmund Randolph argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.|$|E
5|$|After the US Army stopped alcohol {{trading with}} the Blackfeet Nation in Montana in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B. Hamilton started a <b>whiskey</b> trading post at Fort Hamilton, near the future site of Lethbridge. The post's {{nickname}} became Fort Whoop-Up. The <b>whiskey</b> trade {{led to the}} Cypress Hills Massacre of many native Assiniboine in 1873. The North-West Mounted Police, sent to stop the trade and establish order, arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on 9 October 1874. They managed the post for the next 12 years.|$|E

5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank <b>whiskey,</b> as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered <b>whiskey</b> to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{replaced}} Richardson as Treasury Secretary with Benjamin H. Bristow, a {{man known}} for his honesty, who {{began a series of}} reforms in the department. Since the Civil War, <b>whiskey</b> distillers and corrupt treasury agents falsified figures on the amount of liquor produced, while certifying bogus returns, denying the treasury of revenue. Discovering that millions of gallons of <b>whiskey</b> escaped taxation, and having Grant's endorsement to act ("Let no guilty man escape"), Bristow in May 1875 struck at the <b>Whiskey</b> Ring. He ordered federal marshals to seize 32 installations and arrest 350 men; Bristow obtained 176 indictments that led to 110 convictions, and giving $3,150,000 to the Treasury. Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock and Missouri treasury agent John McDonald as part of the <b>Whiskey</b> Ring. When informed on separate occasions, Grant became defensive concerning Babcock, but concerning McDonald, the ringleader, Grant believed he had been betrayed. In 1876, a jury acquitted Babcock at a trial influenced by Grant's deposition in Babcock's favor. After the trial, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House. Grant freed some Ring members after a few months in prison, including McDonald, released after serving 17 months in jail.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>whiskey</b> tax, westerners {{had a number of}} other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the perception that the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier. The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the <b>whiskey</b> excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} sources of revenue Hamilton prevailed upon Congress to approve was an excise tax on <b>whiskey.</b> In his first Tariff Bill in January 1790, Hamilton proposed to raise the three million dollars needed to pay for government operating expenses and interest on domestic and foreign debts {{by means of an}} increase on duties on imported wines, distilled spirits, tea, coffee, and domestic spirits. It failed, with Congress complying with most recommendations excluding the excise tax on <b>Whiskey</b> (Madison's tariff of the same year was a modification of Hamilton's that involved only imported duties and was passed in September).|$|E
5|$|The Washington administration's {{suppression}} of the <b>Whiskey</b> Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. The episode demonstrated that the new national government had the willingness and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws. It was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. The Washington administration and its supporters usually did not mention, however, that the <b>whiskey</b> excise remained difficult to collect, and that many westerners continued to refuse to pay the tax. The events contributed {{to the formation of}} political parties in the United States, a process already underway. The <b>whiskey</b> tax was repealed after Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party came to power in 1801, which opposed the Federalist Party of Hamilton and Washington.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of <b>whiskey</b> {{was certainly not}} a norm in the colonies in the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked down upon American <b>whiskey</b> up until {{the time of the}} American Revolution. Some even saw the harsh spirit as a bastion of debauchery in the American colonies. Whatever the sentiment, the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought a taste for hard spirits from their homelands to the American colonies in the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the English economic controls.|$|E
5|$|The tax on <b>whiskey</b> was bitterly and {{fiercely}} opposed on {{the frontier}} from {{the day it was}} passed. Western farmers considered it to be both unfair and discriminatory. As the Lower Mississippi River had been closed to American shipping for nearly a decade, farmers in western Pennsylvania were forced to turn their grain into <b>whiskey.</b> The substantial reduction in volume resulting from the distillation of grain into <b>whiskey</b> greatly reduced the cost to transport their crops to the populous east coast, which was the only place where there were markets for their crops. By the third quarter of 1794, tensions reached a fevered pitch all along the western frontier as the settlers' primary marketable commodity was threatened by the federal taxation measures.|$|E
