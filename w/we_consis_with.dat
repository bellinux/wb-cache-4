40|$|The {{writings}} of popular lay Buddhist writers Kino Kazuyoshi and Hiro Sachiya affirm traditional Japanese Buddhist ideas of original enlightenment, suchness, nonduality, immediacy, Buddha nature, emptiness, ineffability, and the valorization of everyday life. Kino presents his ideas of self-affirmation through a loose association {{of stories and}} lessons drawn from life, literature, and Buddhist texts. Rejecting early Buddhist teachings such as the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination, Hiro Sachiya argues for a Zen that cham pions individual freedom and disengagement from social expectations {{as an alternative to}} the stresses of Japanese life.

As such, <b>CoNSIS</b> aligns <b>with</b> the overarching objective of the NATO NEC (NNEC) to enhance the Alliance's ability to federate various capabilities at all levels, military (strategic to tactical) and civilian through networking and information infrastructure. Providing security and efficient network management have been important aspects of this work. The work has been a combination of theoretical studies and field experiments in order to get hands-on experience with the involved technologies. This possibility of addressing radios, networks, SOA, security and management together, has given us knowledge on how the different technologies affect each other and how they may be combined.

40|$|Abstract. This {{investigation}} examined faculty attitudes, beliefs, {{and practices}} {{with regard to}} {{students with learning disabilities}} (LD). An instrument was designed to measure attitudes and administered to all faculty in a large urban, private university. Responses from 192 faculty members were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis; results indicated that the instrument contained 12 reliable factors. Further, correlational analyses pro vided preliminary support for the instrument's construct validity by showing that major constructs were associated with each other in expected directions. Descriptive analyses indicated that faculty generally had positive perceptions about students with LD and were willing to spend time supporting students <b>with</b> LD. <b>Consis</b> tent <b>with</b> prior research, faculty expressed greater willingness to provide minor, rather than major, accommodations. Group com parisons by faculty gender, academic unit, and rank are reported. The implications of these findings for future research and training efforts are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A new cell line, {{designated}} BSMZ, {{was established}} from a malignant pleura! effusion {{from a woman}} with breast cancer. This line has a doubling time of 27 h and has now been cultured for over 120 passages. The large, rounded BSMZ cells grow as both a monolayer and as aggregations in suspension. Intracytoplasmic lumen, a finding <b>consis</b> tent <b>with</b> results from cells derived from mammary tissue, was detected on ultrastructural analysis. Injection of BSMZ cells into nude mice resulted {{in the growth of}} solid tumors 4 weeks after inoculation. The solid tumor was identical to the original BSMZ cells in microscopic and electron microscopic studies. These cells possess an average of 80 chro mosomes. Expression of erbB- 2 and c-myc genes was increased by 10 -fold, while there was no detectable overexpression of the N-ras and c-myb genes. Southern analysis has revealed amplification of the erbB- 2 and c-myc loci. The BSMZ cell line may therefore provide a useful model for the study of human breast cancer and overexpression of the erbB- 2 gene...|$|R

The diag nostic yield of NIS was evaluated in human immunodeficiency virus (HlV) -infected patients, when stained with a more sensitive direct fluorescent antibody for PCP-direct fluorescent antibody (PC-DFA). A retrospective analysis was carried out on fifty-five HIV-infected patients with PCP, who had NIS submitted for staining with PC-DFA. Thirty had positive NIS with PC-DFA and all had clinical courses <b>consis</b> tent <b>with</b> PCP. Twenty-five had negative NIS with PC-DFA and were diagnosed as having PCP, by autopsy (n = 2), by a positive bronchoalveolar lavage (n = 10), or by having a clinical course consistent with PCP (n = 13). Thus, the sensitivity of NIS stained with PC-DFA was 55 percent (30 / 55). This is within the range {{reported in the literature}} for induced sputum for the diagnosis of PCP. Non-induced sputum stained with PC-DFA can be useful for the diagnosis of PCP in HIV-infected patients...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified choice ov erload {{as a potential}} cause for purchase deferral. Researchers suggest that the decision difficulties and frustration consumers experience when processing significant amounts of information can lead to decision avoidance and have also found that, <b>consis</b> tent <b>with</b> such expl anation, that time constraints act as a moderator: approach ing deadlines seems to amplify choice overload due to an increased cognitive burden. Identifying moderators of choice overload and discovering contexts in which choice overload occurs is a promising research direction and more importantly it is still unclear whether this phenomenon exists in real business contexts. With th e present study, we address this gap and study the interaction between assortment size and time constraints in a purchase context dominated by uncertainty. We conducted two studies to investigate how number of options and time pressure influence purchase decisions. Past research in time effects vary in understanding of time pressure a nd focus on either real decision deadlines (physical time) or subjective feeling of pr essure associated with time (sense of urgency or psychological time). We test both the moderati ng effect of physical time and psychological time and compare their impact...|$|R
40|$|The 2 D {{horizontal}} morphodynamic {{modeling system}} MORSYS 2 D simulates bottom topography evolution in coastal zones. Sand fluxes are computed with different practical formulas, either for current dominated (e. g, Ackers & White, van Rijn) or combined wave-current flows (e. g., Soulsby van Rijn). Although sensitivity analyses of bottom topography changes {{in terms of}} the transport formulas used have already been done, a comparison of the sediment fluxes computed with the different formulations, considering the same flow conditions and using the parameterizations considered in the model (e. g, bottom roughness, bottom stress) is lacking. With that purpose, we have conceptualized a suitable range of wave and current conditions above a sand bed composed of uniform sediment that is characteristic of the conditions en countered in estuaries, tidal inlets and continental shelves, and applied the several flux formulations. To assess the differences obtained, the average value and the standard deviation were computed for each flow condition. This exercise enabled us to identify, for different parameter ranges, the transport formulations which are <b>consis</b> tent <b>with</b> one another and those that deviate the most from the mean. This information is useful in practical applications by defining conditions for optimal formula performance...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{surveys of}} three Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS) fields using XMM-Newton are presented, {{with the aim}} of {{studying}} the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and galaxy cluster populations in these fields. The X-ray sources detected in these surveys resolve 51 % of the X-ray background (XRB) in the 0. 5 10 keV X-ray band. The relation between the X-ray and sub-mm extra-galactic backgrounds is investigated using a combination of X-ray data and sub-mm data. The X-ray properties of the sub-mm sources and visa versa indicate that the XRB is domi nated by accretion onto super-massive black holes, while the sub-mm background is dominated by dust-obscured star formation. X-ray sources are identified with optical objects using the Canada-France Deep Fields (CFDF) survey, which covers the majority of two fields. The redshift dis tribution of the AGN shows a clear peak at z 0. 7. The 2 -point angular correlation function, W(6), is calculated for the identified AGN but no significant clustering is detected. However, the results are <b>consis</b> tent <b>with</b> X-ray selected AGN being good tracers of the normal, inactive galaxy population. The environments of moderate luminosity AGN at z 0. 5 are investigated, using the clustering amplitude measure Bgq and close pair counts. When compared to a control sample of equivalent inactive galaxies no difference is found between the respective environments. Minor mergers with low mass companions is therefore the most likely mechanism by which these AGN are fuelled. A new method for finding high redshift, optically selected, galaxy clusters is presented and is compared to X-ray selection. It is found that most optically selected clusters may have lower than expected X-ray luminosities suggesting that they are dynamically young compared to X-ray selected clusters...|$|R
40|$|Some quality {{managers}} {{in the construction industry}} are attempting to institute total quality (TQ) management. Having established quality assurance (QA) systems, these managers have realized that the benefits to be gained from this bureaucratic approach are limited. They now aim to transform the culture of the industry, making it less adversarial and more customer centred. Using a sociological analysis based on the forms of legitimation of power identified by Max Weber, the institutional situation of quality managers is examined and their consequent ability to introduce innovation is assessed. Weber suggests that there are three forms of authority: traditional, charismatic and rational. These are considered in the light of some modern organization theory and with reference to the particular problem of cultural change. Managers have the best hope of successfully introducing TQ when they can establish a measure of charismatic authority. This is <b>consis</b> 7 tent <b>with</b> the centrality given to the concept of leadership by writers on TQ. The practicalities of this are investigated through an account of the process of setting up a quality circle. Quality Management, Change Management, Culture, Charismatic Authority, Leadership,...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore ways of {{increasing}} the social and professional awareness of students of architecture to educate a new generation of architects who are familiar with the concepts of social responsibility, professional collaboration, sustainable development and disaster mitigation. Turkey experiences a rapid social change due to the urban regeneration, population movements, environmental changes, new technologies and professional diversification. These phenomenon affect all aspects o f life. This study explores the possibilities for applying new methods of teaching in schools of architecture to train a generation of architects who will be in tune with this new, ever - changing socio - cultural environment in Turkey. A study lasting one edu cational term of 14 weeks was conducted on a group of 15 second year students of architecture. A structural design course which previously had a purely theoretical and mathematical approcah to the subject matter was altered to contain background informatio n regarding social context such as the photos, videos and narratives of earthquake affected areas of Turkey. This was done to introduce the students with the reality of the built environment and professional life in Turkey. Additionally small - scale applied projects were given as semester tasks to the students where they can experience a scaled but realistic application of the theoretical knowledge into reality. These two approaches were supplemented with theoretical knowledge to prepare the students for pro fessional life in a realistic manner. A sudden increase in student attention and participation to the course was observed both in matters concrening the professional application and social context of their architectural projects. These findings were <b>consis</b> tent <b>with</b> a previous study conducted by the author. The findings of this experimental application have resulted in a revision of the educational curriculum concerning the structural design courses to permanently include information regarding the social con text and practical application of theoretical projetcs...|$|R

In this project, {{an attempt was made}} two characterize the binding interactions Between a monoclonal anti-body (Mab) Designated as 14 F 7 and NeuGc-GM 3 ganglioside antigen. The 14 F 7 strongly recognize the ganglioside antigen Fri human melanoma and breast tumors. The crystal structure of the Fab fragment 14 F 7 has Been solved by X-ray crystallography and bonding the two ganglioside Predicted by docking and MD Simulations. However, despite Significant efforts, so far no experimental structural analysis of the 14 F 7 -NeuGc-GM 3 complex is available. Such information Would ask extremely valuable for developing new and improved antibodies for cancer immunotherapy. There Parents, in this thesis, an alternative approach was overtaken two get experimental data. The binding interactions Within the complex were examined Using a newly Developed MS-based oxidative footprinting technique. Briefly, the anti-body sample, with and without the ligand, was overexposed two an excimer laser source in order two oxidize solvent accessible amino acid side chains. The oxidized samples were digested with trypsin simply. Finally, the tryptic fragments were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and ESI-LTQ-FT MS. Sequencing of the MS / MS spectra and database searching identified two residue, Trp 325 of the VL-CDR 3 and Met 112 of the VH-CDR 3, That were oxidized in Both the free and ligand-bound 14 F 7. The Percentage of oxidation Of The peptides containing the residue were quantified based on the areas under the selected ion chromatograms of the oxidized and non-oxidized forms of the peptides. The Data Suggest That the Extent of oxidation of Both peptides is significantly lower in the ligand-bound 14 F 7. More over, an analysis of the spectral intensities and side chain solvent accessibilities confirmed That residue Met 112 and Trp 325 are protected from radical oxidation upon ligand binding the two anti-body.
