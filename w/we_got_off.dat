500|$|Petrucci {{has called}} Portnoy's {{departure}} {{one of the}} hardest things Dream Theater have had to face, and speaking of when he first heard the news, Jordan Rudess recounted, [...] "You know, just to give you an idea of how deep this was to lose him, how difficult it was... after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the phone with him... I literally sat on the steps of my studio and cried. This is a guy who's a friend of mine, who we all love and admire. We didn't want to see it come crashing down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We {{came up with}} a {{narrative}} device to really explore Walter's feelings. We had largely all the elements of the episode in place and Fox called and said, 'Hey, how would you guys feel about if we asked you to have some musical element in the show? Anything, like just feature a song playing.' They didn't ask us to do Glee. And we instantly, before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.' We turned their request into what felt like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking it".|$|E
500|$|... (sic)nesses was {{recorded}} when Slipknot headlined the Download Festival {{in front of}} 80,000 fans on June 13, 2009. The show at Donington Park was filmed with 30 cameras. The 45-minute film audible visions of (sic)nesses features Slipknot during and in-between gigs on the All Hope Is Gone World Tour. Shawn Crahan stated that, [...] "Going in and filming this, {{it just seemed like}} there was no way it could fail. It {{was going to be in}} the top five best shows of our careers, and that's basically what it was: <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the stage and all nine of us [...] felt the same thing, we knew that we destroyed 80,000 people. Watching it back just brings tears to my eyes".|$|E

500|$|However, {{after the}} splendour of the premiere and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons {{departed}} {{on a tour}} of Britain to promote the film it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and box office revenue poor, as Gerry Anderson explains: [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. When we got to the next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only thing we could think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'" [...] Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: [...] "Although we still had our loyal television fans, they remained just that – firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in which she discussed the process behind recording the album, Amos disclosed,"We ended up doing basic tracks at Martian which is my husband’s studio in England, and then we started realising {{that we needed to}} record on days off all through the States, and we would record almost every day <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> in America, and then came back to mix it in England at Martian." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unknown speaker 3: [...] "I {{landed at}} the airport, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off,</b> {{and they told}} the captain that we had three minutes to evacuate; but I didn't think there were still {{a couple of people}} on board when they blew the, they blew the front part of the plane up. They had {{dynamite}}d the they had dynamite all over the front and the back of the plane. They brought on 20 kilos of plastic dynamite or something in Beirut." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> him <b>off</b> {{before any}} harm was done, but Shadrach's face, lined with its livid scars, {{was a thing}} to remember. Between rage and fear, it looked {{like that of a}} devil.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, it's {{that fellow}} whom you sent out, that night I met you, to catch our first gig. What {{do they call}} him? Jaffir, I think. Hasn't he been with you ashore, sir? Didn't he find you with the letter I gave him for you? A most {{determined}} looking chap. I knew him again the moment <b>we</b> <b>got</b> him <b>off</b> the log." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "When we {{got them}} {{surrounded}} the fight was over in one hour. There was so much dust we could not see much, but the Indians rode around and yelled the war-whoop and shot into the soldiers {{as fast as they}} could until they were all dead. One soldier was running away to the east but Crazy Horse saw him and jumped on his pony and went after him. He got him about half a mile from the place where the other soldiers were lying dead. The smoke was lifted so we could see a little. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> our horses and went and took the rings and money and watches from the soldiers. We took some clothes off too, and all the guns and pistols. We got seven hundred guns and pistols. Then we went back to the women and children and got them together that were not killed or hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Truex {{was happy}} with his team's performance, [...] "I'm so proud of the team – all {{the guys on the}} team and {{everybody}} at MWR. Clint (Bowyer) and Brian (Vickers) were up front all day long. This just says a lot about everything that everybody at MWR has done over the off season – working hard, giving us good race cars. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> in the mid-part of the race, but had the race strategy at the end and a fast enough car to stay up there.” Earnhardt regretted colliding with team-mate Jeff Gordon, “I’m mad because I screwed myself on pit road speeding. I’m pretty upset about that. Otherwise, I feel bad about running into Jeff’s car. I had a good day other than that. I had a good time. … I feel bad about what happened with Jeff, but damn, we were just racing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when we first met. Our parents were coming back from an excursion, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the bus at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I stopped {{and turned to look}} back. She had stopped too and was looking at me. We stood like that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|E
6000|$|On {{rock that}} is much softer than that {{on the other side}} of the oolite hills: much softer, because it is much newer. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the oolites on to what is called the Oxford clay; and then, I believe, on to the Coral rag, and on that again lies what we are coming to now. Do you see the red sand in that field? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{want to be}} convinced!" [...] she exclaimed, penitently, [...] "I'd give {{anything}} to feel as you feel. There's something lacking in me, there must be, and I have only seen the disillusionizing side. You infer {{that the issue of}} the Creeds will crumble,--preach the new, and the old will fall away of itself. But what is the new? How, practically, do you deal with the Creeds? <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>off</b> that subject." ...|$|R
5000|$|Boucher left {{dramatic}} {{radio in}} 1948, [...] "mainly because I was {{putting in a}} lot of hours working with J. Francis McComas in creating what soon became The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> it <b>off</b> the ground in 1949 and saw it take hold solidly by 1950. This was a major creative challenge and although I was involved {{in a lot of}} other projects, I stayed with F&SF into 1958." ...|$|R

6000|$|... (The captain, by-the-by, did at last, out {{of sheer}} nervousness, get aground {{at the end of}} Mordet's Island, but <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> in an hour or so with a swell and a little hard work in the boat.) ...|$|E
60|$|Jolnes was {{restored}} to his calm, observant serenity by having wrested victory from his apparent failure; so after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> {{the car he}} invited me into a café, promising to reveal the process of his latest wonderful feat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I did {{not think}} of that, Matteo. You see we are already getting a stock of tools. Another thing is, with the point of the irons <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>off,</b> <b>we</b> can wrench the wood out as fast as we saw it, and the saws will not work so stiffly as they did before. But we must not do that till the morning, for any sound like the {{breaking}} of wood might be heard by the watch, when everything is quiet." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> him <b>off</b> to bed, {{him and his}} infernal Venus, and {{we settled}} down to take a steady look at the {{position}} of affairs. Bill said {{it was my fault}} for getting hold of the wrong picture, and I said it was Bill's fault for fetching me such a crack on the jaw that I couldn't be expected to see what I was getting hold of, {{and then there was a}} pretty massive silence for a bit.|$|R
5000|$|The Lawrence Arms {{also played}} {{a portion of the}} 2004 Warped Tour, but the band's {{attitude}} towards the tour resulted in controversy. In a 2006 interview, Kelly claimed that the band [...] "did like seven days of it and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> kicked <b>off</b> it, banned for life" [...] for [...] "pointing out the obvious flaws of the Warped Tour, on stage while the people running the Warped Tour were watching us." [...] When asked his opinion of the tour, Kelly responded: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{he crossed}} the river, {{there is no doubt}} of that!" [...] {{returned}} Matt quickly. [...] "But where <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the track was somewhere among the mountains. We dropped the right track and took something that resembled it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> at 6:30 {{before the}} other boats. Smooth water. Little breeze. Saw a school of tuna above Long Point. Put up the kite. The school went down. But R. C. got a little strike. Did not hook fish.|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you, sir, if we've hove a stone out of {{this boat}} since <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off,</b> we've hove two hundredweight, and, if the Lord had not fought for us, she'd have been beat to noggin-staves there on the beach." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{nothing short}} of a miracle," [...] Jack said, [...] "that <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>off</b> so easily. If the beggars had not been in such a hurry to get at us that they got into each other's way they would have done for us to a certainty; but they were all {{slashing}} away together, and not one could get a fair drive at us. Well, I feel about five hundred per cent. better now. Let us get on our things again and have breakfast. I feel as if I could tuck into that bread now." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} Goddall {{explained that the}} majority of the album had been written in New York City. [...] "When we found we couldn't write when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back <b>off</b> the road, we were like 'What are we going to do?' Then we went back down to Nashville saw about a million bands in about five days and went back to New York and wrote some more. After that we saw what we had would be the big pick up for the album."

6000|$|... "Our {{business}} {{was to get}} him off,--and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> him <b>off.</b> It's my business to get my cousin's husband off, if I can, and we must do it, by hook or crook. It's a very difficult piece of work, because he won't let us employ a barrister. However, I shall have one in the court and say nothing {{to him about it}} at all. Good-by, Mr. Harding. As you say, it would be a thousand pities that a clergyman should be convicted of a theft;--and one so well connected too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One morning me and Andy {{wakes up}} with sixty-eight cents between us {{in a yellow}} pine hotel {{on the edge of}} the pre-digested hoe-cake belt of Southern Indiana. How <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the train there the night before I can't tell you; for she went through the village so fast that what looked like a saloon to us through the car window turned out to be a {{composite}} view of a drug store and a water tank two blocks apart. Why <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> at the first station we could, belongs to a little oroide gold watch and Alaska diamond deal we failed to pull off the day before, over the Kentucky line.|$|E
6000|$|... "Beast! I met Sir Thomas when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the train. Spennie Blunt {{introduced}} me to him. He seemed to bear it pluckily, but with some difficulty. I think we had better be going, or they will be sending out search parties." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{send you}} a line a few mails back {{to say that the}} three of us, [...] George, Good, and myself, fetched up all right in England. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> [...] <b>off</b> the boat at Southampton, and went up to town.
