50|$|Performing {{perfusion}} culture experiments {{it always}} has to be considered that gas bubbles are forming during slow transport of culture medium. They arise during suction of medium in the storage bottle, during transport within the tube, during distribution within the culture container and during elimination {{on the way to}} the <b>waste</b> <b>bottle.</b> Due to unknown reasons gas bubbles accumulate especially at material transitions between tubes, connectors and perfusion containers. First these gas bubbles are so small that they cannot be observed with the human eye, but during ongoing transport of culture medium they increase in size and are able to form an embolus that massively impedes medium flow. Within a culture container gas bubbles are leading to a regional shortage of medium supply and are causing breaks in the fluid continuum so that massive fluid pressure changes result. In a gradient perfusion culture container, where two media are transported at exactly the same speed, embolic effects can lead to pressure differences destroying in turn the contained epithelial barrier 5,9.|$|E

This paper describes further work performed on stainless steel slag to determine the likely energy costs associated with HPU processing. In industrial applications of HPU it is important to optimise the parameters of the high-voltage (HV) spark discharge causing the shock wave in the working liquid to maximise the efficiency of the treatment. However, because of the high intensity of the shock wave it is difficult to measure its output close to the HPU source. Experiments have therefore been performed using Pinducer sensors to measure the pressure waves produced by the source at distances relatively far from the spark discharge. These measurements made in the far field have been correlated with the electrical energy provided to the discharge and treatment rates for stainless steel slag and bottle glass obtained under identical conditions...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the possibility of using recycled polymer (waste polyethylene terephthalate [PET] bottles) as a membrane material. Furthermore, the effect of the addition of a pore-forming agent and preparation conditions was also observed. Methods: Porous polymeric membranes were prepared via thermally induced phase separation by dissolving recycled PET in phenol. PET polymer was obtained from <b>waste</b> plastic <b>bottles</b> as a new source of polymeric material. For original PET membrane, the casting solution was prepared by dissolving of 20 wt% PET in phenol solution. For PET modified membrane, a 5 wt% of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was added into polymer solution. The solution was cast onto a glass plate at room temperature followed by evaporation before the solidification process. The membranes formed were characterized in terms of morphology, chemical group, and filtration performance. A humic acid solution was used to identify the permeability and the solute rejection of the membranes. Results: The results showed that the recycled PET from <b>waste</b> plastic <b>bottles</b> was applicable to use as a membrane material for a water treatment process. The maximum flux of 97. 0 l/m 2. hr was obtained from filtration test using PET membrane. The highest rejection of humic acid in a water sample, which reached up to 75. 92 %, was obtained using the PET/PVP membrane. Conclusions: The recycled PET from <b>waste</b> <b>bottles</b> was successfully used to prepare porous membrane. The membrane was modified by the addition of PVP as a membrane modifying agent. SEM analysis confirmed that the original PET membrane has a rough and large pore structure. The addition of PVP improved the pore density with a narrow pore structure.

25|$|Chemical {{recycling}} of PET will become cost-efficient only applying high capacity recycling lines {{of more than}} 50,000 tons/year.

Several attempts of industrial magnitude to establish such chemical recycling plants {{have been made in}} the past but without resounding success. Even the promising chemical recycling in Japan has not become an industrial breakthrough so far. The two reasons for this are: at first, the difficulty of consistent and continuous <b>waste</b> <b>bottles</b> sourcing in such a huge amount at one single site, and, at second, the steadily increased prices and price volatility of collected bottles. The prices of baled bottles increased for instance between the years 2000 and 2008 from about 50 Euro/ton to over 500 Euro/ton in 2008.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{unavailability}} of electricity, about 85 % {{of groundwater}} irrigation in eastern India employs fuel-powered surface pumps, which can have system efficiencies {{as low as}} 5 %. As fuel prices continue to rise, impoverished smallholder farmers cannot afford the operation costs of their systems and, as a result, irrigate less land. This research aimed to develop a more efficient off-grid system that eliminates suction head while continuing to utilize a fuel engine on the surface. Design requirements included increased discharge, increased efficiency, portability, maintainability, availability of replacement parts, and affordability. Flow rates and efficiencies of Indian pumps at varying pressure heads were tested to establish baseline performance and test the hypothesis that removing suction lift reduces operation costs. It was found that eliminating suction head can decrease operation costs up to 44 % for the farmers. Fuel-driven system options investigated include flexible shafts and telescoping shafts to transmit power from a surface engine to a submersible pump, fluid machinery such as semi-open hydraulic systems, jet pumps, compressed air motors, and air lifts, and off-grid electricity generation employing a household backup generator or automotive alternator. However, none of these alternatives met all the design requirements. Instead, a hybrid motorized-manual rope pump was prototyped and tested on a well in Ruitola, Jharkhand. Although this system does not meet all the design requirements, it has {{the added benefit of}} providing domestic water supply. The prototype discharged an average of 155. 4 L/min in motorized mode and 17. 2 L/min for men and 13. 3 L/min for women in manual mode. The rope pump received positive feedback from the users and thus could be taken forward with several modifications to improve performance. To increase the available water resources, evaporation reduction strategies to limit water loss from farm tanks were explored. The strategies employed waste materials and included covering a water surface with <b>waste</b> PET <b>bottles</b> and floats comprised of PET <b>waste</b> <b>bottles</b> and old saris.

A method of calculating the surface coverage of both plastics by the reagent is proposed {{based on the fact}} that the lignosulphonate contains sulphur whereas PVC and PET do not. The results show that a greater quantity of lignosulphonate adsorbs on PET than PVC, leading to a higher surface coverage of LS on PET. The surface coverage values are a function of the lignosulphonate macromolecular configuration.
