25|$|The art of weaving {{developed}} in South Asia {{at a time}} when few other civilizations employed it. Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro– ancient cities of the Indus Valley Civilization– have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of <b>woven</b> <b>textiles.</b> As of the late 1990s, hand-knotted carpets were among Pakistan's leading export products and their manufacture is the second largest cottage and small industry. Pakistani craftsmen have the capacity to produce any type of carpet using all the popular motifs of gulls, medallions, paisleys, traceries, and geometric designs in various combinations. At the time of independence, manufacturing of carpets was set up in Sangla Hill, a small town of District Sheikhupura. Chaudary Mukhtar Ahmad Member son of Maher Janda introduced and taught this art to locals and immigrants. He is considered founder of this industry in Pakistan. Sangla Hill is now a focal point in Carpet Industry in Pakistan. Almost all the exporters and manufacturers who are running their business at Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi have their area offices in Sangla Hill.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{different}} fibers are twisted, knotted and {{woven into}} textiles and objects. [...] Materials include rushes, reeds, thread, plastic string and rope {{as well as}} many more. Historically, fibers were dyed using pigments created from plants and animals. Synthetic dyes have replaced natural ones for many craftspeople, but there still are some, especially in Oaxaca state that still use traditional dyes. Woven materials in Mexico started with basketry and mat-making. The agave plant was an important source of fibers and thread and is still used to day for thread and paper. Cotton was also used, spun into thread by itself or combined with feathers or animal fur to provide warmth. Very traditional Mexican women still spin their own thread, which are made from cotton or wool and can be very fine or very coarse. Textiles have long history of tradition. Brightly colored embroidered designs on female garments can identify tribe, age, and marital status of the wearer. [...] <b>Woven</b> <b>textiles</b> were known to pre-Hispanic cultures for hundreds of years before the arrival of the Spanish, using a back-strap loom fastened between a tree and the weaver’s back. The Spanish introduced the treadle loom, which can make larger pieces of cloth.|$|E

All that we can say with any confidence at present is that somewhen about 15,000 and 12,000 B.C. while the Azilian people were in the south of Spain and while the remnants of the earlier hunters were drifting northward and eastward, somewhere in North Africa or Western Asia or in that great Mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters of the Mediterranean sea, there were people who, age by age, were working out two vitally important things; they were beginning cultivation and they were domesticating animals. They were also beginning to make, in addition to the chipped implements of their hunter forebears, implements of polished stone.

40|$|Since many {{classes of}} {{structural}} FRPs have fibrous reinforcing geometries continuous {{in one or}} perhaps two-dimensions, they feature compliance and weakness in the unreinforced directions. Potential solutions to this problem are investigated here by quantifying the performance characteristics that could be achieved by arranging the fibrous reinforcing to run continuously in all three orthogonal directions. We start with results suggested by continuum material topology optimization, and then, for manufacturability reasons, these material arrangements are approximated using plane <b>weave</b> <b>textiles</b> with continuous infills. The elastic stiffness properties of these textile reinforced composites are computed using established unit cell homogenization methods. The results indicate that structural composites with infilled plane <b>weave</b> <b>textile</b> reinforcing may be one promising way to achieve enhanced overall extensional and shear stiffnesses, although coming {{at the expense of}} moderate sacrifices in longitudinal stiffness...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Commercial sandals are often {{designed}} in a 2 D format and materials are generally applied during design development {{rather than the}} earlier stages of the process. In contrast, handson <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> design is often carried out through making and interaction with materials. This paper presents the findings of an action research case study that investigated the use of ‘hands-on’ <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> approaches to sandal design {{at different stages of}} the design process. The role that hands-on interaction with materials plays at each stage is analysed to assess areas of potential for its integration. The case study presented in this paper focuses on an aspect of wider research that investigates the potential for innovation through handson interaction with materials in the sandal design process. The research questions for the study are: is there potential for the in-depth knowledge of materials and construction gained through a hands-on approach to be applied in the sandal design process; where and how does it have the potential to be integrated; how does the use of hands-on interaction with materials compare with more conventional approaches at different stages of the design process? The case study was undertaken {{in the form of a}} sandal design project that incorporated the use of hands-on <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> approaches. The designs produced were informed by knowledge generated through hands-on weaving techniques. The discussion of the empirical research refers to a literature review that was conducted alongside this case study. The findings indicate that there is potential for a hands-on <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> approach to sandal design and it may be integrated at all stages of the design process. Key challenges were noted in relation to issues of time and cost efficiency in comparison to using conventional footwear design approaches alone. Benefits in terms of opportunity for innovation, generation of in-depth knowledge and immediacy, along with control in decision-making are discussed. Hybrid approaches are also identified as being suitable for bringing together outcomes that consist of a number of different formats...|$|R
