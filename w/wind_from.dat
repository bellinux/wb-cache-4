5|$|A weather {{phenomenon}} known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all {{times of the year}} and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity {{to the north of the}} Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.|$|E

5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00 on 30 March, with {{a strong}} <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the south, Guillaume Tell sailed from Valletta, Decrés hoping to use the cover of {{darkness}} to escape the British blockade. Dixon had deployed his ships around the island, with Valletta watched by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood. At 23:55, Blackwood's lookouts spotted Guillaume Tell and the captain gave chase, ordering the brig HMS Minorca under Commander George Miller to convey the message to Dixon, whose ships were just visible in the distance. Blackwood also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as Penelope gave chase.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Jasmine {{affected}} fivecountries {{during its}} existence. The predecessor to Jasmine brought heavy rainfall to areas of extreme northern Queensland. Jasmine also brought rainfall to {{areas of the}} Solomon Islands. As a result, pest infestations occurred across the region. In Vanuatu, heavy rains and <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> Jasmine destroy numerous crops. Banana trees in particular {{are affected by the}} cyclone. Jasmine inundated areas of Tonga that had already been affected by Cyclone Cyril just a week prior. Nuku'alofa recorded half of its average monthly rainfall in a 24‑hour span due to rains associated with the cyclone. After the season, the name Jasmine was retired from the Australian list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E

5|$|A typhoon watch {{was issued}} for Rota, Tinian, and Saipan on December 14, which was {{upgraded}} to a typhoon warning the next day. Because Paka was intensifying while passing {{to the south}} of Rota, the first wind, or northeast through east winds, was less severe than the second <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the southeast. Sustained winds on the island reached 145km/h (90mph), with gusts reaching 185km/h (115mph). Many trees in the mountainous portion of the island were left defoliated, which limited nesting and foraging sites for the endangered bridled white-eye bird. While passing {{to the south of}} the island, Paka dropped 250–300mm (10–12in) of rain. Damage on the island totaled $4.4million (1997USD, $6.4million 2015USD). The typhoon also produced above-normal precipitation on Saipan.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the central Pacific, John left the area {{monitored by the}} NHC and was instead monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). As it moved slowly westward, Hurricane John continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the Hawaiian Islands; on 22 August John was designated a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii Standard Time) reached its peak winds of 175 miles per hour (280 km/h). Also on August 22 (by Hawaii Standard Time), John made its closest approach to the Hawaiian Islands, 345 miles (500 km) to the south. John had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept John on its southerly path. Nonetheless, heavy rains and <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the outer bands of John affected the islands.|$|E
5|$|Contre-Admiral Leissègues' {{squadron}} was unchanged {{from the}} force that left Brest on 13 December. All ships however, especially Jupiter and Diomède, had been badly damaged by storms off the Azores in late December and repairs were incomplete {{by the time of}} Duckworth's attack, most the fleet still undergoing caulking at Santo Domingo. Recognising that if he was caught at anchor he would be destroyed, Leissègues sent orders from his offices in Santo Domingo for the fleet to sail, joining them later by small boat. Trapped against the land with the <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the west, Leissègues had no option but to form a line of battle and wait to meet the British squadron. Although his ships fought hard, they were unable to mutually support one another and were rapidly overwhelmed: three surrendered, while Diomède and Impérial were driven ashore and wrecked to prevent their capture. The only ships to escape were the two frigates and a corvette that and slipped between the French line and the land early in the battle and made sail to the west, eventually reaching France.|$|E

5|$|While the Carthaginians were in {{the process}} of {{defeating}} the cavalry, the masses of infantry on both sides advanced towards each other in the center of the field. The <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the east blew dust in the Romans' faces and obscured their vision. While the wind was not a major factor, the dust that both armies created would have been potentially debilitating to sight. Although it made seeing difficult, troops would still have been able to see others in the vicinity. The dust, however, was not the only psychological factor involved in battle. Because of the somewhat distant battle location, both sides were forced to fight on little sleep. Another Roman disadvantage was thirst caused by Hannibal's attack on the Roman encampment during the previous day. Furthermore, the massive number of troops would have led to an overwhelming amount of background noise. All of these psychological factors made battle especially difficult for the infantrymen.|$|E
5|$|Within 50 million years, the {{pressure}} and density of hydrogen in {{the centre of the}} protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.

At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined. Solar <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1806, Warren's {{squadron}} was cruising in the Eastern Atlantic. Most of {{the squadron}} were grouped to the northwest, but HMS London under Captain Sir Harry Burrard-Neale and the flagship HMS Foudroyant under Captain John Chambers White were sailing together {{some distance from}} the rest of the British force, in company with the frigate HMS Amazon under Captain William Parker. At 03:00, sails were spotted to the north-east by lookouts on London. Hastening in pursuit with the <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the south-west, Captain Neale signalled the location of the strange ships to Warren with blue lights, the admiral following with Amazon and the rest of the squadron trailing behind. To the north-east, Linois had also sighted sails in the distance and turned Marengo south-west in pursuit, anticipating a third encounter with a valuable merchant convoy. Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac of Belle Poule insisted that the sails were from British warships, but Linois over-ruled him, arguing that any warships would be part of the convoy's escort and could be avoided in the night. It was not until 05:30, when London appeared from the gloom just ahead of Marengo that Linois realised his mistake. He attempted to escape, but his ships had been at sea for an extended period and were sluggish compared to the 98-gun London, which rapidly came alongside the French ship of the line and opened a heavy fire.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} kernel regression {{that can be used}} to investigate the relationship between a directional explanatory variable and a real-valued response variable. Cross-validation and bootstrap methods for obtaining sensible bandwidths and standard error estimates are also described. The proposed method is applied to wildfire and meteorological data from Los Angeles County, California, with the goal of summarizing and quantifying the impact of wind direction on the total area burned per day in wildfires. The results confirm that <b>winds</b> blowing <b>from</b> the NorthEast and East are associated with significantly higher burn areas than <b>winds</b> <b>from</b> other directions and that the daily burn area on days with <b>winds</b> <b>from</b> the NorthEast is about 4. 7 times that associated with the <b>winds</b> <b>from</b> the SouthWest...|$|R
5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E
5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar <b>wind</b> <b>from</b> the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E
