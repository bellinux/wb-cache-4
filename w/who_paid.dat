40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{different}} sequences of work and rest on the daily productivity of workers who planted trees in the province of British Columbia, Canada, comparing the intertemporal productivity profiles of planters <b>who</b> were <b>paid</b> either fixed wages or piece rates. We find that planters <b>who</b> are <b>paid</b> piece rates produce more, on average, than those <b>who</b> are <b>paid</b> fixed wages, but that the productivity of piece-rate planters falls with the number of consecutive days worked; the fall in productivity is between three and five percent per day. Fixed-wage planters, on the other hand, showed no such decreases. Compensation Systems, Productivity, Rest, Recuperation...|$|R

5|$|The Home {{opened its}} doors in 1923. It was built as a diocesan {{memorial}} to the Coloured men <b>who</b> <b>paid</b> the ultimate sacrifice for their country.
