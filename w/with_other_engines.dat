2500|$|Several {{other models}} were carried over from 1970, {{including}} the 500, R/T, and SE. Sales of the R/T declined {{due in part}} to higher insurance costs and gasoline prices. A total of 63 Hemi RTs were built that year, marking its last appearance in any production car, and 2,659 <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>engines.</b> The 1971 model year was also the last for the 440 Six-Pack engine, which could still be mated to a Hurst 4-speed transmission, as well as the automatic.

2500|$|The {{standard}} cabin series were Waco's {{first successful}} cabin biplane design, and {{was developed to}} accompany the F series airframe in their lineup. [...] The Model C series had the top longerons raised to form a four-seat cabin which was entered through a door between the wings {{on the left side}} and had a rather distinctive rear-view window that was cleaned up, and then dispensed with in the later standard cabins. The initial QDC model of 1931 was offered with a [...] Continental A70 cowled engine, or as the BDC, ODC, PDC and UDC <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> (as listed under variants). 1932 saw the introduction of the OEC and UEC models. Continuous refinement and improvement by Waco Aircraft resulted in production of various sub-models continuing until 1939.|$|E

50|$|A {{liquid air}} powered car called Liquid Air was built between 1899 and 1902 but it couldn't {{at the time}} compete in terms of {{efficiency}} <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>engines.</b> More recently, a liquid nitrogen vehicle was built. Peter Dearman, a garage inventor in Hertfordshire, UK who had initially developed a liquid air powered car, then put the technology to use as grid energy storage. The Dearman engine differs from former nitrogen engine designs in that the nitrogen is heated by combining it with the heat exchange fluid inside the cylinder of the engine.|$|E
50|$|After their {{successful}} water-cooled radial engines, {{developed from}} 1908 to 1918, Salmson changed their focus to air-cooling to reduce weight and increase specific power (power per unit weight). The {{majority of the}} engines produced by Salmson were of radial type with a few other arrangements such as the Salmson T6.E. In common <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>engines</b> produced by this manufacturer, the air-cooled radial engines featured the unorthodox Canton-Unné internal arrangement that dispensed with a master rod in favour of a cage of epicyclic gears driving the crankpin. Production ended in 1951 with the liquidation of the manufacturing company.|$|E
50|$|Launch {{vehicles}} are often classified {{by the amount}} of mass they can carry into orbit. For example, a Proton rocket can lift 22000 kg into low Earth orbit (LEO). Launch {{vehicles are}} also characterized by their number of stages. Rockets with as many as five stages have been successfully launched, and there have been designs for several single-stage-to-orbit vehicles. Additionally, launch vehicles are very often supplied with boosters supplying high early thrust, normally burning <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>engines.</b> Boosters allow the remaining engines to be smaller, reducing the burnout mass of later stages to allow larger payloads.|$|E
