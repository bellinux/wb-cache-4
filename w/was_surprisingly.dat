5|$|After Vytautas' {{death in}} 1430, Lithuania became embroiled in {{internal}} wars and conflicts with Poland. Casimir, sent {{as a boy}} by King Władysław on a mission there in 1440, <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> proclaimed by the Lithuanians as their Grand Duke, and he remained in Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losses}} {{that had brought}} the Allies to the border of their homeland, German morale <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> strong.

5|$|After plans by WWF {{writers to}} turn the Ultimate Warrior against Savage were {{scrapped}} due to the Warrior's refusal to turn heel, the two were scheduled to face Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series 1992. However, as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21, his spot <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> offered to Mr. Perfect, who accepted it in spite of Flair, thereby turning face and initiating a feud with Flair which culminated in Flair leaving the WWF in January 1993.|$|E

5|$|Though Boston College {{lost the}} game on the scoreboard, it won almost every {{statistical}} category. Quarterback Matt Ryan outperformed both Hokie quarterbacks combined in passing yardage, throwing for 305yards. Ryan was extremely accurate through {{the air in the}} fourth quarter, throwing eight straight complete passes, an ACC Championship Game record. Ryan also <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> successful on the ground, rushing for Boston College's touchdown of the gamea 14-yard sprint in the second quarter that put Boston College ahead 167.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his success, Garfield was promoted to brigadier general, {{at the age of}} 30. After Marshall's retreat, Garfield's command was the sole remaining Union force in eastern Kentucky, and he announced that any men who had fought for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to their homes and lived peaceably and remained loyal to the Union. The proclamation <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> lenient, as Garfield now believed the war was a crusade for eradication of slavery. Following a brief skirmish at Pound Gap, the last rebel units in the area were outflanked, and they retreated to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sihanouk <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> acquiescent {{about the}} whole affair. He was under {{pressure}} from the U.S. to reopen diplomatic ties and to act militarily against the sanctuaries; from the North Vietnamese, who now received 80 percent of their supplies for their southernmost operations through Sihanoukville; and from the fledgling Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge (approximately 4,000 men). Sihanouk felt that this was a propitious moment to swing back to the right. By the summer he created a right-wing Government of National Salvation under General Lon Nol and he suspended DRV arms shipments through his ports.|$|E

5|$|A {{week later}} on 27 September 1822, he {{published}} {{some of his}} findings in his Lettre à M. Dacier, addressed to Bon-Joseph Dacier, secretary of the Paris Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Champollion read the letter before the assembled Académie. All his main rivals and supporters were present at the reading, including Young {{who happened to be}} visiting Paris. This was the first meeting between the two. The presentation did not go into details regarding the script and in fact <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> cautious in its suggestions. Although he must have been already certain of this, Champollion merely suggested that the script was phonetic already from the earliest available texts, which would mean that the Egyptians had developed writing independently of the other civilizations around the Mediterranean. The paper also still contained confusions regarding the relative role of ideographic and phonetic signs, still arguing that also hieratic and demotic were primarily ideographic.|$|E
5|$|As expected, the Australian team's leaders Ian Johnson and Keith Miller, {{retired from}} cricket after the tour. Harvey {{replaced}} Johnson as Victorian captain {{and was the}} logical choice as successor to the Test captaincy, as the most experienced {{member of the team}} (48 Tests). Queensland's captain, the veteran paceman Ray Lindwall, was no longer an automatic Test selection. However, both Harvey and Benaud had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. Harvey <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> overlooked for the captaincy, which went to Ian Craig, who had replaced Miller as New South Wales skipper. Craig was only 22 and had played six Tests; he had yet to establish himself in the team. After several disappointing results against England, the selectors chose a youthful team. Harvey was named vice-captain to Craig for both the 1956–57 non-Test tour of New Zealand and the 1957–58 Test tour to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Death Cab for Cutie {{began as}} a solo project of Ben Gibbard in 1997, while he was the guitar player for the band Pinwheel, and was {{recorded}} under the name All-Time Quarterback. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords the same year. The release <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the project into a complete band, recruiting Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as lead guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass player, and Nathan Good as drummer. Death Cab for Cutie was officially formed at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, and lyrics from early songs include local references that were important to the band's development. Many of the early songs were recorded {{in the basement of}} an Ellis Street home Gibbard lived in with several roommates in Bellingham.|$|E

5|$|Lee Chong Wei {{started the}} 2009 season with his fifth Malaysia Open title. He failed to secure his first Korea Open and All England Open title despite marching into the final. However, he secured his second {{title of the}} year in the Swiss Open which was held in Basel, {{defeating}} Lin Dan in straight sets and marking his first win in the finals against the Chinese opponent outside home turf. Next, Lee <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> defeated by Chen Long of China in the India Open. He cited the loss was due to food poisoning and insisted the authorities improve the conditions before the World Championships. In May, Lee helped Malaysia reach the semi-finals of the Sudirman Cup, the first in national history, despite his unbeaten record in the tournament being blown out by Lin Dan. He won another two titles in June, the Indonesia Open and the Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold, despite failing to defend his Singapore Open title when he was taken by Nguyen Tien Minh in the second round.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Rushden & Diamonds in December 2006, {{with the club}} sitting 22nd in the table, two points adrift of safety. Westley's first game in charge of Rushden was a 1–0 victory away at Cambridge United, as he set about ensuring safety. Westley secured the signatures of several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage; signing the likes of Jamie Cook, David Perpetuini, and Dino Maamria. Westley also brought in the likes of Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley – younger players who he had previously written about in his weekly column in The Non-League Paper {{when he was out}} of work. Westley's newly assembled team secured five straight wins in the league, including wins away at the top two teams in the league at the time, Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge. Despite managing an upturn {{in the form of the}} club, Westley <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> sacked after a 2–2 draw at Aldershot Town in February 2007. He had taken the club from 22nd in the league to 12th in the space of two and a half months, and the club were on a seven-match unbeaten run at the time. In all, he managed Rushden for 13 games; winning seven, drawing three and losing three. The reason behind Westley's sacking is unknown, but he was replaced two days later by Garry Hill.|$|E
5|$|On 26 August, the {{aircraft}} carrier HMS Victorious sailed from Singapore with her two escorting destroyers, HMS Caesar and HMS Cavendish, bound for Fremantle in Western Australia. The genuine purpose of the voyage is still disputed, but {{it is probable that}} the carrier group was passing through as a show of strength to Indonesia {{in the wake of the}} Pontian landings as well as the routine 'goodwill visit' that the vessel was purportedly making to Britain's ally. The task force <b>was</b> <b>surprisingly</b> met by very little Indonesian response as it passed through their territorial waters, the carrier reporting only a single Tupolev Tu-16 aircraft making a flyover as the warships passed through the Sunda Strait the following day. The ownership of the Strait itself was complex, as Indonesia claimed it despite British assertions that it was an international waterway that her warships could pass through at any time. Following standard British procedure in such a situation, the British Military Attache in Jakarta had telephoned ahead to the Indonesian Director of Naval Intelligence that the squadron would be passing through Indonesian territory without seeking their clearance, a precedent set the last time Britain had used the Straits in October 1963. This policy, engineered by the Foreign Office, had the dual purpose of notifying the Indonesians of a possibly provocative action without recognizing what they thought to be exaggerated claims on international waters. The return date to Singapore was not set exactly at the time of sailing but was to be sometime in mid-September.|$|E
