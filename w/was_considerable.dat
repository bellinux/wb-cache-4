5|$|Additionally, the {{definition}} kept Pluto as a planet. Pluto's planetary status {{was and is}} fondly thought of by many, especially in the United States since Pluto was found by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, {{and the general public}} could have been alienated from professional astronomers; there <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> uproar when the media last suggested, in 1999, that Pluto might be demoted, which was a misunderstanding of a proposal to catalog all trans-Neptunian objects uniformly.|$|E
5|$|After the Imperial Japanese Navy's {{attacks on}} the Allies in December 1941, the RAN redeployed its larger ships to home waters, to protect the Australian {{mainland}} from Japanese attack, while several smaller ships remained in the Mediterranean.

An internal Navy memorandum set forth four {{options for the}} submarine's extended use. These included configuration {{to serve as a}} command ship (SSCN) for a fleet or force commander, an advanced sonar scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine (SSGN), or a minelaying submarine. However, {{with the exception of the}} command ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the planet Neptune in 1846, there <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and culminated {{at the start of the}} 20th with Percival Lowell's quest for PlanetX. Lowell proposed the PlanetX hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, {{problems}} with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing allies of the U.S. at a disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France's Dassault Mirage 2000. Barry N. Blechman, Assistant Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales. At the same time, there <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.|$|E

The tension culminated in what has been called the Cochise County feud, and the Earp-Clanton feud, which ended with the historic Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Ride.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages there <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> {{variation}} in the nomination of the archbishop and other bishops. At various times the choice {{was made by the}} canons of Canterbury Cathedral, the king of England, or the Pope.

5|$|The 6th Airborne Division, {{which was}} {{under the command of}} Major-General Richard Gale, was chosen to conduct the {{airborne}} operations on the eastern flank of the invasion area. The division was new, having been activated in April 1943, and Operation Overlord would be its first experience of combat. The division was the first to be established {{for the sole purpose of}} undertaking division-level airborne operations rather than contributing to a range of smaller operations, and there <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> debate over what the unit should do.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>considerable</b> anti-Chinese {{sentiment}} in Australia at this time. As a boy, Sing {{was well known}} for his shooting skill, but {{was the subject of}} racial prejudice due to his ancestry. He began work hauling timber as a youth, and later worked as a stockman and a sugarcane cutter. Sing became well known for his marksmanship, both as a kangaroo shooter and as a competitive target shooter. In the latter role, {{he was a member of}} the Proserpine Rifle Club. He regularly won prizes for his shooting, and also played cricket with skill.|$|E
