40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{objective}} of the project is defined in two phases. The first phase is to study the effect of oil composition and carboxylic acids in the crude oil on the <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> and wettability alteration process using “Smart Water”. It {{has been reported that}} the major types of acidic compounds in crude oil were identified as carboxylic acids, phenols, carbazoles, and amides. The phenols and carboxylic acids comprise the major portion of the acidic species. The water soluble components of the carboxylic material are {{a small fraction of the}} total amount of carboxylic acids in the crude oil. They play an important role in establishing the initial <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> by contributing to destabilize the water film between the rock and oil. In this work, we have extracted water-soluble acids from a crude oil with high acid number (AN) to study the effect of these acidic materials on the <b>wetting</b> <b>condition.</b> Two crude oils have been prepared with almost the same acid number: the original oil, RES 40 and synthetic crude oil containing only water-soluble acids termed EWS-oil. Two parallel cores were saturated and aged with each crude oil. The cores were subjected to spontaneous imbibition to study the oil displacement efficiency by “Smart Water”. The potentiality of seawater as a wettability modifier has been investigated previously. The mechanism of wettability alteration has been proposed based on the interactions between the rock surface and the potential determining ions Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and SO 4 2 - present in seawater. It was concluded that, not only the strength of the bonding of carboxylic material onto the calcite surface dictated by the carboxylic group, AN, is an important wetting parameter; but also the organic structure of the carboxylic material may have an impact on the <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> as well. The second phase of the project is to study the application of Enzymes to improve the <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> towards water-wetness. An enzyme-based method has already been reported, which generates organic acids for a variety of acidizing applications such as a matrix acidizing, the stimulation of natural fracture networks, damage removal over long horizontal intervals. The generation of acid in-situ following placement of the fluid ensures the even delivery of acid over the whole of the treated zone. Two cores were saturated and aged with the crude oil, RES 40. After forced displacement with seawater depleted in sulfate and establishing residual oil saturation, the enzyme solution was injected into the cores and shut-in for 48 or 96 hours in an attempt to improve the <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> towards water-wetness. Later, the chromatographic wettability test was performed to monitor the change in the <b>wetting</b> <b>condition.</b> No improvement in the <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> and displacement efficiency was observed after enzyme injection...|$|E

40|$|A re-circulatory {{vegetable}} moisturizer {{for preventing}} wilting in vegetables {{was developed and}} its performance evaluation carried out. Freshly harvested Amaranthus vegetables {{were used for the}} experiments. The temperature and relative humidity were monitored daily. The vitamin A of this produce was determined at intervals of two days for 9 days. The effects of the storage parameters (temperature and relative humidity) on the nutritional value of the produce were determined using statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA). Further analysis by Duncan’s New Multiple Range Test (DNMRT) was carried out to compare the means. The vegetable moisturizer was evaluated by comparing the change in nutritional (vitamin A) of Amaranthus vegetable with hand wetting system and no <b>wetting</b> <b>condition.</b> The results showed that the moisturizer had higher mean vitamin A content (4. 93 mg/ 100 g) compared to the mean vitamin A content of the manual wetting (4. 88 mg/ 100 g) and no <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> (4. 57 mg/ 100 g). The sensory characteristics showed that the Moisturizer was more desirable when compared to the manual wetting and no <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> after nine days. It was concluded that the Moisturizer preserved the nutritional and sensory characteristics (texture and colour) better than the manual and no <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> as a result of lower temperature, higher relative humidity and better water draining of the Moisturizer...|$|E

40|$|Water-Based Enhanced Oil {{recovery}} (EOR) by injecting "Smart Water" in Carbonate Reservoirs {{have shown}} promising results. The success of EOR-process waterflooding by “Smart Water” is {{dictated by the}} initial <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> of the rock and the potential of EOR methods related to wettability alteration. It is also found that adsorption of polar organic components has the largest effect on the wettability alteration in carbonates. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to show adsorption of polar organic components towards water wet chalks surface with different initial water saturation (0 %, 10 %, and 100 %). Three cores with 0 %, 10 %, and 100 % initial water saturation were flooded 15 pore volumes (PV) of crude oil with fix Acid Number (AN= 0. 35 mgKOH/g) and Base Number (BN= 0. 20 mgKOH/g) at 50 ° C. The core without initial water saturation adsorbed most polar components in comparison with other cores. Wettability of the cores was analyzed by spontaneous, forced imbibition and chromatographic wettability tests. Based on oil recovery and chromatographic wetting index, the experimental results showed that the core initially saturated with 100 % water behaved more water-wet core than other two cores. The observations were in the followings: 1) The <b>wetting</b> <b>condition</b> of chalks is strongly linked to the acidic oil components. 2) As adsorption of polar components on the rock surface increases, it continuously causes decrease of water wetness. 3) Initial water saturation has a strong influence on the <b>wetting</b> <b>condition,</b> as increasing water saturation can be seen to provide a more water wet condition because of reducing the amount of appropriate cites for adsorption in the core...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was an {{investigation}} of the influence of different storage conditions on the bond strength between cp-titanium and two veneering porcelains. Both porcelain compound systems were investigated with and without the use of porcelain bonder. The porcelains under investigation were Vita Titankeramik (Vita) and Triceram (Esprident). The titanium test specimens of I defined size of 25 mm x 3 mm x 0, 5 mm were individually manufactured at the dental laboratory Ticost (Brandenburg) as described in detail in chapter 3. 3. <<in the following, seven test specimens each were stored under different conditions: Triceram with porcelain bonder, Vita Titankeramik without porcelain bonder, all having been veneered as described in detail in chapter 3. 5. 28 test series were conducted with 7 test specimens of the four different types each under the following conditions: 28 test specimens were stored under dry conditions. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for on week. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for one month. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for six month. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for one week. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for one month. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for six months. The resulting bond strength was evaluated and their effects significantly higher bond strength could only be found for Triceram with bonder stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for six months as compared to Triceram with bonder stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for six months. When no bonder is used a range of significant differences can be found: It can be stated that bond strengths decrease with the duration of storage. Similar results were found for Vita Titankeramik. With the use of bonder no significant differences in bond strength can be found. But again, if no bonder is used bond strength values decrease significantly over time. With porcelain veneered titanium a bonder should definitely be used and is indispensable. Even after short storage durations results do not differ significantly between dry storage <b>conditions</b> and <b>wet</b> storage <b>conditions.</b> The investigations show that with longer duration of storage under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> bond strength will profit from the use of a bonder.
