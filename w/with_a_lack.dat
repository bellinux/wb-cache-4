5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August 25, and ultimately discontinued {{about three days}} later. Two cruise ships left Bermuda early to avoid the storm, and another two postponed their scheduled stops there. The threat of the storm, combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of passengers due to cruise ship diversions, resulted in the suspension of ferry service. Cristobal ultimately passed well to the northwest of the island, producing breezy conditions and heightened surf.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence {{continues}} to accumulate that oxidative stress is etiologically {{important in the}} pathogenesis of age-related maculopathy (ARM) and that appropriate antioxidants of dietary origin may protect against this condition. OBJECTIVE: Risk factors for ARM may be classed as established or putative. We report a study designed to investigate whether such risk factors are associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dietary <b>lack</b> of antioxidants relevant to retinal health. DESIGN: Dietary, anthropometric, and sociodemographic details relating to 828 healthy Irish subjects aged 20 - 60 y were recorded in a cross-sectional fashion and analyzed for associations between risk factors for ARM and dietary intake of relevant nutrients. RESULTS: Of the established risk factors for ARM, increasing age was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> of dietary zeaxanthin (P < 0. 05) and tobacco use <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> of dietary vitamin C (P < 0. 05). Of the putative risk factors for ARM, alcohol consumption was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> of dietary alpha-linoleic acid (P < 0. 05), and female sex was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> of dietary zinc (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: We showed that several variables related to risk for ARM are associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relative dietary <b>lack</b> of key nutrients. Our finding that age, {{the most important and}} universal risk factor for ARM, is associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> of dietary zeaxanthin, is an important finding that warrants further investigation...|$|R

5|$|Giselle was revived in 1863 {{with new}} costumes by Lormier's assistant, Alfred Albert. Albert's costumes {{are closer to}} those of modern {{productions}} than those of Lormier, and were in use at the opera until 1868. The ballet was revived again in 1924 with scenery and costumes by Alexandre Benois. He wanted to revive the costumes of the original production but dropped the idea, believing the critics would charge him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of imaginative creativity.|$|E

5|$|Overall, Hurricane Katrina killed 14people in the state, {{of which}} 6 were {{directly}} related to the storm. Six of the indirect deaths were in South Florida, of which three were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one was due to a vehicle accident, one occurred during debris cleanup, and one was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of electricity. At least five people were injured due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Overall damage totaled $623million (2005USD).|$|E

FinTech companies use technology to assess these borrowers’ creditworthiness inexpensively—an advantage over traditional banks with many small stores in lower-income neighborhoods across the country (Hayashi, 2016).|$|R
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Neuner hinted the {{upcoming}} season might be her last. She began the winter in Östersund with the best season start of her career, beating Tora Berger by 0.2 seconds in the sprint to claim her 25th World Cup win. She also came third in the individual and the pursuit, and took the yellow bib of the Overall World Cup leader. On 6 December 2011, Neuner announced her retirement from biathlon {{by the end of the}} season on her homepage. She explained her early departure from the sport (at age 25) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of motivation and her desire for a normal life. Neuner nonetheless continued her good form in Hochfilzen, where she claimed her 26th World Cup win in the sprint.|$|E
5|$|By June, {{the band}} had {{performed}} another Italian tour (the third that year) {{and wanted to}} start recording new material (some of which ended up on Hammill's 1973 solo album Chameleon in the Shadow of the Night). However, the combination of working for too long without a break, combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of support from Stratton-Smith and Charisma and continued financial difficulties caused the band to implode, and Hammill left to pursue a solo career in mid-1972.|$|E
5|$|Copeland was {{appointed}} a soloist at ABT in August 2007, {{one of the}} youngest ABT dancers promoted to soloist. Although, she was described by early accounts as the first African American woman promoted to soloist for ABT, Anne Benna Sims and Nora Kimball were soloists with ABT in the 1980s. Male soloist Keith Lee also preceded her. As of 2008, Copeland was the only African-American woman in the dance company during her entire ABT career. The only male African American in the company during her career, Danny Tidwell, left in 2005. In an international ballet community <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of diversity, she was so unusual as an African American ballerina, that she endured cultural isolation. She has been described in the press as the Jackie Robinson of classical ballet.|$|E
500|$|Overall, reviewers {{are mixed}} {{in their final}} {{assessment}} of Karas. Their common reaction is of a visually stunning show <b>with</b> <b>a</b> confusing story. DVD Talk commented the blending of traditional 2D drawings and 3D CG was interesting; but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lacking</b> story, the product is a [...] "triumph of style over substance".

5|$|In early May, an upper-level trough dropped southward {{through the}} western Atlantic Ocean, forcing a {{back-door}} cold front—a cold front that moves southwestward {{ahead of a}} building surface ridge to its north or northeast—southward. For several days, forecast models had anticipated for the trough to evolve into a closed low pressure area, and on May 6, a frontal low with a large and well-defined circulation developed about 90miles (140km) east of Cape Hatteras. The low maintained scattered convection around its circulation center, and {{in conjunction with the}} strong high pressure to its north, a very tight pressure gradient produced gale-force winds near the coastline. The extratropical storm tracked southeastward and later turned to the southwest while steadily deepening; on May 7, it attained hurricane-force winds. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of tropical moisture, its corresponding convection was minimal and scattered.|$|E
5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} in rural environments {{made use of}} local materials and styles. As in England, cruck construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof; however they were usually hidden from view. In rural areas there was extensive use of turf {{to fill in the}} walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt frequently, perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing.|$|E

5|$|Puccini {{had long}} {{considered}} writing {{a set of}} one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy Il tabarro and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera Suor Angelica. Gianni Schicchi, a comedy, completes the triptych with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, {{and it has been}} praised for its inventiveness and imagination.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} {{to relieve the}} citadel ended in farce. Badly-drilled reinforcements sent by the Habsburgs fled in fear of the Ottomans, and their {{attempts to}} re-board their boats at Solin Bay caused many vessels to sink. Niccolo dalla Torre and the papal commissioner managed to escape. Kružić himself– who had left the fortress {{to make contact with}} the reinforcements- was captured and executed; the sight of his head on a stick overwhelmed the remaining defenders of Klis, who were now willing to give up the fortress in return for safe passage north. After Kružić's death, and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of water supplies, the Klis defenders finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom, on 12 March 1537. Many of the citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated to the city of Senj, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army.|$|E
5|$|The early Middle Ages were {{a period}} of climate deterioration, with a drop in {{temperature}} {{and an increase in}} rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes, each probably containing a nuclear family, with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance. The climate was more favourable for oats and barley than for corn. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare.|$|E
