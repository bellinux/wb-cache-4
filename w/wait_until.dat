5|$|Leftovers of wolf kills are {{sometimes}} scavenged by wolverines. Wolverines usually <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the wolves are done feeding, {{but have been}} known to drive away wolves from kills. However, there have been confirmed reports of wolf packs killing wolverines.|$|E
5|$|The {{losses of}} the spring {{campaign}} had weakened the Luftwaffe before the Battle of Britain. The service was forced to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> it had reached acceptable levels before a main assault against the RAF could be made.|$|E
5|$|After {{evaluating}} the imagery sent {{down from the}} late inspection, the ground team officially cleared the orbiter's thermal protection system for re-entry. Initially, NASA had planned on releasing Endeavour from its stand-by status following the late inspection, but managers on the ground decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> Atlantis had performed the de-orbit burn before standing down the STS-400 rescue mission officially.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} {{over whether the}} object would be classified as a planet or a minor planet, because different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects, the decision on what to name the object had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> after the August 24, 2006, IAU ruling. As a result, for a time the object became known to the wider public as Xena.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, RFC 1738 {{formally}} defined relative {{and absolute}} URLs, refined the general URL syntax, defined how to resolve relative URLs to absolute form, and better enumerated the URL schemes then in use. The agreed definition and syntax of URNs had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> {{the publication of}} RFC 2141 in May 1997.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Joey is in a {{hospital}} room of his own, where a doctor informs him that he's suffering from kidney stones. As they're too close to his bladder, Joey is given two options: <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> he passes them naturally, or have a procedure, which he finds too invasive. Opting for the former, he gives 'birth' to the kidney stones, concurrent with Phoebe’s birth.|$|E

50|$|Following this attack, the LRA {{dispersed}} {{into several}} groups, {{each of which}} targeted civilians along its path. The rebels <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> December 24 for the most devastating of their attacks, <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> people had come together for Christmas festivities, then surrounding and killing them by crushing their skulls with axes, machetes, and large wooden bats.|$|R
5|$|The {{spirit of}} peace and {{reconciliation}} established by the Dictum of Kenilworth lasted {{for the remainder of}} Henry III's reign and into the 1290s. In 1270, Prince Edward left the country to go on crusade in the Holy Land. When his father died in 1272, Edward felt in a safe enough position to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 1274 before returning home to claim the throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{timing of}} black vultures' {{breeding}} season {{varies with the}} latitude at which they live. In the United States, birds in Florida begin breeding as early as January, for example, while those in Ohio generally do not start before March. In South America, Argentinian and Chilean birds begin egg-laying as early as September, while those further north on the continent typically <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> October. Some in South America breed even later than that—black vultures in Trinidad typically do not start until November, for example, and those in Ecuador may <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> February. Pairs are formed following a courtship ritual which is performed on the ground: several males circle a female with their wings partially open as they strut and bob their heads. They sometimes perform courtship flights, diving or chasing each other over their chosen nest site.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E

5|$|After {{using the}} plot of the aborted 1884 {{collaboration}} with Archer to complete Widowers' Houses (it was staged twice in London, in December 1892), Shaw continued writing plays. At first he made slow progress; The Philanderer, written in 1893 but not published until 1898, had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 1905 for a stage production. Similarly, Mrs Warren's Profession (1893) was written five years before publication and nine years before reaching the stage.|$|E
5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the next election season.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all {{the doors and windows}} to the house were shut, except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fentolin <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> he had finished. Then {{he waved}} him away.|$|R

5|$|Brigadier General J.F.K. Mansfield, {{commander}} of the Department of Washington, argued that Northern Virginia should be occupied {{as soon as possible}} in order to prevent the possibility of the Confederate Army mounting artillery on the hills of Arlington and shelling government buildings in Washington. He also urged the erection of fortifications on the Virginia side of the Potomac River to protect the southern terminuses of the Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge. His superiors approved these recommendations, but decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> after Virginia voted for or against secession.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{promising}} start Reid failed {{to recapture the}} form he had shown at Forest and had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> May before netting for his new club, coming against Aston Villa in a 5–1 win {{at the end of}} the season. Making only 20 starts in 26 appearances he scored just one goal for Tottenham leading him to be listed by one journalist as one of the worst signings of the January Transfer market.|$|E

5|$|Females of P. labiata and P. schultzi try to {{kill and}} eat their mates during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging. The males <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the females have hunched their legs, making this attack less likely. Males also try to abseil from a silk thread to approach from above, but females may manoeuvre to get the higher position. If the female moves at all, the male leaps and runs away.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{departure}} from Luton, Whalley joined Shrewsbury Town, recently promoted to League One, on 6 June 2015. Making only sporadic substitute {{appearances in the}} early part of the season, Whalley had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 28 December to make his first league start for the club, scoring a late winning goal in a 2–1 away victory over Crewe Alexandra. He scored another late winner away at the league-leaders Burton Albion the following month, eventually ending the season with seven goals in all competitions as Shrewsbury avoided relegation with a game to spare.|$|E
5|$|In 1530, Mingyi Nyo's son 14-year-old Tabinshwehti succeeded him as king. Toungoo's {{stability}} {{continued to}} attract manpower {{from the surrounding}} regions, especially after 1533 when the Confederation sacked its erstwhile ally Prome. The tiny Toungoo was now the only ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded by much larger kingdoms. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation was distracted by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led. Tabinshwehti decided not to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the larger kingdoms' attention turned to him.|$|E
