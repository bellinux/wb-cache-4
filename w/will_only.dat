5|$|A 24-inch 1080p PlayStation branded 3D television, officially {{called the}} PlayStation 3D Display, was {{released}} in late 2011. A feature of this 3D television is SimulView. During multiplayer games, each player <b>will</b> <b>only</b> see their respective screen (in full HD) appear on the television through their respective 3D glasses, instead of seeing a split screen (e.g. player 1 <b>will</b> <b>only</b> see player 1's screen displayed through their 3D glasses).|$|E

5|$|Long term {{proposals}} by {{the province}} call for Highway 404 {{to be extended}} to Highway12, between Sunderland and Beaverton. This extension would follow a new alignment to Port Bolster, east of which the freeway would incorporate the existing two lanes of Highway48. It has drawn criticism from various environmental groups who claim it <b>will</b> <b>only</b> serve to accelerate urban sprawl north of Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Several {{anti-noise}} {{and electric}} car advocates have opposed {{the introduction of}} artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as {{they argue that the}} proposed system <b>will</b> <b>only</b> increase noise pollution. They also opposed U.S. pending legislation that would require generated warning sounds with no off switch for the driver.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian {{consulate}} requires Indonesian domestic {{workers to}} use the services of employment agencies. The consulate can do this because the Hong Kong Immigration Department <b>will</b> <b>only</b> accept applications for employment visas that have been endorsed by consulates.|$|E

In a {{paper presented}} in New Delhi in 1968, at the triennial {{meeting of the}} General Assembly of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), Dioum made the much anthologised statement: [...] "In the end we <b>will</b> conserve <b>only</b> what we love, we <b>will</b> love <b>only</b> what we understand, and we <b>will</b> understand <b>only</b> what we are taught." [...] His major concerns have been agricultural development and natural resource management.|$|R

5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money <b>will</b> <b>only</b> generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
5|$|After several sightings, the Fringe team {{move into}} some nearby storm drains to bait the chimera with its larvae. Feeling {{somewhat}} responsible, Walter locks himself {{in with the}} chimera and ingests some poison that will kill him within the hour, believing that if it kills him, the chimera <b>will</b> <b>only</b> be killing itself. He manages to shoot the chimera in time however, and they use its blood {{to find a cure}} for Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Although spiders {{are widely}} feared, {{only a few}} species are {{dangerous}} to people. Spiders <b>will</b> <b>only</b> bite humans in self-defense, and few produce worse effects than a mosquito bite or bee-sting. Most of those with medically serious bites, such as recluse spiders and widow spiders, would rather flee and bite only when trapped, although this can easily arise by accident. Funnel web spiders' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom, although they rarely inject much, has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 years. They have been deemed to be the world's most dangerous spiders on clinical and venom toxicity grounds, though this claim has also been attributed to the Brazilian wandering spider, due to much more frequent accidents.|$|E

5|$|An {{impressed}} tutor {{suggested he}} should become an actor and, on Pryce's behalf, {{applied to the}} Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for an application form; Pryce was awarded a scholarship to RADA. When he joined Equity he used Jonathan Pryce as his stage name because Equity <b>will</b> <b>only</b> have one actor with any particular name on its books. While at RADA Pryce worked as a door-to-door salesman of velvet paintings. Pryce {{was part of a}} 'new wave' of actors to emerge from the Academy. Others included Bruce Payne, Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Anton Lesser, Kenneth Branagh and Fiona Shaw.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, House is annoyed {{because he is}} not able to spend enough time with his friend, James Wilson. He {{attempts}} to negotiate with Amber, Wilson's girlfriend, about conditions under which they can both have Wilson's company. They are at a standstill, thus House seeks Lisa Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) resolution. However, she <b>will</b> <b>only</b> lay out the conditions if House does his team's performance reviews (knowing that he hates doing paperwork). House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it <b>will</b> <b>only</b> occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E
