A <b>time</b> <b>bank,</b> also known as a service exchange, is a community that practices <b>time</b> <b>banking.</b> The unit of currency, always valued at an hour's worth of any person's labor, used by these groups has various names but is generally known as a time dollar in the USA and a time credit in the UK. <b>Time</b> <b>banking</b> is primarily used to provide incentives and rewards for work such as mentoring children, caring for the elderly, being neighborly—work usually done on a volunteer basis—which a pure market system devalues.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patters across 22 European countries. The focu was on three questions: how much mothers prefer to work, how much they {{actually}} work, and to what degree their preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> are (in) consistent with each other. The focus was on cross-national differences in mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns, comparison of mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> to that of childless women and fathers, as well as on individual- and country-level factors that explain the variation between them. In the theoretical background, the departure point was an integrative theoretical approach where the assumption is that there are various kinds of explanations for the differences in mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns – namely structural, cultural and institutional –, and that these factors are laid in two levels: individual- and country-levels. Data were extracted from the European Social Survey (ESS) 2010 / 2011. The results showed that mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns, both preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> varied across European countries. Four clusters were formed to illustrate the differences. In the full-time pattern, full-time work was the most important form of work, leaving all other <b>working</b> <b>time</b> forms marginal. The full-time pattern was perceived in terms of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times</b> in Bulgaria and Portugal. In polarised pattern countries, full-time work was also important, but it was accompanied by a large share of mothers not working at all. In the case of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> many Eastern and Southern European countries followed it whereas in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> it included all Eastern and Southern European countries as well as Finland. The combination pattern was characterised by the importance of long part-time hours and full-time work. It was the preferred <b>working</b> <b>time</b> pattern in the Nordic countries, France, Slovenia, and Spain, but Belgium, Denmark, France, Norway, and Sweden followed it in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> The fourth cluster that described mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> was called the part-time pattern, and it was illustrated by the prevalence of short and long part-time work. In the case of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> it was followed in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Besides Belgium, the part-time pattern was followed in the same countries in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> The consistency between preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> was rather strong in a majority of countries. However, six countries fell under different <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns when preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> were compared. Comparison of working mothers’, childless women’s, and fathers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> showed that differences between these groups were surprisingly small. It was only in part-time pattern countries that working mothers worked significantly shorter hours than working childless women and fathers. Results therefore revealed that when mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> are under study, an important question regarding the population examined is whether it consists of all mothers or only working mothers. Results moreover supported the use of the integrative theoretical approach when studying mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns. Results indicate that mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns in all countries are shaped by various opportunities and constraints, which are comprised of structural, cultural, institutional, and individual-level factors.

One way of developing co-production is <b>time</b> <b>banking,</b> a form of community currency that has developed in the UK since the 1990 s and is gaining increased policy attention with Governments in England and Wales. This research examines the relationship between <b>time</b> <b>banking</b> and co-production within health care. The starting point {{of the study is}} two-fold. First there is an interest in the claimed health benefits of <b>time</b> <b>banking</b> and its potential for service delivery. To explore these issues the research specifically examines the mechanisms which generate social capital and social networks through <b>time</b> <b>bank</b> participation to offer a more nuanced analysis of the health outcomes currently found in the literature.

The intention has been to investigate the work environment impacts of unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> and what differences there are from a gender perspective. The conclusion is that workers who enter into agreements for unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> have significantly different terms from traditional workers. Workers with unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> are exempted from the <b>working</b> <b>time</b> law and so even the provided safety net.
