25|$|It's like St. Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for <b>what</b> <b>my</b> people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that they were giving us something again.|$|E
25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of <b>what</b> <b>my</b> life would be like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E

25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me <b>what</b> <b>my</b> name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

Rob Bowman, in his book Soulsville, U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records, wrote that in these two songs [...] "Otis sings with a harsh, impassioned gospel voice reminiscent of Archie Brownlee of the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi" [...] and further reckoned the ending of the first would have made Redding [...] "a suberb gospel singer had he chosen to record in that idiom." [...] "That's <b>What</b> <b>My</b> Heart Needs" [...] became Redding's second single on Stax.|$|E

Mahendra recalled in 2007, [...] "When I first met [...] I explained him <b>what</b> <b>my</b> kind of movie is and what I expect from him.

500|$|During the {{production}} of THX 1138 (1971), producer Francis Ford Coppola challenged co-writer/director George Lucas to write a script that would appeal to mainstream audiences. Lucas embraced the idea, using his early 1960s teenage experiences cruising in Modesto, California. [...] "Cruising was gone, and I felt compelled to document the whole experience and <b>what</b> <b>my</b> generation used {{as a way of}} meeting girls," [...] Lucas explained. As he developed the story in his mind, Lucas included his fascination with Wolfman Jack. Lucas had considered doing a documentary about the Wolfman when he attended the USC School of Cinematic Arts, but dropped the idea.|$|E
