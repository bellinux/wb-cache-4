The violent acts were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed {{of violence in the}} real world. The focus was not on the direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the perpetrators or <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> act.|$|E

5|$|Also {{dating from}} this time is Beauchief Abbey, which was founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that {{it was founded in}} 1183. Samuel Pegge in his History of Beauchief Abbey notes that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, {{who was one of the}} <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.|$|E
50|$|There {{appeared}} a man sent from God, {{whose name was}} John; he came as a <b>witness</b> — <b>to</b> bear <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light so that through him everyone might believe. He was not the light, but he came <b>to</b> bear <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light.|$|R
2500|$|To keep “a clear {{conscience}} toward God {{and toward}} men”(Acts 24:16), Christians must follow Christ’s example “to bear <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truth.”(John 18:37) [...] The Christian {{is not to}} “be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord.”(2 Timothy 1:8) [...] In situations that require <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> faith, the Christian must profess it without equivocation. Christian <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gospel and the obligations that flow from it are an act of justice that establishes the truth or makes it known. [...] Catholic teaching regards martyrdom as <b>the</b> supreme <b>witness</b> given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truth of the faith: it means bearing witness even unto death.|$|R

5|$|Following the explosion, the {{remaining}} gunmen {{opened fire on}} the dazed band members, who had all been knocked down into the field {{below the level of}} the road from the force of the blast. The order to shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing. Three of the musicians were killed: lead singer Fran O'Toole, trumpeter Brian McCoy, and guitarist Tony Geraghty.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{finds that}} police across the United States have {{received}} calls from <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> killing. The police believe {{it to be}} a hoax but Black is convinced of its authenticity. He and fellow Group members Brian Roedecker (Allan Zinyk) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) identify the victim as Rebecca Damsen. Damsen's email correspondence leads them to a San Jose address; Watts finds the bodies of both the owner and Damsen in a nearby graveyard. By the bodies is another number, which they determine to be an IP address.|$|E
5|$|The {{hearing in}} the case of Ruto, Kosgey and Sang took place in The Hague between 1 and 8 September 2011. The three {{defendants}} had all filed applications challenging the jurisdiction of the court which were rejected by the chamber. Although the defence teams had initially proposed calling 43 <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> confirmation of charges hearings the chamber instructed them to present just two witnesses each at the confirmation hearings, which they did. Ruto and Sang additionally made unsworn statements in person.|$|E

5|$|The {{survivors}} at the shingle, many facing combat for {{the first}} time, found themselves relatively well-protected from small arms fire, but still exposed to artillery and mortars. In front of them lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from the bluffs above. Morale naturally became a problem. Many groups were leaderless and <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fate of neighboring troops and landings coming in around them. Wounded men on the beach were drowning in the incoming tide and incoming landing craft were being pounded and set ablaze.|$|E
5|$|<b>Witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crash were in {{universal}} {{agreement that}} the aircraft had not struck any foreign objects on the runway. Also, no pieces of the wing or other aircraft components were found with the separated engine, other than its supporting pylon, leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free of the airframe and struck the engine. Hence the engine/pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a structural failure.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{spent most}} of 1145 and 1146 at the papal court in Rome, {{although}} some time during that period he was in England {{as one of the}} <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peace accord signed between the earls of Chester and Leicester. He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but he was back in England by {{the time of his death}} the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, probably on the 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral, and he was buried at Lincoln on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.|$|E

5|$|Carl Probyn {{witnessed}} the abduction of his stepdaughter from {{within sight of}} their home. He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.|$|E
5|$|During a hailstorm in Washington state, {{university}} students run to find shelter. One girl, Lauren (Kristi Angus), {{stands in the}} rain, lights a cigarette, and goes up in flames. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question—Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring {{about the end of}} the world. Hoffman believes that this cataclysm will be preceded by strange events and weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|In February 1194 Coutances was in Germany, at {{the court}} of the German emperor, along with Longchamp, who brought letters to Richard, still in captivity. On 4 February, Coutances became a hostage to the German emperor as surety for the payment of the {{outstanding}} portion of Richard's ransom, and the king was released. The king never paid the final instalment of his ransom, and the archbishop had to pay 10,000 marks for his own release. From that point onwards Coutances was no longer involved with English politics or government, and {{spent the rest of}} his career on Norman affairs. His record of charter witnessing bears this out; between 1189 and 1194 Coutances was among the most prolific of the <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king's English charters, but not after 1194.|$|E

She responded by overturning a table, damaging a computer that was sitting on it. A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack, and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged {{her out of the}} room. Several <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incident believed her access to sensitive material ought to have been withdrawn at that point. The following month, January 2010, she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone.|$|E
5|$|Rome's Ciampino airport, {{the site}} of the first Comet hull loss, was the origin of more {{disastrous}} Comet flights just over a year later. On 10 January 1954, 20minutes after taking off from Ciampino, the first production Comet, G-ALYP, broke up in mid-air while operating BOAC Flight 781 and crashed into the Mediterranean off the Italian island of Elba with the loss of all 35 on board. With no <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disaster and only partial radio transmissions as incomplete evidence, no obvious reason for the crash could be deduced. Engineers at de Havilland immediately recommended 60 modifications aimed at any possible design flaw while the Abell Committee met to determine potential causes of the crash. BOAC also voluntarily grounded its Comet fleet pending investigation into the causes of the accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented four <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court. Robert Chobert, a {{cab driver}} who testified he was parked behind Faulkner, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter. Cynthia White, a prostitute, testified that Abu-Jamal {{emerged from a}} nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner. Michael Scanlan, a motorist, testified that from two car lengths away, he saw a man, matching Abu-Jamal's description, run {{across the street from}} a parking lot and shoot Faulkner. Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who did not see the shooting, testified to seeing Faulkner pull over Cook's car. As Abu-Jamal started to cross the street toward them, Magilton turned away and lost sight of what happened next.|$|E

5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E
5|$|Warelwast {{may have}} been with the hunting party on 2 August 1100 in which King William was accidentally killed, as {{he was one of}} the <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter sent on 5August 1100 from William IIs brother, the new King Henry I to Anselm recalling the archbishop. King Henry {{continued}} to use Warelwast as an ambassador, sending him to Rome in 1101 to bring back Pope Paschal II's reply to a letter written by Henry immediately after his accession. Henry was seeking a reconciliation with the papacy, and confirmed to the pope the rights and obedience which his father had rendered, but he also requested the same rights within the Church as his father had enjoyed, chiefly the lay investiture of bishops and the granting of the symbols of episcopal authority by laymen. Paschal declined to grant Henry those rights.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} before Leo's paper, the first small papyrus {{fragment}} was found, and {{the first half of}} the twentieth century would see the publication of several other pieces which added significantly to the modern text of the Catalogue. Among these finds were important passages, the Catalogue of Suitors and Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis for example, but few advanced the modern understanding of the work's overall structure. The appearance of the proem in 1956 actually led to a major misapprehension, for the list of gods found therein, beginning with Zeus and proceeding through the divine Heracles, led some to believe that the Catalogue was not organized in a strictly genealogical manner, but presented the unions of gods and heroines organized to some extent by amorous deity. Six years later, with the publication of the 28th part of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the corpus of papyrus <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fragmentary Hesiodic poems was nearly doubled, with the lion's share of these new texts belonging to the Catalogue. The new papyri proved once and for all that the poem was organized by genealogies of the great families in a way similar to the Bibliotheca, and that the poet's use of the ē' hoiē-formula was not a random method of introduction but an organizing tool within an overall structure.|$|E
