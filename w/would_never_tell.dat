2500|$|... "I {{was present}} at the death of Crazy Horse; he was my cousin; his father and his two wives and an uncle of Crazy Horse took the body away, and no one knows today where he is buried. Several years later, they went to see how the body was, and when the ground was removed, they found the bones, and they were petrified; they <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> where they buried him." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is also {{reportedly}} {{a silver}} mine {{known to the}} Indians here. [...] Local Indians had Work mill their corn, and paid him in silver ore. [...] When Work asked {{of the source of}} the ore, the Indians said they had a mine, but they <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> any white where the mine was located. [...] If such a mine exists, it has yet to be found. Gold flakes have been found in the stream, enough to fill a vial.|$|E
2500|$|Danforth brings Elizabeth in {{to confirm}} this story, {{beforehand}} forbidding anyone {{to tell her about}} John's testimony. Unaware of John's public confession, Elizabeth fears that Abigail has revealed the affair in order to discredit John and lies, saying that there was no affair, and that she fired Abigail out of wild suspicion. Hale begs Danforth to reconsider his judgement, now agreeing Abigail is [...] "false", but to no avail; Danforth throws out this testimony based solely upon John's earlier assertion that Elizabeth <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> a lie.|$|E
60|$|He {{was always}} just that strict and delicate. He <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> a lie himself.|$|R

2500|$|Heap {{states that}} her song lyrics come from {{personal}} experience, {{but are not}} straightforwardly confessional. She has stated [...] "Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mum or my dad. I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> them that these songs are about them or which specific lyric is about somebody. Often, when I sit down to write a lyric, {{it is in the}} heat of the moment, and something has just happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 CNN {{segment on}} {{the origins of}} Festivus, O'Keefe spoke about the real-life {{experiences}} related to the holiday. O'Keefe's father, who originated some of the now-recognized Festivus traditions, used a clock, not an aluminum pole. O'Keefe told CNN: [...] "The real symbol of the holiday was a clock that my dad put in a bag and nailed to the wall every year...I don't know why, I don't know what it means, he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> me. He would always say, 'That's not for you to know.|$|E
2500|$|On March 9, {{during a}} segment of Mad Money, Cramer admitted, [...] "OK, I'm a tempting target. Plenty of people come in and give their {{criticism}} on this show. But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, but I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{a fellow}} should tumble here he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> live to <b>tell</b> it," [...] said the young ranchman. [...] "This {{would be a}} bad trail {{to follow in the}} dark." ...|$|R
60|$|Harriet and Aurelia had {{divested}} {{themselves of}} their finery before Betty came in, and they assisted her operations, Harriet preferring a complaint that she <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> them anything.|$|R
500|$|I'm {{so excited}} about the 'Alejandro' video, [...] Actually, we're {{shooting}} it very soon and I don't want to say who the director is yet because it's {{going to give a}} lot away. [...] Are you absolutely mad? I <b>would</b> <b>never,</b> ever <b>tell</b> you ! I {{would be more likely to}} lie through my teeth to you [...] what the video's about so that you could all be surprised. But I will tell you it's not the sequel to the 'Telephone' video.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "Me²" [...] (1988), Rimmer {{is shown}} {{moving in with}} his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also {{mentions}} taking a film course at night school, although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with Citizen Kane. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are [...] "gazpacho soup". Demonstrating intense, literal self-hatred, the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to [...] a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during he made a faux pas where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup {{is meant to be}} served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer {{for the rest of his}} life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that [...] "anybody could make a mistake like that." [...] His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his [...] "death" [...] was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the [...] "gazpacho soup" [...] remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> him any other circumstances.|$|E
60|$|Mary Erskine related {{subsequently}} to Mary Bell {{what took}} place at this interview, thus far, but she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> the rest.|$|E
6000|$|She checked herself. That man was hopeless. He <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> {{anything}} {{and there was}} no means of compelling him. He was invulnerable, unapproachable. [...] . He was dead.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked a}} long while on the Lowick road away from the town, glad of the starlit {{darkness}} when it came. He {{felt as if he}} had had dirt cast on him amidst shouts of scorn. There was this to confirm the fellow's statement--that his mother <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> him the reason why she had run away from her family.|$|R
5000|$|Grimes {{has said}} that she is [...] "pro-choice down the line on abortion" [...] and opposes efforts to {{prohibit}} abortion after 20 weeks. She explained [...] "I come {{from a family of}} five women. I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> pretend to <b>tell</b> one of my sisters what to do with their body and I don't want the federal government doing that either.… When it comes to choice, I believe, should a woman have to make that decision, it's between herself, her doctor, and her God." ...|$|R
50|$|Danette {{approaches}} Bullet in an alley, {{asking if}} she knows where Kallie might be. Bullet takes {{her to the}} riverfront, a favorite spot of Kallie's. Danette reminisces about playing hide-and-seek with a younger Kallie, who <b>would</b> <b>never</b> hide. Bullet <b>tells</b> her Kallie will be okay. Bullet later finds Lyric (Julia Sarah Stone) alone in her hotel room, upset about Twitch. Lyric asks Bullet to keep her warm in bed, and they discuss Kallie. She tells Bullet that she notices her, and the two kiss.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eleanor, you are forgetting yourself," [...] said he, {{looking very}} sternly at her. [...] "Otherwise you <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> me that I {{conceive}} any {{man to be}} a messenger from Satan." ...|$|E
60|$|As to {{explaining}} my ejaculations, {{that was}} impossible. I thought the matter {{over and over}} again as I lay awake that night, and I determined that I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> Madeline the facts of the case. It would be better for me to suffer all my life than for her to know that the ghost of her uncle haunted the house. Mr. Hinckman was away, and if she knew of his ghost she could not be made to believe that he was not dead. She might not survive the shock! No, my heart could bleed, but I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' he said quickly, 'she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> {{his real}} name, even {{under threat of}} torture. Poor erring soul, she could be {{faithful}} in her unfaith. Of what would you speak to her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>would</b> <b>never</b> do to <b>tell</b> {{my father}} what Ciceley said. He would bundle the fellow out, neck and crop, and perhaps break {{some of his}} bones, {{and then it would}} be traced to her. She has not a happy home, as it is, and it would be far worse if her father knew that it was she who had put us on our guard. I must find out {{something}} myself, and then we can turn him out, without there being the least suspicion that Ciceley is mixed up in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Sun sank {{behind the}} proud castle of my princely father, as, {{trotting}} slowly along upon my humble beast, with my wallet slung at my side, I approached it through his park. A guard, consisting of {{twenty or thirty}} men in magnificent uniforms, were lounging at the portal. I--but sir, sir, {{what is the meaning}} of this darkness? I always made a vow to myself that I <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> my history. Ah! what ails me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] screamed out the Baronet in his turn, [...] "yes, a d----d runaway convict--a fellow that forged his father-in-law's name--a d----d attorney, {{and killed}} a fellow in Botany Bay, hang him--and ran into the Bush, curse him; I wish he'd died there. And he came to me, a good six years ago, and robbed me; and I've been ruining myself to keep him, the infernal scoundrel! And Pendennis knows it, and Strong knows it, and that d----d Morgan knows it, and she knows it, ever so long; and I <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> it, never: and I kept it from my wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But,' cried Constance, in a fright, 'you <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> him! You {{promised that}} it should be a secret, and I should be in such a dreadful scrape with Lady Merrifield and Mary.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Carrie, {{with the}} spot of colour {{once more in}} her cheek. [...] "He <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> me, and how could I ask him? It is a hateful subject--why should you mention it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This, in fine, however, she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> him. [...] "You shall hear only if your smash takes place. As that's {{really out}} of the question, I won't expose myself"--a point at which, for reasons of his own, Strether ceased to press.|$|E
2500|$|... — Prime Minister David Cameron (who {{enabled the}} Scottish {{independence}} referendum, 2014 {{to be carried}} out) said: [...] "I don't believe that, in the end, [...] try to ignore these questions of nationality, independence, identity... I think it’s right to make your arguments, take them on and then you let the people decide. But that's the way I {{want to do things}} in the United Kingdom. I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> presume to <b>tell</b> people in Spain how to meet these challenges themselves; it's a matter for the Spanish Government and the Spanish Prime Minister." [...] After the consultation he declared that he wanted Spain [...] "to stay united" [...] and that referendums [...] "should be done through the proper constitutional and legal frameworks".|$|R
6000|$|... "What do ye want?" [...] says he. [...] "A {{man should}} aye put his best foot forrit with the womenkind; he should aye {{give them a}} bit of a story to divert them, the poor lambs! It's what ye should learn to attend to, David; ye should get the principles, it's like a trade. Now, if this had been a young lassie, or onyways bonnie, she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have heard <b>tell</b> of my stomach, Davie. But aince they're too old to be seeking joes, they a' set up to be apotecaries. Why? What do I ken? They'll be just the way God made them, I suppose. But I think a man would be a gomeral that didnae give his {{attention}} to the same." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following a {{backlash}} over Robertson's advice, Robertson said, [...] "Basically I’m saying, adultery {{is not a}} good thing and you might as well straighten your life out {{and the only way to}} do it is to kind of get your affair with your wife in order. ... I was not giving advice to the whole world and nor was I counseling anybody to be unscriptural and leave their spouse. ... Please know that I believe the Bible. Please know that I <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> anybody to leave their sick spouse. I <b>never</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> say such a thing because I need my spouse when I get sick and she needs me when she gets sick. In sickness and in health, I believe it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said nothing}} whatever, Carrie, that would justify this little explosion, which I {{certainly}} don't intend to answer. I should really feel very vexed, if I were not perfectly {{sure that you}} <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> anyone else of this notion that you have got in your head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I did see the corporal, {{when the}} Parliament {{soldiers}} were at Bristol, flog Stead shamefully {{to know where}} it was, and never get a word out of him, whether or no; and as {{he was a boy}} who <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> a lie, it stands to reason he knew where they were." ...|$|E
6000|$|GREGORY. Yes: I {{maintain}} that I am {{responsible for my}} intentions only, and not for reflex actions over which I have no control. [Mrs. Juno sits down, ashamed]. I promised my mother that I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> a lie, and that I would never make love to a married woman. I never have told a lie-- ...|$|E
5000|$|..... 'asking {{questions}} you <b>never</b> <b>would,</b> <b>telling</b> secrets he <b>never</b> should.' What does that mean? Gossip, baby! The {{truth is that}} it has become much more than gossip. I've been told that people look it at as fun place to catch up on Portland, and that, for many, it is one more source for news. I started it over three years ago as a way to continue the conversations I had with the public at my previous post as a writer at Willamette Week. I often say it's the 'same show just on a different stage.' I think that's still true, but the stage is becoming much bigger.|$|R
5000|$|Off-court issues {{cut short}} both Halbrook's college and {{professional}} careers. He would reportedly go missing for days, sometimes {{weeks at a}} time without explanation. [...] Oregon State coach Gill was forced to cut him from the team after only two seasons for skipping class so often. Nationals coach Hannum is quoted to have said that [...] "He could have had a worthwhile career if he had taken care of himself. During his second season, he disappeared for a week and we sent the police out to look for him. But they couldn’t find a 7-footer! He came back on his own but he <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> me where he had been." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{she died}} by an accident--a fall--four years ago. It is curious that my mother, too, {{ran away from}} her family, {{but not for the}} sake of her husband. She <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> me {{anything}} about her family, except that she forsook them to get her own living--went on the stage, in fact. She was a dark-eyed creature, with crisp ringlets, and never seemed to be getting old. You see I come of rebellious blood on both sides," [...] Will ended, smiling brightly at Dorothea, while she was still looking with serious intentness before her, like a child seeing a drama for the first time.|$|R
