40|$|Background. Additional {{physical}} activity including repetitive task practice can improve outcomes after stroke. The additional practice can be facilitated by therapists {{and family members}} or could also be delivered by nursing staff. Objective. To investigate the feasibility of a nurse-led weekend exercise program after stroke. Participants. Individuals after stroke, who participated in a weekend exercise program during their hospital admission. Methods. A retrospective audit {{of the number of}} referrals to and amount of exercise repetitions achieved in a nurse-led weekend exercise program was undertaken. The weekend exercise program occurs on each Saturday and Sunday for one hour. The repetitions of exercise completed during each class were documented by staff. An audit was conducted to ascertain the amount and type of exercise completed within the class. Results. During the study period 284 people were referred to the exercise program. The mean number of exercise repetitions completed per participant in each class was 180. 7 (SD 205. 4). The number of exercise repetitions completed by participants was highly variable ranging from 0 to 1190 per class. Conclusion. The amount of average exercise repetitions completed in the <b>Weekend</b> <b>Warrior</b> program was large but with significant variability. A nurse-led exercise class is a feasible method of delivering exercise opportunities to individuals in hospital after stroke...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT EXAMINING ACL REVISION SURGERY OF A FEMALE COLLEGIATE ATHLETE by Heather McHale Master of Arts in Kinesiology Athletic Training Education Option California State University, Chico Spring 2011 Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgeries {{have become very}} common in the athletic population. With the increasing numbers of opportunities for physical activity, physical education, and sports participation, more competitive and amateur athletes are being treated for sports-related musculoskeletal injuries such as ACL sprain and rupture. High school and collegiate athletes, specifically, are at a higher risk for ACL injury than their <b>weekend</b> <b>warrior</b> counterparts are. Due to the prevalence of this injury in the younger, more active population, the medical community has been motivated {{to find the most}} appropriate treatment for this season-ending injury. Orthopedic surgeons have been able to identify successful reconstructive methods using tissue grafts that aid in the full recovery of their patients. Gone are the days where the athlete is told that he or she can no longer participate in their sport due to ACL injuries; athletes now have the opportunity to return safely to participation as soon as 6 months after reconstructive surgery. Unfortunately, the different grafts that are available for reconstruction have both positive and negative outcomes, thus there is yet to be a true medical ???gold standard??? among surgeons. This fact is troubling for the collegiate athlete looking for an accelerated return-to-play timeline. The {{purpose of this study was}} to chronicle the recovery of a female collegiate athlete who suffered an ACL injury and progressed through reconstructive surgery, rehabilitation, and return to full competition after two ACL reconstructions in the same knee. The athlete suffered an initial ACL rupture, as diagnosed by her orthopedic surgeon, during her first collegiate basketball season. Reconstructive surgery was performed using cadaveric tissue. At 11 months after the operation, the graft ruptured during basketball practice while performing a routine lay-up. An autogenic hamstring graft was used for the revision surgery. After receiving two different types of grafts, this athlete???s case presents an opportunity for the medical community to question and further examine the optimal type of graft for young athletes who are looking to continue athletic competition after surgery.
