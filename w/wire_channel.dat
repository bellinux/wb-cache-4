The Management Center (MC) plays a role as centralized data center for highway information computing, storage, and monitoring. A toll station can {{transfer the}} traffic information by private highway fiber network or by VPN rented from China Telecom as a backup line. While in some areas, especially the mountainous areas, the <b>wired</b> <b>channel</b> to MC is very disruption prone due to disrepair and aging of lines. Toll stations would have to choose the wireless broadband service rented from China Mobile when the <b>wired</b> <b>channel</b> failed and toll stations were disconnected from the MC. But in these areas, all stations are not equipped with access points connecting RRHs, and those with access points may have a different wireless channel QoS due to the difference of distance, terrain, and devices. One of possible solutions under this condition is to select a toll station as a relay node, which should have the best wireless QoS compared to other stations nearby. The nearby stations could transfer the traffic information to the relay node by <b>wired</b> <b>channel</b> (providing the <b>wired</b> <b>channel</b> between them is working well) or by D 2 D communications. After that, the relay node would transfer the traffic information to MC by wireless broadband channel. Thus, it is desirable for the relay node to be dynamically configured to choose an optimal solution for reducing communication cost while subject to time constraints. The service provided by this relay node is the data service in this context. The relay node is a service provider who should take responsibilities of configuring and optimizing the data transferring procedure.|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} a Spin Field Effect Transistor, {{realized}} with a semiconductor quantum <b>wire</b> <b>channel</b> sandwiched between half-metallic ferromagnetic contacts, can have Fano resonances in the transmission spectrum. These resonances appear because the ferromagnets are halfmetallic, so that the Fermi level can be placed above the majority but below the minority spin band. In that case, the majority spins will be propagating, but the minority spins will be evanescent. At low temperatures, the Fano resonances can be exploited to implement a digital binary switch that can be turned on or off with a very small gate voltage swing of few tens of µV, leading to extremely small dynamic power dissipation during switching. An array of 500, 000 × 500, 000 such transistors can detect ultrasmall changes in a magnetic field with a sensitivity of 1 femto-Tesla / √ Hz, if each transistor is biased near a Fano resonance. ∗Corresponding author...|$|E
