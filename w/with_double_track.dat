5|$|Work {{commenced}} {{again in}} 1933 {{and the line}} opened on 10 October 1934. At first the line was built <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track</b> from Frøen to Østhorn and single track to Sognsvann. Between 1937 and 1939, the upper section was converted to double track. The construction spurred a massive residential construction along the line giving a good foundation for ridership.|$|E
5|$|The Sinsen Line {{opened on}} 1 February 1923 as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line, which {{continued}} along Trondheimsveien to Carl Berners plass. The entire Rodeløkka Line was rebuilt <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track</b> in 1938. In December 1940, a service extension of the Rodeløkka Line was built from Rodeløkka to Søndre Åsen, operated by the Oslo trolleybus, remaining in service until 14 January 1945. The tram service on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated on 6 February 1949, and replaced with bus line 27, although the tracks were kept.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1953, the Trunk Line from Lillestrøm to Eidsvoll took {{electrification}} into use. Further upgrades on the Drammen Line installing {{double track}} {{were put into}} service on 24 July 1953 from Billingstad to Hvalstad, on 29 November 1955 from Hvalstad to Asker and on 9 November 1958 from Sandvika to Billingstad. Between 1953 and 1955, NSB took delivery of 18 Class 67 multiple units. While visually similar to Class 65, they had improved technology and reliability. On 1 February 1961, the Gjøvik Line from OsloØ to Tøyen was put into service <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track</b> and the line from OsloØ to Jaren put into service as electrified. Double track from Tøyen to Grefsen opened on 27 May 1962 and the sections from Jaren to Gjøvik was electrified in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Carl Berners plass {{became a}} public {{transport}} station on 1 February 1923, when the then single-track Sinsen Line of the tramway opened as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line. The station took its name from the square it was located at, Carl Berners plass, which is again named for the politician Carl Berner. The station was served by the newly created Line 13 that operated through the city center and ran every twelve minutes, and since 29 June 1924 every fifteen minutes. The line was built by Kristiania Sporveisselskap, but they were taken over by the municipality in 1924, and the line became part of Oslo Sporveier. On 28 June 1938, the line was rebuilt to double track. From 19 December 1939, the line was extended along Trondheimsveien to Sinsen; this section was built <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track.</b> In 1948, the tracks at Carl Berners plass was rebuilt to run through the roundabouts {{at both ends of the}} square. The station was served by various services numbers along the Sinsen Line, including 1, 3, 7, 13 and 17, although not all at the same time. At the most, three services operated to the station, giving a five-minute headway.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the short section between Bewdley North and Bewdley South signal boxes on the Severn Valley Railway, the GCR is currently the only standard gauge heritage railway in the UK <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track</b> outside of stations. However, there are other preserved lines that were previously double track.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{a project}} to upgrade {{the full length of}} the line from Mangonia Park to Miami Airport <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track</b> was {{completed}} with the opening of a high-level fixed bridge over the New River near Fort Lauderdale. During the 2000s, most of the stations were completely rebuilt to accommodate for double tracking and include dual platforms, elevators, pedestrian bridges over the tracks, large roofs over the platforms, and better facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Because it {{is nearly}} {{impossible}} for a performer to sing or play the same part {{in exactly the same way}} twice, a recording and blending of two different performances of the same part will create a fuller, [...] "chorused" [...] effect <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>tracking.</b> But if one simply plays back two copies of the same performance in perfect sync, the two sound images become one and no <b>double</b> <b>tracking</b> effect is produced.|$|R
50|$|Since the Fullerton to Hurstbourne Line was {{intended}} to handle heavy freight and express passenger traffic from the Midlands via the DN&SR it was built <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>tracks</b> and large stations at Longparish and Wherwell complete with extensive goods yards. Despite the line's short length it included some substantial engineering, including a 50-foot (15.2m) deep cutting near Longparish.|$|R

25|$|A {{simplified}} {{interlocking system}} was installed on 1 January 1901. The station was originally named Bækkelaget, but took a new spelling in April 1921. The section past Bekkelaget was rebuilt <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track</b> during the 1920s. The first stage, from Bekkelaget to Ljan, was completed on 1 July 1924. The section from Oslo Ø to Bekkelaget was completed on 15 May 1929. As {{part of this}} a new, fail-proof interlocking system became operational in December 1926. The line past Bekkelaget was electrified on 9 December 1936.|$|E
500|$|To {{allow more}} {{frequent}} services, the line {{needed to be}} rebuilt to double track. The first section was from Sportsplassen to Holtet, which opened <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track</b> on 16 January 1930. Next followed the section from Holtet to Kastellet on 12 February 1931, and finally from Sjømannsskolen to Sportsplassen on 30 September 1931. This occurred {{at the same time}} the Simensbråten Line was built, as a branch from Jomfrubråten to Simensbråten. Construction of the Simensbråten Line started in December 1928; ...|$|E

50|$|On 25 August 1960 {{the station}} Christopher Columbus was opened, {{connected}} <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>tracks</b> {{to the rest}} of the line. This marked the completion of the work for the railroad at Ostia. Also, in 1960, Tor di Valle station, near the hippodrome of Rome was opened. In the summer of 1972, thanks to the expansion of the neighbourhoods between Rome and Ostia, the station Casal Bernocchi is opened.|$|R
50|$|Private {{companies}} were definitively bought {{back by the}} Italian state on July 1, 1905, {{with the creation of}} the Ferrovie dello Stato (State Railways), or FS, with a total of 10,557 km of lines, of which it already owned 9686 km. The move was completed the following year with the acquisition of the remaining SFM network: by then FS possessed 13,075 km of lines, of which 1,917 km <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the Sognsvann Line {{started in}} 1933. It and Kringsjå Station were opened on 10 October 1934. At first {{the line was}} built <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track</b> to Østhorn and single track to Sognsvann. Between 1937 and 1939, the upper section was {{converted}} to double track. Unlike further south along the line there was not as much construction of housing. The area around Kringsjå was mostly developed from the 1960s. Until 1970 there was a café at the station. Kringsjå Student City opened in 1970, followed by Fjellbirkeland Student City in 1990. East of the station {{there was also a}} major construction of condominiums and row housing since the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|The route via Røyken {{was based}} on running trains from Oslo Central Station (OsloS) via the Drammen Line to Asker Station and then {{continuing}} along the Spikkestad Line to Hallenskog Station. From there a new railway would be built to the airport. The total distance is , of which [...] would be along the Drammen Line, [...] along the Spikkestad Line and [...] would be a new railway. The Drammen Line between Oslo and Asker {{would need to be}} expanded with a third track and the Spikkestad Line between Asker and Hallenskog would have to be expanded to double track. The entire new section would also be built <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track.</b> NSB estimated the construction costs in 1986 to 1.59 million.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Public Roads Administration was {{increasingly}} {{dissatisfied with the}} road section. It was not wide enough to allow two cars to meet. The bridge was also {{not strong enough to}} support the weight of increased traffic. [...] The Norwegian State Railways wanted to build a bridge <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>track,</b> but there was not sufficient funding for this. This would allow both branches of the railway to have each their track from Hafslund to Sarpsborg Station. The next idea was to build a second bridge next to the first, also carrying one road lane at a lower level and a track at an upper level. The two agencies were not able to agree on the distribution of the costs. The railways could in the end not wait longer and decided to build their own bridge and leave the old one free of the charge to the Public Roads Administration.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} reoriented in 2004, <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>tracking,</b> for the stretch from Lesina to Apricena (saving about 2.5 km), {{while at the}} end of 2005, the railway between Ortona and Vasto Casalbordino and between the Port of Vasto and Vasto / San Salvo were also realigned; for the dual purpose of {{eliminating}} the multiple curves in the old section, and reducing the danger posed by storm surges and coastal erosion.|$|R
