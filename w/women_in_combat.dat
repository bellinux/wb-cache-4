25|$|Several hundred {{thousand}} women served in combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units. The U.S. {{decided not to}} use <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>combat</b> because public opinion would not tolerate it. However 400,000 women served in uniform in non-combat roles in the U.S. armed forces; 160,000 were killed by enemy fire.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, occupations and {{units with}} the primary role of {{preparing}} for direct involvement in combat {{on the ground or}} at sea were still closed to women: infantry, armoured corps, field artillery, air-defence artillery, signals, field engineers, and naval operations. On 5 February 1987, the Minister of National Defence created an office to study the impact of employing men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>combat</b> units. These trials were called Combat-Related Employment of Women.|$|E
25|$|During his presidency, Obama, Congress, and the Supreme Court all {{contributed to}} a huge {{expansion}} of LGBT rights. In 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded hate crime laws to cover crimes committed because of the victim's sexual orientation. In December 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which ended the military's policy of disallowing openly {{gay and lesbian people}} from openly serving in the United States Armed Forces. Obama also supported the passage of ENDA, which would ban discrimination against employees on the basis of gender or sexual identity for all companies with 15 or more employees, and the similar but more comprehensive Equality Act. Neither bill passed Congress. In May 2012, Obama became the first sitting president to support same-sex marriage, shortly after Vice President Joe Biden had also expressed support for the institution. In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges, and Obama personally congratulated the plaintiff. Obama also issued dozens of executive orders intended to help LGBT Americans, including a 2010 order that extended full benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. A 2014 order prohibited discrimination against employees of federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2015, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter ended the ban on <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>combat</b> roles, and in 2016, he ended the ban on transgender individuals openly serving in the military. On the international stage, Obama advocated for gay rights, particularly in Africa.|$|E

The [...] "Rani of Jhansi Regiment" [...] involved these <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>combat</b> {{on behalf of}} the Indian National Army. It was active from 1943-45. Bose {{spent a good deal of}} effort on him developing anti-British anti-imperialist ideology designed to mobilize models of women as mothers and sisters in Indian tradition. Bose argued that the direct involvement of women was necessary to achieve total independence of India from the colonial powers. Bose articulated a modern definition of female heroism that involved combat. In actual practice, very few of his women soldiers were directly involved in combat; they largely had support roles in logistics and medical care.|$|E

2500|$|Leslie [...] "Les" [...] Aspin Jr. (July 21, 1938 – May 21, 1995) was a United States Representative from 1971 to 1993, and the United States Secretary of Defense under President Bill Clinton from January 21, 1993 to February 3, 1994. [...] In Congress, Aspin had a {{reputation}} as an intellectual who took a middle-of-the-road position on controversial issues. He supported the Reagan administration regarding the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, but he opposed the B-2 bomber and the Strategic Defense Initiative. He {{played a major role in}} convincing the House to support the January 1991 resolution supporting the use of force by President G.H.W. Bush against Iraq, after it invaded Kuwait. As Secretary of Defense, he faced complex social issues, such as the roles of homosexuals in uniform, and of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>combat.</b> He faced major decisions regarding the use of military force in Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti. He proposed budget cuts and restructuring of forces as part of the downsizing of the military after the end of the Cold War. The deaths of U.S. soldiers in Somalia because of inadequate military support led to his resignation.|$|E
2500|$|The PCA {{has little}} doctrinal quarrel with the OPC. [...] Both {{denominations}} have similar {{views on the}} Federal Vision, creation and justification. [...] While most OPC congregations allow women only to teach children and other women in Sunday school, some moderate PCA congregations allow women to do anything a non-ordained man can do. While the OPC and the PCA both adhere to the Westminster Standards, the OPC is generally more strict in requiring its officers to subscribe to those standards without exception. It {{is hard to find}} any doctrinal differences between these two denominations. In recent years the OPC and PCA published substantial similar reports on the Creation Days, the debate about Justification and the issue of the Federal Vision. [...] They have identical positions on social issues like <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>combat,</b> Freemasonry and abortion. The only divergence of any significance is the matter of charismatic gifts. The OPC maintains a strict cessationist position, while the PCA allows presbyteries to ordain non-cessationists if they do not believe that ongoing gifts are relevatory and they promise not to teach their distinctive views, but most PCA presbyteries would refuse to ordain such a man. Many PCA churches have moved toward contemporary worship, while the OPC is dominated by traditional Reformed worship. [...] The southern roots of the Presbyterian Church in America were tempered somewhat by the merger with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod and the northern roots of the OPC was also tempered by the influence of Van Til and Kuyper. Nonetheless, the two denominations enjoy fraternal relations and cooperate in a number of ways, such as sharing control of a publication company, Great Commission Publications, which produces Sunday School curricula for both denominations.|$|E
