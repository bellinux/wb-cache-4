5|$|Trauma {{lighting}} – In {{addition to}} normal working lighting, ambulances can be fitted with special lighting (often blue or red) {{which is used}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> becomes photosensitive.|$|E
5|$|Valsalva {{maneuver}} – <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> performs this maneuver, he or she, increases intra-abdominal venous pressure. If {{the great}} saphenous valve at the sapheno-femoral junction is incompetent, a reflux will appear.|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction. This is usually deferred until 24–48hours after admission, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is stable and has shown some improvement with antibiotics, but may need to happen as an emergency in case of ongoing deterioration despite adequate treatment, or if antibiotics are not effective in reducing the signs of infection (which happens in 15% of cases).|$|E

5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of CSF leak can be {{done through}} various imaging techniques, {{chemical}} tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice, or by a clinical examination. The use of CT, MRI, and assays {{are the most common}} types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> takes a prone position are positive indicators.|$|E
5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} to start CLL treatment is taken <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> clinical symptoms or blood counts {{indicate that the}} disease has progressed {{to a point where}} it may affect <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> quality of life.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "down pressure" [...] sensor will detect <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> vein is blocked, or {{the line}} to <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is kinked. This may be {{configurable}} for high (subcutaneous and epidural) or low (venous) applications.|$|R
50|$|This is <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient’s</b> {{attention}} can be {{held and}} he/she can answer questions. <b>When</b> answering questions, <b>the</b> answers may be delayed and/or indicate a level of disorientation or confusion.|$|R
5|$|Shunt surgery, usually {{performed}} by neurosurgeons, involves {{the creation of}} a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. Generally, a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion—usually due to shunt obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by stereotactic surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.|$|E
5|$|John Greyson became {{interested}} in offering a counterpoint to the Patient Zero story as early as 1987, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Patient</b> Zero meme began entering the public consciousness following the publication of Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On. The book described the cluster study {{which led to the}} popular identification of flight attendant Gaëtan Dugas as the vector through which HIV was first brought to North America. It should be noted, however, that Shilts himself never claimed that Dugas was the first. In early 1991 Greyson was given a development grant for the script from the Canadian Film Centre, of which Greyson is an alumnus. Over the next year Greyson, in collaboration with Film Centre partners Louise Garfield and Anna Stratton, continued to develop the script, eventually presenting it with producer Alexandra Raffé in a workshop format. During the first half of 1992, the production team secured additional development funding from the Canada Council, Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation. By June of that year the script and the songs were completed and that autumn, with funds from the Telefilm Canada and OFDC grants along with revenue from the sale of British broadcast rights to Channel 4, pre-production and casting got underway. Principal photography began in November 1992 and wrapped after five weeks. Sneak previews took place at the Seattle International Film Festival and a number of LGBT film festivals across the United States before its official debut in September 1993 at Toronto's Festival of Festivals.|$|E
