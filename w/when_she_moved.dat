5|$|It is {{uncertain}} as to exactly why John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high-ranking position in Bulgaria, as his ancestry and family ties would suggest. Bulgarian historian Ivan Bozhilov {{is of the}} opinion that John was not seeking political refuge in Serbia. Instead, it is most likely that he moved to that country with the belief that Serbia's territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure him better career opportunities. Presumably, John accompanied his sister Helena <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> to Serbia to marry Stephen Dušan in 1332.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{set up a}} {{two-stage}} {{game with}} sequential moves by one altruistic agent and n selfish agents. The rotten kid theorem states that the altruist can only reach her first best when the selfish agents move before the altruist. The Samaritan’s dilemma, on the other hand, states that the altruist can only reach her first best <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>moves</b> before the selfish agents. We find that in general, the altruist can reach her first best <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>moves</b> first, {{if and only if}} a selfish agent’s action marginally only affects his own payoff. The altruist can reach her first best <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>moves</b> last if and only if a selfish agent cannot manipulate the price of his payoff. When the altruist cannot reach her first best <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>moves</b> last, the outcome is not Pareto efficient either. JEL Classification: D 6...|$|R

5|$|Although {{popular with}} groupies, Chrisye had rarely dated. But in early 1981 he began courting Guruh Sukarnoputra's secretary, Gusti Firoza Damayanti Noor (Yanti). Yanti, of mixed Dayak and Minang ancestry, {{was a former}} singer and came from a musically {{inclined}} family; she would often discuss music with Chrisye {{while he waited for}} Guruh, and he would also see her when visiting her brother Raidy, one of his friends. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> to Bali to work at a five-star hotel there for several weeks, Chrisye followed her and told her that he would marry her when she returned to Jakarta; although this was not a formal proposal, Yanti accepted. In 1982 Chrisye converted to Islam, as Islam does not permit interfaith marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men, and changed his name to Chrismansyah Rahadi; Chrisye at the time had been growing increasingly discontent and disillusioned with Christianity. On 12 December 1982 he married Yanti in a Padang-style wedding.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from {{other members of the}} Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers. Wörth left Taku to coal at Tsingtau, the German naval base in China, and on 25 October {{returned}} to Wusong via Yantai. There, she joined the blockade of the Yangtze River. Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to Hong Kong or Nagasaki, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; Wörth went to Nagasaki from 30 November to the end of December. She returned to Wusong on 27 December, where she remained until 18 February 1901, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> to Tsingtau for division exercises and gunnery drills. Wörth {{and the rest of the}} fleet then stayed in Shanghai in April and May.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September, Emden {{entered the}} Bay of Bengal, {{achieving}} complete surprise, since the British assumed {{she was still}} with Spee's squadron. She operated on shipping routes there without success, until 10 September, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> to the Colombo–Calcutta route. There, she captured the Greek collier Pontoporros, which was carrying equipment for the British. Müller took the ship into his service and agreed to pay the crew. Emden captured five more ships; four were sunk, and the fifth, a steamer named Kabinga, was used to carry the crews from the other vessels. On 13 September, Müller released Kabinga and sank two more British prizes. Off the Ganges estuary, Emden caught a Norwegian merchantman; upon searching her, the Germans determined she was not carrying contraband and therefore released her. The Norwegians informed Müller that Entente warships were operating in the area, and {{so he decided to}} return to the eastern coast of India.|$|E

5|$|On May 17, 2010, Patti Smith {{received}} an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Pratt Institute, along with architect Daniel Libeskind, MoMA director Glenn Lowry, former NYC Landmarks Commissioner Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, novelist Jonathan Lethem, and director Steven Soderbergh. Following the conferral of her degree, Smith delivered the commencement address and sang/played two songs accompanied by long-time band member Lenny Kaye. In her remarks, Smith explained that in 1967 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> to New York City (Brooklyn), {{she would never}} have been accepted into Pratt, but most of her friends (including Mapplethorpe) were students at Pratt and she spent countless hours on the Pratt campus. She added that it was through her friends and their Pratt professors that she learned much of her own artistic skills, making the honor from the institute particularly poignant for Smith 43 years later.|$|E
5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>moved</b> to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E
