5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Skaboy JFK, Perry already began announcing plans for the Daddies' next studio album, {{revealing}} the band would be returning to swing music for their first all-swing album since Zoot Suit Riot. Initial production on the album, titled <b>White</b> <b>Teeth,</b> Black Thoughts, began in March 2011, though lasted infrequently throughout the year as the Daddies continued to carry out several more successful international tours, including two separate sold-out tours of Australia in 2011 and 2012. During this time, the band experienced major changes within their touring line-up after longtime keyboardist Dustin Lanker departed the group in 2012, prompting the Daddies to decide to continue touring without a live keyboardist. Several months later, trombonist Joe Freuen was added to the band, marking the first time the Daddies have ever included a full-time trombone player in their official line-up.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Esthetics in {{dentistry}} aims {{to improve}} the patients’ self-esteem and satisfaction regarding how beautiful and attractive they feel. However, patients and dental professionals may perceive the concept of esthetics differently instead, which may cause the dissatisfaction of the patient {{with the results of}} the treatment. Objective: This cross-sectional observational study aimed to verify the esthetic self-perception of undergraduate dental students regarding their own smile. Material and methods: A questionnaire, designed by Goldstein [10] to measure the patients’ self-perception and satisfaction, regarding their smiles, was applied to undergraduate students of different semesters of the School of Dentistry of the Federal University of Pelotas. Results: Our results showed that women are more dissatisfied with their smiles than men. Students attending different semesters worried somehow about the esthetics of their smiles and revealed the wish of having <b>whiter</b> <b>teeth.</b> Most students are satisfied with the shape of their teeth. Ninety two percent of the students feel self-confident regarding to smile, 90 % believe someone else has a better smile, 87 % look at the smile of models in fashion magazines, 71 % wish to have <b>whiter</b> <b>teeth</b> and 80 % wish to have rather a bigger or smaller teeth. Conclusion: Undergraduate dental students have a positive self-perception of their smile. Women are less satisfied than men. Students of the earlier semesters wish to have <b>whiter</b> <b>teeth</b> than students from the later semesters...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and objective: Esthetic {{dentistry}} {{has been}} prioritizedand {{the desire for}} <b>whiter</b> <b>teeth</b> has been increasingly present in dental offices, since <b>whiter</b> <b>teeth</b> tend to indicate health, beauty, youth and a more attractive smile. Teeth bleaching is a conservative method widely used to restore the original color of darkened teeth. However, possible relations with the external cervical root resorption have concerned many researchers and clinicians. Literature review: There are many mechanisms that can activate the external cervical root resorption, such as: chemical and physical action of the bleaching materials used, morphology of the cementoenamel junction associated to the immune system, material concentration, traumas and bleaching technique used. Conclusion: Therefore, considering many factors that are still not conclusive, preventing deleterious effects on teeth and support structures, {{care must be taken}} when choosing bleaching agent and bleaching technique, as well as when selecting each case, beyond a proper restoration after teeth bleaching...|$|R

50|$|Tooth color varies {{according}} to race, gender and geographic region. Females generally have slightly <b>whiter</b> <b>teeth</b> than males, partly because females' teeth are smaller, and therefore there is less bulk of dentin, partially visible through the enamel layer.

500|$|Steve Perry is the Daddies' sole lyricist, {{and writes}} the {{majority}} of his songs in a fictional narrative format he credits as being influenced by Randy Newman, Ray Davies and Jarvis Cocker, often told about or through the unreliable perspective of downtrodden characters struggling against adversity.

Perry has also incorporated political themes into his music, most overtly on the Daddies' 2013 album <b>White</b> <b>Teeth,</b> Black Thoughts, which addressed issues relating to the 2008 financial crisis through a variety of American character perspectives. The Register-Guard has described Perry's lyrics as [...] "ribald [...] often despairing", [...] " [...] the underbelly of society, stabbing at oppressors such as...the pressure to conform", while The New York Times has lauded them as [...] "vivid poetry" [...] containing [...] "an inventiveness missing from the other swing bands' lyrics".|$|E
