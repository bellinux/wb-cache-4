500|$|The album explores gloomy lyrical {{subjects}} such as death, violence, and occultism. Speaking about the themes on the album, author Bob Larson asserted that Megadeth [...] "cranks out songs about spilling blood and stomping guts with venomous anger". The album's title, {{as well as its}} lyrics, led to accusations whether the band was promoting Satanism. These allegations were rigidly denied by Mustaine, who said that the band consciously kept away from the Satanic image. [...] "I mean, it's great to thrash and pound, cut yourself up, scream and have fun, but you don't have to take out a Pagan attitude. Why support the Devil? He's already there. I'd rather just fucking thrash and be a metalist and listen to <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to than be forced to listen to one style of music." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Scott-Heron {{received}} top-billing for the release, Jamie xx worked {{solely on}} the remix project. For We're New Here, he remixed 13 of the original album's 15 songs, including its [...] "interlude" [...] cuts, mixing Scott-Heron's vocal tracks from the original recording sessions over his own beats and instrumentals, rather than the original music. Many of the remixes were created by Jamie xx on his laptop, while on tour with The xx. In a March2010 interview, {{he said that the}} label [...] "gave me the parts and let me do <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>want,</b> so I've been doing it on my laptop on tour. [...] only using [...] vocals, I'm not using any of the original music from it, which is very freeing". On his intentions for the album's music, he explained in an interview for The Irish Times, [...] "I wanted it to sound like everything I had been listening to in London. I wanted it to sound like something you’d hear on pirate radio. You hear so many different genres, and it’s all so convoluted and mixed-up, but it makes sense when you turn on the station".|$|E

Reznor explained this move by saying [...] "It's a stance we're taking that we feel is appropriate with digital technology, and outdated copyright laws, and all the nonsense that's going on these days". Jim Guerinot, then manager of Nine Inch Nails, explained the unconventional release of the album as [...] " [...] a reaction to what doesn’t exist today. it’s more just like, 'Hey, in a vacuum I can do <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do.'" [...] The digital-release of the album reportedly required an extensive overhaul of the Nine Inch Nails website {{in order for the}} site to cope with the influx of traffic, online-payments, and customer service needs of releasing the album. These upgrades cost Reznor approximately $20,000 to implement. Despite these measures, upon the release of Ghosts the site crashed, and additional servers were necessary to handle the traffic.|$|E

500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still a bit too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, I know this is it and I'll go to battle if I have to, against anyone who doesn't believe in it. Now I have this freedom to do <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>want,</b> because people trust me.' She was right about this one. The song's straightforward party is now tied to a sordid universe of visuals- the official video and the VMA performance." [...] Common Sense Media gave the song two stars out of five saying that [...] "After listening to the weird intro to [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] you'll kind of wish the song did just stop right there." ...|$|E

With the song entering the UK Singles Chart at number one, Rihanna joined Elvis Presley and The Beatles {{as just one}} of three acts to have scored a number-one single each year over seven consecutive years in the chart's history. The song also peaked at {{number one on the}} US Billboard Hot 100, which marked Rihanna's thirteenth chart topper, tying her at the time with Michael Jackson for the fourth most number ones in the chart's history. Rihanna then appeared on Shakira's single, [...] "Can't Remember to Forget You", which was released in January 2014. Following the release of Unapologetic and its accompanying tour, Rihanna aimed to take a hiatus from recording music, stating: [...] "I wanted to have a year to just do <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> artistically, creatively." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{during the}} tour, Chappell sent an email to the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which criticised Ganguly as being [...] "mentally and {{physically}} unfit" [...] {{to lead the}} team. Chappell stated that Ganguly's [...] "negative attitude" [...] would hamper India's development as a unit for the 2007 World Cup and that the injuries suffered by Ganguly are [...] "imaginary". He also accused Ganguly of desperately trying to retain captaincy {{and that he had}} [...] "lost the trust and respect of his teammates". The email was leaked, and upon returning to India, both Ganguly and Chappell were summoned to a BCCI board meeting in Mumbai. Before the meeting, Ganguly told a Kolkata-based newspaper, [...] "I will say <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to to the board. I hope the board will {{give me a chance to}} explain.

2500|$|Following {{the release}} of Rihanna's seventh studio album, Unapologetic (2012) and its {{accompanying}} tour, the singer aimed to take a hiatus from recording music. She stated, [...] "I {{wanted to have a}} year to just do <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> artistically, creatively." [...] However, the hiatus did not last long and after a week she returned to the studio. During the initial writing and development of the album, Rihanna wasn't sure how she wanted Anti to sound. Ultimately, she decided that she wants [...] "honest" [...] music and a body of work that reflected and represented her at that time. However, the singer stated that during the recording process she was evolving and she didn't have the answer of who she was at that point. According to her, she was feeling disconnected from her emotions and [...] "numb" [...] during the album's conception. During her creative struggle, Rihanna rented a house in Malibu over a couple of months and started extensively writing and composing music with her team consisted of various musicians.

Impersonations include Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, {{and members of the}} British Royal Family, Camilla Parker-Bowles and Carole Middleton. Ullman received considerable international attention for her portrayal of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. [...] "I'm fascinated by Angela Merkel, so I wanted to be Angela Merkel. I think they're like Trojan horses, these impersonations. I can dress up like them and make them <b>whatever</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> them to be, like putting a personality within them. I didn't want to just do a straight impersonation. I wanted to try and show their lives. I always imagine that Angela Merkel is someone that has to be with men all the time, in these rooms having meetings... And I thought, 'I wonder what she's like when she's with her best friend and they just talk about hair and make-up?'" [...] BBC Director-General Tony Hall paid a visit to the set show and caught Ullman playing Merkel singing jazz and scatting about the state of European affairs.

The thin man is squeezed into any odd corner; and is not treated with half the consideration that is given to a fat man. He worries about trifles, and has none of the quiet contentment that characterizes stout people. A stout man's food always agrees with him, or else he would not be stout; while the thin man suffers indigestion, dyspepsia, and perhaps jaundice. You see, my dear young lady, that almost all the advantages are on our side. Of course you will say I could not climb a ladder, but then I do not want to climb a ladder. I could not make the ascent of Matterhorn; but it is much more pleasant to sit at the bottom and see fools do it. I could not very well ride a horse unless it were a dray-horse; but then I have no partiality for horse exercise. Altogether I think I have every reason to be content.
