5|$|A Sanskrit scholar Vijnaneshwara {{became famous}} {{in the field of}} legal {{literature}} for his Mitakshara, in the court of Vikramaditya VI. Perhaps the most acknowledged <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> field, Mitakshara is a treatise on law (commentary on Yajnavalkya) based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of modern India. An Englishman Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance giving it currency in the British Indian court system. Some important literary works of the time related to music and musical instruments were Sangita Chudamani, Sangita Samayasara and Sangita Ratnakara.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{there was}} a burst in {{overlapping}} commitments and commission, both public and ecclesiastical, {{many of which were}} more important than his debut work at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli. Indeed, <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> church stopped around the same time. The sculptor returned to it only for occasional work over the following years {{to the end of the}} century; overall, however, work ceased until the mid-sixteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Frances Elizabeth Somerville Alexander (née Caldwell; 13 December 1908 – 15 October 1958) was a British geologist, academic, and physicist, whose wartime {{work with}} radar and radio led to early {{developments}} in radio astronomy. Alexander earned her PhD from Newnham College, Cambridge, {{and worked in}} Radio Direction Finding at Singapore Naval Base from 1938 to 1941. In January 1941, unable to return to Singapore from New Zealand, she became Head of Operations Research in New Zealand's Radio Development Lab, Wellington. In 1945, Alexander correctly interpreted that anomalous radar signals picked up on Norfolk Island were caused by the sun. This interpretation became pioneering {{work in the field}} of radio astronomy, making her one of the first women scientists to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> field, albeit briefly.|$|E

5|$|The {{work was}} {{translated}} back to French by Felix Coveliers for a {{production at the}} Fantaisies-Parisiennes in Brussels, which opened on 28 December 1878, despite concerns from Scribe's widow. However, in Paris, she refused permission for the Gaîté to mount the <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> form, and {{the directors of the}} Théâtre des Nouveautés, Boulevard des Italiens therefore procured a much altered libretto from Alfred Delacour and Victor Wilder, and in this form the Paris première was produced at that theatre on 15 March 1879, with costumes by Grévin, running for 59 nights. Revived in April 1882, the production received 55 more performances, with Marguerite Ugalde in the title role.|$|E
5|$|Though writers {{disagree}} on {{details of the}} handwriting (see the section on handwriting below), they all agree that the handwriting of the latter portion of Drexel 4257 is probably that of John Gamble, given {{that there is a}} concentration of his <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> part of the manuscript. This suggests that the book was begun by someone else (whom Lynn Hulse recognized as Thomas Jordan; see below). Duckles surmised that Gamble came into possession of the book in 1642–43 when the musicians of the Royal Chapel were dispersed {{as a result of the}} English Civil War. Although Gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666, this book appears to have survived. He made out his will on June 30, 1680 in which he bequeathed his grandson (also named John Gamble) all his books of music.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1929, the Lopez family began {{migrating}} {{north for}} <b>work.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> year, {{they arrived in}} Arvin, CA in the San Joaquin Valley {{and worked as a}} crew picking cotton. Her Aunt Maria, who Jessie recalled as her sister because of their close age and sister like relationship, was killed in a tragic accident when her dress caught fire, causing her to perish. In January 1930, her mother Guadalupe fell ill and was bedridden by February. She died on March 11, 1930 and was laid to rest in Compton, CA. After the death of their mother, Lopez and her sisters moved back to Anaheim with their grandparents. Her grandfather Basillo returned to cotton picking in the San Gabriel Valley to support them, but fell ill shortly after and died of dropsy on June 14, 1930. The depression years were tough on the Lopez family. In 1931 they became migrant workers again, often sleeping roadside in a tent.|$|E
