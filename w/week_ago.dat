25|$|India's innings was {{as easy as}} it {{had been}} a <b>week</b> <b>ago.</b> From the first 12 overs, Sehwag and Gambhir added 75 runs, before Sehwag edged Streak behind for a run-a-ball 44. Gambhir continued, though, and India lost no further wickets until the close of play, leaving them on 195 for 1 with Gambhir five runs short of his second Test century. Rahul Dravid was more subdued, only making 49 from 103 balls, and he was {{occasionally}} troubled by Streak – but not enough to surrender his wicket.|$|E
25|$|June 15, 2005 - Paul Martin's {{minority}} government survives {{no fewer}} than 16 confidence votes in the House of Commons. A defeat on any {{of them would have}} forced an election. But in the end, there was no repeat of the single-vote squeaker win of May 19. The closest vote passed 153 to 149; Gurmant Grewal is on stress leave over the tape scandal, two other conservative MPs are sick with cancer, and Thibault from the BQ is away due to the passing away of her father. As well, a series of public opinion polls released just days earlier all showed the Liberals in the lead, one of them released just a <b>week</b> <b>ago</b> showing the Liberals have a 14% lead over the Tories. The Tories seem themselves to not be wanting an election now, either.|$|E

500|$|Michigan played {{its second}} {{game of the}} season at home against the team from Grand Rapids High School, (Now Grand Rapids Central High School [...] ). The game was played in halves of 20 and 10 minutes, and Michigan won easily by a score of 44 to 0. A {{newspaper}} account of the game described Michigan's performance as follows:"Michigan is now rapidly rounding into form and the team played a much stronger game today than a <b>week</b> <b>ago.</b> Several of the new men did some creditable work, and the interference at all times was excellent. Hazen Pingree, at half, made several brilliant runs, and Hannan, at full, punted very well. Bennett, Wombacher, Palmer and Farnham also showed up well in the line. Grand Rapids was never able to gain and the 'varsity scored as she pleased." [...] Michigan's lineup in the game was Palmer (left end), Giovanni [...] "Count" [...] Villa (left tackle), Fred Baker (left guard), John David Wombacher (center), John W.F. Bennett (right guard), Frederick Henninger (right tackle), Thaddeus Farnham (right end), Richards (quarterback), Hazen Pingree (right halfback), Thomas Jesse Drumheller and Steel (left halfback), and William Caley and Hannan (fullback).|$|E

2500|$|Vice President Cheney, {{there have}} been new {{developments}} in Iraq, especially {{having to do with}} the administration's handling.

Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics.

2500|$|The R-1 won the 1932 Thompson Trophy [...] race, piloted by Jimmy Doolittle. [...] He {{also set}} a new world landplane speed record of 476km/h (296mph) in the Shell Speed Dash. The {{distinction}} of a landplane record was noteworthy because, at that time, specialized speed seaplanes outran landplanes, e.g. the Macchi M.C.72 with over 700km/h. The Springfield Union of September 6, 1932 quoted Doolittle as saying, [...] "She is the sweetest ship I've ever flown. She is perfect in every respect and the motor is {{just as good as}} it was a <b>week</b> <b>ago.</b> It never missed a beat and has lots of stuff in it yet.
