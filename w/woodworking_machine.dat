50|$|A {{thickness}} planer (also {{known in}} the UK and Australia as a thicknesser or in North America as a planer) is a <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> to trim boards to a consistent thickness throughout their length and flat on both surfaces.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> is {{a machine}} that is {{intended}} to process wood. These machines are usually powered by electric motors and are used extensively in woodworking. Sometimes grinding machines (for grinding woodworking tools) are also considered a part of woodworking machinery.|$|E
50|$|A wood shaper, {{usually just}} shaper in North America or spindle moulder in the UK, is a {{stationary}} <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> {{in which a}} vertically oriented spindle drives cutter heads to mill profiles on wood stock. The spindle may be raised and lowered relative to the shaper's table, and rotates between 3,000 and 10,000 rpm, with stock running along a vertical fence.|$|E

50|$|A jointer {{or in some}} configurations, a jointer-planer (also {{known in}} the UK and Australia as a planer or surface planer, and {{sometimes}} also as a buzzer or flat top) is a <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> used to produce a flat surface along a board's length. As a jointer, the machine operates on the narrow edge of boards, preparing them for use as butt joints or gluing into panels. A planer-jointer setup has the width that enables smoothing ('surface planing') and leveling the faces (widths) of boards {{small enough to fit}} the tables.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 1990s Swan {{moved to}} the Scottish Borders and {{developed}} a second career as a woodworker (carpenter, cabinet maker and violin restorer). After cutting {{off the top of}} a finger with a <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> in 2008, he decided to give up the large-scale carpentry and concentrate on restoring old violins. He soon became fascinated and exasperated by the variations in tonal quality of old violins and started researching the methods of Eastern European violin makers. This led to him designing a range of handmade violins, violas and cellos, travelling to Transylvania to choose tonewood and developing friendships with the Hungarian luthiers who now make the instruments for him.|$|E
50|$|A {{router table}} is a {{stationary}} <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> in which a vertically oriented spindle of a woodworking router protrudes from the machine table and can be spun at speeds typically between 3000 and 24,000 rpm. Cutter heads (router bits) may be mounted in the spindle chuck. As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the cutters mold a profile into it. The machine normally features a vertical fence, against which the workpiece is guided to control the horizontal depth of cut. Router tables are used to increase the versatility of a hand-held router, as each method of use is particularly suited to specific application, e.g. very large workpieces would be too large to support on a router table and must be routed with a hand-held machine, very small workpieces would not support a hand-held router and must be routed on a router table {{with the aid of}} pushtool accessories etc.|$|E

50|$|Now {{over one}} hundred years old, the O'Bryant began as the Mechanic Arts High School in 1893. Until the early 1970s, it was an all-boys school. In 1944, the school became Boston Technical High School. The {{original}} building containing the various shops, <b>woodworking,</b> <b>machine</b> shop, forge shop and drafting rooms was built around 1900 and was located {{on the corner of}} Dalton and Belvidere Streets in the Back Bay. The Hilton Hotel is located there today. In 1909 the five-story class room, chemistry and physics labs building was completed on Scotia Street adjacent to the older building. Later, the school moved to the building that originally housed Roxbury Memorial High School (1930 to 1960) at 205 Townsend Street in Roxbury, Massachusetts. That school building is now the home of Boston Latin Academy. Boston Technical High School remained there until 1987 when it relocated to a new building at 55 New Dudley Street (now Malcolm X Boulevard). In 1989, Boston Technical High School and Mario Umana Technical High School merged but still kept the name of Boston Technical High School. In 1992, the school was renamed after Boston educator John D. O'Bryant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. At present, guards on <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine</b> tools have {{to undergo}} an impact test with a 100 g {{projectile}} and an impact speed of 70 m/s {{to protect the}} operator against breaking tools. At the moment, only sheet metal housings and plastic elements of polycarbonate as well as particular safety curtain systems meet these requirements regarding the retention capacity of machine enclosures for woodworking centres according to EN 848 - 3. In context of this work, a machine enclosure made out of lightweight materials was developed as alternative to the conventional sheet metal housings. A solution for safety curtains that passes easy over the workpieces without damaging the edges was also worked out. With regard to rigid guards, {{many different kinds of}} material combinations were examined concerning retention capacity and acoustic behaviour. In addition to the experimental tests, a FEM model was developed representing the impact behaviour of the composite based. Finally, a lightweight enclosure prototype was designed and examined with regard to the retention capacity at critical spots and of sound emission...|$|E
40|$|In {{the project}} MobiKAM, the {{foundation}} for a seeing machine as an integrated system has been developed. Similar to the way tools are integrated in the machine, the camera operates as a mobile, energy self-sufficient optical sensor being a new interchangeable machine element. In comparison to available techniques, a more flexible and advanced measuring and testing in the working area of production machinery is facilitated. In the sense of Plug-and-Work, the camera system is integrated the easiest way into the machine as well as into the control system. For the use in the working area of a production machine, a camera system has been developed which is resistant to concussions and contamination as well as electromagnetic disturbances. To grant convenient installation and handling of the camera the way it is practiced with tools, self-sufficient energy supply and wireless communication for the transmission of control signals and image data will be implemented. Latest energy storage systems as well as a highly efficient energy management system ensure lengthy operating times. The exemplary implementation for the solutions worked out will be tested for a machine tool and a <b>woodworking</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E

50|$|Generally speaking, spindle {{speeds and}} feed rates are less {{critical}} in woodworking than metalworking. Most <b>woodworking</b> <b>machines</b> including power saws such as circular saws and band saws, jointers, Thickness planers rotate {{at a fixed}} RPM. In those machines, cutting speed is regulated through the feed rate. The required feed rate can be extremely variable depending {{on the power of}} the motor, the hardness of the wood or other material being machined, and the sharpness of the cutting tool.|$|R
