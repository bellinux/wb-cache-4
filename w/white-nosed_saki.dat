50|$|Few {{detailed}} {{studies of}} {{flora and fauna}} have been undertaken.The Manicore marmoset (Mico manicorensis) was discovered in the forest.The savanna enclaves are seen by biologists as important in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of the Amazonian biota.There is high diversity of birds.The forest may provide {{a breeding ground for}} several commercially important species of fish.Mixed groups of woolly monkeys and <b>white-nosed</b> <b>saki</b> (Chiropotes albinasus) have been observed, an unusual occurrence in the Amazon.|$|E
40|$|<b>White-nosed</b> bearded <b>sakis</b> (Chiropotes albinasus) are {{endemic to}} the Madeira-Xingu interfluvium in {{southern}} Amazonia, though recent field-work has produced conflicting {{data on the}} southwestern limits of the species's geographic range. We reevaluated the distribution of bearded sakis {{on the basis of}} surveys from 34 sites throughout the Brazilian state of Rondonia. Chiropotes albinasus occurred at seven sites {{in the eastern part of}} the state, including two west of the Jiparana-Pimenta Bueno river system in the extreme south, but there is no record of their presence further north and west in the Jiparana-Guapore interfluvium and they were absent from the Jiparana- Mamore interfluvium. The data suggest that ecological, rather than geographic barriers restrict the distribution of Chiropotes albinasus in southern Rondonia, but are contradictory with regard to the possible determining factors. Chiropotes albinasus appears able to thrive in transi-tional, savanna-like ecosystems in southern Rondonia, but is unexpectedly absent from adjacent areas of terra firme forest. Syntopy with the only other pitheciine found in the state (Pithecia irrorata) appears to have a negative effect on the abundance of Chiropotes albinasus which implies that interspecific competition may reinforce a complex of limiting factors, such as the availability of key plant species. Despite showing that Chiropotes albinasus is widespread in southern Rondonia, we also confirm its absenc...|$|R
50|$|The {{forest is}} home to species endemic to the Amazon basin such as the Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) and tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), and to the white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus) and <b>white-nosed</b> <b>saki</b> (Chiropotes albinasus), {{primates}} whose presence in the Tapajós basin was not certain until their presence {{was reported in the}} forest. Bird species endemic to the forest include the dark-winged trumpeter (Psophia viridis), Gould's toucanet (Selenidera gouldii) and lettered aracari (Pteroglossus inscriptus).|$|E
50|$|The Amazon and {{its major}} tributaries {{such as the}} Xingu, Tapajós, Madeira, Purus and Rio Negro form {{barriers}} to the geodispersal of plants, animals and even insects. Thus the white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons) and hairy saki (Pithecia hirsuta) are found west of the Tapajós, while the <b>white-nosed</b> <b>saki</b> (Chiropotes albinasus) is only found east of the river.The World Wildlife Fund divides the biome into ecoregions, often defined as the regions lying between major tributaries of the Amazon.|$|E
50|$|Primates include {{spider monkey}} (Atelinae subfamily), Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus), common {{squirrel}} monkey (Saimiri sciureus), bare-eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus) and red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas). Endemic primates include Hoffmanns's titi (Callicebus hoffmannsi), ashy black titi (Callicebus cinerascens), Hershkovitz's titi (Callicebus dubius), Santarem marmoset (Mico humeralifer) and white-footed saki (Pithecia albicans).Endangered primate include white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek), white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), <b>white-nosed</b> <b>saki</b> (Chiropotes albinasus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) and pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor).|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-nosed</b> <b>saki</b> (Chiropotes albinasus) is an {{endangered}} species of bearded saki, a type of New World monkey, endemic to the south-central Amazon rainforest in Brazil and possibly a small area east of Bolivia. Both its scientific and common name were caused by the authors working from dead specimens, where the skin on and around the nose fades to whitish. In living individuals, it is actually bright pink (though with fine barely visible white hairs), and the pelage is black. No other species of the genus Chiropotes have a brightly colored nose.|$|E
50|$|Average annual {{rainfall}} is 2101 mmTemperatures {{ranges from}} 22 to 32 C {{with an average}} of 27 C.About 78% of the unit is covered by dense submontane rainforest with emergent canopy, and 7% by dense submontane rainforest with uniform canopy.Smaller areas are covered by alluvial rainforest with uniform canopy and open submontane rainforest.The area is considered an ecological sanctuary, with an unusually high concentration of primates and more than 600 species of birds.It is a suitable habitat for survival of the jaguar. Of fourteen primate species, three are endemic.Threatened primates include the red-faced spider monkey, <b>white-nosed</b> <b>saki</b> and woolly monkey.|$|E

50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{covers the}} interfluvial region between the Madeira River {{to the west}} and the Tapajós rivers to the east, two large tributaries of the Amazon to the north.Above the sources of the Tapajós the ecoregion extends south to the Guaporé River basin.The large rivers prevent the spread of flora and fauna. Thus the white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons) and hairy saki (Pithecia hirsuta) are found west of the Tapajós, while the <b>white-nosed</b> <b>saki</b> (Chiropotes albinasus) is only found east of the river.In the south the bounds of the ecoregion are defined by distinct changes in vegetation, with the transition to Mato Grosso tropical dry forests in the southeast and to the Beni savanna and later the Chiquitano dry forests in the southeast.|$|E
