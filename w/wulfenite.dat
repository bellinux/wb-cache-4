5|$|Molybdenum {{trioxide}} (MoO3) {{is used as}} an adhesive between enamels and metals. Lead molybdate (<b>wulfenite)</b> co-precipitated {{with lead}} chromate and lead sulfate is a bright-orange pigment used with ceramics and plastics.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral in the oxidized zone of lead-bearing deposits, the vanadium is leached from wall-rock silicates. Associated minerals include mimetite, pyromorphite, descloizite, mottramite, <b>wulfenite,</b> cerussite, anglesite, calcite, barite, and various iron oxide minerals.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite is an {{uncommon}} mineral, only occurring {{as the result}} of chemical alterations to a pre-existing material. It is therefore known as a secondary mineral. It is found in arid climates and forms by oxidation of primary lead minerals. Vanadinite is especially found in association with the lead sulfide, galena. Other associated minerals include <b>wulfenite,</b> limonite, and barite.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum is the 54th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust and the 25th {{most abundant}} element in its oceans, {{with an average of}} 10parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant element in the Universe. The Russian Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6µm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon. The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur {{in the same way as}} copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as <b>wulfenite</b> (PbMoO4) and powellite (CaMoO4), the main commercial source is molybdenite (MoS2). Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.|$|E
25|$|The {{deposits}} include diverse secondary minerals such as arsenopyrite, anglesite, baryte, bournonite, cerussite, chalcopyrite, freibergite, galena, mimetite, pyrite, pyromorphite, quartz, semseyite, sphalerite, stannite, tetrahedrite and <b>wulfenite.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{high quality}} {{turquoise}} promoted as Bisbee Blue was {{a by-product of}} the copper mining. Many high-quality mineral specimens have come from Bisbee area mines and {{are to be found}} in museum collections worldwide. Some of these minerals include cuprite, aragonite, <b>wulfenite,</b> malachite, azurite, and galena.|$|E

50|$|The Castle Dome mining {{district}} {{is a popular}} district for mineral collectors. The region is known for striking combinations of cerussite, fluorite, vanadinite, <b>wulfenite,</b> barite, and mimetite, as well as galenite and anglesite. The Hull Mine and Puzzler Mine in particular have produced atypical green vanadinite and mimetite as well as yellow-hued <b>wulfenite.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An {{extensive}} {{solid solution}} {{exists between the}} two end members <b>wulfenite</b> and stolzite (PbWO4), such that tungstenian-wulfenite compositions range from 90% <b>wulfenite</b> and 10% stolzite to chillagite (64% <b>wulfenite,</b> 36% stolzite) and so on. Nevertheless, the Commission for New Minerals and Mineral Names of the International Mineralogical Association has deemed that the solid solutions do not require new names. The correct nomenclature of the 90:10 solid state is wulfenite-I41/a and the 64:36 solid state is wulfenite-I4. [...] The structure of the wulfenite-I41/a system {{can be described as}} a close packing of tetrahedral MoO42− anions and Pb2+ cations. [...] In the lattice, the MoO42− anions are slightly distorted, though the bond lengths remain equal and the oxygens are linked through Pb-O bonds. Each lead atom has an 8-coordination with oxygen and two slightly different Pb-O bond distances. This structure closely resembles that of pure <b>wulfenite.</b>|$|E
