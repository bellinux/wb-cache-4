5|$|British forces {{landed at}} Calvi on 19 June, and {{immediately}} began moving guns ashore {{to occupy the}} heights surrounding the town. While Nelson directed a continuous bombardment of the enemy positions, Stuart's men began to advance. On 12 July Nelson <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> of the forward batteries {{early in the morning}} when a shot struck one of the sandbags protecting the position, spraying stones and sand. Nelson was struck by debris in his right eye and was forced to retire from the position, although his wound was soon bandaged and he returned to action. By 18 July most of the enemy positions had been disabled, and that night Stuart, supported by Nelson, stormed the main defensive position and captured it. Repositioning their guns, the British brought Calvi under constant bombardment, and the town surrendered on 10 August. However, Nelson's right eye had been irreparably damaged and he eventually lost all sight in it.|$|E

5|$|Farrell was {{inspired}} to try acting when Henry Thomas' performance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial moved him to tears. With his brother's encouragement, he attended the Gaiety School of Acting, dropping out when he was cast as Danny Byrne on Ballykissangel, a BBC drama about a young English priest who becomes part of an Irish rural community. As an 18-year-old travelling in Sydney, he <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> time suspected for attempted murder. The police sketch looked remarkably like him and he had even described blacking out during the night in question. His only alibi was apparently a journal kept by his friend that explained the two had been across town that night, taking MDMA.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1927 by the West Australian botanist Charles Gardner, the species <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> stage considered {{a variety of}} B.sphaerocarpa. Although there are no recognised subspecies or varieties, both lignotuberous and nonlignotuberous forms exist for Banksia violacea. Wasps, ants and flies have been recorded visiting flower spikes. Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Regarded as of little value to floriculture, it is rarely cultivated.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years Clark's {{mounting}} debts {{made it impossible for}} him to retain ownership of his land, since it became subject to seizure due to his debts. Clark deeded much of his land to friends or transferred ownership to family members so his creditors could not seize it. Lenders and their assignees eventually deprived the veteran of nearly all of the property that remained in his name. Clark, who <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> time the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory, was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville. In 1803 Clark built a cabin overlooking the Falls of the Ohio, where he lived until his health failed in 1809. He also operated a small gristmill, which he worked with two African American slaves.|$|E

5|$|Royal Sovereigns main {{opponent}} was {{the large}} Spanish first rate Santa Ana, {{with whom she}} was engaged for several minutes {{at the start of}} the action without support. During this time, Royal Sovereign <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point engaged with five different enemy ships, and suffered heavy damage and casualties during the engagement, finally subduing the 112-gun Santa Ana after a duel lasting several hours. Both ships were left unmanageable at the end of the engagement, Royal Sovereign being taken in tow by HMS Euryalus into which Collingwood transferred his flag. Royal Sovereign had suffered nearly 150 casualties, Santa Ana over 300 by the end of the battle. Santa Ana was later abandoned by her captors and ultimately fell back into Spanish hands, but Royal Sovereign reached the safety of Gibraltar soon after the battle.|$|E
5|$|Sidle {{was born}} on September 16, 1971, in Tomales Bay, {{an hour and a}} half north of San Francisco. Her father was an abusive {{alcoholic}} and was killed by Sidle's schizophrenic mother in 1984. Afterward, she spent time in the foster care system, which didn't keep her from graduating high school as valedictorian at age 16. She attended Harvard on a scholarship, moving on to graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley. While at Berkeley, she started a work-study position at the San Francisco Coroner's Office, where she would also audit lectures to keep up with new developments; it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> of these that she met Gil Grissom.|$|E
5|$|The 1907 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> point the only Atlantic {{hurricane season}} {{that did not}} feature a hurricane. With only five tropical storms having formed, it was a relatively inactive season; of those that did, three made landfall, of which all occurred on the shoreline of the Gulf Coast of the United States. The first storm of the season formed on June24, while the final dissipated on November12. Damage from the storms were minimal, and no deaths were reported. Due {{to the lack of}} modern technology, including satellite imagery, information is often sparse, and four additional systems could have formed during the season. A documentation for four possible storms during the season exists, although it has not been proven that these systems were fully tropical.|$|E
