30|$|Therefore, for <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> {{secondary}} user equipments (UEs) in CR networks, {{they can}} harvest energy from RF signals transmitted {{from the primary}} UEs {{as well as from}} a dedicated power station. For the CR networks that offer data traffic offloading service to the primary networks, the <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> secondary UEs can harvest energy while the primary UEs are transmitting and transmit using the harvested energy while the QoS of the primary UEs is satisfied and the secondary UEs are allowed to transmit. Such data traffic offloading for the primary UEs via CR networks with <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> secondary UEs can achieve a win-win situation for the primary UEs and the secondary UEs. However, how to optimize time allocation between energy harvesting and data transmission, how to determine which primary UEs are offloaded to the CR network, and how to control the transmit powers of the secondary UEs and the primary UEs remain unknown. This motivates the work in this paper.|$|R
25|$|<b>Wireless</b> <b>power</b> {{transfer}} {{is a process}} whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load {{that does not have}} a built-in power source, without the use of interconnecting wires.

40|$|Various {{nondestructive}} testing (NDT) technologies for construction and performance monitoring {{have been studied}} for decades. Recently, the rapid evolution of wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies has enabled the development of sensors that can be embedded in concrete to monitor the structural health of infrastructure. Such sensors can be buried inside concrete and they can collect and report valuable volumetric data related {{to the health of}} a structure during and/or after construction. Wireless embedded sensors monitoring system is also a promising solution for decreasing the high installation and maintenance cost of the conventional wire based monitoring systems. Wireless monitoring sensors need to operate for long time. However, sensor batteries have finite life-time. Therefore, in order to enable long operational life of wireless sensors, novel <b>wireless</b> <b>powering</b> methods, which can charge the sensors’ rechargeable batteries wirelessly, need to be developed. ^ The optimization of RF <b>wireless</b> <b>powering</b> of sensors embedded in concrete is studied here. First, our analytical results focus on calculating the transmission loss and propagation loss of electromagnetic waves penetrating into plain concrete at different humidity conditions for various frequencies. This analysis specifically leads to the identification of an optimum frequency range within 20 – 80 MHz that is validated through full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Second, the effects of various reinforced bar configurations on the efficiency of <b>wireless</b> <b>powering</b> are investigated. Specifically, effects of the following factors are studied: rebar types, rebar period, rebar radius, depth inside concrete, and offset placement. This analysis leads to the identification of the 902 – 928 MHz ISM band as the optimum power transmission frequency range for sensors embedded in reinforced concrete, since antennas working in this band are less sensitive to the effects of varying humidity as well as rebar configurations. Finally, optimized rectennas are designed for receiving and/or harvesting power in order to charge the rechargeable batteries of the embedded sensors. Such optimized <b>wireless</b> <b>powering</b> systems exhibit significantly larger efficiencies than the efficiencies of conventional RF <b>wireless</b> <b>powering</b> systems for sensors embedded in plain or reinforced concrete. ...|$|R
40|$|Radio-frequency (RF) signals enabled <b>wireless</b> {{information}} and <b>power</b> transfer (WIPT) is a cost-effective technique to achieve two-way communications {{and at the}} same time provide energy supplies for low-power wireless devices. However, the information transmission in WIPT is vulnerable to the eavesdropping by the energy receivers (ERs). To achieve secrecy communications with information nodes (INs) while satisfying the energy transfer requirement of ERs, an efficient solution is to exploit a dual use of the energy signals also as useful interference or artificial noise (AN) to interfere with the ERs, thus preventing against their potential information eavesdropping. Towards this end, this article provides an overview on the joint design of energy and information signals to achieve energy-efficient and secure WIPT under various practical setups, including simultaneous <b>wireless</b> {{information and}} <b>power</b> transfer (SWIPT), <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> cooperative relaying and jamming, and <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> communication networks (WPCN).

25|$|Before World War 2, little {{progress}} was made in <b>wireless</b> <b>power</b> transmission. Radio was developed for communication uses, but couldn't be used for power transmission {{due to the fact}} that the relatively low-frequency radio waves spread out in all directions and little energy reached the receiver. In radio communication, at the receiver, an amplifier intensifies a weak signal using energy from another source. For power transmission, efficient transmission required transmitters that could generate higher-frequency microwaves, which can be focused in narrow beams towards a receiver.|$|E
25|$|The space-based portion {{will not}} need to support itself against gravity (other than {{relatively}} weak tidal stresses). It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will {{have to cope with}} space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares. Two basic methods of conversion have been studied: photovoltaic (PV) and solar dynamic (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. <b>Wireless</b> <b>power</b> transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.|$|E

Bride later remembered being moved by the way Phillips continued working. While their backs were turned, a crew member (either a stoker or trimmer) snuck in and attempted to steal Phillips's lifebelt. Bride saw and grabbed the man as Phillips stood up and knocked the crew member out. The water was beginning to flood the wireless room as they both {{ran out of the}} wireless room, leaving the unconscious crewman where he fell. The men then split up, Bride heading forward and Phillips heading aft. This was the last time Bride saw Phillips.|$|E
30|$|We {{consider}} a secondary small cell with <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> SUEs to provide data traffic offloading service to MUEs {{in a primary}} macrocell and formulate the problem of optimizing data traffic offloading, time, and power allocation for maximizing the SUE sum rate under the required minimum MUE sum rate.|$|R
50|$|In {{far-field}} or radiative techniques, {{also called}} power beaming, power is transferred by beams of electromagnetic radiation, like microwaves or laser beams.

30|$|The {{works on}} energy-harvesting-based CR {{networks}} include [28 – 32]. In [28], {{the time and}} energy allocation problem for CR multiple access networks with energy harvesting was formulated as a Stackelberg game, and then, the Stackelberg equilibrium was derived. In [29], a distributed channel selection strategy was proposed for a multichannel CR system with energy-harvesting secondary users. In [30], the optimal power control and time allocation for CR networks with <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> secondary users to maximize the sum rate of the secondary users under the interference power constraint at the primary user was derived. In [31], the <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> secondary users were assumed to relay the signals from the primary users and energy-efficient scheduling and power control algorithms were proposed. In [32], the secondary users were assumed {{to cooperate with the}} <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> primary users in exchange for transmission opportunities and the resource allocation schemes to maximize the sum rate of the secondary users under the minimum rate constraint at the primary users were proposed. It is noted that, although the works in [28 – 32] considered to guarantee or improve the performance of the primary users, unlike this paper, they did not consider that the SUs can provide offloading service to the primary users. To our best knowledge, there is no work on the topic of data traffic offloading considering both CR and energy-harvesting capabilities yet.|$|R
25|$|A major {{export of}} the initial space {{settlement}} designs was anticipated to be large solar power satellites that would use <b>wireless</b> <b>power</b> transmission (phase-locked microwave beams or lasers emitting wavelengths that special solar cells convert with high efficiency) to send power to locations on Earth, or to colonies on the Moon or other locations in space. For locations on Earth, this method of getting power is extremely benign, with zero emissions and far less ground area required per watt than for conventional solar panels. Once these satellites are primarily built from lunar or asteroid-derived materials, the price of SPS electricity could be lower than energy from fossil fuel or nuclear energy; replacing these would have significant benefits such as the elimination of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste from electricity generation.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the cost}} of {{implementing}} such a system, SBSP also introduces several technological hurdles, including the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to Earth's surface for use. Since wires extending from Earth's surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology, SBSP designs generally {{include the use of}} some manner of <b>wireless</b> <b>power</b> transmission and its concomitant conversion inefficiencies, as well as land use concerns for the necessary antenna stations to receive the energy at Earth's surface. The collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board, powering a microwave transmitter or laser emitter, and transmit this energy to a collector (or microwave rectenna) on Earth's surface. Contrary to appearances of SBSP in popular novels and video games, most designs propose beam energy densities that are not harmful if human beings were to be inadvertently exposed, such as if a transmitting satellite's beam were to wander off-course. But the vast size of the receiving antennas that would be necessary would still require large blocks of land near the end users to be procured and dedicated to this purpose. The service life of space-based collectors in the face of challenges from long-term exposure to the space environment, including degradation from radiation and micrometeoroid damage could also become a concern for SBSP.|$|E

Under the assumption that the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoder is available or not available at the SBS, iterative optimization-based data traffic offloading schemes are proposed to maximize the SUE sum rate provided that the required minimum MUE sum rate is satisfied. It is shown that the proposed data traffic offloading schemes are effective in improving the performance of the MUEs and providing transmission opportunities for the <b>wireless</b> <b>powered</b> SUEs.|$|R
