5|$|Lisa's Florentine {{family was}} old and aristocratic but over time had lost their influence. They were <b>well</b> <b>off</b> but not wealthy, and lived on farm income {{in a city that}} was among the largest in Europe. While {{economically}} successful, there were great disparities in wealth among its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Never <b>well</b> <b>off</b> and {{struggling}} to make ends meet, he also suffered since youth from chronically bad health, including gout and tinnitus. His health first began to deteriorate during his time in Paris, where the dank climate and unsanitary environment {{did not agree with}} him.|$|E
5|$|A {{love affair}} between Thamarai (Kushboo) and her {{maternal}} uncle Nellaiyankondan (Jayaram) is badly received by their family, {{especially since he}} is not financially <b>well</b> <b>off.</b> Thamarai's father, King Periyamalaikozhundhu Gounder (Vijayakumar), arranges for her marriage to Mandhiyappan (Prakash Raj), ruler of a neighbouring country. Thamarai rejects the arranged marriage, angering Mandhiyappan. She later marries her lover, {{who had come to}} see her marry Mandhiyappan, and challenges her brother Chinna Malaikozhundhu (Ponvannan) to marry his daughters off to her sons (the marriage of cousins is a gounder custom). Periyamalaikozhundhu disowns his daughter for choosing Nellaiyankondan and banishes them from his kingdom.|$|E

5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head <b>well</b> <b>off</b> the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
5|$|From July 717 to August 718, {{the city}} was besieged by land and sea by the Muslims, who built an {{extensive}} double line of circumvallation and contravallation on the landward side, isolating the capital. Their attempt to complete the blockade by sea however failed when the Byzantine navy employed Greek fire against them; the Arab fleet kept <b>well</b> <b>off</b> the city walls, leaving Constantinople's supply routes open. Forced to extend the siege into winter, the besieging army suffered horrendous casualties from the cold {{and the lack of}} provisions.|$|E
5|$|Healey {{was born}} in Darlington, County Durham, the older child of Albert Healey and his wife Elizabeth née Jackson, {{daughter}} of a Stockton-on-Tees draper. The family was sufficiently <b>well</b> <b>off</b> to keep a live-in servant. Albert taught at the Bluecoat School in Stockton before moving to Darlington where he opened a hardware shop, and later worked for the National Telephone Company; he died in February 1899. Elizabeth remarried; {{at the time of}} the 1911 Census, Healey and his sister Winifred were assisting in their stepfather's business as licensee of the Three Tuns Hotel in Bishop Auckland.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Sergio was {{the third}} strongest Pacific {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} November on record. The nineteenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Sergio developed from a tropical wave on November 13 about 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico, and steadily intensified as it tracked southeastward. It reached peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) on November 15, and subsequently began to weaken due to increased wind shear as it turned to the north. Sergio later turned to the west, remaining <b>well</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Mexico, and dissipated on November 20 about 320miles (515km) west-northwest of it originally formed.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, she {{enrolled}} at the University of Chicago, where she studied music and languages, intending to become an orchestral musician. She studied the harp under Walfried Singer, the Chicago Symphony's harpist. She left after three years before graduating, lonely and bitterly disillusioned. In 1918, she married Albert Dilling, an engineer studying law who attended the same Episcopalian church as Elizabeth. The couple were <b>well</b> <b>off</b> financially, thanks to Elizabeth's inherited money and Albert's job as chief engineer for the Chicago Sewerage District. They lived in Wilmette, a Chicago suburb, and had two children, Kirkpatrick in 1920, and Elizabeth Jane in 1925.|$|E
5|$|On 11 December 2010, a monsoon trough {{developed}} {{northwest of}} Western Australia. Slowly tracking to the south, the system spawned a low pressure system (Tropical Low 03U) by 15 December. Turning southeastward, the low later made landfall near Coral Bay on 18 December. Within hours of moving inland, the system {{turned to the}} southwest and moved back over water the following morning. The storm was last noted on 20 December <b>well</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Western Australia.|$|E

50|$|The moors were filmed {{around the}} Black Mountains in Wales, and 'East Proctor' is {{in reality the}} tiny village of Crickadarn, about six miles {{southeast}} of Builth <b>Wells</b> <b>off</b> the A470. The ‘Angel of Death’ statue was a prop added for the film, but the red phone box is real - though the Welsh road signs were covered by a fake tree.|$|R
5|$|Rose Levin was {{a capable}} cook, and, though the {{household}} was not <b>well</b> <b>off,</b> Levin was well fed and acquired {{an interest in}} food that in adult life {{became one of the}} regular themes of his journalism. The cuisine was traditional Jewish, with fried fish as one cornerstone of the repertoire, and chicken as another – boiled, roast, or in soup with lokshen (noodles), kreplach or kneidlach. As an adult Levin retained his love of Jewish cookery along with his passion for French haute cuisine.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the orders}} of {{the captain of the}} Barracouta, Waddell {{immediately}} converted the warship back to a merchant ship, storing her cannon below, discharging all arms, and repainting the hull. At this point, Waddell decided to sail back to England and surrender the Shenandoah in Liverpool. Surrendering in an American port carried the certainty of facing a court with a Union point of view and the very real risk of a trial for piracy, for which he and the crew could be hanged. Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying <b>well</b> <b>off</b> shore to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is diurnal and chiefly an ambush predator, {{though it has}} been {{recorded}} as hunting partly by pursuit, such as catching pigeons at a watering hole before they can fly high enough to escape. It usually goes hunting from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return, if the hunting is good {{and it is not}} disturbed. It hunts mainly by sight and in doing so it commonly will raise much of its length <b>well</b> <b>off</b> the ground. The black mamba does not typically hold onto prey after biting, instead releasing its quarry and waiting for it to succumb to paralysis and die. This however depends on the type of prey; for example, it typically will hold onto a bird till it stops struggling to escape. If prey tries to escape or defend itself, the black mamba often may follow up its initial bite with a rapid series of strikes to incapacitate and quickly kill its prey. The snake has been known to prey on hyrax and rock hyrax, bushbabies, and bats. The black mamba has a potent digestive system and has been observed to digest prey fully within eight to ten hours.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{dropped below}} 11th place overall {{heading into the}} stage 10 {{individual}} time trial, where the squad had three riders finish in the top ten. Cancellara's fourth-place ride was perhaps a disappointment, in that he finished a minute and 27 seconds slower than the stage winner Tony Martin, the rider seen as his chief rival for the world championships time trial. Fuglsang took sixth on the day and Monfort tenth, putting Fuglsang 12 seconds off the race lead in second place overall and Monfort sixth 59 seconds back. Both of them lost time in stage 11, finishing in a group 27 seconds back of the group containing most of the race's top riders, but both remained in the top ten overall. Both again fell down the standings in stage 14 on La Farrapona, a day when {{out of the first}} 50 riders no more than four finished together. Their overall positions reversed the next day on the storied Alto del Angliru. Monfort finished with a group that lost time to only six riders, while Fuglsang was a further minute and eight seconds down the road from his teammate. This left Monfort fifth overall and Fuglsang seventh, after Fuglsang had been the higher-placed of the two for the entire race to that point. The next major mountain was Peña Cabarga in stage 17. Both riders were <b>well</b> <b>off</b> the pace, with Monfort finishing 19th and Fuglsang 31st. Monfort still held sixth overall with the result, but Fuglsang fell out of the top ten, down to 12th place. Fuglsang improved a place to 11th after stage 19, when Wouter Poels, who had been ahead of him, finished six minutes behind the main field. Those were their final overall positions, with both Monfort's sixth place and Fuglsang's 11th representing the best such finishes for either of them in a Grand Tour. The day before the race ended, Bennati gave the team a second stage win, coming home first in a large sprint finish in stage 20 at Vitoria.|$|E
