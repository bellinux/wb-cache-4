40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{relation}} between a three-dimensional {{state of strain}} and the optical phase retardation in a single mode optical fiber is formalized by drawing together classical three-dimensional crystal optics and classical waveguide theory. Neumann’s strain optic relations are described in a form usable in optical fiber sensor design. These relations are then combined with <b>weakly</b> <b>guiding</b> <b>fiber</b> theory to develop an integral which relates the optical phase shift in a structurally embedded interferometric optical fiber strain sensor to the induced three-dimensional strain field. This process leads to a previously undisclosed, additional waveguide dispersion term which contributes on the same order to the total strain induced phase retardation as does the term derived by Butter and Hocker (1978). Still, however, waveguide dispersion effects {{are found to be}} negligibly small, even in three-dimensional loading. Butter and Hocker’s equation and the complete phase-strain model developed herein can give very similar results when both are applied to certain embedded sensors. This anomaly can lead to the false conclusion that Butter and Hocker’s results are equally valid for any structurally embedded sensor...|$|E
40|$|Previous work on {{efficiency}} of light injection {{into the core}} of a fiber from a thin film and a bulk distribution of sources in the cladding have used the fields of a <b>weakly</b> <b>guiding</b> <b>fiber.</b> This approximation simplifies the analysis of the power efficiency by introducing universal values for the eigenvalues of different fibers with the same V-number, but cannot predict accurately the behavior of the injected light into a fiber with arbitrary differences in indices of refraction. The exact field solution was used in the expressions of the power efficiency, p sub eff, and its behavior {{as a function of the}} fiber parameter was analyzed. Weakly guiding results obtained previously are confirmed. However, P sub eff does not always increase with the V-number but with the difference in the indices of refraction, eta sub core-eta sub clad. For the bulk distribution it was found that P sub eff increases with the wavelength, lambda, and decreases with the fiber core radius, a, i. e., it decreases with the V-number. However, for the thin film, the P sub eff remains almost constant with lambda and the fiber core radius...|$|E

40|$|A {{vector mode}} {{analysis}} of dispersion-shifted-mode triangular-index fibers with a trench is presented. The aspects considered are the total dispersion, splice losses and bending loss of such fibers {{as a function}} of the trench width and location, wavelength fluctuations, index difference, as well as core radius change. The presence of a trench has pronounced effects on the performance of these fibers, yielding combined advantages of dispersion-shifted and dispersion-flattened fibers, and also improves the splice loss and bending loss characteristics. Some fiber characteristics due to the presence of a trench found in this study are interesting and have not been noted previously. As for the fabrication aspect, the effects of the parameter variations on the fiber performance are examined in detail. Unlike other authors' results obtained using the scalar modal fields, our formulas here derived from the vector modal fields facilitate the study of the polarization dependence of the splice and bending losses. For <b>weakly</b> <b>guiding</b> <b>fibers</b> with a small index gradient, the polarization dependence becomes negligible...|$|R

Acoustic waves are about five orders of magnitude slower than optical waves and can also be guided in cladded glass fibers, similar to optical fibers, with low loss and low dispersion (2 – 7). Fiber acoustic waveguides are believed to be a very attractive and basic component for further sensor development (8).

30|$|A {{multimode}} interference {{refractive index}} (RI) sensor {{based on the}} coreless fiber was numerically and experimentally demonstrated. Two identical single mode fibers (SMF) are spliced {{at both ends of}} a section of the coreless fiber which can be considered as the equivalent <b>weakly</b> <b>guiding</b> multimode <b>fiber</b> (MMF) with a step-index profile when the surrounding refractive index (SRI) is lower than that of the coreless fiber. Thus, it becomes the conventional single-mode multimode single-mode (SMS) fiber structure but with a larger core size. The output spectra will shift along with the changes in the SRI owing to the direct exposure of the coreless fiber. The output spectra under different SRIs were numerically studied, as well as the sensitivities with different lengths and diameters of the coreless fiber. The predication and calculation showed the good agreement with the experimental results. The proposed RI sensor proved to be feasible by verification experiments, and the relative error was merely 0.1 % which occupied preferable sensing performance and practicability.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of core-light injection from {{sources in the}} cladding of an optical fiber is modeled analytically {{by means of the}} exact field solution of a step-profile fiber. The analysis is based on the techniques by Marcuse (1988) in which the sources are treated as infinitesimal electric currents with random phase and orientation that excite radiation fields and bound modes. Expressions are developed based on an infinite cladding approximation which yield the power efficiency for a fiber coated with fluorescent sources in the core/cladding interface. Marcuse's results are confirmed for the case of a <b>weakly</b> <b>guiding</b> cylindrical <b>fiber</b> with fluorescent sources uniformly distributed in the cladding, and the power efficiency is shown to be practically constant for variable wavelengths and core radii.

40|$|A variational {{analysis}} of <b>weakly</b> <b>guiding</b> optical <b>fibers</b> is described. series expansion of Laguerre-Gauss functions and a modified Bessel function {{have been used}} to describe the field in the fiber core and in the uniform cladding, respectively. A numerical procedure optimizing the field parameters (the expansion coefficients, the Gaussian spot-size and the normalized transverse propagation constant) has been developed which allowed highly accurate field representations to be obtained through few-term expansions. Low-order LP modes have been analyzed for refractive index profiles with a power-law variation in the core for which reference solutions (either exact or approximate) are available. A modified profile exhibiting a high index ring around the core has also been analyzed. For power-law profiles, the results are in excellent agreement with the reference solutions and show that the proposed variational analysis also appears to be appropriate for determining the field at wavelengths near to cutoff. Moreover, the comparison with other field representations which use series expansions, shows that our solution needs a noticeably lower number of terms. The {{analysis of}} the modified profile, for which only numerical solutions are available, highlights that the developed method provides very accurate field representations...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. This thesis {{covers the}} theory and {{development}} of fused, biconically tapered, fibre-optic couplers and their application in sensors. The optical coupling between fibres is described {{by means of the}} coupled-mode theory {{in the case of a}} <b>weakly</b> <b>guiding</b> coupler. Firstly, simplified expressions for the guided modes in an optical fibre are derived. This is followed by the derivation of the coupled-mode equations for a perturbed waveguide. The coupled-mode equations are then used, together with the expressions for the guided modes, to determine the coupling coefficient for a <b>weakly</b> <b>guiding</b> coupler. In the case where the coupler is not <b>weakly</b> <b>guiding,</b> a model based on a rectangular dielectric waveguide is presented. A process for the manufacture of fibre-optic couplers, based on the fusion and elongation technique, was developed. This process is described and special attention is paid to the influence which different process parameters has on the properties of the couplers. During the development, the coupling theory was utilized to optimize the process. Results obtained with couplers manufactured by this process, are presented. A specific application of couplers, namely a new type of fibre-optic coupler sensor, was developed. The operation of the sensor relies on the change of the coupling ratio with an axially applied mechanical strain. Analog signal processing of the two outputs yields a signal which is directly proportional to the strain and which is independent of fluctuations of the light source power. The sensor was investigated experimentally by manufacturing temperature and elongation sensors which work on this principle. The operation and features of these sensors are presented, together with very promising experimental results...|$|R
