And even compared with the population of all ACP countries together (for whom, by whom, with whom Spore is produced), it s still just a sliver. We are, though, all important and we can share, even combine, our importance. The fact that each receiver of Spore shares its content directly with 26 other people on average means that the message reaches many more people than just the list of subscribers. The additional fact that hundreds of other magazines, newsletters, radio and television stations and other communicators all use articles from Spore mean that messages from Spore are reaching even more hundreds of thousands, or millions, of people. Three simple exercises in networking 1. There are one million and more readers and direct users of Spore. If the size of this poster represented the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> today, then one million people is a block of 8 mm x 8 mm. Just like this: 2. In reality though, we are not all squashed up into that one block. We are dispersed over all the ACP countries and many more. Our outreach is wider. Now, select we suggest somewhere near the centre of this poster, a letter i. Select, in your eye, or with a pencil, the dot on top of the i. If the size of the poster represents the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population,</b> that tiny dot represents a small group of perhaps twenty people. Imagine that you are part of that group, that dot. Now draw a line to another dot, say a finger s length away from you. Repeat this with, in all, 26 dots around you. (It is easiest if you do this is in a rough circle. You have now represented the outreach of an average Spore subscriber to other users of the same copy of the magazine. 3. Now select one of the dots to which you drew a line. From there, repeat the exercise to 10, 20, 30 other dots, each of which represents another person or small group. You have now represented the way Spore messages can move on to many more people. And so it goes on. If you look at the patterns you have made, they probably form a collection of star shapes, with parts of one star maybe touching another. That is the reason why we called the subscribers and readers of the magazine the Stars of Spore. It {{is one of the most}} natural, organic and effective forms of networking.

The transition in the developed world from an agricultural to an industrial-urban society has already produced substantial changes in human health, morphology and growth (Schell, Smith and Bilsborough, 1993, p. 1). By the year 2000, about 50 % of the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> total <b>population</b> will be living crowded in urban areas and soon thereafter, by the year 2025 as the global urban population reaches the 5 billion mark more of the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> will be living in urban areas. This has enormous health consequences. By the close of the twenty-first century, more people will be packed into the urban areas of the developing world than are alive on the planet today (UNCHS (Habitat), 1996, p. xxi). Africa presents a particularly poignant example of the problems involved, as it has the fastest population and urban growth in the world as well as the lowest economic development and growth and many of the poorest countries, especially in Tropical Africa. Thus it exemplifies in stark reality many of the worst difficulties of urban health and ecology (Clarke, 1993, p. 260). This essay is therefore concerned to analyse the trends of urbanization in Africa. This is followed by an overview of the environmental conditions of Africa s towns and cities.

By combining data from climate-related natural disasters and conflict data from the last 30 years this thesis tries to discern whether there is already an observable increase in the risk of civil war braking out in a country or location ravaged by climate disasters. A country level analysis is complimented by a disaggregated analysis utilizing geography information systems (GIS) data to see if there is any indication that a more detailed approach nets different results. The core findings of the thesis are that there is a heightened risk of civil war in geographical locations that have suffered a period of extreme drought, two to three years after the occurrence of the drought. Other types of disasters appear neither to increase nor decrease the risk of civil war onset in any significant way. Further there is no indication that climate-related natural disasters have any country-wide effect on the risk of civil war onset...|$|R

Moreover, there is a critical need to assess how under global climate change, cities will affect the local, regional, and even global climate. As urban areas increase in size, it is anticipated there will be a concomitant growth of the Urban Heat Island effect (UHI), and the attributes that are related to its spatial and temporal dynamics. Therefore, how climate change, including the dynamics of the UHI, will affect the urban environment, must be explored to help mitigate potential impacts on the environment (e. g., air quality, heat stress, vectorborne disease) and on human health and well being, to develop adaptation schemes to cope with these impacts...|$|R

Data used for model testing included crop growth, soil water, and soil-crop N of field trials conducted from 2001 to 2003 in four split doses (200 to 800 kg N ha- 1). In general, biomass, plant N uptake, and residual soil N predictions showed greater departures from measurements than total profile (0 - 180 cm) soil water and grain yield. Soil profile water contents were predicted within ± 2 % and biomass prediction errors were between - 2. 9 % and 2. 1 %. Grain yield was consistently underpredicted, but only by 5 % to 7 %. Other prediction errors ranged from - 0. 8 % to 5. 7 % for Crop N uptake, 0. 3 % to 6. 0 % for grain N uptake, and - 13. 6 % to 28. 7 % for residual soil N.

This thesis is written after three months of ethnographic research among urban permaculturists in San Francisco, the United States. The term permaculture was coined by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in Australia in the 1970 s and has spread throughout the world. Permaculturists, and specifically, San Francisco s permaculturists have their own specific way of engaging with society. By altering their consumption pattern, growing their own food and buying locally, they try to subvert the capitalist system. The urban garden is their main tool for changing their surroundings and changing culture. They do this by helping people re-imagine the city as a place where food can be produced and the ecosystem can be supported...|$|R

According to predictions from [1], a threefold increase is expected for the coming five years. This growth trend calls for high performance {{communication network}}s. Although the tremendous bandwidth from fiber supports transport of huge data from one place to another, todays switching technologies provide either deterministic quality in circuit switches or high resource utilization in packet switches. Regard to user applications transported on networks, while some of them require a deterministic circuit switch type of transport, others can be transported better in packet switch that are efficient in resource utilization. TransPacket Fusion switching [2], a hybrid type of switching integrates both circuit and packet type transport on a single node; hence can support various types of user applications from both worlds. It provides a deterministic circuit transport using dedicated wavelength, and uses the vacant gap on the wavelength to transport a low priority packet without affecting packets that are transported with deterministic quality. On this thesis, we build on the concept of hybrid switching by aggregating multiple sub-wavelength traffic, which have deterministic characteristics, on a single wavelength. In addition to that, we demonstrate how the vacant gaps from the aggregated traffic can be used to transport low priority packet traffic. Several experiments have been performed on a network set at UNINETT with Fusion prototype hybrid nodes from TransPacket. The results from the experiment show that: Fusion node can provide the required strict quality of service to the aggregated sub-wavelength circuits while, at the same time, increase resource utilization by injecting low priority traffic on vacant gaps...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that by the year}} 2025, 60 % of the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> will live in cities (UNFP, 1999). As cities continue to grow, urban sprawl (e. g., the expansion of urban surfaces outward into rural surroundings) creates unique problems related to land use, transportation, agriculture, housing, pollution, and development. Urban expansion also has measurable impacts on environmental processes. Urban areas modify boundary layer processes through the creation of an urban heat island (UHI). The literature indicates that the signature of the urban heat island effect may be resolvable in rainfall patterns over and downwind of metropolitan areas. However, a recent U. S. Weather Research Program panel concluded that more observational and modeling research is needed in this area (Dabberdt et al. 2000). NASA and other agencies initiated programs such as the Atlanta Land-use Analysis: Temperature and Air Quality Project (ATLANTA) (Quattrochi et al. 1998) which aimed to identify and understand how urban heat islands impact the environment. However, a comprehensive assessment of the role of urban-induced rainfall in the global water and energy cycle (GWEC) and cycling of freshwater was not a primary focus of these efforts. NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) seeks to develop a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural or human-induced changes to enable improved prediction capability for climate, weather, and natural hazards (NASA, 2000). Within this mission, the ESE has three basic thrusts: science research to increase Earth system knowledge; an applications program to transfer science knowledge to practical use in society; and a technology program to enable new, better, and cheaper capabilities for observing the earth. Within this framework, a research program is underway to further address the co-relationship between land cover use and change (e. g. urban development) and its impact on key components of the GWEC (e. g., precipitation). This presentation discusses the feasibility of using the TRMM or GPM satellite to identify precipitation anomalies likely caused by urbanization (Shepherd et al. 2002). Recent results from analyses of TRMM data around several major U. S. cities (e. g. Dallas, Atlanta, Houston) will be discussed. The presentation also summarizes a NASA-funded research effort to investigate the phenomenon of urban-induced precipitation anomalies using TRMM (future GPM) satellite-based remote sensing, an intensive ground observation/validation effort near Atlanta, and coupled atmosphere-land numerical modeling techniques...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB), {{caused by}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis, {{has been treated}} with the same arsenal of {{antibiotics}} since the 1970 s; and with an estimated {{one third of the}} <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> latently infected at the moment, new regimens are sorely needed. Treatment remains lengthy and difficult, and inappropriate dosing or administration of drugs as well as patient non-compliance is contributing to the rising threat of multi-, extensively- and now totally- drug resistant TB. Should further expansion of resistant strains become a reality it would render our current antibiotics useless. To address the need for new therapies, this thesis explores both in vitro and in vivo approaches using a novel nanoparticle-based efflux pump inhibitor-antibiotic combination treatment. Bacterial efflux pumps (EPs) are inducible membrane-based transporters that can reduce intracellular concentrations of drugs, which leaves open a window for the development of permanent genetic drug resistance. By blocking these EPs with EP inhibitors such as thioridazine (TZ), while simultaneously treating {{with one of the most}} efficient anti-TB drugs, rifampicin (RIF), we predicted a synergistic effect likely caused by an increased intracellular concentration of both drugs in the bacteria. The first aim of this study was to develop a protocol for the encapsulation of TZ in polymeric poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles (PLGA NPs). Our group has previously established that PLGA NPs with RIF localize in the same cells as the bacteria, and improve therapy both in vitro and in vivo relative to free drug. Slow release from these particles and facilitated macrophage uptake could potentially lead to treatment that can be administered less frequently in a more targeted and consequently less toxic manner. This may be especially beneficial in the case of TZ, which is associated with serious dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. The second aim of the study was therefore to determine if the encapsulated form of TZ was less toxic than the free form. The third aim of this study was to explore the possible role of TZ as a potentiator of traditional anti-TB therapy. We found that encapsulating TZ in PLGA NPs reduced TZ toxicity, and had a synergistic effect when administered together with RIF. This was the case both in vitro, in primary murine macrophages infected with Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and in vivo, in the zebrafish model infected with Mycobacterium marinum...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus mutans and Helicobacter pylori {{belong to}} the most common {{bacterial}} pathogens of humans. They infect more than 50 % of the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population.</b> Further, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) {{is regarded as the}} most common bacterial cause of diarrhoea worldwide. Colostrum is essential for a newborn by providing nutrition but also immunological protection. Immunoglobulins and complement system are considered as the major antimicrobial agents in bovine colostrum. By immunizing a cow it is possible to produce specific antibodies in serum and lacteal secretions against microbes. These antibodies have proven effective in preventing many gastrointestinal microbial diseases. Probiotic bacteria are often used in fermented dairy products because of their beneficial effects on human health. Some probiotic bacteria, especially lactobacilli, can inhibit growth and colonization of pathogens. Probiotic bacteria like Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) also reduce the side effects of antibiotic treatment. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of bovine colostrum and specific colostral antibodies, and some lactic acid bacteria on gastrointestinal infections, especially H. pylori induced gastritis and dental caries caused by S. mutans. The effect of colostrum on the activity of the complement system in neonatal calves was also studied. It was possible to increase substantially complement and opsonization activities of serum by feeding colostral whey concentrate to neonatal calves. A colostral immune preparation (IP) containing specific antibodies against H. felis prevented but did not eradicate an experimental H. felis infection in mice. However, the IP combined with amoxicillin lowered the level of inflammation and colonization more than amoxicillin alone. The specific anti-cariogenic antibodies of IP remained active and functional when added to UHT milk or fermented with LGG and stored for an extended time. Further, the combination of IP and LGG prevented the adherence of S. mutans effectively. Lactobacillus plantarum MLBPL 1 isolated from sauerkraut showed anti-Helicobacter activity mainly associated with cell wall, from where it can be extracted 5 into the culture supernatant. Colostral preparations, and acidifying microbes (L. plantarum MLBPL 1 and LGG) reduced the adhesion of H. pylori on human gastric adenocarcinoma cells.

40|$|Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis, {{is one of}} the most lethal {{infectious}} agents affecting humans. The World Health Organisation estimates that about one-third of the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> is infected with persistent mycobacteria and that tuberculosis accounts for approximately 2 million deaths annually. Treatment of this disease is complicated by the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to switch from the active form into a persistent phase. In this phase the bacteria have little or no replication and are not targeted as effectively by the antibiotics used today. The emergence of multi-drug resistant and extensively drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis poses a major threat to human health worldwide. Therefore the development of novel antibiotics especially targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the persistent state is of highest interest. In this thesis three target proteins from persistent phase Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been studied by protein crystallography and biochemical methods. The studies have focused on CysM, a cysteine synthase where transposon knockouts are attenuated in macrophages and AlaDH, a secreted protein showing altered expression profile upon adaptation to dormancy. Furthermore NarL, a member of the two component regulatory system family was studied since it has been shown to be up-regulated in dormant bacteria. This work has been done within a large consortium with the aim to develop novel antibiotics which are active against stationary phase persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The three-dimensional structure and subsequent functional characterization of CysM revealed that the enzyme is an O-phosposerine dependent sulfhydrylase in contrast to previous annotations as an O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. With these findings we can conclude that CysM is part of a new cysteine biosynthesis pathway that is independent of both O-acetylserine and sulphide. Furthermore it was shown that the C-terminus of CysM is acting as a lid and thereby protecting the reaction intermediate from spontaneous nucleophilic attack. The C-terminus is also responsible for the specificity of the thiocarboxylated protein substrate used in the second half reaction. The structures of apo and holo-AlaDH revealed a large domain rotation upon nucleotide binding. In the structure of the abortive complex with NAD+ and pyruvate, the substrates are suitably placed for hydride transfer between the nicotinamide ring and pyruvate. As the abortive complex that we have trapped most likely represents an active conformation of the enzyme it can serve as a suitable template for inhibitor design. The structure of the N-terminal domain of NarL was determined to 1. 9 Å and is similar to the structures of previously determined response regulators. Additionally a key residue is identified which might play an important role for the stability of the phospho-aspartyl anhydride. In conclusion this thesis describes the structure and functional characterization of three potential drug targets from persistent phase tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} cities, both in {{population}} and areal extent, appears as an inexorable process. Urbanization continues {{at a rapid}} rate, and {{it is estimated that}} by the year 2025, 60 percent of the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> will live in cities. Urban expansion has profound impacts on a host of biophysical, environmental, and atmospheric processes within an urban ecosystems perspective. A reduction in air quality over cities is a major result of these impacts. Because of its complexity, the urban landscape is not adequately captured in air quality models such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model that is used to assess whether urban areas are in attainment of EPA air quality standards, primarily for ground level ozone. This inadequacy of the CMAQ model to sufficiently respond to the heterogeneous nature of the urban landscape can impact how well the model predicts ozone levels over metropolitan areas and ultimately, whether cities exceed EPA ozone air quality standards. We are exploring the utility of high-resolution remote sensing data and urban spatial growth modeling (SGM) projections as improved inputs to a meteorological/air quality modeling system focusing on the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area as a case study. These growth projections include business as usual and smart growth scenarios out to 2030. The growth projections illustrate the effects of employing urban heat island mitigation strategies, such as increasing tree canopy and albedo across the Atlanta metro area, which in turn, are used to model how air temperature can potentially be moderated as impacts on elevating ground-level ozone, as opposed to not utilizing heat island mitigation strategies. The National Land Cover Dataset at 30 m resolution is being used as the land use/land cover input and aggregated to the 4 km scale for the MM 5 mesoscale meteorological model and the CMAQ modeling schemes. Use of these data has been found to better characterize low density/suburban development as compared with USGS lkm land use/land cover data that have traditionally been used in modeling. Air quality prediction for future scenarios to 2030 is being facilitated by land use projections using a spatial growth model. Land use projections were developed using the 2030 Regional Transportation Plan developed by the Atlanta Regional Commission, the regional planning agency for the area. This allows the Georgia Environmental Protection Division to evaluate how these transportation plans will affect future air quality. The coupled SGM and air quality modeling approach provides insight on what the impacts of Atlanta s growth will be on the local and regional environment and exists as a mechanism that can be used by policy makers to make rational decisions on urban growth and sustainability for the metropolitan area in the future...|$|R

Nowhere is this more critical than within many of the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> developing countries, and in particular within those Low-income Food-deficit countries (LIFDC; currently representing over 62 % of the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population),</b> which are net importers of food and lack sufficient earnings to purchase food to cover their basic dietary needs. Of the multitude of agricultural food production systems, aquaculture is widely viewed as being an important potential candidate capable of contributing to reductions in the shortfall in the terrestrial food basket. Aquaculture, the farming of aquatic plants and animals, has been the fastest growing food production sector for over a decade. Total global production from aquaculture more than tripled from 10 million metric tons (mmt) in 1984 to over 36 mmt in 1997, and production grew at an average compound rate of 1 l% per year since 1984. In contrast to traditional livestock food production systems, the bulk of global aquaculture is realised within developing countries (89. 6 % total) and LIFDCs (80. 6 % total). Despite its good prospects and apparent potential for continued growth, the aquaculture sector has not been without its problems and critics. In particular, there have been concerns raised related to deficiencies in existing aquaculture legislation and planning methods, the use of certain farming practices, issues of resource use efficiency, disease treatment and control, environmental degradation, social welfare, and employment opportunities, etc. Although the majority of these are not unique to the aquaculture sector, it is imperative that these issues be addressed and resolved if the sector is to emerge into a major global food production sector in the next millennium. In addition, the present paper reviews the origins and salient features of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF), and in particular of Article 9 of CCRF concerning aquaculture development. An overview is also presented of ongoing and planned initiatives concerning the implementation of the code. In particular, the paper attempts to consider the existing socioeconomic conditions of the majority of aquaculture producing countries within the Asian region, and the real basic need of identifying affordable and practical solutions to aid the development of the sector. Particular emphasis is placed on the need of government to provide an enabling economic and legislative environment and umbrella for the sustainable and responsible development of the sector, and the need for increased collaboration between the private and public sector organizations, and government engaged in all stages of the aquaculture development process.

40|$|ABSTRACT Severe {{deficiencies}} of iron (Fe) and iodine (I) affect {{more than one}} third of the <b>world</b> 9 <b>s</b> <b>population.</b> A table salt, fortified with I and Fe, would be useful in areas in which anemia and goiter coexist. However, interactions between the two minerals have prevented their simultaneous use as fortificants. A method has been developed to coat I with dextran such that after spraying onto table salt, Fe and I do not interact. Our objective was to determine the absorption of Fe and the urinary excretion of I from table salt when provided in meals designed to significantly inhibit or enhance Fe absorption. Subjects (n 5 16) ingested Fe-enhancing and Fe-inhibiting meals containing 5 g of table salt with 0. 39 mmol dextran-coated I as potassium iodide and 1 mg of Fe (ferrous fumarate labeled with 59 Fe) per gram of salt. Subjects also received a reference dose of 3 mg of ferrous fumarate labeled with 59 Fe to “correct ” for interindividual variation in iron absorption at a later date. Measured by whole-body counting, Fe-absorption from the Fe-enhancing meal (36. 2 6 12. 0 %, corrected; 13. 5 6 13. 8 % uncorrected) was significantly higher than that from the Fe-inhibiting meal (7. 4 6 11. 3 %, corrected; 4. 0 6 8. 4 %, uncorrected) (P, 0. 0001). Urinary excretion of iodine at baseline and postingestion were not significantly different (0. 89 6 0. 5 vs. 1. 06 6 0. 39 mmol/L, P, 0. 47) and were within the normal range. We conclude that Fe was well absorbed but influenced by the composition of the meal and that urinary excretion of iodine was maintained in the normal range with dextran-coated iodine. J.

With {{an increase in the}} <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> {{and at the same time}} a more energy demanding one the energy issue is and will be one aspect that will involve all of us. The demand and environmental impacts will require that an increasing share of the energy will be renewable. Waste systems has therefore become of bigger interests in the resent years. This thesis has looked at biogas/biofuel production from organic waste. Production of biogas from different types of food wastes and the upgrading to liquefied biogas (LBG) for the value chain of Romerike biogas plant (RBA) located outside Oslo has been chosen as a case study. An evaluation of resource efficiency performance and environmental life cycle impact for RBA has been conducted using material flow analysis (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA). The resource efficiency performance has been found by using MFA and measured by definition of indicators for material rate of recovery (MRR), nutrient rate of recovery (NRR) and energy efficiency (&# 951;). The MRR was found to be 3. 6 %. NRR for N and P was found to be respectively 26. 1 % and 7. 8 %. It was found that the DM content in solid biofertilizer as well as the food waste share in the residual waste had large impacts on these indicators. The energy efficiency of the system was found to be very low, 2. 5 %. This was due to that data for sold gas was received that actually was much lower than the produced gas. Energy efficiency of 26. 1 % was found by using an estimated volume correlated to the waste amount delivered to RBA in the investigated period. This showed that the use of correct produced gas volume has a large impact. In general the indicator values found were evaluated to be poorer than would have been the case if better data had been provided as well as the plant had not been in a run-up period. In the LCA conducted the GWP had the main focus. It was found that the RBA value chain had a total GWP impact of 455 kg CO 2 -eq. /FU. By the processes defined the collection of HHW had the biggest impacts. In all except one category these two processes contributed to over 80 % of the impact. The contribution found was evaluated to be higher than it is in reality due to the data used. It was found an avoided burden of 747 396 kg CO 2 -eq by implementing the value chain in contrast to use the alternative option (diesel and chemical fertilizer). Due to large uncertainties in the models established the results found in this thesis should be used more to indicate where there are problems than contribute to specific measures to be done. It is therefore beneficial that the models are improved by better definition of systems as well as more specific data should be provided...|$|R
40|$|Half of the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> live at {{risk for}} malaria and nearly one million people die from the disease every year. The malaria burden is {{greatest}} in children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. As effective treatment is crucial for malaria control, the spread of antimalarial drug resistance has contributed significantly to malaria attributed morbidity and mortality. The current cornerstones in malaria treatment are artemisininbased combination therapy (ACT) for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for intermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women. While resistance to SP is already established, recent advances have provided the first evidence of decreased susceptibility or resistance to the ACT components; artemisinins (ART) and the key ACT partner drugs lumefantrine, amodiaquine and mefloquine. Development of resistance to ACTs and aggravation of SP resistance could be devastating, as there are presently no further well established treatment options. This stresses the importance to understand the molecular mechanism of resistance in order to potentially prevent its emergence and spread. The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase orthologue of P. falciparum (PfATP 6) has been suggested to be a target for ART. Multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) {{are known to be}} related with multidrug resistance in many organisms. The P. falciparum Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 (pfMRP 1) has been suggested to have a role in the parasite response to several antimalarial drugs through drug efflux The aim of this thesis is to understand the role of PfATP 6 and pfMRP 1 in decreased susceptibility/resistance to ACTs and SP in vivo and in vitro. In two comprehensive studies the global biodiversity of PfATP 6 and pfmrp 1 was determined, resulting in the identification {{of a large number of}} SNPs suggesting that both genes harbor significant diversity. The contribution of the identified pfmrp 1 polymorphisms in the parasite drug response in vivo was studied in P. falciparum infected patients from clinical drug trials. We observed a selection of parasites harboring pfmrp 1 I 876 in patients with recurrent infections after treatment with artemether-lumefantrine and of pfmrp 1 K 1466 in recrudescent infections after SP treatment, providing the first indications ever that pfMRP 1 may have a role in P. falciparum drug response in vivo. In vitro associations between pfmrp 1 SNPs and decreased susceptibility to a large number of structurally unrelated antimalarial drugs, including artemisinin, lumefantrine, amodiaquine and mefloquine, were observed in P. falciparum fresh isolates. However, we could not detect any association with PfATP 6 SNPs. In conclusion, in this work no further evidence was found supporting the hypothesis of PfATP 6 as a target of ART. Nevertheless it was demonstrated that PfATP 6 harbors considerable sequence biodiversity which can be the basis for following studies investigating the association of PfATP 6 polymorphisms with artemisinin resistant or tolerant phenotypes, as they emerge. The association of pfmrp 1 polymorphism with P. falciparum response to a number of structurally unrelated drugs suggests that pfMRP 1 may be a true multidrug resistance factor. Potential pfMRP 1 -based cross-resistance between ART and the partner drugs may have implications for development of resistance to ACTs...|$|R

40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{persistently}} colonizes the gastric mucosa {{of approximately}} {{one half of}} the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population.</b> Colonization always leads to chronic gastric inflammation, which may progress to peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer or MALT lymphoma. The nature of H. pylori infection is determined by bacterial, host and environmental factors. Variability in strain virulence may be explained by the high genetic diversity of the species. The work presented in this thesis focuses on diverse bacterial factors and mechanisms that modulate persistent H. pylori infection. In paper I, we characterized the effects of clinical H. pylori isolates with diverse inflammatory background on human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (AGS) and studied their capacity to cause maturation and activation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). The inflammatory background of the bacteria was defined by the infiltration of lymphocytes and granulocytes at the site of infection. We found that the expression of the cytokines interleukin (IL) - 6 IL- 12, TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta was higher when DCs were infected with H. pylori of a higher inflammatory background. Such a correlation could not be described when analyzing IL- 8 induction in AGS cells. We suggest, that DCs {{play a major role in}} H. pylori infection and that the bacterium can influence the outcome of the interaction. In papers II and III, we investigated the prevalence of H. pylori virulence factors, the combination of virulence factors and their association with disease development in three major ethnicities in Malaysia and Singapore. The genes encoding an intact cag PAI, babA, oipA ON and vacA s 1 and i 1 were present in more than 85 % of the isolates, irrespective of the disease state or ethnicity. This demonstrates that these factors are not reliable predictors of disease in these populations. In contrast, the prevalence of dupA, hp 0521 alleles and EPIYA motifs varied with ethnicity. We observe an association between EPIYA motifs and hp 0521 alleles and suggest a novel function for HP 0521, probably correlated to CagA. The prevalence of dupA was further investigated in Swedish and Australian isolates. It varied between the geographic groups and could not be consistently associated with duodenal ulcer or gastric cancer across the investigated ethnic groups. The dupA gene was highly conserved in H. pylori strains with different geographic and ethnic background. A role in IL- 8 induction in AGS cells could not be confirmed. In paper IV, we examined the genetic diversity of type I restriction-modification (R-M) systems in clinical isolates of H. pylori. Due to the high sequence variability observed, we focused on the HsdS subunit, which is responsible for sequence specificity of the enzyme. A high number of novel allelic hsdS variants could be described. To investigate intra-strain diversity, we analyzed isolates obtained from six individuals at two different time points, four years apart. Most sequence variation could be observed for two isolates from patients with ongoing atrophy development. We therefore propose that H. pylori alters the specificity of type I R-M systems in response to a changing gastric environment, which may lead to adaptation. H. pylori is a genetically diverse species. The work presented in this thesis provides an insight into the effects of this high diversity on immune response to the bacterium, on variation in H. pylori virulence as well as on a possible bacterial adaptation process...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is {{a global}} epidemic, with {{one third of the}} <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> infected, at least 9 million new active cases per year and about 2 million deaths per year. Without {{adequate}} chemotherapy treatment TB may be a mortal disease. In countries like Sweden the mortality was dramatically reduced about half a century ago when modern TB drugs where introduced. These gains are however seriously jeopardized by the now emerging multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. In Sweden the majority of patients with TB are immigrant from countries with a high incidence of TB. The incidence among the Swedish-born population has continued to decrease while it has increased among the foreign-borns. In the West African country Guinea-Bissau TB is a common disease where the incidence is believed to be further increased by the epidemic of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Since independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has experienced considerable political and military turmoil. In 1998 the country and especially the capital Bissau suffered a civilian war that after a peace agreement in 1999 demanded a challenging rebuilding of the country. The national TB control programme has regrettably been having difficulties in its function. Different genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) predominate in different geographical regions of the world and strain-to-strain variations may have important consequences for instance when it comes to transmissibility. Future diagnostics, drugs and vaccines are affected by these strain variations and it is therefore of great importance to establish the whole spectrum of strains of the MTC world wide. Despite the high prevalence of TB in Africa, relatively {{little is known about the}} MTC genetic diversity on this continent. This study phylogenetically and epidemiologically characterized MTC isolates obtained from TB patients in Sweden and Guinea-Bissau using the two molecular techniques Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping). The work was performed with the view to understand species and strain diversity as well as transmission patterns. In Sweden, 400 drug-resistant isolates were collected during the years 1994 - 2005. The great majority (87 %) of the patients was foreign-born and originated from several regions, with a clear dominance for Africa, in particular the Horn of Africa. It was found that the T lineage was predominant and that the isolates of the foreign-born patients to a large extent reflected genotypes common in their country of origin. One large outbreak of isoniazid resistant TB was identified, at the time (2005) involving 96 patients, mainly from the Horn of Africa. This outbreak represents one of the largest outbreaks of TB ever reported and was an important warning signal to the Swedish authorities. This study showed that molecular epidemiological typing is a powerful tool to monitor and identify chains of transmission which indicate deficiencies in national TB control programs. It was our strong recommendation that Swedish health authorities should integrate full Directly Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS) in the Swedish national TB control program. In Guinea-Bissau we reinvestigated the molecular epidemiology of strains with regards to the phylogeography of M. africanum in West Africa. Altogether, 418 isolates collected at three different points in time were investigated. The main (47 %) lineage present was the AFRI (M. africanum) lineage which included the genotypically closely related but phenotypically heterogenic Guinea-Bissau family of strains. This family of strains appeared to be decreasing over time and may be out conquered by other more successful lineages such as the Beijing and Cameroon family of strains...|$|R

The research is conducted {{within the field of}} commercialization of renewable energy in developing countries. The research was chosen based on the authors desire to contribute to increase the success rate of emerging and existing renewable energy firms. Electricity is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity that the world faces today, and creates a room of opportunity for emergent and existing entrepreneurs. Still, as many as 1, 4 billion people of the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> live without access to electricity and 2, 5 billion people rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating. Most of who are people living in rural areas. In response, the United Nations have initiated collaboration in order to achieve universal access to modern energy services by 2030. As the public sector do not access the financial resources needed in order to meet this goal, the private sector plays a significant role. With $ 37 billion dollars being spent on poor-quality energy solutions each year, there is a great potential for entrepreneurs to run sustainable companies delivering widely needed innovative solutions. However, with rural renewable electrification being an emerging field of industry, and with the challenging conditions of this market, {{there is a need to}} build innovative business models in order to succeed. The authors have employed qualitative research with use of an exploratory multi-case study design, basing the investigation on literature and the Indian case companies: Mera Gao Power (MGP), Onergy and Applied Solar technology (AST). The authors interviewed the CoFounder and CEO of MGP, the CoFounder and CEO of Onergy as well as two additional employees and the long term employee of AST, ASTs manager of the Speed project, as well as their two partners, TARA and Nidan. From a literature review the authors have designed a theoretical approach including empirical data for the identification of critical business model components. The challenges with rural electrification, which are closely linked with the characteristics of the rural population in developing countries, can be categorized in the following: economic, legal, social and institutional challenges. For the entrepreneur it is important to design the business models in such a way that it responds to the external challenges. By applying business stage and business model theory, through looking at early stages and business model components in relation to the external challenges, the authors have developed a set of propositions as the answering the {{research question}}. The overall critical elements are shown to be partnership, investments and offering that enable customers to pay. Further the authors have identified additional elements that are also important in order for the entrepreneur to succeed. These are related to the offering and access of human resources. The identification shows that the criticality may be distinguished based on the entrepreneurs goals. The most important contribution of this research is to present how entrepreneurs need to prioritize their effort at an early stage in order to succeed when providing renewable energy to the rural population. Rural electrification is an emerging field of study and there has been limited focus on how offering meets the needs of the rural poor which in necessary in order to succeed in these markets. The authors believe that by presenting the critical and important elements of a business model in rural electrification the entrepreneur can get a guideline for designing a viable business. The finding of this study may facilitate further research by testing the propositions on more case companies from additional developing countries, providing a range of renewable energy solutions...|$|R

In Europe seaweeds have mainly been utilized industrially, and especially for their content of phycocolloids, this includes Norway. Due to the dramatic increase in the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>population</b> there is a demand for new food sources. However, the nutritional composition in macroalgae varies according to specie and environmental factors. Therefore, more knowledge on the chemical composition in the different macroalgal species is needed. In this thesis the chemical composition of Saccharina latissima, Alaria esculenta and Palmaria palmata was characterised. These are common macroalgal species growing on the Norwegian coast. In order to characterize the composition of these macroalgae the dry matter, ash, total lipids, total protein and total carbohydrates were determined, in addition to the amino acid and carbohydrate composition. Different seasons and depths were examined in order to find the most optimal harvesting conditions. The P. palmata sample was a wild growing sample, while S. latissima and A. esculenta contained both cultivated and wild samples. The cultivated algae samples were harvested in May and June (S. latissima was also harvested in April), and from depths of 2, 5 and 8 meters. In addition, samples containing a mixture of these depths were analysed. The wild samples were harvested in June and contained samples with a mixture of different depths. The protein content was found by determination of total nitrogen (the C/N method) and determination of the total amount of amino acids (by high-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC). Different hydrolysis methods were tried in order to see which gave the highest amino acid yields. Hydrolysis with 6 M HCl containing 0. 4 % β-mercaptoethanol was found to give the highest yields. Determination of the carbohydrate composition in the macroalgae was performed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAE). This method was optimized with regard to different hydrolysis times and different settings on the analysis instrument. The highest dry matter content could be found in the wild growing samples of S. latissima and A. esculenta. In cultivated S. latissima the dry matter was highest in the samples harvested in May, while the dry matter content in cultivated A. esculenta was highest in June. The ash content was highest in cultivated S. latissima and A. esculenta in May. The amount of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates were generally highest in cultivated S. latissima in May (except for the total carbohydrates), and in cultivated A. esculenta in June. Low lipid levels were found in all three macroalgae. When the samples were analysed by HPLC the results showed a higher protein content than when the samples were analysed by the C/N method. The protein content in S. latissima and A. esculenta was within the values reported in different literature for these species, while the protein content in P. palmata was low. The amino acid composition in S. latissima, A. esculenta and P. palmata was dominated by aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine and leucine. The carbohydrate content in S. latissima and A. esculenta was highest in the wild samples. The highest carbohydrate content in the cultivated samples could be found in April for S. latissima and in June for A. esculenta. The carbohydrate content was highest in P. palmata, which had a high amount of mannose/xylose and galactose. In S. latissima mannitol dominated the carbohydrate composition, while glucose dominated in A. esculenta, especially in the samples from June. The different depths only provided small variations in the chemical content. However, some of the S. latissima and A. esculenta samples containing a mixture of depths had a lower dry matter and ash content and a higher content of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, compared to the other samples. For example, the total protein content was twice as high in some of the samples containing a mixture of depths, than in the samples from individual depths.
