5000|$|As picross is {{traditionally}} played, {{to solve a}} puzzle the player must mark a box in a window of varying sizes to create the resulting picture. The numbers {{on the top and}} left side of the <b>window</b> <b>guide</b> the correct boxes to mark (for example, if the window is 10×10, and one of the numbers at the top is a [...] "10", that means all ten boxes in the column below it are part of the solution to the puzzle. If the numbers [...] "5" [...] and [...] "4" [...] are at the left of the window, that means that {{all but one of the}} boxes in the row next to them are correct, with five consecutive boxes, followed by four more consecutive boxes, separated by one space). The gameplay is timed, and mistakes cost time. If the player is sure the box is an incorrect box, they can mark it with an X so that they will know not to chisel it (useful for rows or columns marked with a [...] "0"). Finally, there's a [...] "With Hint" [...] option available at the beginning of the puzzle. Choosing this will start a roulette with the numbers labeling the columns and rows. Pressing the A button would stop the top cursor, and pressing it again would stop the left cursor. The game would then show the answers for the resulting combination of a specific row and column. The pictures include a few Mario-related characters, food, animals, and objects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Mass spectrometric {{profiles}} of peptides and proteins obtained by current technologies {{are characterized by}} complex spectra, high dimensionality, and substantial noise. These characteristics generate challenges in discovery of proteins and protein-profiles that distinguish disease states, e. g. cancer patients from healthy individuals. A challenging aspect of biomarker discovery in serum is the interference of abundant proteins with identification of disease-related proteins and peptides. We present data processing methods and computational intelligence that combines support vector machines (SVM) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) for biomarker selection from MALDI-TOF spectra of enriched serum. SVM classifiers were built for various combinations of m/z <b>windows</b> <b>guided</b> by the PSO algorithm. The method identified mass points that achieved high classification accuracy in distinguishing cancer patients from non-cancer controls. Based on their frequency of occurrence in multiple runs, six m/z windows were selected as candidate biomarkers. These biomarkers yielded 100 % sensitivity and 91 % specificity in distinguishing liver cancer patients from healthy individuals in an independent dataset. I...|$|R

We show that the spectrum in the Coulomb phase of the system {{can be described in}} the context of a universal scaling analysis and we provide the nonperturbative determination of the fermion mass anomalous dimension gamma* = 0. 235 (46) at the infrared fixed point. We comment on the agreement with the four-loop perturbative prediction for this quantity and we provide a unified description of all existing lattice results for the spectrum of this system, them being in the Coulomb phase or the asymptotically free phase. Our results corroborate the view that the fixed point we are studying is not associated to a physical singularity along the bare coupling line and estimates of physical observables can be attempted on either side of the fixed point. Finally, we observe the restoration of the U(1) axial symmetry in the two-point functions...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} simple method for {{utilizing}} experimental data {{to improve the}} efficiency of numerical calculations of free energy profiles from molecular dynamics simulations. The method involves umbrella sampling simulations with restraining potentials based on a known approximate estimate of the free energy profile derived solely from experimental data. The use of the experimental data results in optimal restraining potentials, guides the simulation along relevant pathways, and decreases overall computational time. In demonstration of the method, two systems are showcased. First, guided, unguided (regular) umbrella sampling simulations and exhaustive sampling simulations are compared {{to each other in}} the calculation of the free energy profile for the distance between the ends of a pentapeptide. The guided simulation use restraints based on a simulated “experimental” potential of mean force of the end-to-end distance that would be measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (obtained from exhaustive sampling). Statistical analysis shows a dramatic improvement in efficiency for a 5 <b>window</b> <b>guided</b> umbrella sampling over 5 and 17 window unguided umbrella sampling simulations. Moreover, the form of the potential of mean force for the guided simulations evolves, as one approaches convergence, along the same milestones as the extensive simulations, but exponentially faster. Second, the method is further validated by replicating the forced unfolding pathway of the titin I 27 domain using guiding umbrella sampling potentials determined from actual single molecule pulling data. Comparison with unguided umbrella sampling reveals that the use of guided sampling encourages unfolding simulations to converge faster to a forced unfolding pathway that agrees with previous results and produces a more accurate potential of mean force...|$|R

40|$|Fail High Reductions (FHR) is a {{new method}} to guide the search in game trees in a very {{selective}} manner. The main {{idea is that the}} search algorithm should not spend too much effort searching subtrees, which look too good {{to become part of the}} principal variation even at their roots. More precisely, a fail high node is a node v with a search window [ff; fi] at which a static evaluation function e produces a cutoff.
