6000|$|... "Then there's {{the drill}} of {{building}} a chain--making a line of ladders from the roof to the street--and getting from the upper window out over the cornice. Straddling sills is another lesson you'll have to learn, till you can get astride of one, and by holding on <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees,</b> work as handy as on the ground. Standing on sills; working the life-line; climbing crosswise so's to step from one window {{and go to the}} next story on a slant, instead of straight up; using the life net by jumping down, or holding it for others to leap into--and if it so chances that you are ever set to holding one, Amateur, my boy, you'll find it ain't child's play. I've heard it said that when a man weighing one hundred and fifty pounds jumps from the sixth floor of a building, he strikes the net with a force of nigh on to eighteen hundred pounds, and I tell you them as are holding it have to keep scratching." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was a funny}} bath. We {{could not}} sink. One could stretch himself at full length on his back, with his arms on his breast, {{and all of his}} body above a line drawn {{from the corner of his}} jaw past the middle of his side, the middle of his leg and through his ancle bone, would remain out of water. He could lift his head clear out, if he chose. No {{position}} can be retained long; you lose your balance and whirl over, first on your back and then on your face, and so on. You can lie comfortably, on your back, with your head out, and your legs out from your knees down, by steadying yourself with your hands. You can sit, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> drawn up to your chin and your arms clasped around them, but you are bound to turn over presently, because you are top-heavy in that position. You can stand up straight in water that is over your head, and from the middle of your breast upward you will not be wet. But you can not remain so. The water will soon float your feet to the surface. You can not swim on your back and make any progress of any consequence, because your feet stick away above the surface, and there is nothing to propel yourself with but your heels. If you swim on your face, you kick up the water like a stern-wheel boat. You make no headway. A horse is so top-heavy that he can neither swim nor stand up in the Dead Sea. He turns over on his side at once. Some of us bathed for more than an hour, and then came out coated with salt till we shone like icicles. We scrubbed it off with a coarse towel and rode off with a splendid brand-new smell, though it was one which was not any more disagreeable than those we have been for several weeks enjoying. It was the variegated villainy and novelty of it that charmed us. Salt crystals glitter in the sun about the shores of the lake. In places they coat the ground like a brilliant crust of ice.|$|E
50|$|The freedom I {{pleaded for}} twenty years ago was freedom to be a person, with dignity, integrity, nobility, passion, pride that {{constitute}} personhood. Freedom to run, shout, talk loudly and sit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> apart. Freedom to know and love the earth and all that swims, lies, and crawls upon it...most {{of the women in}} the world are still afraid, still hungry, still mute and loaded by religion with all kinds of fetters, masked, muzzled, mutilated and beaten.|$|E

5000|$|This time I shall {{begin at}} once with Stein's pianofortes. Before I had {{seen any of}} his make, Späth's claviers had always been my favourites. But now I much prefer Stein's, for they damp ever {{so much better than}} the Regensburg instruments. ... In {{whatever}} way I touch the keys, the tone is always even. It never jars, it is never stronger or weaker or entirely absent; in a word, it is always even. It is true that he does not sell a pianoforte of this kind for less than three hundred gulden, but the trouble and the labour which Stein puts into the making of it cannot be paid for. His instruments have this special advantage over others that they are made with escape action. Only one maker in a hundred bothers about this. But without an escapement it is impossible to avoid jangling and vibration after the note is struck. When you touch the keys, the hammers fall back again the moment after they have struck the strings, whether you hold down the keys or release them ... He guarantees that the sounding-board will neither break nor split. When he has finished making one for a clavier, he places it in the open air, exposing it to rain, snow, the heat of the sun and all the devils in order that it may crack. Then he inserts wedges and glues them in to make the instrument very strong and firm. He is delighted when it cracks, for he can then be sure that nothing more can happen to it. Indeed he often cuts into it himself and then glues it together again and strengthens it in this way ... The device too which you work <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>knee</b> is better on his than on other instruments. I have only to touch it and it works; and when you shift <b>your</b> <b>knee</b> the slightest bit, you do not hear the least reverberation.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Air (Ollie) - {{similar to}} the skateboarding trick of the same name, or a bunny hop in BMX, it is {{possible}} to jump without utilizing the wake. By pushing down against the water <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> and simultaneously pulling the handle in provides more tension on the rope. Then pulling upwards with your legs, you can make the entire board leave the water. If this is combined with 'jumping' the wake, much greater heights can be achieved.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 2001 the {{subframe}} {{was changed}} from a steel to a blue painted aluminum style. In 2002 the blue painting was stopped and left to a bare aluminum look. Motorcycle.com says that [...] "The gas tank is reasonably thin and allows good forward and backward movement while providing something nicely shaped to hold onto <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees.</b> In fact, the entire ergonomic package on this YZF is well thought out. The handlebars have a nice bend to them and are well-placed for good rider control and legroom. The footpegs are well-made units with a wide platform and sit in a position that keeps them from dragging in ruts without cramping a rider's legs." ...|$|E
50|$|Born in New York City's Greenwich Village, {{he studied}} film {{at the prestigious}} Vassar College. His uncle, the late Howard Brookner, {{directed}} Bloodhounds of Broadway with Madonna and Matt Dillon. Visiting the set of that film was one of Aaron's early life memories and inspiration to become a filmmaker. Among his early work in filmmaking, he assisted the production of Jim Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes and Personal Velocity by Rebecca Miller. Before doing fiction films, {{he worked as a}} director of music videos such as Shake it for the band The Johns, I’m In Love <b>With</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Knees,</b> a collaboration between the singer/songwriter Austin Thomas, legendary guitarist Lenny Kaye of Patti Smith’s band, and acclaimed American novelist Nick Tosches. He was the director and cinematographer on a long feature documentary about Budd Schulberg, the legendary Hollywood writer.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess whether}} patient-reported {{outcomes}} (psychological factors, appraisals of knee function, {{and physical activity}} participation) were associated with satisfaction with knee function after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods: Participants who were aged 18 to 45 years and a minimum 12 months post primary ACL reconstruction completed a questionnaire battery evaluating knee self-efficacy, knee-related quality of life, self-reported function, and physical activity participation. Participants responses to the question "If you were {{to spend the rest}} of <b>your</b> life <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>knee</b> just the way it has been in the last week, would you feel [...] (7 -point ordinal scale; 1 = happy, 7 = unhappy) " were categorized as satisfied, mostly satisfied, or dissatisfied and used as the primary outcome. Ordinal regression was used to examine associations between independent variables and the primary outcome. Results: A total of 177 participants were included at an average of 3 years after primary ACL reconstruction. At follow-up, 44 % reported they would be satisfied, 28 % mostly satisfied, and 28 % dissatisfied with the outcome of ACL reconstruction. There were significant differences in psychological responses and appraisal of knee function between the 3 groups (P =. 001), and significantly more people in the satisfied group had returned to their preinjury activity (58 %) than in the mostly satisfied (28 %) and dissatisfied (26 %) groups (P =. 001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the odds of being satisfied increased by a factor of 3 with higher self-efficacy, greater knee-related quality of life, and returning to the preinjury activity. Conclusions: People who had returned to their preinjury physical activity and who reported higher knee-related self-efficacy and quality of life were more likely to be satisfied with the outcome of ACL reconstruction...|$|R
5000|$|The Sit-Up: [...] "The sit-up event {{measures}} the endurance of the abdominal and hip-flexor muscles. On the command [...] "get set," [...] assume {{the starting position}} by lying on your back <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> bent at a 45- degree angle. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. Another person will hold your ankles with the hands only. No other method of bracing or holding the feet is authorized. The heel is {{the only part of}} your foot that must stay in contact with the ground. Your fingers must be interlocked behind your head and the backs of your hands must touch the ground. Your arms and elbows need not touch the ground. On the command [...] "go," [...] begin raising your upper body forward to, or beyond, the vertical position. The vertical position means that the base of your neck is above the base of your spine. After you have reached or surpassed the vertical position, lower your body until the bottom of your shoulder blades touch the ground. Your head, hands, arms, or elbows do not have to touch the ground. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of sit-ups you have correctly completed. A repetition will not count if you fail to reach the vertical position, fail to keep your fingers interlocked behind your head, arch or bow your back and raise your buttocks off the ground to raise your upper body, or let your knees exceed a 90-degree angle. If a repetition does not count, the scorer will repeat the number of your last correctly performed sit-up. The up position is the only authorized rest position. If you stop and rest in the down (starting) position, the event will be terminated. As long as you make a continuous physical effort to sit up, the event will not be terminated. You may not use your hands or any other means to pull or push yourself up to the up (resting) position or to hold yourself in the rest position. If you do so, your performance in the event will be terminated. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes to perform as many sit-ups as you can.".|$|E
