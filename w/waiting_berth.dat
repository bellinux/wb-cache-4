5000|$|Witter {{lost control}} briefly {{but from the}} help of Captain George [...] "Tim" [...] Herrmann, it was {{restored}} again almost as quickly. Damage control took the situation well in hand, and soon Witter was proceeding under her own power at 10 knots. With the assistance of , , , and the tug , the destroyer escort limped toward Kerama Retto. Morris left the formation at 17:15, and at 18:19, also suffered a suicide crash. Richard P. Leary then also {{dropped out of the}} group to assist Morris while Arikara and Gregory continued on with Witter. The little flotilla entered the anchorage at Kerama Retto at a little after 21:30, and Arikara towed the damaged destroyer escort to a <b>waiting</b> <b>berth.</b> Witter remained at Kerama Retto until late June, undergoing temporary repairs and dodging sporadic air attacks by constantly shifting from anchorage to anchorage — a process which slowed repairs considerably.|$|E

A port container terminal can be considered as a queuing system defined with basic parameters: the ship or container arrival rate and the ship or container service rate, in an observed time unit. Appropriate indices of port container terminal operations are computed {{on the basis of these}} parameters. A model of total ship <b>waiting</b> and <b>berth</b> unoccupancy costs has been established through the introduction of costs as optimization criteria thus facilitating decision-making on optimal capacity of a port container terminal...|$|R
50|$|Cardiff Docks were {{geographically}} {{the usual}} point of export for the coal from the Taff and its tributaries, but the port had become notorious for congestion and delay, with complaints from ships' masters {{that they had}} to stand off {{for days at a time}} <b>waiting</b> for a <b>berth</b> to load at Cardiff. If a railway could be built from Pontypridd to Newport, the coalfield there could use Newport Docks as an alternative.|$|R
40|$|As port {{performance}} is becoming correlative to national competitiveness, {{the issue of}} port performance evaluation has significantly raised. Port performances can simply be indicated by port service levels to the ship (e. g., throughput, <b>waiting</b> for <b>berthing</b> etc.), {{as well as the}} utilization level of equipment and facilities within a certain period. The performances evaluation then {{can be used as a}} tool to develop related policies for improving the port’s performance to be more effective and efficient. However, the evaluation is frequently conducted based on deterministic approach, which hardly captures the nature variations of port parameters. Therefore, this paper presents a stochastic microsimulation model for investigating the impacts of port parameter variations to the port performances. The variations are derived from actual data in order to provide more realistic results. The model is further developed using MATLAB and Simulink based on the queuing theory...|$|R
50|$|The {{volume of}} transported {{materials}} at Cardiff docks resulted in increasing congestion there, {{and it was}} reported that the masters of ships had to stand off for several days <b>waiting</b> for a <b>berth</b> to load their cargo. At the same time, the Cardiff system was considered to be a monopoly, exploited by its owners and charging excessive dues for its use. Moreover the Taff Vale Railway serving the route from Pontypridd to Cardiff Docks had become extremely congested, and mineral trains spent lengthy periods waiting for access to the docks.|$|R

40|$|When {{arriving}} at a busy port, a container ship usually need to queue in anchorage <b>waiting</b> for a <b>berth.</b> If the port establishes a toll scheme, the ship may rationally adjust sailing speed and time to save the cost, otherwise she {{has to pay for}} berthing on time. Consequently container ships' arrival times at the port will be dispersed, and the queuing situation can be decreased. In this article, an optimal step toll scheme by cost equilibrium approach is designed, and all values of equilibrium queuing cost and operating cost under the scheme are obtained. According to equilibrium results in this study, we show container ships that pay the toll to berth a queuing port are those altered their original arrival times at the port before the toll established. In addition, those ships' arrival time adjusting decisions from the nontoll to the optimal step toll cases can be well investigated before tolling a queuing port. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{containerization}} in international trade, has created many problems for ports, i. e. higher requirements on terminals and infrastructure. Many container terminals are reaching their capacity limits and increasingly leading to traffic and port terminals congestion. With this in mind, {{the efficiency of}} container ports and terminals has become more ever important worldwide. It has been ascertained that port of Dar es salaam faces several challenges on efficiency and operational performance at its container terminals. Some of the challenges are; queing of ships at outer aunchorage <b>waiting</b> for <b>berthing,</b> congestions at yard storage area, causing delays on ship and slow yard delivering processes. The solution to increase capacity, either physical expansion or better utilization of resources, are often employed to alleviate the congestion and bottleneck problems that constrain the terminals performance. The situation call for alternative methods in solving the problems that weaken container terminals performance that are needed by management to increase capacity in terminals. This study tried to investigate and attempt to solve {{some of the problems}} that are leading to inefficiency operations at container terminals. The study was conducted on a sample of two terminals, TPA and TICTS terminal, the information was collected through survey with a broad base of qualitative and little quantative information about various characteristics of ports in terms of port infrastracture, maritime services and operational performance as the key factors for productivity and efficiency measurements. Much of the research has been focused on the marine interface or ship operations side of a container terminals,which leaves room for further research on the land-side interface where yard congestions contribute more to poor ship operations and overall terminal performance...|$|R
40|$|Maldives is {{an island}} nation that {{consists}} of around 1190 islands located in the Indian Ocean, southwest of Sri Lanka. The country virtually imports everything it consumes. Male’ Commercial Harbour handles all international sea cargo for the country. The land area assigned for the port is small; and there are frequent bottlenecks and congestion in the port. By using computer simulation techniques, this research investigates the situation of Male’ Commercial Harbour and identifies logistic bottlenecks that exist at the port. Accordingly, a field research was conducted at Male’ Commercial Harbour to collect required data. Both, qualitative and quantitative data were collected using focus group, interviews, on-site observations, and time and motion measures. The simulation models presented in this thesis were carried out with Arena software (Academic Version of Arena 10. 0). The models were used to analyse the vessel turnaround time, berth capacity, yard capacity, container dwell time, queue values, utilisation of ship cranes and other container handling equipment. The results show that berth capacity {{seems to be the}} major bottleneck that creates longer queues and ship delays at Male’ Commercial Harbour. Several scenarios were tested to identify the best scenario regarding ship <b>waiting</b> time at <b>berth.</b> Based on the best scenario, a project was proposed focusing on the development of an extended alongside berth at Male’ Commercial Harbour. A cost benefit analysis was performed to see whether the project is financially feasible...|$|R
40|$|Port {{container}} terminal play {{the leading role}} in transition goods and products between continents. Competition in the port industry increase dramatically, for this reason most of the port management tries to enhance their service rate and productivity to get competitive advantages. For enhancing the productivity rate of port {{container terminal}} management tries to solving queue problem at port terminal in order to decrease ships waiting time and ships turnaround time. This study try to enhance port terminal productivity rate and reduced ships <b>waiting</b> time at <b>berthing</b> area of port container terminal. The data was collected from berthing area of PCT port container terminal located at Southern Malaysia as case study, and based on these data the simulation model was built with using Arena 13. 5 software. After verification and validation model, different scenarios were tested to improvement ships berthing operation at PCT port container terminal. Three kind of scenarios were tested; first category of scenarios focused on the ships waiting time and try to reduced ships waiting time without any reduction on productivity rate, second type of scenarios {{are based on the}} PCT afford and last type of scenarios tried to enhanced port resource and equipments to optimize the productivity rate and ships waiting time. After tested around 80 alternatives on these categories the best productivity rate at each categories were selected and for choosing proper alternatives waiting time was considered.

40|$|The main route {{discussed}} for mitigating CO 2 {{emissions from}} shipping is through increased energy efficiency. Many operational measures that cost-efficiently decrease the energy consumption for shipping companies are available; however, assessments {{indicate that they}} have not been fully implemented. Speed reduction due to improved port efficiency has previously been highlighted as a measure with high potential for increased energy efficiency at a low investment cost. The purpose of this report is to investigate the possibilities to reduce speed at sea when the turnaround time in port is decreased and how this affects the total energy consumption. The research is based on a case study of one short sea bulk shipping company operating in Northern Europe. Quantitative analyses of voyage reports, vessels’ energy consumption curves and Statement of Facts (SoF) for two shipping services were combined with information gained from interviews with onshore managers and operators at the shipping company, ship crew members and managers in ports. The largest sources of unproductive time in port that could be minimized to improve turnaround time are waiting time due to the ports’ hours of operation, as well as <b>waiting</b> time at <b>berth</b> before loading and discharging due to early arrival. Scenarios have been developed from quantitative and qualitative data in the study that result in 1 to 4 hours of decreased time per port call. With a corresponding speed reduction at sea, the potential for improvement in energy efficiency is 1 - 5 %. This is substantially lower than other assessments found in the literature, but is still impressive. The low investment costs could be confirmed qualitatively, but the transaction costs involved for communication and monitoring between stakeholders could contribute to the slow implementation of this measure...|$|R
