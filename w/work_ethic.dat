40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> and value systems {{associated}} with work {{has captured the}} attention of scholars,for the past seven decades. Most discussions about these topics have been concerned with Judeo-Christian contributions and, to a large extent, have been carried out in Western societies. Despite the fact that many other religions and ethnic groups have achieved prosperity and tremendous economic advancement during part of their history, their contributions have been almost totally ignored in management literature and in the discourse on <b>work</b> <b>ethics.</b> The Islamic view of work and ethical considerations have either been misunderstood or not widelv studied in the field of organization studies. Thus, bearing the above in mind, this paper analyzes the concept of <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> from the prophetic tradition. Although admitting that Hadith should be part of understanding the Qur'an, nonetheless, this research focuses primarily on the Hadith by deliberately separating the treatment of the concept of <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> in Hadith literature,from the Qur'an.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to find out the {{relationship}} between role stres, reward, <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> and job satisfaction among civil servants. A total of 700 respondents out of of 1214 civil servants from Kedah, Perlis, and Pulau Pinang were involved in this study. The construct of the concepts and measurements were adapted from past studies. The concept of role stres was measured using an instrument by Rizzo et. a 1 (1970), that consists of role conflict and role ambiguity dimensions. The reward concept was measured using Work Preference Inventory (WPI) by Amabile et. a 1 (1994) which consists of intrinsic and extrinsic reward dimensions. Meanwhile, <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> was measured using Islamic <b>Work</b> <b>Ethics</b> (IWE), created by Ali (1992). Work satisfaction was measured using an instrument adapted from Wright & Cropanzano (1998). Multiple regression analysis was used to study the relationship between role stres, reward, <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> and job satisfaction. The result of this study shows that role stres has negative and significant relationship with job satisfaction. Similar result was found for <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> as the study found that it has a significant and positive relationship with job satisfaction. Based on the findings, it is recommended that the management take the right step to create a job description that can be understood clearly by civil servants so that they can accept and perform their job with a high degree of satisfaction. At the same time, proactives steps need to be taken to plan activities and trainings to increased understanding on <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> and Islamic <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> among civil servants as they have proven to have an impact on job satisfaction and satisfied civil servants will do their job effectively and efficiently...|$|R
