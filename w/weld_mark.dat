Thus, plastic products are widely used in many fields. With the fast development of the molding technology, plastic products are replacing iron in more and more fields. There are many ways of plastic molding. Among them, injection mold has the largest production and highest technology. According to the statistics, more than 35 % thermoplastic resin is processed by injection mold. More and 50 % plastic processing devices are used to injection mold. The current market competition is intense. Consumers have higher requests to the plastic injection products ’ property, weight, size, especially its appearance.

40|$|Remote Ablation Cutting (RAC) {{is a most}} {{promising}} process for cutting thin metal sheets in the automotive, medical and consumer industry. Characteristically for the RAC are high cutting velocities for metal foils as well as material processing of box structures without spatter contamination at the inner surface. Furthermore, the system technology for RAC {{can also be used}} for other processes, like <b>welding</b> and <b>marking.</b> Thereby, the flexibility of a production unit is increased, compared to a conventional cutting system.

Misalignments in the workspace location during loading cause injuries in the workpiece and tool. Further, in modern flexible industrial production, machinery must adapt to changing product demands, both to the simultaneous production of different types of workpieces and to product styles with short life cycles. In this paper, visual data processing concepts on the basis of fuzzy logic are applied to enable an industrial desktop robot to raise its flexibility and address these problems that limit the production rate of small industries. Specifically, a desktop robot performing dispensing tasks is equipped with a CCD camera. Visual information is used to autonomously change previously off-line stored robot programs for known workpieces or to call worker’s attention for unknown/misclassified workpieces. A fuzzy inference classifier based on a fuzzy grammar, is used to describe/identify workpieces. Fuzzy rules are automatically generated from features extracted from the workpiece under analysis. Regarding the evaluation of the system performance, different types of workpieces were tested and a good rate performance, higher than 90 %, was achieved. The obtained results illustrate both the flexibility and robustness of the proposed solution as well as its capabilities for good classification of workpieces.

40|$|High {{carbon steels}} are {{commonly}} used in modern mechanical industry due to their good mechanical properties and to their relatively low cost. Unfortunately, when dealing with welding processes, these materials must be set aside because of their very high crack susceptibility and more refined and expensive steels {{must be taken into}} consideration, such as HSLA, DP and TRIP ones, thanks to their lower carbon equivalent and similar, or even better, mechanical properties. In micro-scale components industry the use of high carbon steels is also very common, in particular in precision mechanics, watch and MEMS industry. Considering the very low thicknesses typical of these components and the intrinsic welding difficulty related to the material, several studies stressed on the possibility to exploit nanosecond pulsed lasers in welding this kind of steels. These sources, taking advantage from the short duration of the pulse and from a repetition rate as high as I MHz, allow a very accurate control of the heat input delivered to the material and pave new ways in micro-welding of medium and high carbon steels. The present paper deals with the exploitation of a 20 W nanosecond pulsed laser source in welding low thickness C 70 (AISI 1070) plain carbon steel. The process is studied by evaluating the influence of the main parameters on its feasibility. The activity pointed out that, by properly selecting the main parameters, it is possible to achieve sound and crack-free weld beads with a maximum penetration as high as 200 μm and a very small heat affected zone. The main interesting point concerning this specific welding process is related to the fact that, by simply selecting the proper process parameters, it is possible to achieve high productivity working cycles involving laser cutting, <b>welding</b> and <b>marking</b> on the same machine and exploiting the same workpiece positioning...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years diode lasers have evolved into tools for {{industrial}} manufacturing for instance for soldering, plastics welding, transformation hardening and heat-conduction welding. The high efficiency, compactness and in particular the high modularity makes them superior to conventional CO 2 - or Nd:YAG-lasers for the applications mentioned above. In the low-power regime fiber-coupled diode lasers are dominating. In these systems a variety of different beam transformation techniques are common for the forming of the line-shaped beam of a diode-laser bar into a spot which can be efficiently coupled into an optical fiber of circular cross section. At higher output powers diode laser stacks are commonly used, supplied with micro-optical cylinder lenses for collimation and shaping of the individual beams. A major limitation of presently available high-power diode lasers is the limited beam quality, which still is more than an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional lasers. A broad spectrum of activities is necessary and currently performed in order to increase the brightness: - increase of power and beam quality of the diode laser bar, - increased quality of micro-optics and packaging, - wavelength and polarization coupling. By means of these techniques output-power as well as beam quality have already been considerably increased in {{the past few}} years. Further improvements will be achieved in the future. With the new diode lasers the range of applications in industrial manufacturing can be increased considerably. Diode lasers are currently used in more mature applications such as transformation hardening, soldering and plastics welding but due to the increased beam qualities are now able to weld and cut metals as well.

Laser percussion drilling (drilling by multiple shots) is for instance used in the process of gas turbine manufacturing, {{because of the fact that}} the components to be drilled are made of superalloys which are very hard to machine by conventional techniques. To fix ideas, the typical hole diameter, hole depth and pulse length are 0. 5 : 1. 0 mm, 3 : 10 mm and 1. 0 ms, respectively. Laser percussion drilling is favoured over alternative drilling processes like spark erosion drilling and laser trepanning drilling because it is by far the fastest process. However, it suffers of problems with the quality of the hole. The main quality aspects are: - Tapering (Decrease of hole diameter with depth) - Recast layer (Re-solidified material at wall of hole) - Bellow shape (Local increase of hole diameter) The laser drilling process depends on the material properties and on the laser beam characteristics: wavelength and intensity as a function of space and time.

The present work reports the effect of heat input, cooling rate, parent plate deformation and restraining conditions on the formation and morphology of delta ferrite in welds on AISI 318 L and 321 steels. The experiments were carried out on commercially produced plates in the following conditions: (i) as received condition (ii) further deformed by cold rolling. (iii) further deformed by hot rolling. The effect of heat input and cooling rates were examined using bead-onplate Submerged Arc welds on the same parent plate material. The parent plate condition was assessed using bead-on-plate metal Inert Gas (MIG) and Subm rged Arc butt welds. The results suggest that 1. The weld metal solidification proceeds epitaxially from the existing unmelted base metal. The <b>weld</b> exhibited surface <b>marking</b> i. e. deformation bands or close packed plane, in the austenite matrix, but not passing through delta ferrite phase. 2. The solidification substructure, the ferrite content, and morphology are influenced by tile (i) thermal stress induced during welding, (ii) parent plate chemical composition, (iii) the parent plate microstructural and deformation characteristics i. e. strain energy. 3. Rapidly cooled welds have lower ferrite content than welds produced with slower cooling rates. The randomly distributed elongeed ferrite with some lath type ferrite morphology was predominantly attributed with the welds produced with high cooling rates. 4. The ferrite is the first solidified phase to form and austenite is formed from the liquid rather than by solid phase transformation of primary ferrite to austenite. 5. The ferrite formation is a diffusion controlled phase transformation, the degree of its dendrites development depends upon the welding parameters i. e. heat input, cooling rates. 8.

The first part of the work involved a literature review of the process and factors affecting the laser forming process. It became clear from the literature overview that laser forming of sheet material thicker than 1 mm is complex in nature. The variables that can influence the process are complicated and their interaction with each other is not easily controlled. The main parameters that were thus controlled in this study are as follows: • Laser power (P) • Laser head travel speed (v) • Laser beam size (mm) The chapters that follow the literature review, deals with the laser forming process of dual phase steel and the production of fatigue specimens using various laser parameters. It was found that the following laser parameters resulted in specimens with approximately the same radius of curvature: Laser power KW Beam diameter mm Interval spacing % Overlap Scanning velocity m/min Line Energy J/m 5 20 10 50 2, 5 2000 3, 1 14 10, 5 25 2 1550 1, 5 7, 5 7, 5 0 1, 2 1250 From the results obtained from fatigue testing specimens produced with the above settings, it is clear that the laser forming process has the potential to be employed as a production stage in the manufacture of wheel centre discs while maintaining adequate fatigue strength. Large beam diameters which cause heat penetration through the thickness of the specimen and hence microstructure breakdown should be avoided, since it was shown that these specimens exhibited impaired mechanical properties than those produced with a smaller laser beam diameter. The microstructural changes observed during the forming process needs to be considered since the mechanical properties of the material changes with a change in microstructure. A dramatic change in microstructure was observed; therefore it is of crucial importance that microstructural evaluation plays an important part in deciding optimum laser parameters for the forming process of ferrous alloys. During residual stress analysis, trends were observed between measurements taken at the same location of the samples; regardless whether measurements were taken on the laser irradiated side or the reverse side of the specimen. The only difference was the magnitude of the relieved residual stress. In most cases the obtained relieved residual stress was much smaller in magnitude than that of the original plate (in the bulk of the material). The surface indicated a slight tensile residual stress for most samples evaluated. A good correlation in distribution profile was obtained between microhardness and relieved residual stress distribution at the ‘middle of sample’ location. This indicates that an increase in hardness indicates an increase in residual stress magnitude for the laser formed specimens. In conclusion, this research has proved that it is possible to deform metal plate of a 3, 5 mm thickness with a CO 2 laser system. The research also established the effect of process parameters on the final product’s shape/bend angle and characterised the effect of the laser forming process on the material’s mechanical properties and structural integrity...|$|R

Spectacles) Over the last 15 years as a lecturer I have been increasingly interested in the integration of emerging technologies for the creative industries, overseeing the installation of laser systems for <b>welding,</b> cutting and <b>marking</b> for jewellery and applied art courses. In order to further understand the technology that artists increasingly look for to use as a daily tool, I recently completed the research project Laser processing on titanium for contemporary jewellery: a bridge between cultures at The University of Manchester in the School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering. The difficulty in understanding between my own art background and their engineering culture, however, created in the project a new dimension. The relatively straightforward task of finding applications of laser processing for contemporary jewellery also became a mission to improve the communication between art, science and engineering through the objects being made. The Ocular series 1 - 6 created during the research, was grounded in the aesthetic and function of the measuring instruments used in optometry. These had always been an intriguing source of interest to me, perhaps because of my lifelong condition of hyperopia and astigmatism. Manual instrumentation, trial lenses and correcting glasses provided an important design influence. The objects all include a lens in the centre, inviting the viewer to peer through, to examine in detail, to inspect further - actions associated with scientific observation and also with improving sight, clarifying vision, aiding discovery, altering perception or simply appealing to the wonder of magnification. The journey that I encountered during my research included microscopic views of titanium oxidation and opened new levels of material understanding thanks to the help of engineers and scientists working around me. Eyesight correction and the essential use of both eyes needed for binocular vision became metaphors for the research. The Ocular series were modelled on the idea of a monocle that might be made to individual prescriptions, suggesting that correcting vision would help see the ‘bigger picture’, assuage ‘clouded’ or ‘tunnel vision’. For this exhibition it is my intention to further develop the concept of using sight as a bridging mechanism between the cultures of science and art. Jewellery is the ideal art form with which to communicate and carry this notion forward and I hope to work with a scientist and/or an engineer to carry it out. The object/s made will also engage with issues surrounding the public understanding of both art and science, exposing aspects of engineering research and of art practice that aim to change persistent preconceptions...|$|R
40|$|Artists {{are natural}} researchers. We are {{constantly}} {{in the process}} of investigation and enquiry using a multitude of media. We acquire an extraordinary understanding of materials thanks to systematic experimentation with them leaning beyond boundaries and uncovering truths at every stage. Jewellery artists are responsible for the direct implementation of this knowledge, engaging in their practice all manner of organic and inorganic materials, listening to them and constructing with them three-dimensional artefacts with awesome results. It is the same unbelievable logic that enables engineers to build impossible distances into the sky whilst allowing concrete to move. How different are we to scientists or engineers? Over the last two years I have had the privilege to work with artist Kalsang Shoba in the Laser Processing Research Centre at the The University of Manchester, School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering. Our main objective has been to explore creative ways of using lasers, understanding something about the way they work and report back to the world of art practice and contemporary jewellery. This publication offers a glimpse into that journey and accompanies the exhibition at The Museum of Manchester. It aims to unfold the multiplicity of an emergent, hybrid practice that has demanded a new language mutually understood by the cultures of art and design and of engineering and science. Perhaps what is unusual about this exhibition is the angle of insight it gives the viewer about life in an engineering research laboratory. Whilst engineers are looking for new methods of improved manufacturer for clients such as Rolls Royce and the nuclear industry, scientists seek to understand the phenomena involved, largely unaware that an artist is working amongst them, observing their behaviour and their language but, more importantly, seeing with fascination the experiments, the visual and factual material emerging from their research. From centres like this one, the jewellery and silversmithing industries have been fed from laser <b>welding,</b> cutting and <b>marking,</b> rapid protyping, laser forming, and now direct manufacturing of three dimensional form by laser sintering of metal powders. My own research pivots around the use of laser on titanium. Heat from the applied laser beam causes an oxide layer to grow on the surface of metal, which, depending on the thickness, appear as different colours to the eye. The colour can be controlled by using different laser parameters such as the speed, power and pulse density of the beam. To render the technology more invisible and to narrow the distance between it and the more intuitive aspects of my work, drawings are sometimes converted to bitmaps for a less calculated, more 'painterly aesthetic. What started as an investigation into laser processing for the creative industries has become more a mission to charter this relatively unknown territory, crystallising the astounding visual and anecdotal in uences encountered on the way, all of them treasured gems that I hope will offer a positive contribution to the current art/science debate. For this reason I have also prof led the work of some engineers and scientists working in the LPRC. Dr Amin Abolvand, an applied physicist, observes the formation of metallic nanoparticles embedded in various media. Mechanical engineer Dr Andrew Pinkerton creates three-dimensional parts by fusing metal powders with a laser beam, offering a glimpse into the development of direct manufacturing. The influence of Dr Marc Schmidt and Dr Philip Crouse is less clear but perhaps more appropriately, exists below the visible surface. After renegotiating historical preconceptions on both sides, a curious state of equilibrium has settled itself quite naturally. It was clear that I had much to learn from this aerospatial environment, particularly with my lifelong curiosity in titanium, but how to persuade this deeply formuleic culture that they stand to gain as much from art and design one? How different is a drawing from a formula, a sketchbook from a lab book? Is there a need for an equation to explain the theory of creativity? This journey does not set out to establish superiority of one expression over another, but calls for collaboration from both angles in order that our vision is more complete. The work presented here is a set of dual nationality passports aiming {{to attract the attention of}} both disciplines or better still, to encourage a new one to rise. I am indebited to Dr Andrew Gale and Professor Lin Li for their invaluable support and continued interest in this project. Perhaps we can already see a spot of green light ahead on the substrate of a new culture [...] ...|$|R
