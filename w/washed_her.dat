5|$|On July 10—when {{the storm}} was {{approaching}} or at its peak intensity with winds of —the Bowditch encountered severe hurricane conditions which destroyed both of her masts and <b>washed</b> <b>her</b> entire crew overboard. Her captain was able to climb back aboard, where he survived for over a week with no food or water until he was rescued by a schooner. The Echo and Creole both sustained significant damage, and the crew and captain of the latter ship had to be rescued after she began taking on water. The extent of {{the damage to the}} three ships served as the basis for evaluating the storm's intensity in Partagás's paper. The hurricane ultimately passed between Bermuda and the United States before dissipating after July 12.|$|E
25|$|Ovid's Metamorphoses {{mentions}} that just before discovering Callisto's pregnancy, Diana <b>washed</b> <b>her</b> feet {{and then she}} and her attendants disrobed. Walter Liedtke {{points out that the}} nymph standing somewhat apart from the group, with her hands clenched in front of her abdomen, perhaps in contrast with the nymph showing devotion and fidelity by washing feet, may be Callisto. This scene would then illustrate part of that myth narrative, Liedtke asserts, although Wheelock states that the episode seems unrelated to the mood of the painting.|$|E
25|$|One {{version has}} him {{throwing}} one purse for three consecutive nights. Another has him throwing the purses {{over a period}} of three years, each time the night before one of the daughters comes of age. Invariably, the third time the father lies in wait, trying to discover the identity of their benefactor. In one version the father confronts the saint, only to have Nicholas say it is not him he should thank, but God alone. In another version, Nicholas learns of the poor man's plan and drops the third bag down the chimney instead; a variant holds that the daughter had <b>washed</b> <b>her</b> stockings that evening and hung them over the embers to dry, and that the bag of gold fell into the stocking.|$|E

25|$|Shoshone {{was then}} taken further downriver, making the run over Celilo Falls, itself always {{reckoned}} a hazardous stretch, on June 28, 1870. Once below Celilo, she ran as a cattle boat between the upper Cascades and The Dalles. Later {{she was taken}} over the Cascades {{and down to the}} Willamette River, where she was sold to the Willamette River Transportation Company. The W.R.T. Co. then hauled Shoshone up around Willamette Falls, and ran her on the upper Willamette and also on the Yamhill River. There, perhaps surprisingly for a boat that had run Hells Canyon, she struck a rock near Salem, Oregon in the fall of 1874 and sank. Efforts to raise her failed, although her machinery was salvaged, and later installed in Champion. In January 1875, rising water lifted her free, and <b>washed</b> <b>her</b> down river to Lincoln. There a farmer salvaged her cabins, hauled them ashore, and turned them into a chicken coops.|$|E
500|$|Her morning ablutions {{included}} washing herself unassisted with a flannel {{rather than}} taking a shower ("an odd invention"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She <b>washed</b> <b>her</b> own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed daube (braised beef) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a Dunhill cigarette (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank {{a small amount of}} Port wine. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange.|$|E
500|$|A variant {{form of the}} legend, and {{the only}} one in which the pig-faced woman is not {{connected}} with a great fortune, told of a Christian man who converted to Judaism. In this version, the first child born to him after his conversion was a girl with the face of a pig. Some years later, the father realised that his daughter's appearance was a divine punishment, and re-converted to Christianity along with his pig-faced daughter. At the moment of the daughter's baptism, the holy water <b>washed</b> <b>her</b> pig-like features away, revealing a normal human face. The story was alleged to be represented by a sculpture in [...] "one of the grand old cathedrals of Belgium", but no evidence for such a sculpture has been found.|$|E

2500|$|With no {{survivors}} and no {{witnesses to the}} actual sinking, what happened on Sophia to drive her off the reef {{is a matter of}} reconstruction from the available evidence and conjecture. [...] Based on the evidence it appears that the storm, blowing in from the north, raised water levels on the reef much higher than previously, causing the vessel to become buoyant again, but only partially so. [...] The bow of the vessel remained on the reef, and the force of the wind and waves then spun the vessel almost completely around and <b>washed</b> <b>her</b> off the reef. [...] Dragging across the rock ripped out the ship's bottom, so when she reached deeper water near the navigation buoy, she sank. [...] This process, based on the evidence, seems to have taken about an hour.|$|E
