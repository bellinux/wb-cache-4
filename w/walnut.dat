50|$|The {{first stage}} is {{to pick the}} <b>walnuts</b> whilst they are still green and before the shells have set. Most recipes say that late June is about {{the best time to}} pick them. The soft <b>walnuts</b> are then soaked in brine (salt water) for at least ten days. The <b>walnuts</b> are then drained and left to dry in the air. Soaking the <b>walnuts</b> in brine causes a {{chemical}} reaction to take place and the <b>walnuts</b> turn dark brown to black in colour when exposed to sunlight. The now-black <b>walnuts</b> are then placed into jars and a pickling solution poured over them. This can vary from a straightforward pickling vinegar to a solution containing spices and sugar. The <b>walnuts</b> are sealed and then left in the jars for anywhere between five days and eight weeks depending on which recipe is followed.|$|R

Conditional heterogeneity is explored, assuming two possible sources: how often <b>walnuts</b> are consumed and how driven by health and nutrition attitudes or convenience the consumer is.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore {{chemical}} and sensory stability of <b>walnuts</b> during their storage. We determined fatty acids composition, as well as chemical indicators of lipid oxidative stability (peroxide and thiobarbituric values and conjugated dienes) during accelerated storage of <b>walnuts.</b> Besides this, a thorough descriptive analysis was performed. The accelerated storage of <b>walnuts</b> was shown to cause the significant changes in sensory characteristics of <b>walnuts,</b> as well as the significant increase of peroxide and thiobarbituric values and contents of conjugated dienes...|$|R

Temperatures above 30 C, and humidities above 70 percent can lead to rapid and high spoilage losses. Above 75 percent humidity threshold, fungal molds that release dangerous aflatoxin can form.|$|R
