5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, a {{year after}} independence, slaves made up 29% of the {{population}} of Brazil, a figure which fell throughout the lifetime of the Empire: from 24% in 1854, to 15.2% in 1872, and finally to less than 5% in 1887—the year before slavery was completely abolished. Slaves were mostly adult males from southwestern Africa. Slaves brought to Brazil differed ethnically, religiously and linguistically, each identifying primarily <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her own nation of origin, rather than by a shared African ethnicity. Some of the slaves brought to the Americas had been captured while fighting intertribal wars in Africa and had then been sold to slave dealers.|$|E
5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany {{the same degree of}} guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E

25|$|A topspinner {{is a type}} of {{delivery}} bowled by a cricketer bowling either wrist spin or finger spin. In either case, the bowler imparts the ball with top spin by twisting it <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her fingers prior to delivery. In both cases, the topspinner is the halfway house between the stock delivery and the wrong'un - in the wrist spinner's case his googly, and in the finger spinner's case his doosra.|$|E
25|$|A variant on {{the fast}} bowler's action is the sling (sometimes {{referred}} to as the slingshot or javelin), where the bowler begins his delivery <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her arm fully extended behind their back. The slinging action generates extra speed, but sacrifices control. The most famous exponent of the slinging action was Jeff Thomson, who bowled at extraordinary pace off a short run up. Other international examples include Fidel Edwards, Shaun Tait, Lasith Malinga and Mitchell Johnson.|$|E

25|$|The complex {{forms that}} defined Metzinger's {{paintings}} of the period serve to suggest the underlying imagery (e.g., a nude, a horse, a dancer, a café-concert), rather than define the imagery; arousing the viewer's own creative intuition to decipher the 'total image.' This meant too, inversely, that the creative intuition of the artist would be aroused. No longer did the artist have to define or reproduce, painstakingly, {{the subject matter of}} a painting. The artist became to a large extent free, libre, to place lines, shapes, forms and colors onto the canvas in accord <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her own creative intuition.|$|E

Caresse grew up amid the social constraints imposed by her upper-class family in New York. She had a doomed and troublesome romanticism with Harry Crosby.
