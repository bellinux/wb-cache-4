5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, there were two {{accidents}} (one serious) caused by what {{is believed to be}} loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster. The most serious accident was when a man got struck with an object and had to get his eye removed due to the amount of damage. On the same day that the man got hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the salvage {{operation}} {{were approved}} by the Irish Coast Guard, and the salvage operation began on 1 September, with work to remove loose ropes and secure the fuel containers; the salvage operation was expected to take up to 3 weeks. Astrid was recovered by the sheerleg GPS Atlas on 9 September 2013 by Atlantic Towage and Marine, and was transported on a barge to Kinsale for assessment and an investigation of <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> accident. The insurers of the ship deemed the cost of restoring Astrid to be too high due to the damage caused while she was partially submerged (an economic write-off); as such she was scrapped and taken to Cork Harbour to be broken up. The scrapping process was completed by April 2014.|$|E

5|$|Sources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the {{historian}} David Bates, this probably means that little happened of note, and that because William {{was on the}} continent, {{there was nothing for}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to record. In 1082 William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope. Orderic also related that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo on an invasion of southern Italy. This would have been considered tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. More difficulties struck in 1083, when William's eldest son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Matilda, William's wife, on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E

The CBO reported that the deficit expansion was mainly due to the economic downturn rather than policy choices. Revenue fell while social safety net spending increased for programs such as unemployment compensation and food stamps, as more families qualified for benefits. From 2008 to 2009, the large deficit increase was also driven by spending on stimulus and bailout programs.|$|E

25|$|Cabell {{conducted}} an investigation {{in which he}} and his associates interviewed a range of civilians (including US Consul Lawton) and military personnel {{in an attempt to}} determine <b>what</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> border violence that 27 August.

Cabell informed his commanding officer that an unnamed US customs inspector had been found guilty of “improper conduct” and removed from duty because of his harsh treatment of Mexicans. Cabell's report expressed dismay at the “frequent cases of insolence and overbearing conduct” among US customs inspectors. The investigation laid the blame, albeit begrudgingly, for the outbreak of violence in Ambos Nogales on resentment among nogalenses over the routine mistreatment of Mexican border crossers.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October, clashes {{erupted in}} eastern Gaza between Hamas {{security}} forces {{and members of the}} powerful Heles clan (Fatah-affiliated), leaving up to two dead on both sides.

Another gun battle on October 20 killed one member of the clan and a 13-year-old boy.
