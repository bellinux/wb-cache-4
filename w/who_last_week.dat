Sinclair was accused of bribing United States Secretary of the Interior Albert B.

Littleton managed to get Sinclair exonerated from the serious criminal conspiracy charges related to bribing Secretary Fall, although Fall was later convicted of accepting the bribe. Sinclair only served 9 months in prison on contempt of Congress and jury tampering charges relating to Sinclair's hiring of detectives to follow jurors. Time magazine hailed Littleton as [...] "the man <b>who</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> extricated Harry Ford Sinclair from the oil scandal" [...] and likened his legal maneuvers to Houdini.

Top seed Caroline Wozniacki sensationally crashed out of the French Open 1-6, 3-6 {{at the hands of}} Daniela Hantuchová on Friday afternoon. The world no. 1 was sent packing by her Slovakian opponent who barely put a foot wrong during the entire match, hitting 26 winners to 8 of the Dane. In defeating Wozniacki, the 28-year-old has equalled her best result here. She now faces 2009 French Open winner Svetlana Kuznetsova, who saw off up-and-coming Canadian teenager Rebecca Marino 6-0, 6-4 in 49 minutes earlier in the day. Marion Bartoli, <b>who</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> reached her first clay court final in Strasbourg before being forced to retire injured, fought back from a set down to scoop a 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory over dark-horse Julia Görges but was made to work for it. Meanwhile, over on Court 7, no. 14 seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova also came back from a set down to defeat Spanish qualifier Nuria Llagostera Vives 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 and set up a round of 16 clash with fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva, after the no. 3 seed sealed a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Anastasia Rodionova.

40|$|This posting {{about the}} {{politics}} of pop concerts in Shanghai is mostly about an American duo (Jan and Dean), whose hits included “Surf City,” and the hard-to-categorize Icelandic songstress Bjork, <b>who</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> made headlines anddrew the ire of the Chinese state by saying the words “Tibet, Tibet” after performing a song called “Declare Independence” (on the heels of which, there wasapparent tinkering with Harry Connick Jr. ’s song list at a recent performance). It still seemed right, though, to give the piece a title adapted from a song by a famous British band. Why? Because the Rolling Stones, like Bjork and Jan and Dean back in 1986, made headlines when they played Shanghai. And because the band’s lead singer, Mick Jagger, made the funniest statement I’ve ever come across regarding the often singularly unfunny topic of censorship in the PRC. When told before the group’s 2006 concert that the authorities forbid them from playing “Brown Sugar” and several other sexually suggestive songs, at a concert that Jagger knew would probably be attended largely by Western men, accompanied by either Western of Chinese women, his comment (made with his famous tongue firmly in cheek) was: “I’m pleased that the Ministry of Culture is protecting the morals of the expat bankers and their girlfriends {{that are going to be}} coming. ...|$|E
40|$|The Liberal Party now has {{a chance}} to modernise, writes JUDITH BRETT JOHN HOWARD’s {{greatest}} legacy will be the size of his defeat. This will set in train consequences which will change the Liberal Party and the country. The Liberal Party is now out of power everywhere, and it will have to rebuild. Without Howard’s social conservatism sitting like a capstone on the party, it can modernise, to open out to a much wider range of social and cultural ideas and to bring in a new generation of politicians. The country can move forward on the republic and reconciliation, the two items that have been on hold since Paul Keating’s defeat. The Liberal Party in government has always been focused on the leader, and so after a long period of government under a successful leader it is inevitably weakened - as it was after Menzies’ retirement and Fraser’s defeat. It takes time for the next election-winning leader to emerge. We now know it will not be the risk averse Peter Costello. But our system of government depends on two viable parties of government, so the Liberal Party will revive. The size of the defeat will give confidence to the forces for change in the party. Second, the Senate has been saved. Neither the government nor the opposition will control the Senate. Howard’s deal with Meg Lees to push through the GST after the 1998 election {{was the beginning of the}} end of the Democrats. They lost half their number in 2004, and now the rest are gone. The Democrats are largely responsible for the revival of the Senate since the early 1980 s, restoring its function as a house of review in which legislation can be scrutinised and committees can investigate the actions of the executive. In 2004 the government won control of the Senate for the first time since 1983. Howard used this to push through the Work Choices legislation. I believe that this legislation is the main (though not the only) reason for the Coalition’s defeat. If Howard had won control of the Senate in 1996 much of what he introduced in 2005 would have been introduced in the first term. He would not have had to negotiate with the Democrats, to introduce the no-disadvantage test, nor soften the changes to the unfair dismissal laws. He could well have been a one-term government. On Saturday Australians voted to deny the government control of the Senate, because they have seen what happens when the government controls both houses. Howard’s second legacy is to the Australian people’s understanding of the importance of the Senate. Third, we now know that many Australians think about more than their hip pockets. A government has been defeated when the economy is going well. I always thought this was possible. (Chifley lost the 1949 election despite the economy being about as good as could be expected in those early postwar years.) But almost no one else did: not the Liberal Party who could not believe that it would be thrown out in a time of near full employment; and certainly not the press gallery, who spent most of the year in denial about what the polls were telling them. By campaigning so narrowly on his record of economic management, and losing so decisively, Howard’s third legacy is to remind us that politics has always been about more than the economy. Fourth, climate change is now at the centre of the government agenda. After Work Choices, climate change is the reason Howard lost. His is probably the first incumbent government in the world to have been defeated in part because of denial on climate change. To be sure he made a late change of direction early in the year, and started to introduce piecemeal measures, but he has cost Australia 10 years of wasted opportunity to prepare ourselves for a very difficult future, and he has cost us a great deal of our international reputation through his recalcitrance on Kyoto. High and Dry, by the Liberal Party insider Guy Pearse, shows just how much Howard was personally responsible for the government’s position on climate change. Many Liberals have been waiting for him to go so the party can develop a more responsible policy. Expect a flood of people joining the former NSW Liberal leader, Peter Debnam, <b>who</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> criticised Howard’s position on Kyoto and dismissed his support for clean coal and nuclear energy. And expect to find out what Malcolm Turnbull really thinks. • Judith Brett teaches politics at La Trobe University.
