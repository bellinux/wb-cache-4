40|$|Abstract. For the {{net shape}} forming of {{composite}} products with structure of SB/CF-EP (steel backing/carbon fabric reinforced epoxy) lining, the demolding is difficult. Aiming to net shape forming of transmission screw nuts with structure of SB/CF-EP, a new solution was proposed {{in which the}} high-strength casting wax was used as the release agent. A basic demolding experiment was designed and comparative demolding experiments were conducted for three different conditions: wax and grease as release agents and no agent. The influences of different agents and agent thickness on demolding force, product sizes and surface quality were studied. In comparison with grease and no release agent the demolding force for wax was reduced by 91. 6 % and 98. 0 % respectively. The product shrink could be compensated by controlling the wax thickness. By using <b>wax</b> <b>release</b> <b>agent,</b> the fabrication of transmission screw nuts with SB/CF-EP lining was successfully completed...|$|E
5000|$|Ultrasonic {{cleaning}} uses cavitation bubbles {{induced by}} high frequency pressure (sound) waves to agitate a liquid. The agitation produces high forces on contaminants adhering to substrates like metals, plastics, glass, rubber, and ceramics. This action also penetrates blind holes, cracks, and recesses. The {{intention is to}} thoroughly remove all traces of contamination tightly adhering or embedded onto solid surfaces. Water or solvents can be used, {{depending on the type}} of contamination and the workpiece. Contaminants can include dust, dirt, oil, pigments, rust, grease, algae, fungus, bacteria, lime scale, polishing compounds, flux agents, fingerprints, soot <b>wax</b> and mold <b>release</b> <b>agents,</b> biological soil like blood, and so on. Ultrasonic cleaning can be used for a wide range of workpiece shapes, sizes and materials, and may not require the part to be disassembled prior to cleaning.|$|R

50|$|Like amphetamines, cathinone, and ephedrine, cathine {{acts as a}} {{norepinephrine}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (NRA). It also acts as a dopamine <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (DRA) to {{a lesser}} extent.|$|R
30|$|To {{reduce the}} effort in terms of bonding {{pre-treatment}} the applied adhesives {{need to be more}} contamination tolerant or the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer has to be as low as possible to achieve a clean surface. Due to the fact, that there are no adhesives, which show the relevant tolerance for the typical <b>release</b> <b>agents,</b> the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer has to be lowered to increase the production efficiency. Unfortunately, the correlation between the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer and the CFRP-part production process has not yet been investigated in literature.|$|R
50|$|No {{selective}} DRAs {{are currently}} known.

50|$|Preparing the mandrel - The beadmaker starts by dipping a mandrel, or wire (stainless steel welding wire, {{cut into}} lengths) into a <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> <b>Release</b> <b>agents</b> are either clay based or man made, such as boron nitride.|$|R
30|$|To {{guarantee}} the demolding of the cured parts, <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> are used. Within {{the aerospace industry}} (where thermoset matrix systems are widely used), external <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> are applied to coat the mold prior to the curing process [7]. After the crosslinking reaction of the resin-system and the demolding of the parts, <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> residues are found on the parts surface as several times shown (e.g. [6 – 9]). This indicates a <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer during {{the production of the}} parts. These <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> residues lower the adhesion of the parts and therefore their initial bondability [10]. Within industrial applications, the challenge of the relatively bad initial bondability is solved by an additional process step—the bonding pre-treatment. Even if there are different approaches, like a laser [8] or plasma [9] application, which allow a sufficient and potentially automated bonding pre-treatment, it is still an additional process step which lowers the production efficiency.|$|R

30|$|Within this equation, all {{parameters}} which {{increase the}} <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer with an enlarged value (time and pressure) are {{inserted in the}} numerator, while the parameters which decrease the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer with higher value are inserted in the denominator.|$|R
30|$|Besides the {{characteristics}} of the raw materials (e.g. <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> formulation, resin formulation or fillers), the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer is depending on the processing during the crosslinking reaction of the resin. This dependency is subsequently discussed to identify the different influences.|$|R
50|$|In the {{concrete}} construction industry, form <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> prevent the adhesion of freshly placed concrete to the forming surface, usually plywood, overlaid plywood, steel or aluminum. In this application, {{there are two}} types of <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> available: barrier and reactive.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Release</b> <b>agents</b> {{provide the}} {{critical}} barrier between a molding {{surface and the}} substrate, facilitating separation of the cured part from the mold. Without such a barrier in place the substrate would become fused to the mold surface, resulting in difficult clean-up and dramatic loss in production efficiency. Even when a <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> is used, factors such as irregular applications or improper <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> choice may have a dramatic effect on the quality and consistency of the finished product.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{the vapor}} {{pressure}} of the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> could also be relevant, if silicone oils are parts of the applied <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> At higher temperatures, those silicone oils have a relatively low vapor pressure [32], which could be critical for the CFRP-processing and would may be indicate a negative effect of an applied vacuum on the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer. Nevertheless, even if the vapor pressure is reached during the production cycle, the volatile components of the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> are mainly sucked outside of the laminate by the applied vacuum system within the experimental set-up (e.g. by the application of vacuum bags [27, 33]), proven by the reduction of voids after the application of an higher vacuum [13].|$|R
50|$|A serotonin-norepinephrine-{{dopamine}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (SNDRA), {{also known}} as a triple <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (TRA), is a type of drug which induces the release of serotonin, norepinephrine/epinephrine, and dopamine in the brain and body.

5000|$|A {{serotonin}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (SRA) {{is a type}} of {{drug that}} induces the release of serotonin into the neuronal synaptic cleft.

30|$|Applying the NDT {{technologies}} Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE) and Aerosol-Wetting-Test (AWT) {{was achieved}} using the CFRP samples without further preparation before characterising their surfaces. Comparing the OSEE signal intensity with {{the concentration of}} silicon atoms as detected by XPS, the experimental data shown in Figure  10 clearly reveal that the signals obtained in OSEE studies {{are sensitive to the}} presence of even the thinnest layers of <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> investigated. Additionally, results from evaluating sizes of water droplets obtained from performing the AWT for CFRP surfaces free from <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> and contaminated with distinct amounts of <b>release</b> <b>agent,</b> respectively, are shown in Figure  10. For all the samples the same amount of water was applied, and the lateral dimensions and areas of imaged water drops show a size distribution. Basically, the portion of wider drops is observed to be significantly higher for the CFRP surface free from <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> which shows a better wettability with water as compared to the CFRP sample contaminated with <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> The elaborate studies comprising a variation of the surface concentration of the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> reveal that even at the lowest investigated thickness of the silicone-based films the average size of water drops is significantly smaller than in case of the CFRP surfaces free from <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> That means that both OSEE and AWT investigations of CFRP adherents allow for clearly indicating the presence of a silicone-based <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> in an amount which – following Figure  1 – was demonstrated by Markatos et al. [23] to result in a strongly reduced strength of adhesive joints manufactured based on such adherents. These adherents therefore may be considered effectively contaminated. Cleaning them appropriately and testing the effect of the cleaning applying extended non-destructive testing will contribute to preventing the manufacture of adhesive joints with undesirably compromised strength.|$|R
