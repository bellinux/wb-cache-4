Ghafur Muhaiyyuddin Shah (1592 – 1614 A.D.) following the Undang-undang Melaka, the present authors found that the influence of the Malay custom was less than the Islamic law which was generally followed. Thus, there were provisions based on the Islamic law dealing with qiṣāṣ (section or s. 46 and 47), fines (s. 48), unlawful intercourse (s. 49), sodomy (s. 50), theft (s. 53), robbery (s. 54), apostasy (s. 62), omission to pray (s. 60), jihad (s. 61), procedure (<b>s.</b> 62), and <b>witnesses</b> and <b>oaths</b> (<b>s.</b> 64).

40|$|An {{entanglement}} witness {{approach to}} quantum coherent state key distribution {{and a system}} for its practical implementation are described. In this approach, eavesdropping can be detected by a change in sign of either of two witness functions, an entanglement <b>witness</b> <b>S</b> or an eavesdropping witness W. The effects of loss and eavesdropping on system operation are evaluated {{as a function of}} distance. Although the eavesdropping witness W does not directly witness entanglement for the system, its behavior remains related to that of the true entanglement <b>witness</b> <b>S.</b> Furthermore, W is easier to implement experimentally than S. W crosses the axis at a finite distance, in a manner reminiscent of entanglement sudden death. The distance at which this occurs changes measurably when an eavesdropper is present. The distance dependance of the two witnesses due to amplitude reduction and due to increased variance resulting from both ordinary propagation losses and possible eavesdropping activity is provided. Finally, the information content and secure key rate of a continuous variable protocol using this witness approach are given. This research was supported by the DARPA QUINESS program through U. S.

40|$|I {{provide a}} description, analysis, and {{interpretation}} of the social reality constructed by the discourse of Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses.</b> I utilize a qualitative-interpretive approach for my exploration into a social reality. My purpose is {{to determine how the}} textual and contextual reality of Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses</b> influences their lives and courses of action. ^ I identify in Chapter I the focus of the dissertation, discuss the theoretical framework of the social construction of reality, and explicate the method used to illuminate the social reality of Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses.</b> ^ Chapter II has two primary sections. First, I provide a description of the Witnesses 2 ̆ 7 history, including beliefs, standards, terminology. Second, I provide a review of literature concerning social issues involving Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses,</b> the intersection of research on religion and language, research involving religious-communication genres, and research addressing Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Witnesses</b> and the Watch Tower Society. ^ I illuminate in Chapter III the reality I interpret as emerging in Witness 2 ̆ 7 discourse. The description section articulates a reeality composed of three world formations [...] Satan 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> World, <b>Witness</b> 2 ̆ 7 World, and Jehovah 2 ̆ 7 s World. The analysis section posits Witness 2 ̆ 7 reality is composed of three primary themes including visual, family, and foundation. The interpretation section focuses on what I identify as the processes of splitting and bridging occurring in the discourse. ^ Chapter IV focuses on how this dissertation strengthens our understanding of the subjectivity of social reality within the realm of discursive constructionism. The breadth and diversity of the categories, patterns, and themes in the analysis section of Chapter III illuminate the plurality and the subjectivity [...] the polysemy [...] of discursive constructed realities. I argue an independent and objective reality removes a realm of responsibility from humans for what occurs in their lives. A rhetorical-constructionist perspective forces persons to actively engage in an analysis {{and interpretation of}} reality, and to involve themselves in how reality is perceived and understood. I address implications for both the Watch Tower Society and the communication discipline. ...|$|R

The two primary alternative routes to development are inward-oriented growth strategies, which emphasises import-substitution industrialisation (ISI); and outward-oriented policies, which emphasises the economic benefits {{of participation in the}} world economy, that is, export-led growth (ELG).
