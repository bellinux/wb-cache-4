5|$|Sri Aurobindo {{argues that}} divine Brahman manifests as {{empirical}} reality through līlā, or divine play. Instead of positing {{that the world}} <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> is an illusion (māyā), Aurobindo argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the human species just as human species have evolved after the animal species.|$|E
25|$|David Bohm viewed {{quantum theory}} and {{relativity}} as contradictory, which implied {{a more fundamental}} level in the universe. He claimed both quantum theory and relativity pointed towards this deeper theory, which he formulated as a quantum field theory. This more fundamental level was proposed to represent an undivided wholeness and an implicate order, from which arises the explicate order of the universe as <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> it.|$|E
25|$|In 1738, Swiss {{physicist}} and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica which laid {{the basis for}} the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion.|$|E

25|$|We create karma {{in three}} {{different}} ways, through actions that are positive, negative, or neutral. When we feel kindness and love and with this attitude do good things, which are beneficial to both ourselves and others, this is positive action. When we commit harmful deeds out of equally harmful intentions, this is negative action. Finally, when our motivation is indifferent and our deeds are neither harmful or beneficial, this is neutral action. The results <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> will accord {{with the quality of}} our actions.|$|E
25|$|Nothing within {{quantum theory}} itself {{requires}} each possibility within a wave function to complement a mental state. As {{all physical states}} (i.e. brain states) are quantum states, their associated mental states should be also. Nonetheless, {{it is not what}} <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> within physical reality. Albert and Loewer argue that the mind must be intrinsically different than the physical reality as described by quantum theory. Thereby, they reject type-identity physicalism in favour of a non-reductive stance. However, Lockwood saves materialism through the notion of supervenience of the mental on the physical.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} pathway {{through which}} the threat-activated vigilance system acts is not well understood. One possibility is that the thalamus receives sensory information and sends it on the amygdala, which regulates emotional experience. Another is that the amygdaloid complex, anterior cingulate, and the structures in the pontine tegmentum interact to create the vision. It is also highly possible that SP hallucinations could result {{from a combination of}} these. The anterior cingulate has an extensive array of cortical connections to other cortical areas, which enables it to integrate the various sensations and emotions into the unified sensorium <b>we</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E

25|$|Kant {{deemed it}} obvious {{that we have}} some {{objective}} knowledge of the world, such as, say, Newtonian physics. But this knowledge relies on synthetic, a priori laws of nature, like causality and substance. The problem, then, is how this is possible. Kant's solution was to reason that the subject must supply laws that make experience of objects possible, and that these laws are the synthetic, a priori laws of nature that we know apply to all objects before <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> them. So, to deduce all these laws, Kant examined experience in general, dissecting in it what is supplied by the mind from what is supplied by the given intuitions. What has just been explicated is commonly called a transcendental deduction.|$|E
25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon the things <b>we</b> <b>experience.</b> In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing the criterion for those things that we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of anything at all we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E
25|$|Gaseous water {{represents}} {{a small but}} environmentally significant constituent of the atmosphere. The percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42°C (-44°F) to 4.24% when the dew point is 30°C (86°F). Approximately 99.13% of it is contained in the troposphere. The condensation of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for clouds, rain, snow, and other precipitation, all of which count among the most significant elements of what <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> as weather. Less obviously, the latent heat of vaporization, which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, {{is one of the}} most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales. For example, latent heat release in atmospheric convection is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as tropical cyclones and severe thunderstorms. Water vapor is the most potent greenhouse gas owing to the presence of the hydroxyl bond which strongly absorbs in the infra-red region of the light spectrum.|$|E

500|$|... "That's how <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> reality, {{by looking}} at the {{microcosm}} and the macrocosm simultaneously. The eye sees differently than the lens, but with multiple focal lengths and a muscular editorial style, the lens can give you that microcosm/macrocosm perspective, and that contributes to the feeling of total immersion." [...] In staging the film's action sequences, Bigelow did not want to lose a sense of the geography and used multiple cameras to allow her to [...] "look at any particular set piece from every possible perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1738, Swiss {{physicist}} and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica, which laid {{the basis for}} the kinetic theory of gases.

The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because conservation of energy had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.|$|E
500|$|As {{the sacred}} texts of ancient Hindu and Buddhist {{philosophy}} became available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they influenced philosophers such as Schopenhauer {{to hold that}} in a healthy mind only deeds oppress our conscience, not wishes and thoughts; [...] "for it is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will"; the good conscience, thought Schopenhauer, <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> after every disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification [...] "that our true self exists not only in our own person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives.

500|$|Neutral monism, in philosophy, is the meta{{physical}} {{view that the}} mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are themselves [...] "neutral", that is, neither physical nor mental. [...] This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things. Rather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff, {{in the form of}} neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical. These neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape, just as <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> those properties. But these shaped and colored elements do not exist in a mind (considered as a substantial entity, whether dualistically or physicalistically); they exist on their own.|$|E
500|$|Finally, Duerr {{once again}} criticises the {{approach}} of Western society and its anthropologists to studying [...] "archaic" [...] spiritual beliefs. He asserts that in these [...] "archaic" [...] cultures, people [...] "have a much clearer idea {{about the fact that}} we can not be only what we are if at the same time, we are also what we are not, and that we can only know who we are if <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> our boundaries". He denounces Western scientists and anthropologists for their approaches to the study of such cultures, arguing that they have misrepresented them by attempting to fit them within the Western ideas of objectivity. He argues that in future, anthropologists must reach their own boundaries, and recognize the wilderness of their consciousness before they can truly understand the worldview of [...] "archaic" [...] humans.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Stransky was {{favorable}} of both Strong's narration {{and performance}} in the fifth season episode [...] "The Best Thing That Could Have Ever Happened", describing Mary Alice's role in the episode as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and writing: [...] "I know we hear Brenda Strong nearly every week in her voiceovers, {{but it was so}} nice to see her on screen again! That lady can act." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic was bored by Mary Alice's flashback scenes in the sixth season episode [...] "Epiphany", believing them to be unrealistic. Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine praised Mary Alice's narration in the series finale in 2012, writing: [...] "There was one resolution that truly resonated. When the ladies all move out of [...] Lane and politely promise to keep in touch and visit, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) takes the opportunity to unearth one last lie. With one of her most somber voiceovers ever, she lets us in on a secret that the housewives already know: They won’t keep in touch, and they won’t visit. The moment is far more unsettling and existential than the overblown sequence of the desperately deceased gathering to wave Susan goodbye. Deep friendships and passing acquaintances can never be replicated, and these are the endings <b>we</b> <b>experience</b> every day, even as we try to deny their finality." [...] Writing for Backstage magazine in 2012, Jeffery Self wrote that Strong's narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming [...] "one of the most familiar on television". As a result of her popularity as the series' narrator, Anna Silman of Vulture magazine described Strong as [...] "everybody's favorite deceased housewife/omniscient narrator" [...] in 2014.|$|E
