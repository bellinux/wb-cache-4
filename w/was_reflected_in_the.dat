5|$|City {{had only}} {{appeared}} in one previous major final when {{they won the}} 1911 FA Cup Final before Wembley Stadium had been built. Hence, the play-off final was the club's first game at Wembley in their 93-year history. For Notts County, it was the fifth visit to the national stadium since 1990. The historic occasion for Bradford <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ticket sales, with City fans outnumbering their opponents nearly three-to-one with 28,000 of the crowd of 39,972 coming from Bradford.|$|E
5|$|During 1987, {{relations}} improved steadily, with U.S. military inspectors {{present at}} Soviet military manoeuvres, {{an agreement to}} establish centers on Reducing Nuclear Threat, and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning nuclear tests. The thaw in relations <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural sphere. Matlock’s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a reception at Spaso House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev’s intentions, as earlier Soviet leaders would have considered it a provocation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} term, 1999 to 2004, {{there was a}} break in the grand {{coalition}} resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties. This <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and Socialists. In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's growing {{interest}} in art <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story, as he included a copy of Alfred Sisley's Le Canal du Loing at Marlinspike Hall. He also included paintings by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró aboard Rastapopolous' Scheherazade. Muller's pseudonym in the story, Mull Pasha, was based upon the British soldier Glubb Pasha. In the final scene, Hergé included cameos of both himself and his friend and colleague Edgar P. Jacobs.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in August 1973 following the tour supporting the previous album, Foxtrot (1972). The group set aside {{a short period of}} time to write new material, which covered a number of themes, including the loss of English folk culture and an increased American influence, which <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> title. Following the album's release, the group set out on tour, where they drew an enthusiastic reception from fans.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} {{finished}} with extremely similar statistical totals, as befitting a close game. The two teams were within 38total yards of each other; Kansas had 344yards and Virginia Tech had 306. That relative closeness <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> teams' first-down totals as well. Virginia Tech earned 20first downs: 10rushing, eightpassing, and twovia penalty. Kansas, meanwhile, earned 19first downs: fiverushing, 13passing, and onevia penalty.|$|E

5|$|Another injury problem; {{this time}} an ankle {{ligament}} injury sustained in a pre-season match at Goodison Park, restricted Shearer to just twogoals in 17games in the 1997–98 season. His injury <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club's form, and Newcastle finished just 13th in the Premier League. However, United (now managed by Shearer's old boss at Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish) {{had a good}} run in the FA Cup; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi-final victory over Sheffield United as the team reached the final. The team were unable {{to get on the}} scoresheet at Wembley, and lost the game 2–0 to Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the city}} of Bern celebrated the 650th anniversary of its {{adherence}} to the Old Swiss Confederacy with many events, including a dedicated exposition at the Historical Museum that ran for several months and {{the publication of the}} history schoolbook Berns mutige Zeit. The simultaneous 350-year anniversary of the peasant war <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city only in a few newspaper articles, but it was widely celebrated in the coutryside with speeches, colloquia, and an ambitious and very successful open-air theatre production at Eggiwil in the Emmental.|$|E
5|$|Sujoy Ghosh {{approached}} {{novelist and}} script writer Advaita Kala {{with the idea}} for the film. Kala took inspiration from her experience in Kolkata, where she had moved in 1999, akin to the protagonist in the film. She reported that despite facing a language barrier and the chaos and poverty of the metropolis, she was charmed by the warmth of the people, which <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. Kala started writing in 2009 and finished the 185-page script by February 2010. Her research included reading the books Open Secrets: India's Intelligence Unveiled by Maloy Krishna Dhar and India's External Intelligence: Secrets of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) by V. K.

5|$|Synge's plays {{helped to}} set the {{dominant}} style of plays at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised realism of his writing <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> training given at the theatre's school of acting, and plays of peasant life were the main staple of the repertoire {{until the end of}} the 1950s. Sean O'Casey, the next major dramatist to write for the Abbey, knew Synge's work well and attempted to do for the Dublin working classes what Synge had done for the rural poor. Brendan Behan, Brinsley MacNamara, and Lennox Robinson were all indebted to Synge.|$|E
5|$|The {{elaborate}} {{style of}} European monarchies left a favorable impression on Kalākaua. Construction on Iolani Palace {{had begun in}} 1879, and was ongoing when Kalākaua was touring the world, with an appropriation from the legislature of $80,000. Even {{though it was not}} fully completed until December 1882, the King was living there prior to his departure on his world tour. The influence of European palaces <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interior design and expensive furnishings. The final cost was $343,595. Immediately upon completion, the King invited all 120 members of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie to the palace for a lodge meeting.|$|E
5|$|The writers {{had wanted}} an episode where Burns becomes {{bankrupt}} and shows what Burns {{would be like}} as {{a person in the}} real world. The idea with the recycling plant was that Burns did not have any sort of evil plan, he just could not help being himself. Burns really was trying to change and this <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff joked about this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 check really is.|$|E

5|$|According {{to former}} English paceman Bill Bowes, England had {{approached}} the First Test {{with the intention}} of achieving a draw against a team they regarded as their superior, reflected in their selections and use of defensive tactics. Bowes himself believed the tactics to be correct and almost successful. However, he suspected that Walter Robins, one of the selectors, considered the English strategy to be misguided and that they should attack the Australians. This <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English selections. The home team made three changes; the leg spinner Doug Wright, who was forced to withdraw from the First Test at late notice due to lumbago, had regained his fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox spin of Young, who had taken match figures of 1/107 in the First TestAustralian wicket-keeper Don Tallon was his only wicket. However, he had managed to keep the batsmen quiet with his defensive leg theory, bowling 60 overs for 79 runs; Wright was a much more attacking and therefore expensive bowler. Jim Laker, who had been called into the First Test team due to Wright's lumbago, was initially the third spinner in the pecking order, but he took 4/138, including three specialist batsmen, and was retained.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to England, Hirst completed another double in 1904. Although a leg injury reduced {{the pace and}} effectiveness of his bowling {{for much of the}} season, he scored 2,501 runs at an average of 54.36, the highest aggregate and average of his career, and took 132 wickets at 21.09. He became the first Yorkshire player to achieve the double of 2,000 runs and 100 wickets, a feat previously achieved only by the Gloucestershire trio of W. G. Grace, Charlie Townsend and Gilbert Jessop. Most of his eight centuries were either against the strongest counties or in adverse circumstances for the team. In August, Hirst had a benefit match against Lancashire from which he received £3,703, worth around £296,000 in 2009, a very high sum for a benefit at the time, and his popularity <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attendance over three days of 78,792 spectators.|$|E
5|$|An already tense {{situation}} in the Lika region, following 1 April Plitvice Lakes incident when the first fatalities of the Croatian War of Independence occurred, deteriorated further in June when Croatia reaffirmed its sovereignty through a parliamentary declaration. This <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rise of violent incidents, setting up of unauthorized road checkpoints and occasional exchanges of small arms fire. On 22 June, three policemen were abducted on the road between Gospić and SAO Krajina-controlled Gračac, {{and a series of}} attacks on the Croatian police occurred in various parts of Lika, including Gospić, on 27–28 June. In July 1991, the JNA started to openly confront the Croatian police and the ZNG in Lika. On 1 July, Plitvice police station was surrounded by the JNA, and on 6 July, two ZNG troops were killed and another two wounded in a JNA ambush near Gospić. Further escalation of the fighting was seen at the Ljubovo pass on the Gospić–Korenica road, where the JNA and SAO Krajina troops fought and pushed the ZNG back on 28–29 July.|$|E

5|$|Between the Acts of Union in the mid-16th {{century and}} the English Civil War in the mid-17th century, a period of great {{rebuilding}} {{took place in the}} Kingdom of England, of which Wales was now annexed, and this is reflected in the structures that were built within the Rhondda Valley. The fluctuating economic state of the late Tudor period resulted in farmers taking in more land, creating higher levels of surplus goods and therefore producing higher profits. This profit <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new farm houses built in the Rhondda {{and for the first time}} an emphasis on domestic comfort became apparent in the design of the dwellings. Many of the new farm buildings were simple structures consisting of two or three small rooms, though of a much sturdier and permanent quality than the Medieval platform houses. A popular style of building was the long-house, a building which combined the house and cowshed into a single building. By 1840, at least 160 farms existed in the Rhondda, but most were destroyed with the growth of the mining industry. Of the few surviving buildings, those of note include Tynewydd ('New House') in Blaenrhondda, a 17th-century house thought to have given its name to the neighbouring village of Tynewydd and Tyntyle in Ystrad dated around 1600.|$|E
5|$|Burke {{experimented with}} a variety of musical styles {{throughout}} the game's development. Burke's original compositions were lighthearted as befitting for a Nintendo game, but became darker along with other parts of the game to match the Xbox audience when Microsoft acquired Rare. The composer thought that this transition <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack, with some Nintendo-style music juxtaposed against the roaring orchestral tracks. Burke estimates that he had written four hours of audio for the project and ultimately recorded 80 minutes with an orchestra and choir over four days in Prague. The team recorded the orchestra and choir separately. Sumthing Else Music Works published the soundtrack on compact disc and for download via the iTunes Store and Amazon. It was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition award.|$|E
5|$|Despite their defeat by Selim I and the Ottomans in 1517, the Mamluks {{remained}} {{influential in}} Egyptian society, becoming beys ("chieftains"), nominally {{under the control}} of the Ottoman governors, instead of amirs at the head of an empire. The first governor of Egypt under Selim I was Khai'r Bey, a Mamluk amir who had defected to the Ottomans during the Battle of Marj Dabiq. Though the Mamluks launched multiple revolts to reinstate their Sultanate, including two in 1523, the Ottomans refrained from completely destroying the Mamluk hold over the power structure of Egypt. The Mamluks did suffer losses—both economic and military—in the immediate aftermath of the Ottoman victory, and this <b>was</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lack of financial assistance provided to al-Azhar in the first hundred years of Ottoman rule. By the 18th century the Mamluk elite had regained much of its influence and began to sponsor numerous renovations throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar specifically.|$|E
