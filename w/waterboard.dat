500|$|Returning home, Brian informs Lois that Limbaugh will {{be coming}} over for dinner. That night, Lois and Peter begin arguing and {{challenging}} Limbaugh politically. Deciding to confront Limbaugh for brainwashing Brian, Lois demands for their dog {{to go back to}} the way he used to be. Limbaugh insists Brian became a conservative on his own terms, and the two sing a number based on [...] "The Company Way", [...] "Republican Town". Angered, Brian decides to move out and become roommates with a reluctant Limbaugh. Brian begins to irritate Limbaugh with his blind devotion. He replaces lots of Limbaugh's possessions with American-Made versions, which all go wrong. Deciding to follow Limbaugh to his radio show, Brian attempts to voice his own political opinions on the air about Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, causing Limbaugh to become frustrated and throw him out. Deciding to prove his devotion to the conservative cause, Brian attempts to <b>waterboard</b> Pelosi before being apprehended and arrested. After being bailed out by Limbaugh later that day, Brian continues to assert his conservatism. Limbaugh attempts to convince Brian he is only fighting against the Establishment due to his desire of being the underdog. He tells Brian that a child was executed in Texas and Brian is visibly horrified; Limbaugh then says that he made up the story, but Brian's honest reaction to it shows he is a liberal at heart. Reassuring Brian of his liberal convictions, Rush leaves the jail, making a Grapes of Wrath-like pledge to [...] "be around" [...] wherever conservative causes need help. Outside, they heckle each other with reassurance, and the episode ends with Limbaugh then transforming into a bald eagle and flying away into the skyline.|$|E

40|$|Drawing on a {{qualitative}} analysis of 21 hearings {{held by the}} US Congress in 2007 and 2008, this manuscript examines the discursive work that proponents and opponents of <b>waterboarding</b> used to maintain and challenge {{the legitimacy of the}} practice. The juxtaposition reveals that US political discourse of <b>waterboarding</b> orients to a long-standing cultural coding of torture as antithetical to liberal democ-racy. Specifically, I show that proponents defend <b>waterboarding</b> by narrating its use within a sequence of instrumentally rational actions that begins with the capture of a terrorist, involves the unsuccessful use of traditional interrogation techniques fol-lowed by <b>waterboarding,</b> and concludes with the collection of intelligence that frus-trates terroristic activities. In this sequence, <b>waterboarding</b> appears to be a last resort in the pursuit of a legitimate state goal. Opponents of <b>waterboarding,</b> conversely, emphasize the practice’s illiberal qualities, arguing that <b>waterboarding</b> produces com-pliant detainees who will say anything to end their torture. Opponents also describe the physical horrors associated with torture and compare <b>waterboarding</b> to practices employed by notorious illiberal regimes. I demonstrate that these opposing depictions of <b>waterboarding</b> derive their resonance from a single cultural code that legitimates instrumentally rational expressions of state violence and abhors ferocious, repressiv...|$|R
5000|$|During 2016, Trump {{has called}} for the {{resumption}} of <b>waterboarding,</b> and has repeatedly expressed support {{for the use of}} torture by the U.S. for the purpose of trying to get information from terrorists, if Congress allows it. On one occasion, Trump has called <b>waterboarding</b> [...] "your minimal form of torture"; on another occasion he has said, [...] "Nobody knows if it's torture". Whether <b>waterboarding</b> is torture or not, Trump supports broadening the laws to allow <b>waterboarding.</b> Many experts believe that <b>waterboarding</b> would be illegal without a change in the laws, including a group of foreign policy experts who published a letter in Foreign Policy magazine to that effect in March 2016.|$|R
2500|$|At 21:00, Sgt. Mark Boland {{replaced}} Master Corporal Clayton Matchee as {{guard of}} the prisoner, and ordered that his foot bindings be removed, {{and replaced with}} fetters as the ropes were too tight. Warrant Officer Murphy {{took the opportunity to}} kick Arone [...] "savagely", which was later claimed to be implicit permission to abuse the prisoner. At this time, Matchee began his abuse of Arone by removing the captive's clothing and using it to crudely <b>waterboard</b> the youth until Boland objected, and Matchee left the bunker.|$|E
2500|$|Van Nieuwland was {{succeeded by}} Godfried van Mierlo, {{who would be}} the last bishop in communion with Rome Haarlem would know for 300 years. In 1578 after the Spanish were defeated, the church was {{attacked}} on Sacrament day (29 May), this time by soldiers of the Prince of Orange. One of the priests was killed, and many objects in the church were destroyed. [...] This event, called the Haarlemse Noon, forced the bishop to flee the city. Fortunately, many treasures were still safe 500 yards away in the underground Catholic church. The city council confiscated the Sint Bavo Kerk and all of its daughter churches, and later converted them along the tenets of the Evangelical Reformed Church. The new (and current) name became Grote Kerk. Old Catholics and the Lutherans, though officially tolerated, went underground. Both Protestants and Catholics alike felt that when all political unrest had subsided, the Catholics could regain control of [...] "their" [...] church. However, the Dutch Protestants had also removed all Catholics from local government and feared {{that they would have to}} pay damages to the Catholics if they were allowed their own churches again. All over the Netherlands, new Catholic churches were subsidised, called <b>Waterboard</b> churches, for their similarity to <b>Waterboard</b> pump stations (they were designed by the same architect in Neo-classical style), and in Haarlem they built the St. Joseph kerk in the Jansstraat in 1841. It was not until 1853 that a new Roman Catholic bishop was installed in the St. Joseph kerk. As this church grew, a new cathedral, again called the Cathedral of Saint Bavo, was built at the Leidsevaart (canal to Leiden) in 1898. The Bishop of Haarlem has a formal residence on the Nieuwe Gracht canal.|$|E
2500|$|Its use principally {{for obtaining}} confessions {{rather than as}} {{punishment}} {{dates back to the}} 15th century and the Spanish Inquisition. It was also in use for the same purpose, albeit illegally, by U.S. police officers as recently as 1981. During the Korean War, the North Koreans used several enhanced interrogation techniques (EIT) to achieve prisoner compliance and false confessions. Such techniques caused a U.S.airmen to falsely [...] "confess" [...] that there was a plan to use biological weapons against North Korea. After 9/11, CIA interrogators, sought to <b>waterboard</b> suspected terrorists to obtain actionable intelligence, but prisoners falsely confessed to whatever interrogators accused them of in order to stop the EIT. Khalid Shaykh Muhammad fabricated stories to give his tormentors [...] "everything they wanted to hear." [...] Later, he recanted, citing he was being tortured when he made up the stories. The same was true for the [...] "confessions" [...] elicited by EIT on Riduan Isamuddin, aka Hambali.|$|E

50|$|It was at {{this time}} that Kruik changed his name to the Latin Cruquius after his first {{publications}} of maps and measurements. In 1725 he wrote a famous letter to Willem 's Gravesande, a Dutch professor of physics and astronomy at Leiden, proposing an empirical deductive research method to solve the water problems of the Netherlands. This letter started the chain of events in working that eventually led to a plan presented to the United Provinces to create a water defence plan in 1727. It was this unified water plan that in turn {{led to the creation of}} Haarlemmermeer bij pumping the Haarlem lake dry more than a century later. In 1733 he became a member of the 'Hoogheemraadschap Rijnland', the Dutch <b>Waterboard</b> Agency, and worked as a <b>Waterboard</b> inspector in Spaarndam.

5000|$|However, {{according}} to a declassified Justice Department memo attempting to justify torture which references a still-classified report of the CIA Inspector General on the CIA's use of waterboarding, among other [...] "enhanced" [...] interrogation techniques, the CIA applied waterboarding to detainees [...] "in a different manner" [...] than the technique used in SERE training:The difference was {{in the manner in}} which the detainees' breathing was obstructed. At the SERE school and in the DoJ opinion, the subject's airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passages; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contrast, the Agency interrogator ... applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee's mouth and nose. One of the psychiatrist / interrogators acknowledged that the Agency's use of the technique is different from that used in SERE training because it is 'for real' and is more poignant and convincing.According to the DOJ memo, the IG Report observed that the CIA's Office of Medical Services (OMS) stated that [...] "the experience of the SERE psychologist / interrogators on the <b>waterboard</b> was probably misrepresented at the time, as the SERE <b>waterboard</b> experience is so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant" [...] and that [...] "consequently, {{according to}} OMS, there was no a priori reason to believe that applying the <b>waterboard</b> with the frequency and intensity with which it was used by the psychologist/interrogators was either efficacious or medically safe." ...|$|E
