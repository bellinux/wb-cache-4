30|$|The high {{dropout rate}} {{is related to}} the nature of the data collection, in that the {{follow-up}} data were acquired by postal questionnaire, with only one <b>written</b> <b>reminder</b> and no direct patient contact. This design was necessary to improve the integrity of the data, given the 2 -year follow-up period and to ensure that any placebo effect following surgery would have passed. It is possible that the women who did not respond to the second questionnaire were more likely to have been discharged from the clinic than women who had not been discharged and where follow-up data could be collected in clinics. The former group of poor responders could, therefore, be women who had responded better to treatment. This is a limitation of the study, as it may lead to underestimation of the size of the reduction in pain achieved. If this is so, then it may be proposed that surgical excision may be appropriate for deep disease but that women with chronic pelvic pain with no evidence of endometriosis, women with superficial disease only and not complaining of sub- fertility, irrespective of r-ASRM score, were less likely to show reduced pain and should be offered alternative treatments.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{importance}} of electronic medical {{records for the}} healthcare system is well documented. IT enables easy storage, communication and decision support and can provide important tools {{in the care of}} chronically ill patients {{in the form of a}} reminder system. METHODS: A questionnaire was developed and send out to 1200 physicians extracted from the official data base. After four weeks the non-responders received a <b>written</b> <b>reminder.</b> Data collection started in December 2007 and was completed in February 2008. RESULTS: 719 questionnaires were received back, representing a response rate of 59. 9 %. The data revealed a significant underuse of electronic medical records (EMRs) and IT compared to other European countries. Smaller practices, older physicians and especially primary care physicians tended to use less EMR. Only 10. 2 % of all physicians declared an interest in considering investment in IT in the next three years, 66. 9 % expressly denied wishing to do so. The most important barriers were the costs, the unclear benefit and a feared worsening of the doctor-patient-communication during consultation. CONCLUSION: IT and especially EMRs are underused in daily ambulatory care in Switzerland. To increase the use of EMRs, several approaches could be helpful. First of all, the benefit of EMRs in daily routine care have to be increased as, for example, by decision support systems, tools to avoid pharmaceutical interactions and reminder systems to enable a proactive treatment of chronically ill patients. Furthermore, adequate approaches to offer appropriate reimbursement for the financial investments have to considered such as an additional payment for electronically generated, evidence based quality indicators...|$|E

The aims {{of this study were}} to estimate the effect of telephone follow-up on retention, identify participant characteristics predictive of questionnaire completion during or after telephone follow-up, and estimate the effect of including participants who provided follow-up data during or after telephone follow-up on balance between randomly allocated groups in a trial estimating the effect of electronic alcohol screening and brief intervention on alcohol consumption in hospital outpatients with hazardous or harmful drinking. Method: Trial participants were followed up 6  months after randomization (June–December 2013) using e-mails containing a hyperlink to a web-based questionnaire when possible and by post otherwise. Telephone follow-up was attempted after two <b>written</b> <b>reminders</b> and participants were invited to complete the questionnaire by telephone when contact was made. Results: Retention before telephone follow-up was 62. 1 % (520 / 837) and 82. 8 % (693 / 837) afterward: an increase of 20. 7 % (173 / 837). Therefore, 55 % (95 % CI 49 %– 60 %) of the 317 participants who had not responded after two <b>written</b> <b>reminders</b> responded during or after the follow-up telephone call. Age <  55  years, a higher AUDIT-C score and provision of a mobile/cell phone number were predictive of questionnaire completion during or after telephone follow-up.

40|$|AIM: To {{discover}} {{the attitudes of}} mothers of young children towards community pharmacists, and mothers' use of community pharmacies for childhood illnesses OBJECTIVES: To discover how frequently mothers visit pharmacies; for which childhood complaints they tend to consult a pharmacist first, rather than other health professionals; to identify how helpful mothers feel their pharmacists are; and to identify whether mothers prefer pharmacists with particular demographic characteristics, eg having children of their own. METHODS: A questionnaire survey {{based on the results}} of four focus groups conducted with mothers of children aged under five years. 117 questionnaires were distributed by five pharmacies in Northern England to a convenience sample between July and September 2000, with one <b>written</b> <b>reminder</b> to non-respondents one month later. A total of 85 (73 %) were returned and the anonymised data were entered into SPSS for Windows for analysis. RESULTS: 61 % of mothers claimed to visit the pharmacy once a month or more but only 22 % of mothers claimed to have had advice from the pharmacist once a month or more. 57 % of the mothers are loyal customers to one pharmacy. 87 % of the mothers reported that pharmacist's advice was helpful or very helpful. Mothers sought advice from pharmacists for minor childhood ailments but not always in the first instance. Mothers did not feel that the demographic characteristics of the pharmacists affected the advice given but they expressed a personal preference for receiving advice from female pharmacists with children. LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: This was an exploratory study with a small sample so the results cannot be generalised. Also, convenience sampling is prone to bias. However, this qualitative study presents some preliminary indications about mothers' use of pharmacies for advice on young children's ailments, and suggests aspects that warrant further investigation. CONCLUSION: In this study, mothers of children under five years of age rated pharmacist's advice as helpful. They did not consider that the demographics of the pharmacist would affect the advice they received, but preferred to consult a pharmacist with children. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} factors affecting attendance in screening for cervical cancer, and to evaluate various measures aimed at increasing compliance to self-administered postal questionnaires and screening for cervical cancer. A population-based randomized controlled trial including 2000 men and women aged 20 - 79 years and living in Sweden was conducted to investigate compliance to postal questionnaires. In a randomized 2 3 factorial design three factors were tested: 1) preliminary notification or not, 2), questionnaire length, and 3) mention of a possible telephone contact or not. Preliminary notification increased the response rate by 7 %, a short questionnaire with 5 %, whereas mention of a possible telephone contact did not influence attendance. Combinations of preliminary notification and short questionnaires increased the response rate by 16 %, whereas young age, male gender and urban residence lowered the response rate. The relation between non-attendance to screening for cervical cancer (Pap smear screening) and sociodemographic factors, gynecological examinations, risk behavior, general health behavior, knowledge, attitudes and beliefs was investigated in a population-based case-control study with 430 non-attenders and 514 attenders at Pap smear screening in Uppsala county. Non-attendance was more likely among women who had not used oral contraceptives, who had not taken their own initiative to a Pap smear, who had visited different gynecologists, and who had visited a physician very often or not at all. Regular condom use, living in rural/semirural areas, and not knowing the recommended screening interval were all associated with non-attendance, whereas socioeconomic status was not, when tested in a multivariate model. Multivariate analysis also showed that non-attendance was more likely among women who did not perceive cervical cancer to be as severe as other malignancies, who did not perceive {{the benefits of a}} Pap smear, who had time-consuming and economical barriers, and who did not feel anxious about the test results or cervical cancer. The results were strengthened with increasing time since the last smear or if self-reported attendance status was used instead of true attendance. Non-attenders also kept holding on harder to their preferences than did attenders, stating that they would not participate if their preferences were not met and were less likely to intend to participate in future screening. Among the non-attenders, 57 % underestimated the time lapse since the last smear. Modifications of the invitation and call-recall system for Pap smear screening was investigated in a randomized controlled trial including all 12, 240 women invited to organized screening during 17 weeks in 2001 in Uppsala County. Three successive interventions were tested: 1) modified invitation vs. the standard invitation letter, 2) reminder letter vs. no reminder letter, and 3) phone reminder vs. no phone reminder. Whereas the modified invitation did not increase attendance, a reminder letter increased the proportion attending by 9 %, and a phone reminder by 31 %. Combinations of modified invitation, <b>written</b> <b>reminder</b> and phone reminder almost doubled attendance within 12 months, and the number of detected cytologic abnormalities was more than tripled.

40|$|Introduction. A {{pilot study}} on the {{feasibility}} of {{the establishment of a}} serumbank of a representative sample of the Dutch general population was carried out. The aims of this so-called 'PIENTER-project' were to estimate: 1. age-specific immunity of the general population against childhood diseases of the Netherlands Immunization Programme, 2. the incidence of infectious diseases with a frequent subclinical course 3, the prevalence of serum-determinants of other illnesses. This report describes the results of the non-response study which was performed to obtain insight in the reasons for nonparticipation and to test the representativity. Design. Nonresponse study as part of a cross-sectional population survey. Methods. 510 persons in the age-strata (0, 1 - 4, 5 - 9 to 75 - 79 years) were randomly selected out of four municipalities in het Province of Utrecht. The participants have been asked to fill in a questionnaire and to visit a local health service to give some blood. The nonparticipants were contacted by telephone (or mail). In this nonresponsestudy data were obtained on the reasons for nonparticipation, willingness to visit additional hours to give blood. Information on religion, vaccination history, self-perception on health status, country of nationality and level of education were collected with a short questionnaire. Data obtained from the registries of the municipalities were age, sex, nationality and marital status. Part of the eligible persons received a <b>written</b> <b>reminder.</b> Differences between participants and nonparticipants were tested in logistic regression analyses. To get information on the immunity of nonparticipants and participants, the immunity against hepatitis A and measles was weighted by the variables in the logistic regression model. Results. Four groups of (non) participants were distinguished: 1. initial participants (n= 714, 34 %); 2. additional participants who visited the additional hours of the local health service to give blood (n= 113, 6 %); 3. partial nonparticipants from whom questionnaire data were obtained (n= 667, 27 %); 4. absolute nonparticipants from whom information on data out of the registry of the municipality and some times the reason for nonparticipation were available (n= 546, 27 %). 1021 of the 1326 (77 %) nonparticipants were reached by telephone; 75 % of them were reached in two, 95 % in five attempts. Information was collected on 58. 9 % of nonparticipants. The reason for nonparticipation were very diverse. 36 % of the reasons given were considered impressionable. The logistic regression analyses showed that childeren aged 0 - 4 years, men, single persons, persons who didn't receive a reminder by mail, persons with low education level, persons with bad perception of health status were more frequent nonparticipants. Persons who belong to a religion from which it is known that vaccination is refused participated less frequent, particularly when they had indeed not participated in the Netherlands Immunization Programme. Persons aged 5 - 14 years participated more frequent. The estimation of the immunity against hepatitis A and measles were not biased by the selection due to nonparticipation. Conclusion. It is possible to get information on nonparticipants by telephone. The non-participants gave usefull information on possible adaptions to increase the participation rate in further surveys. A telephone reminder turned out to have a possitive influence on the participation rate. Although nonresponse selection existed, the estimation on the immunity against hepatitis A and measles were not biased by this nonparticipation selection. The results of the nonresponse study can be used to correct the measured seroprevalence of other diseases by selective nonparticipation...|$|E

A subset of defendants was surveyed after their scheduled court date to assess their perceptions of procedural justice and trust and confidence in the courts. Reminders reduced FTA overall, and more substantive reminders (e. g., with information on {{the negative consequences of}} FTA) were more effective than a simple reminder. FTA varied depending on several offense and offender characteristics, such as geographic location (urban vs. rural), type of offense, and number of offenses. The reminders were somewhat more effective for Whites and Hispanics than for Blacks.

We used a population-based survey using a mailed questionnaire on a random sample of 2600 individuals aged 38 - 77 years. After two <b>written</b> <b>reminders,</b> the response rate was 86 %. The prevalence of reported hip disorders was 32 % and increased with age from 18 % among males 38 - 47 years to 42 % among females 48 - 67 years.

Background: A fragility fracture is a sentinel event in osteoporosis and should prompt a family physician to investigate. However, previous research has shown that in both Canada and the United States investigation rates following a fragility fracture are generally 20 % or less. A study was conducted to investigate potential physician barriers to osteoporosis management following a fragility fracture in British Columbia. Methods: A questionnaire concerning the management of osteoporosis following a fragility fracture was sent to 517 family physicians and orthopaedic surgeons in Prince George, BC, and Victoria, BC. Results: A total of 144 questionnaires were returned, for a response rate of 29 %. Respondents consistently reported that osteoporosis should be managed by family physicians. Physicians did not report a lack of knowledge about osteoporosis investigation following a fragility fracture. Conclusions: Given the demonstrated gap between recommendations and service delivery, a change in practice patterns is needed by all health professionals to improve secondary prevention of osteoporosis. Patients with fractures might be referred for densitometry on admission to the emergency department, and might also be offered information on supplements (calcium and vitamin D) and exercises for bone health.

The hypotheses to be tested were that adult patients with ASD have a higher caries prevalence, have more risk factors for caries development, and utilize dental health care {{to a lesser extent}} than people recruited from the normal population. Methods: Forty-seven adults with ASD, (25 men, 22 women, mean age 33 years) and of normal intelligence and 69 age- and sex-matched typical controls completed a dental examination and questionnaires on oral health, dental hygiene, dietary habits and previous contacts with dental care. Results: Except for increased number of buccal gingival recessions, the oral health was comparable in adults with ASD and the control group. The group with ASD had less snacking, but also less frequent brushing of teeth in the mornings. The stimulated saliva secretion was lower in the ASD group, regardless of medication. Frequencies of dental care contacts were equal in both groups. The most common reason for missing a dental appointment was forgetfulness in the ASD group. Conclusions: Adults with ASD exhibited more gingival recessions and considerably lower saliva flow compared to healthy controls. Despite equal caries prevalence, the risk for reduced oral health due to decreased salivary flow should be taken into consideration when planning dental care for patients with ASD. <b>Written</b> <b>reminders</b> of dental appointments and written and verbal report on oral health status and oral hygiene instructions are recommended...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{literacy}} in children aged 11 - 12. The overriding {{purpose is to}} describe the specific competencies that children employ in their daily use of writing. What do they do with writing {{and how do they}} do it? The theoretical framework is primarily the strand of literacy research that belongs to the field of New Literacy Studies, where literacy is understood as socially and contextually related. The study also draws on ethnomethodology {{in the sense that the}} object of study is the daily actions through which we construct our lives and negotiate identities. Two children, a boy and a girl, with different socio-economic backgrounds and family situations were observed at home, in school and during freetime activities for more than a year through an ethnographic research approach. The thesis identifies the different competencies that the children activate. In one case competencies involving oral skills are primarily used as resources in problem solving, while writing and reading are used to solve similar problems as a matter of course in the other case. The thesis also shows that a common use of writing is to regulate and organise everyday and special activities such as planning Christmas gifts and to <b>write</b> <b>reminders</b> that school tasks need to be completed andreported. In terms of materiality, writing is available in more or less conventionalised formats.

The aim of this work was detailed description of claims, then show the control system of the claims of ENVIRO-EKOANALYTIKA and propose improvements to the existing claims management system. The main reasons why claims come into existence are business relations, but they can be caused by provided deposits, loans and bank credits. Claims from business relations are necessary parts of belongings, because every businessman needs goods and services from others. A company can analyse high earnings and profit in accounting but his financial resources can be essentially different. For a company is very important to have a sufficient number of financial resources and to this a company ensures of claims and then restricts entrepreneurial risk. The ensuring of claims means that contractual partner is obliged to realise his account payable. General forms to ensure claims are for example: penal clause, liability, acknowledge a debt, bank quarantee or altitude of debt. We can divide claims in risk claims and abandoned claims. During trading a lot of profits are formed, these profits can be evoked by for example: political or economical events, announcing a financial insolvency or natural catastrophe. Between the most frequent cause of risk claims are mainly the absence of morality in business relations. If the payment of claim is not done until fixed date, the claim gets the bad debt. The only way how to anticipate abandoned claims is, that busines men do not let them come into existence. The proceedings also include claims recovery. The main objective of recovery is to get customers to pay, and as early as possible. Most companies use a standard procedure for recovery, which includes telephone reminders, terminating the supply of credit, <b>written</b> <b>reminders,</b> the transmission of judicial or extrajudicial recovery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Three-quarters of 3 - 6 year-old {{children}} in the U. S. spend time in childcare; many {{spend most of their}} waking hours in these settings. Daily physical activity offers numerous health benefits, but activity levels vary widely across centers. This study was undertaken to explore reasons why physical activity levels may vary. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to summarize an unexpected finding that child-care providers cited was a key barrier to children's physical activity. Methods Nine focus groups with 49 child-care providers (55 % black) from 34 centers (including inner-city, suburban, Head Start and Montessori) were conducted in Cincinnati, OH. Three independent raters analyzed verbatim transcripts for themes. Several techniques were used to increase credibility of findings, including interviews with 13 caregivers. Results Two major themes about clothing were: 1) children's clothing was a barrier to children's physical activity in child-care, and 2) clothing choices were a significant source of conflict between parents and child-care providers. Inappropriate clothing items included: no coat/hat/gloves in the wintertime, flip flops or sandals, dress/expensive clothes, jewelry, and clothes that were either too loose or too tight. Child-care providers explained that unless there were enough extra coats at the center, a single child without a coat could prevent the entire class from going outside. Caregivers suggested several reasons why parents may dress their child inappropriately, including forgetfulness, a rushed morning routine, limited income to buy clothes, a child's preference for a favorite item, and parents not understanding the importance of outdoor play. Several child-care providers favored specific policies prohibiting inappropriate clothing, as many reported limited success with verbal or <b>written</b> <b>reminders</b> to bring appropriate clothing. Conclusion Inappropriate clothing may be an important barrier to children's physical activity in child-care settings, particularly if the clothing of a few children preclude physical activity for the remaining children. Center directors and policy makers should consider devising clear and specific policies for the types of clothing that will be permitted in these settings so that children's active play opportunities are not curtailed. To enhance compliance, parents may need education about the importance and benefits of active play for children's development. </p...|$|R

40|$|The term "handwriting" {{is defined}} as meaning a surface {{consisting}} of artificial graphic marks conveying some message through the mark’s conventional relation to language (Plamondon and Srihari, 2000). Handwriting {{is one of the}} most important ways in which civilized people communicate. It is used both for personal (letters, notes, addresses on envelopes etc), official communications (bank checks, tax form, postal services, admission forms etc) and for communications <b>written</b> to ourselves (<b>reminders,</b> lists, diaries etc). Extensive research has been carried out in terms of technical research papers and reports by various researchers around the globe. Despite, intensive research efforts of decades, still there are no commercial solutions to deal with totally unconstrained cursive handwriting recognition on static surface such as bank checks, postal envelopes and paper-based forms (Gatos et al., 2007) ...|$|R

Despite acceptable knowledge regarding the potential for infection and mechanisms to prevent these infections, this study has found out that health care workers are not as compliant with universal precautions as they need to be. The findings that compliance correlated directly with knowledge, with in-service training and with availability of protective equipment, provide important indications for future interventions. Therefore a regular on job refreshing training program on Universal Precautions, a <b>written</b> guideline and <b>reminder</b> poster on Universal Precautions and personal protective equipment {{need to be made}} available for all health care providers in every department of the hospital for better compliance...|$|R
40|$|Background. The Objective of {{the article}} is a two year {{statistics}} on sentinel events in hospitals. Results of a survey on sentinel events and the attitude of hospital leaders and staff are also included. Some recommendations regarding patient safety and the handling of sentinel events are given. Methods. In March 2002 the Ministry of Health introduce a voluntary reporting system on sentinel events in Slovenian hospitals. Sentinel events were analyzed according to the place the event, its content, and root causes. To show results of the first year, a conference for hospital directors and medical directors was organized. A survey was conducted among the participants {{with the purpose of}} gathering information about their view on sentinel events. One hundred questionnaires were distributed. Results. Sentinel events. There were 14 reports of sentinel events in the first year and 7 in the second. In 4 cases reports were received only after <b>written</b> <b>reminders</b> were sent to the responsible persons, in one case no reports were obtained. There were 14 deaths, 5 of these were in-hospital suicides, 6 were due to an adverse event, 3 were unexplained. Events not leading to death were a suicide attempt, a wrong side surgery, a paraplegia after spinal anaesthesia, a fall with a femoral neck fracture, a damage of the spleen in the event of pleural space drainage, inadvertent embolization with absolute alcohol into a femoral artery and a physical attack on a physician by a patient. Analysis of root causes of sentinel events showed that in most cases processes were inadequate. Survey. One quarter of those surveyed did not know about the sentinel events reporting system. 16 % were having actual problems when reporting events and 47 % beleived that there was an attempt to blame individuals. Obstacles in reporting events openly were fear of consequences, moral shame, fear of public disclosure of names of participants in the event and exposure in mass media. The majority of the surveyed persons agreed to disclosure of the event to a patient but this was the case in {{less than half of the}} occasions. Conclusions. The small number of reports of sentinel events, late or incomplete reporting of conducted analyses of root causes and plans for future prevention of these events and survey data showed the state of culture in the majority of hospitals. Fear of reporting and therefore, hiding of errors or ascribing errors to the »usual« complications of a disease or procedures, the reaction of leadership to quickly find a culprit for the event, disregarding a serious approach to analyze the event and taking measures for their future prevention leads to the culture of silence. Root cause analysis of the events showed that the reason frequently lies in systems and processes and not in individuals. Health care will never be without risks for patients. However, with an open approach without the blaming and shaming of individuals, implementation of reporting the events in hospitals and other health care facilities with clear goals of patient safety, standardization of equipment, materials, and processes and education on patient safety many sentinel events and medical errors could and should be prevented. </p...|$|R
30|$|Although {{they had}} used the KAL we {{introduced}} them to in their own reflections, had seen knowledge in action and discussed it every week, the PSTs seemed to need constant reinforcement of this material. Thus, this unit on spoken language needed {{to be followed by}} literacy units in which the KAL was discussed in the context of teaching children to read, and particularly to <b>write.</b> Without constant <b>reminders</b> of the need to be specific about linguistic elements, the PSTs tended to revert to making very general statements about language or discussing handwriting and spelling. The value of applying the Mode continuum to program design and introducing PSTs to knowledge about spoken language first, is that PSTs can immediately apply this knowledge to their own practice before they embark on the difficult journey of helping children to become literate. It also places spoken language in its rightful place as the foundation of all other learning.|$|R

Brian humors him at first, and eventually reads the play {{after a night of}} drinking and philosophical discussion with aspiring writers, but his confidence is shaken when the play Stewie wrote, entitled An American Marriage, is much better than his. Brian tries to lower Stewie's expectations and attempts to destroy the only copy. But when Stewie finds it buried in the yard, he reveals that he knows Brian's work is inferior because A Passing Fancy was so bad that it was easy for Chris and Peter to follow the plot. Stewie points out to Brian that he has [...] "a voice" [...] when it comes to writing, while Brian doesn't, and all he does is steal ideas from others saying every person who laughs or criticizes his <b>writing</b> is a <b>reminder</b> that he will never be a good writer.
