40|$|Wireless systems <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> {{based on}} the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The {{orthogonal}} frequency division multiplexing <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to split the input signals into number of sub carrier signals. The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing requires an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). The inverse fast Fourier transform <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to produce multiple sub-carriers signal. The FFT/IFFT processor for OFDM applications is described in this paper. The architecture uses single path delay feedback style and it occupies less memory space. The read only memory <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to store the twiddle factors. To eliminate the Read Only Memory (ROM) a ROM-less FFT/IFFT processor is used. The reconfigurable complex multipliers <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to achieve the ROM-less FFT/IFFT processor and the bit parallel multipliers <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used for square root evaluation. The Fused Multiply Add (FMA) operation {{is very important in}} many scientific and engineering fields. The floating point unit increases the performance and accuracy of the floating point. The Fused Multiply and Add unit <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to reduce the latency and power...|$|R
