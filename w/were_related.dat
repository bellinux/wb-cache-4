Less than 24 hours later a 19-year-old man from New Jersey {{was arrested and charged}} with unlawful entry, after he initially tried to enter the White House on foot before returning in a vehicle, which he refused to exit at the checkpoint.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} perceptions of organizational justice and workplace (in) civility in a promotional exam context. Specifically, it was proposed that perceptions of distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice {{and perceptions of}} workplace civility and incivility would <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to performance in a promotional assessment center, self-reported organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), and self-reported burnout. The model indicated that procedural justice <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to exam scores and OCBs. Interpersonal justice <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to OCBs towards the organization. Informational justice <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to OCBs. Workplace civility <b>was</b> <b>related</b> to OCBs and burnout.

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the 19th century most of the European {{settlements}} <b>were</b> <b>related</b> to the fur trade. The largest of these settlements were trading posts established by the North West Company, particularly those at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fond du Lac. Historian Grace Lee Nute has documented over 100 fur trading posts of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these posts were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States by way of the Red River Valley, instead of moving to eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E
5|$|Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for {{the first}} time on 29 October and soon {{introduced}} him to the up-and-coming anatomist Richard Owen, who had the facilities of the Royal College of Surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct ground sloths as well as the Megatherium, a near complete skeleton of the unknown Scelidotherium and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named Toxodon resembling a giant capybara. The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought. These extinct creatures <b>were</b> <b>related</b> to living species in South America.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon {{suggested}} that Sturnus-like species could have arrived in Africa, and {{given rise to}} the wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea) and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings <b>were</b> <b>related</b> to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of Sturnus, rather than the glossy starlings (Lamprotornis) of Africa and the Madagascan starling (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds. A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.|$|E

5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour <b>were</b> <b>related</b> to the primacy {{he gave to}} the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became {{the inspiration for the}} body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{belonged to}} a {{sporting}} family; his grandfather Michael Nash and great-uncle Thomas Nash were leading players for Carlton Football Club in the 1880s, his father Robert captained Collingwood Football Club and coached Footscray Football Club, and played cricket, opening the bowling for Hamilton in a match against the 1920–1921 touring English side, while Robert Junior also became a leading footballer in Tasmania and country Victoria. Nash's mother was an orphan who was probably adopted several times, allowing historians no opportunity to determine any sporting links on {{her side of the}} family. Nash's biographer also claims that former Prime Minister of New Zealand Sir Walter Nash and pianist Eileen Joyce <b>were</b> <b>related</b> to the family.|$|E

5|$|Nicolas Giraud {{was born}} in Greece to French parents; the name by which he is most {{commonly}} known, Nicolo, was {{given to him by}} Byron. Giraud may have been the brother-in-law of Giovanni Battista Lusieri, a Roman painter and broker for Lord Elgin. Demetrius Zograffo, Byron's guide in Greece, informed Byron that the 60-year-old Lusieri was unmarried, and was courting two women, each of whom believed that Lusieri was to marry her. Lusieri certainly had a close relationship with Giraud, so {{it is possible that the}} two <b>were</b> <b>related</b> in another way, perhaps as father and son. Byron met Giraud in Athens in January 1809, and the two were companions until Byron resumed his travels in March.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, a trough of {{low-pressure}} {{was analyzed}} near the Lesser Antilles. The system moved westward into the Caribbean Sea without much organization. On November 7, the low-pressure area moved south of Cuba and became sufficiently organized {{to be considered}} a tropical depression with a pressure of at least 1010 mbar (hPa; 29.83 inHg). The depression moved over Cuba and into the Atlantic, where it dissipated the following day. On November 9, a second system was detected northeast of Bermuda with a pressure of 1005 mbar (hPa; 29.68 inHg), though it remained unclear whether the two systems <b>were</b> <b>related.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the theories <b>were</b> <b>related</b> in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians {{associated}} many gods {{who took}} felid form with the sun, and many lioness deities, like Sekhmet, Menhit, and Tefnut, were equated with the Eye.
