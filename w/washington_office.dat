5|$|The {{university}} historically pioneered {{research and}} training collaborations between academia, industry and government. In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm. In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses. On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration {{with the federal government}} on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940. MIT established a <b>Washington</b> <b>Office</b> in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.|$|E

25|$|Following the 1936 {{elections}} in which FDR {{won by a}} landslide and his party expanded its majorities {{in both houses of}} Congress, the League eliminated its public activities and restricted itself to reviewing legislation and sending its assessments to members of Congress.

25|$|A 1997 report {{prepared}} by Oxfam America and the <b>Washington</b> <b>Office</b> on Latin America, Myths And Facts About The U.S. Embargo On Medicine And Medical Supplies, {{concluded that the}} embargo forced Cuba to use more of its limited resources on medical imports, both because equipment and drugs from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms or from non-U.S.sources tend to be higher priced and because shipping costs are greater. The Democracy Act of 1992 further exacerbated the problems in Cuba's medical system. It prohibited foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations from selling to Cuba, thus further limiting Cuba's access to medicine and equipment, and raising prices. In addition, the act forbids ships that dock in Cuban ports from docking in U.S. ports for six months. This drastically restricts shipping, and increases shipping costs some 30%.|$|E

At the trial the manager testified that the controlling Federal agency had given him full authority to regulate the conduct of those living in the village, and that he did not allow preaching by ministers of any denomination without a permit issued by him in his discretion.
