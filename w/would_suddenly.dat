5|$|Unlike Schaefer, {{many members}} of RKO's board of {{governors}} did not like Welles or the control that his contract gave him. However such board members as Nelson Rockefeller and NBC chief David Sarnoff were sympathetic to Welles. Throughout production Welles had problems with these executives not respecting his contract's stipulation of non-interference and several spies arrived on set to report what they saw to the executives. When the executives would sometimes arrive on set unannounced the entire cast and crew <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> start playing softball until they left. Before official shooting began the executives intercepted all copies of the script and delayed their delivery to Welles. They had one copy sent to their office in New York, resulting in it being leaked to press.|$|E
5|$|At {{the village}} of Kusić in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was {{regarded}} to be alovit; the villagers talked {{that he had a}} tail. Whenever a thunderstorm came, his appearance changed—he fought with an ala. If the ala was overwhelming him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, and if he was overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a tale in the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of a thunderstorm, before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At {{the village of}} Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four nipples. At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn clothes. As held in the central Serbian region of Gruža, men could become dragonlike. As such, they <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the dark clouds to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot-tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically crippled by an ala.|$|E
25|$|Dreams {{allow the}} {{repressed}} {{parts of the}} mind to be satisfied through fantasy while keeping the conscious mind from thoughts that <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> cause one to awaken from shock.|$|E
60|$|Out of such private contemplations he <b>would</b> descend <b>suddenly</b> upon me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you read}} Browning, Mr MacArthur?' she <b>would</b> say <b>suddenly,</b> having {{apparently}} waited carefully until {{she saw that}} his mouth was full.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>would</b> you <b>suddenly</b> be blasted [...] By the keen wind of one dark thought, [...] One nameless woe, {{that had}} outlasted [...] The sudden blow whereby 'twas brought.|$|R
25|$|Noda {{pulled in}} to retire, and Mansell {{eventually}} {{had to come}} in for a new nosecone, ruining his race and denting his reputation. Noda's luck would then get no better at his home race in Japan, where he qualified 23rd, once again only one spot off Comas, although this time he was only 0.013s behind the Frenchman. His experience at Suzuka was obviously paying rich dividends, but when torrential rain drenched the circuit on race day, it <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> be a whole new ball game.|$|E
25|$|Beria's {{decision}} to avoid immediately calling a doctor was tacitly supported (or {{at least not}} opposed) {{by the rest of}} the Politburo, which was rudderless without Stalin's micromanagement and paralyzed by a legitimate fear he <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> recover and wreak violent reprisal on anyone who had dared to act without his orders. Stalin's suspicion of doctors in the wake of the Doctors' Plot was well known. At the time of his stroke, his private physician was already being tortured in the basement of the Lubyanka for suggesting the leader required more bed rest.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile Dilated Cardiomyopathy is a rare, fatal {{condition}} {{caused by}} an autosomal recessive gene. It affects young dogs, who succumb to heart failure before reaching adulthood. As a simple recessive gene, it had been difficult to identify and was particularly heartbreaking as seemingly healthy puppies <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> die, often shortly after joining their adopted families. Since a recessive gene is responsible, that means if {{at least one parent}} is homozygous dominant (that is, it does not carry a copy of the cardio version of the gene), its offspring cannot develop the disease.|$|E
50|$|Samuel married Mary Ann Lewis of New Haven, Connecticut in 1831. They {{would have}} no children. He <b>would</b> die <b>suddenly</b> on February 18, 1845, {{at his home in}} East Hartford.|$|R
50|$|One {{consolation}} {{was that}} Hodge was keeping {{hold of his}} England place that season, winning his 15th cap in a goalless draw against Scotland at Wembley. But then he <b>would</b> be <b>suddenly</b> cast into the international wilderness.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the lone}} host of All Night Nippon, she <b>would</b> often <b>suddenly</b> begin {{speaking}} in an angry sounding tone {{as if she}} had lost her temper. Even her tagline in the show's commercial was her angrily saying, [...] "Do I sound mad?!" ...|$|R
25|$|The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, {{which had}} always {{employed}} 'constitutional' methods, continued to lobby {{during the war}} years, and compromises were worked out between the NUWSS and the coalition government. The Speaker's Conference on electoral reform (1917) represented all the parties in both houses, {{and came to the}} conclusion that women's suffrage was essential. Regarding fears that women <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> move from zero to a majority of the electorate due to the heavy loss of men during the war, the Conference recommended that the age restriction be 21 for men, and 30 for women.|$|E
25|$|Ever since 1971, {{scholars}} {{outside of}} China have been {{skeptical of the}} government's official explanation of the circumstances surrounding Lin's death. Skeptics assert that the official narrative does not sufficiently explain why Lin, one of Mao's closest supporters {{and one of the}} most successful Communist generals, <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> attempt a poorly planned, abortive coup. The government narrative also does not sufficiently explain how and why Lin's plane crashed. Skeptics have claimed that Lin's decision to flee to the Soviet Union was illogical, on the grounds that the United States or Taiwan would have been safer destinations.|$|E
25|$|The Mongols very {{commonly}} {{practiced the}} feigned retreat, {{perhaps the most}} difficult battlefield tactic to execute. This is because a feigned rout amongst untrained troops can often turn into a real rout if an enemy presses into it. Pretending disarray and defeat {{in the heat of}} the battle, the Mongols <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> appear panicked and turn and run, only to pivot when the enemy was drawn out, destroying them at their leisure. As this tactic became better known to the enemy, the Mongols would extend their feigned retreats for days or weeks, to falsely convince the chasers that they were defeated, only to charge back once the enemy again had its guard down or withdrew to join its main formation.|$|E
60|$|Now {{and then}} the river's surface <b>would</b> be <b>suddenly</b> broken ahead of them by a huge crocodile, startled by the {{splashing}} of the oars, or, snorting and blowing, a family of hippos would dive from a sandy bar to the cool, safe depths of the bottom.|$|R
50|$|He died, it <b>would</b> {{seem quite}} <b>suddenly,</b> in 1880. His wife predeceased him by some 17 years, {{and they had}} had no children.|$|R
50|$|In December, 2016, Kagawa was {{admitted}} to hospital for treatment of acute myelomonocytic leukemia. He was transferred {{to a hospital in}} Tokyo for further treatment in January 2017, but his condition <b>would</b> deteriorate <b>suddenly</b> in the evening of April 4. Ryo Kagawa died peacefully in hospital on the morning of April 5, 2017.|$|R
25|$|Falcone {{received}} an effusive congratulatory {{phone call from}} Giulio Andreotti after the narrow escape. Falcone privately thought it odd that Andreotti, who he had never spoken to, <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> contact him, and he mused {{about the significance of}} the incident to a friend. Unknown to Falcone the efforts to kill him were suspended while the Maxi trial verdicts went through the appeals process that had often set convicted Mafia members free. Later investigations into the murders of two police officers, Antonino Agostino and Emanuele Piazza, who worked for the secret service, revealed that they had secretly defused the bombs that had been placed by a Mafia commando aided by other secret service men. Agostino and his wife were killed on 5 August 1989 outside their home, and Piazza on 15 March 1990.|$|E
25|$|Many {{survivors}} found {{a temporary}} haven in the First Precinct station house. After a Brooklyn Eagle reporter found her dazed near the Washington Street entrance, Kate Claxton was taken there. Dressed only in thin theatrical garb, she {{huddled in the}} station house. The enormous disaster would occur to her only in small, incongruous pieces. Sitting quietly in Captain Smith's office, she <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> mourn for some lost article of clothing, her seal skin sacque or jewelry. Later on, the thought that {{she had lost her}} purse and was penniless would haunt her. From time to time people would enter and she would ask them about H. S. Murdoch, the actor who had been on stage with her during her final minutes inside and who had rushed to his dressing room for outerwear. No one had seen him; she would beseech the person to go look for him. Eventually a waterproof cloak was found for her and she was driven to her rooms at Pierrepoint House.|$|E
500|$|In 2011 {{the song}} was paired-up with the poem [...] "Planet Earth" [...] (previously {{released}} on Michael Jackson's This Is It, in 2009) and released as a song in the remix album Immortal. Following a rehearsal of the song {{in preparation for the}} This Is It concerts shortly after midnight on June 25, 2009, Jackson <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> die later that day, making [...] "Earth Song" [...] the final song ever performed by Michael Jackson.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe the}} castle {{dates from the}} fifteenth century," [...] Tommy <b>would</b> then say <b>suddenly,</b> {{though it was not}} of castles he had been talking.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not only}} on that occasion. It {{happened}} at other times. The dog seemed to understand and take a pleasure in it. Sometimes meeting a soldier, walking with his sweetheart, Columbus, from behind my legs, <b>would</b> bark <b>suddenly.</b> Immediately the man would let go the girl and proceed, involuntarily, to perform military tricks.|$|R
60|$|The year {{moved on}} to March; and March, though it blew bitter keen from the North Sea, yet blinked kindly between whiles on the river dell. The mire dried up in the closest covert; life ran in the bare branches, and {{the air of the}} {{afternoon}} <b>would</b> be <b>suddenly</b> sweet with the fragrance of new grass.|$|R
500|$|The game {{received}} a weak reception by reviewers, {{though it was}} better received by Japanese reviewers than by Western ones. A common complaint, especially in the original Xbox 360 release, was of graphical problems including low framerates and [...] "texture pop-in" [...] where higher resolution textures <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> replace lower ones several seconds after a scene had started. Other issues included complaints about the game's storyline and battle system, though these were not as universal. The Last Remnant received praise for its art direction and music.|$|E
500|$|The {{propaganda}} ministry {{was organized}} into seven departments: administration and legal; mass rallies, public health, youth, and race; radio; national and foreign press; films and film censorship; art, music, and theatre; and protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic. Goebbels {{style of leadership}} was tempestuous and unpredictable. He <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public. Goebbels was successful at his job, however; Life wrote in 1938 that [...] "ersonally he likes nobody, is liked by nobody, and runs the most efficient Nazi department." ...|$|E
500|$|In his 2002 book The Godwins, Frank Barlow sympathetically {{examined}} the arguments {{put forward by}} Anscombe and Lundie Barlow. He included a family tree based on their work, showing Godwin's descent from ÆthelredI, {{and at one point}} described Wulfnoth Cild as the son of Æthelmær the Stout. Elsewhere he was more cautious, describing Wulfnoth as the probable son of Æthelmær, and questioning whether a family which had used names for seven generations almost all starting with Æthel- or Ælf- <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> have thrown up a Wulfnoth, particularly as Æthelmær the Stout's known sons continued the tradition. He stated nevertheless that [...] "This pedigree, even if mistaken, is of the right type." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” {{said the}} doctor quietly, {{answering}} the unspoken question. “I never expected it <b>would</b> come so <b>suddenly,</b> or I <b>would</b> have sent for you. Godfrey Palliser passed away ten minutes ago.” ...|$|R
60|$|He {{scribbled}} {{the address}} {{on a sheet of}} paper that he found on the table. Margaret took no notice, but sobbed as though her heart <b>would</b> break. <b>Suddenly,</b> looking up with a start, she saw that he was gone. She had not heard him open the door or close it. She sank down on her knees and prayed desperately, as though some terrible danger threatened her.|$|R
60|$|While resting, she {{gathered}} carefully {{together all the}} scraps of food in the hut, and {{found that there was}} still enough for two good meals; so she ate a small piece of dried fish, and began to wish that Roy <b>would</b> return. <b>Suddenly</b> she was startled by a loud fluttering noise close to the hut, and went out to see what it could be.|$|R
500|$|... "Sexual Healing" [...] is {{the fourteenth}} season {{premiere of the}} American {{animated}} television series South Park, and the 196th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 17, 2010, and on Comedy Central UK on March 19, 2010. The title of the episode {{is derived from the}} song of the same name by soul singer Marvin Gaye. In the episode, the sex scandal of golf pro Tiger Woods has the media and public frantic to determine why rich and successful men <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> crave sex with multiple partners. Meanwhile, schools are screened for the condition and Kyle, Kenny and Butters are diagnosed with sexual addiction.|$|E
500|$|He {{publicly}} supported Sinn Féin and {{the unification}} of Ireland, although in 2005 he suggested to Sinn Féin leaders that it abandon its long-standing policy of not taking seats at Westminster (abstentionism). Sinn Féin in turn argued that {{to do so would}} recognise Britain's claim over Northern Ireland, and the Sinn Féin constitution prevented its elected members from taking their seats in any British-created institution. A supporter of the Scottish Parliament and political devolution, Benn however opposed the Scottish National Party and Scottish independence, saying: [...] "I think nationalism is a mistake. And I am half Scots and feel it would divide me in half with a knife. The thought that my mother <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> be a foreigner would upset me very much." ...|$|E
500|$|Kosterman, who {{has played}} law {{enforcement}} officials before, initially turned down the role. After his agent informed him {{it would be a}} recurring role, and the producers were willing to pay him more than he made on any previous show, Kosterman decided to take the job. To executive producers Mark Verheiden and Greg Beeman, making Ethan the villain in [...] "Suspect" [...] was the ultimate [...] "red herring" [...] for audiences. Sheriff Ethan was originally going to take a nurse hostage, but the ending was rewritten to leave Ethan as more of a sympathetic character. Mitchell prefers the filmed ending, as he could not see any reason why his character <b>would</b> <b>suddenly</b> become evil. The actor believes his character fell into the established theme of [...] "good people being pushed to do the wrong thing by bad people like Lionel Luthor".|$|E
60|$|Checked in this design, I {{could do}} nothing but hand her the papyrus, {{thinking}} to myself that while she read I <b>would</b> arise <b>suddenly</b> and plunge the dagger to her heart. She took it, and {{as she did so}} touched my hand. Then she made pretence to read. But she read no word, for I saw that her eyes were fixed upon me {{over the edge of the}} scroll.|$|R
5000|$|Greg Mitchell, the [...] "gorgeous sandy-coloured labrador", was {{a puppet}} {{dog with a}} {{completely}} naïve understanding of the world. He would often talk about something he had just done, in a high-pitched and rather fey voice. He <b>would,</b> however, <b>suddenly</b> realise that he hadn't thought it through and drop into a guttural Cockney bellow, shouting [...] "my wife's gonna KILL me!!!." [...] Greg would also reappear in The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer.|$|R
6000|$|If when {{sitting at}} his work he forgot her {{for an hour or}} two he reproached himself for it afterwards, and next day he was more careful. [...] "Grizel," [...] he <b>would</b> cry, <b>suddenly</b> flinging down his pen, [...] "you are my wife! Do you hear me, madam? You hear, and yet you can sit there calmly darning socks! Excuse me," [...] he would say to his work, [...] "while I do a dance." ...|$|R
