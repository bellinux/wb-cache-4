Like reading motivation writing {{motivation is}} intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic writing motivation comes from within. It includes one's desire to make archive (documentation), to express emotions (emotional expression), to satisfy creation urge (creativity) and to develop mastery over writing (achievement). Extrinsic writing motivation is for satisfying others. It includes one's desire to write to be loved (affiliation), to be recognized by others (recognition) and to avoid punishment. <b>Writing</b> <b>activity</b> includes memory retrieval, goal setting, planning, problem solving and evaluation.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} {{to try to make the}} experiences and perceptions of librarians concerning their own expertise visible and through that visualise possible competences related to <b>writing</b> <b>activities</b> taking place in public libraries today. The research questions of this thesis are: How do public librarians experience working with <b>writing</b> <b>activities</b> in relation to their expertise as librarians? Which competencies do public librarians perceive as important regarding their labour with <b>writing</b> <b>activities</b> taking place at the library today? Which work related challenges do public librarians experience in relation to <b>writing</b> <b>activities?</b> To answer these questions I have chosen a qualitative perspective. My method consists of six semi-structured interviews with public librarians, who have diverse experiences related to <b>writing</b> <b>activities.</b> The theoretical basis of this study consist of Herlings operational definition of expertise as a concept and it's related cornerstones such as foremost competences. Herlings definition is set in an organizational research tradition and focuses mainly on human resources within that. The findings of this study suggests that public librarians experience a connection between their area of expertise and <b>writing</b> <b>activities.</b> And that their related competences are useful concerning how you talk about texts in a group context. The librarians also suggest that challenges might be to find functioning forms for the activity...|$|R

For this reason, the ability to move beyond memorization and think critically is an essential skill for engineering students. Writing is an effective pedagogic tool for helping undergraduate students to develop such critical thinking skills (Bean, 2011). Moreover, research shows that short <b>writing</b> <b>activities</b> can help engineering students deepen their understanding of complex concepts so that they are prepared to engage more critically with course content (Kågesten & Engelbrecht, 2006; Welch Gradin & Sandell, 2002; Wheeler & McDonald, 2000). Yet despite the proven value of <b>writing</b> <b>activities,</b> they are not commonly used in engineering courses.

Rather than design courses solely focused on writing, we embedded <b>writing</b> <b>activities</b> into two bioscience laboratory courses at third year undergraduate level, where students wrote about their own data. Students completed writing exercises during breaks in experimental procedures and received feedback during the session. These activities focused on data presentation, data analysis and writing results and discussion paragraphs. These exercises provided a model to assist students in writing the remainder of the report. We probed student opinions regarding scientific writing and the exercises by anonymous pre- and post-course surveys using both closed and open questions. Confidence towards scientific writing and performing simple writing tasks significantly improved after experiencing the <b>writing</b> <b>activities</b> in the first course. Students related that undertaking <b>writing</b> <b>activities</b> in more than one class helped to further improve their writing skills. Independent assessors, with no knowledge of when the reports were written, evaluated reports that originated from the same course held in years before and after <b>writing</b> <b>activities</b> were incorporated.

The problem is that to store data reliably for very small bit sizes the magnetic medium must be made of a material with a very high coercivity. At increasing areal densities, the size occupied by one bit is so small, and the coercivity required becomes so high, that the strongest magnetic field able to be created for writing data with current technology is not strong enough to flip the magnetic domain.

To elicit such responses when interrupting their writing suggests that hypergraphia is a compulsive condition, resulting in an obsessive motivation to write. A temporal lobe epilepsy may influence frontotemporal connections in such a way that the drive to write is increased in the frontal lobe, beginning with the prefrontal and premotor cortex planning out what to write, and then leading to the motor cortex (located next to the central fissure) executing the physical movement of writing.|$|E
