5|$|They {{visited the}} Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but {{were unable to}} trace the path they took. Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people. Trying {{to come up with}} an explanation, they <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had {{stumbled}} across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon. During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.|$|E
25|$|The first Super Dollfie was {{designed}} in 1999 by the sculptor Akihiro Enku. Enku sculpted a one-off doll for his wife, 57cm tall, {{in what would}} become the Super Dollfie size and style. An executive director at Volks noticed the doll and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would be made in larger numbers.|$|E
500|$|Petroglyphs often {{depict the}} Marquesan Dog in exaggerated forms. Millerstrom noted that these {{representations}} deviated from the typical {{characteristics of the}} Polynesian dog and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{were meant to be}} realistic. She stated: ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I <b>Wonder</b> <b>If</b> <b>They</b> Ever Think of Me" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{recorded}} by the American country music artist Merle Haggard. It was released in December 1972 as the first single from the album I Love Dixie Blues. [...] "I <b>Wonder</b> <b>If</b> <b>They</b> Ever Think of Me" [...] was Haggard's fourteenth {{number one on the}} U.S. country singles chart. It was number one for a single week and spent a total of thirteen weeks on the chart.|$|R
500|$|Three {{years later}} on the Blond Ambition World Tour, [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was again {{performed}} before the encore. Madonna, her backup singers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory were portrayed as being seduced by three macho guys in leather jackets. The girls asked the guys to [...] "prove their love to them" [...] and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would wear a condom when necessary. After that, they sing the Shep Pettibone extended remix of [...] "Into The Groove". Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition– Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E
500|$|Later that month, {{during his}} fifth combat with American pilots, he shot down two more P-51s before {{being forced to}} bail out, when eight other P-51s ran his Messerschmitt out of fuel. During the intense manoeuvring, Hartmann managed to line {{up one of the}} P-51s at close range, but heard only a [...] "clank" [...] when he fired, as he had run out of ammunition. While he was hanging in his parachute, the P-51s circled above him, and Hartmann <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would take this {{opportunity}} to kill him. One of the P-51Bs flown by Lt. Robert J. Goebel of the 308th Squadron, 31st Fighter Group, broke away and headed straight for him. Goebel was making a camera pass to record the bailout and banked away from him only at the last moment, waving at Hartmann as he went by.|$|E
500|$|Having played Adventure (1976) on Oden {{and finding}} its cave {{exploration}} exciting, they <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{would be able}} to create a similar game in Swedish. As they worked on the game, they grew into different roles: Kimmo mostly came up with [...] "wacky ideas", Johansson was a driven visionary who [...] "made things happen", and Kann fixed things and made sure that everything worked. According to Kimmo and Johansson, they cared about the game's content, not just the technical aspects, and made a game that they found fun themselves. They created two reoccurring characters based on themselves, who appear throughout the game: Kimmo, based on the real Kimmo, and the [...] "cottage council chairman" [...] Thorvald, who represents Johansson. As Kann was interested in language, and had specific ideas of how to spell certain words, they used consistently correct grammar, while consistently using non-standard spelling for words such as [...] "sig" [...] ("oneself") and [...] "dem" [...] ("them"), rendering them as [...] "sej" [...] and [...] "dom".|$|E

500|$|The {{creative}} {{team had}} a number of opportunities to try different music to enhance an episode's storyline. Pyken and Wade-Reed chose and coordinated music on the show when Snow and Febre's scores were not used. In season three's [...] "Slumber", producer Ken Horton <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could get a band to provide music for the entire episode. During a breakfast meeting with the music department of Warner Bros. R.E.M. was suggested, and Pyken and Wade-Reed immediately saw an opportunity to connect the episode's featured band with its story (which revolved around REM sleep). That season, Al Gough wanted to use Johnny Cash's cover of the Nine Inch Nails song [...] "Hurt" [...] for the final scene of [...] "Shattered" [...] (when Lionel Luthor looks at Lex through a one-way mirror at Belle Reve sanitarium) as soon as he read the episode's script. Cash died while Wade-Reed was trying to obtain the rights for the song and his heirs, believing that the song's use in the episode would honor his memory, gave Smallville the rights.|$|E
500|$|Introduced as a Lothario-type character, {{according}} to Anderson, Oliver [...] "had {{a reputation for}} being the hospital bike." [...] His first relationship developed when he attracted the attention of ward sisters Chrissie Williams and Daisha Anderson. Daisha showed less interest in him than Chrissie, of whose attentiveness Anderson said, [...] "I think any hot-blooded male would find that attractive". Oliver appeared to ruin his chances with Daisha when he encouraged a patient to complain about her diagnosis – though Anderson noted, [...] "he does apologise to Daisha, and sweetly gives her a cupcake". This left Chrissie free to pursue Oliver. Before their relationship began, Anderson opined [...] "She's gorgeous, and Oliver would be a fool not to go out with her." [...] He thought that Oliver and Chrissie's [...] "unflappable" [...] natures made them a good fit for one another, though <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were too alike. As an older woman, their relationship was described as a [...] "toyboy storyline" [...] for Chrissie. Hobley admitted to having fun with the storyline due to the real age gap between herself and Anderson. She described Chrissie's feelings for Oliver, stating: [...] "Chrissie is {{having a lot of fun}} with him. But deep down she's really hoping to find true love – she's been quite unlucky so far. She's not getting any younger and she's worried about missing out on kids." [...] Producers Kyle and McHale revealed that the pair could have been a [...] "perfect match", however said the romance would not run smoothly.|$|E
2500|$|One 1990 {{study by}} Laurence Iannaccone found that {{starting}} in 1963, statements from church leaders were highly variable on women's topics. After Ezra Taft Benson's 1987 talk [...] "To The Mothers in Zion" [...] exhorting women to not {{work outside the}} home, many women quit their jobs and some women BYU students <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> should continue their studies. Then-BYU-president Jeffrey R. Holland stated that BYU especially welcomed women, and encouraged personal study and revelation about how to follow church guidelines. The same study found that as the Church affirmed new sex roles, the number of living endowments increased (a sign of committed new membership) {{but the number of}} endowments for the dead decreased (a sign of committed, experienced member activity). It also found the opposite was true; as the Church affirms traditional roles, the number of living endowments increased and the number of endowments for the dead increased.|$|E

2500|$|By September 2010, ClariS {{was signed}} to SME Records, {{much to the}} {{surprise}} of Clara and Alice. Alice would later remark that she had suspicions about it, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were somehow being tricked. ClariS released their major debut single [...] "Irony" [...] on October 20, 2010. Composed by Kz, [...] "Irony" [...] debuted at No. 7 on Oricon's weekly singles chart, and was used as the opening theme of the 2010 anime television series Oreimo. Good Smile Company released a Nendoroid Petit set of ClariS in January 2012 based on the illustrations of Clara and Alice by Hiro Kanzaki for [...] "Irony". ClariS released their second single [...] on February 2, 2011. [...] "Connect" [...] debuted at No. 5 on Oricon's weekly singles chart, and was used as the opening theme of the 2011 anime television series Puella Magi Madoka Magica. [...] "Connect" [...] was later awarded the Gold Disc by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) in January 2012 for having exceeded 100,000 copies shipped in a single year. ClariS contributed the song [...] "True Blue" [...] on the Zone tribute album [...] released on August 10, 2011; [...] "True Blue" [...] is a cover of Zone's 2003 single.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, they {{received}} {{phone calls on}} their dormitory pay phone from record companies seeking out the band and wanting to sign them for an album. The band then decided that they should pursue the avenue of music and move to Nashville, putting their college careers [...] "on hold". Matt Bronleewe decided to continue with school for the time, and was getting married as well, so decided not to move to Nashville with the band. Because the band's sound included an acoustic guitar duo, {{it was necessary to}} find a new member to fill the gaps, and Charlie's best friend from high school decided after much debate to join the band and move to Nashville in August. Matt Odmark had been at the University of Rochester as an English major but enjoyed playing his guitar at small cafe's. His assimilation into the band was difficult due to his lack of involvement in the music industry, but by August the band was very comfortable together while they lived in close quarters in a small two bedroom apartment in Antioch, TN. They also accepted jobs during this time, at places such as pizza shops, mall stores and book warehouses while waiting for the contract, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> ever really would be able to sign with a company.|$|E
2500|$|The MCC {{team were}} the first not to travel to Australia entirely by ship. Instead they flew to Aden and boarded the luxury liner Canberra on its maiden voyage to Australia, which became an 11-day {{cocktail}} party, with Tom Graveney {{in charge of the}} bar and Graveney, Ted Dexter, Ken Barrington, Colin Cowdrey, Ray Illingworth and Fred Trueman forming the Marylebone Calypso Club, much to the amusement of the other passengers. Dexter found that the British Olympic long distance runner Gordon Pirie was on board (the Commonwealth Games were being held in Perth, Western Australia in November 1962) and got him to arrange keep fit classes for the team and runs around the deck in return for a first class berth. Trueman first avoided these by dodging down a corridor as short-cut and when was discovered threatening to throw Pirie overboard. He complained to the assistant-manager Alec Bedser that he had just bowled a thousand overs for Yorkshire, was the best fast-bowler in the world and did not need extra training, Bedser agreed and Trueman was excused. The team also needed to sign autographs for an hour each day, but Trueman's occasionally fell out of a porthole. The Canberra docked at Colombo for a one-day game, where David Sheppard made 73 and Ray Illingworth took 5/59. The Duke of Norfolk joined them here with three of his daughters [...] "You may dance with my daughters. You may take them out and wine them and dine them, but that is all you may do", though Colin Cowdrey later married Lady Anne Elizabeth Fitzalan-Howard. The team arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia on 9 October, where they met Brian Statham, who had flown in the day before. Pirie wrote a press article to the effect that the England team were lazy, unfit and overweight; Dexter wrote an article in response, announcing that he hoped that his team would make 60 runs an hour and bowl 15 overs an hour on the tour, an ambitious target and one that he would fail to meet, though the England run rate of 39 runs per 100 balls was the highest since the war (Australia managed 41 per 100 balls). Dexter donated the fee from his article to a team kitty, to be shared amongst the players. Trueman's inflammatory remarks to The Sydney Morning Herald (he <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> would be playing under Jockey Club rules - referring to the Duke of Norfolk's interest in horse-racing - or going on a Church Mission - because the Reverend David Sheppard was on the tour) went down badly with the MCC. As the most colourful of the England players Trueman was offered eight times his tour fee of £250 to give after-dinner speeches and endorse products. On being told that if he did he would have to give the money to the kitty, he turned down the offer, annoyed by the fact that Susan Dexter was supposedly earning more from her modelling work than any of the cricketers. Though Trueman struck up a friendship with the Duke, Bedser was a stickler for team discipline and Trueman would be docked his £50 good conduct bonus {{at the end of the}} tour.|$|E
