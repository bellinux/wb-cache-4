5|$|According to Susan Brownmiller, mass rape {{during wartime}} {{is not a}} new phenomenon. She argues that what was unique to the Bangladesh Liberation War was that the {{international}} community, for the first time, recognised that systematic rape {{could be used as a}} <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> terrorise the people.|$|E

5|$|Accession to EU {{required}} {{a new law}} compliant with the European Firearms Directive, which was passed in 2002. The law significantly liberalized gun ownership, for example by allowing any legal <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> be owned for self-defense and legalizing semiautomatic firearms which look like automatic, despite introducing more EU required regulation.|$|E
500|$|In 1994 Folkvord criticised the Labour Government for {{exporting}} <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> Turkey, {{which at}} that time was engaged in a civil war against the Kurdish people. He claimed it violated a parliamentary decision made in 1959 which said that the government would not distribute, or export, <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> countries involved in a civil war. Folkvord earned the support of the Socialist Left, the Centre Party and the Christian Democratic Party who all sought <b>to</b> end <b>weapon</b> exports <b>to</b> Turkey. The Conservative Party supported the Labour Party's decision however, with the then party leader Jan Petersen claiming that the Kurdish liberators were [...] "terrorists". According to Arbeiderbladet the Norwegian Government had sold [...] worth of <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> the Turkish Government in 1989 alone. Folkvord sent a letter to Bjørn Tore Godal, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, and asked if the Norwegian Government had gotten the approval of the parliament's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence <b>to</b> sell <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> Turkey. In a 1967 decree it became illegal <b>to</b> sell <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> civil war torned countries, and Folkvord believed that Norway should stopp selling <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> a country which he considered to be embroilled by civil war.|$|R

5|$|The M13 {{served at}} the landing at Anzio with the VI Corps of the Fifth United States Army in January 1944. It {{was used as an}} {{anti-aircraft}} weapon during the initial landing and then later as a ground support <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> repel heavy German panzer attacks on the beachhead. It was replaced three months later by the M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage in April 1944. Only 139 examples were deployed overseas by the U.S. Army.|$|E

5|$|All over Europe, strange {{weather is}} {{provoking}} panic. Many believe the unnatural occurrences are {{the beginning of}} the Apocalypse. Dr. Stephen Strange, the court magician of Queen Elizabeth I, senses that there are unnatural forces at work. He has also been asked to watch over the secret treasure of the Knights Templar which is being brought over from Jerusalem. Elizabeth tells her head of intelligence, Sir Nicholas Fury, to bring the <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> England safely. Fury in turn contracts blind minstrel and agent Matthew Murdoch to rendezvous with the Templar guard somewhere in Europe and secure the weapon. Later that evening, Fury and his assistant Peter Parquagh are attacked by an assassin whom Fury disables and locks in the Tower of London.|$|E
5|$|At Cyber Sunday during DX's {{feud with}} Rated-RKO, special guest referee Eric Bischoff allowed the illegal {{use of a}} <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> give Rated-RKO the win. At Survivor Series, DX got their revenge when their team {{defeated}} Edge and Orton's team in a clean sweep during their five-on-five elimination match. In January 2007, at New Year's Revolution, DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps (similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his other leg) 15 minutes into the match. Surgery was successfully performed on January 9, 2007 by Dr. James Andrews.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|During his quest, the Kid meets {{two more}} survivors: Zulf, an {{ambassador}} from the Ura, underground-dwelling {{people with whom}} Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl {{who was raised in}} Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists ("Mancers") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.|$|E
5|$|During that month, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad {{indicated}} {{his intentions}} {{of going to}} war against Israel. Egypt and Syria agreed to coordinate military action via negotiations, and the respective Ministers of War formulated a common military strategy. Egypt enlisted the political support of several more Arab countries, some producers of oil. Sadat discussed {{the possibility of using}} oil as an economic <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> pressure Western governments into adopting more pro-Arab policies. During the war, oil-producing Arab nations, primarily Libya and Saudi Arabia, initiated an oil embargo, and several sent token forces to the front lines.|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the reasons why {{adolescents}} bring guns to schools. It is argued that the etiology for carrying other <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> school {{is not the same}} as that for carrying a gun to school for protection. Data from a nationally representative sample of school youth were analyzed with an appropriate analytic technique [...] multinomial logistic regression in dealing with nominal dependent variable. The results supported the hypotheses that both correlates and correlational strengths of carrying guns and other <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> school for protection are different. Such factors as others' drug use, gangs at school, skipping school, perception, and age influence the probability of carrying other <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> school, but are not related to carrying a gun to school. The three factors that relate to both carrying a gun and other <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> schools are physical fights, peers' carrying guns, and gender. Their correlational strengths, however, are quite different. ...|$|R

5|$|Following this defeat, Shiva {{abandons}} {{the plan}} of invading Meluha and leave for Pariha with Gopal; they wanted to procure the deadly Brahmastra <b>weapon,</b> <b>to</b> threaten the Meluhans for peace with them. There he meets the chief of Vayuputras, Mithra, who {{turns out to be}} his maternal uncle. Mithra convinces the Vayuputras that Shiva is the real Neelkanth and gives him the Pashupathiastra which acts on a specific target, rather than annihilating everything like the Brahmastra. Meanwhile, Parvateshwar uses decoy ships to give an impression to Kali {{that he was going to}} attack Panchavati. Alarmed, Kali takes the bait and leaves with the finest Naga soldiers in their pursuit. However, she realizes her folly and returns.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the demons}} learn {{of a giant}} {{structure}} {{on one of the}} moons orbiting the planet, Malduke, that was designed to be a space station for residential and military purposes, possessing a powerful weapon that could destroy Filgaia. Inside the demons' newly-arisen tower Ka Dingel that connects with Malduke, Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia confront what remains of their adversaries before reaching the teleportation device to take them to Malduke. Within Malduke's deepest sanctum, they confront Zeikfried, who transforms into a revived Mother. This new being, Motherfried, confronts the heroes with the intent of using Malduke's primary <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> destroy Filgaia, but is defeated.|$|E
5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E

5|$|Note 2. The fencing {{programme}} included six individual {{events and}} four team events, though the team events were {{a different set}} than were held in 2004. The International Fencing Federation's rules call for events not held in the previous Games to receive automatic selection and {{for at least one}} team event in each <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> be held. Voting is conducted to determine the fourth event. In 2004, the three men's team events and the women's épée were held. Thus, in 2008, the women's foil and sabre events and men's épée were automatically selected. Men's sabre was chosen over foil by a 45–20 vote.|$|E
5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties of attacks used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> extend from then retract into his hands, resulting in different visual cues than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some moves are unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder Topaz, an attack stance that allows {{the use of an}} altered set of attacks for a short time, and Void Cannon, which creates a small explosion on the ground at varying distances from Necrid.|$|E
5|$|The game {{world is}} filled with traps, laser defence {{mechanisms}} and security robots, all of which kill the astronaut on contact, resulting {{in the loss of}} one of his five lives. These defences must be shut down with objects obtained from gravity boxes in order to progress, as the player has no <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> directly attack the robots with. The jet pack enables the astronaut to travel more quickly, but has a limited supply of nitro fuel. Should this fuel run out then the astronaut will lose a life. The spaceship contains points at which the jet pack can be refuelled, though these can be difficult to locate.|$|E
