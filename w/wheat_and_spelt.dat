This study assesses the efficiency of a specific breeding program dedicated to improve yield and quality in emmer <b>and</b> <b>spelt</b> <b>wheat</b> in low-input environments. Ten tetraploid (emmer <b>and</b> durum <b>wheat)</b> <b>and</b> four hexaploid (<b>spelt</b> <b>and</b> bread <b>wheat)</b> wheat genotypes (including parent cultivars and offspring breeding lines selected for adaptation to low-input conditions) were investigated for 1 yr (2003 - 2004) in Italy in three locations in conventional and low-input {{cropping systems}}.

40|$|Wheat was domesticated about 10, 000 {{years ago}} and has since spread {{worldwide}} {{to become one of the}} major crops. Its adaptability to diverse environments and end uses is surprising given the diversity bottlenecks expected from recent domestication and polyploid speciation events. Wheat compensates for these bottlenecks by capturing part of the genetic diversity of its progenitors and by generating new diversity at a relatively fast pace. Frequent gene deletions and disruptions generated by a fast replacement rate of repetitive sequences are buffered by the polyploid nature of wheat, resulting in subtle dosage effects on which selection can operate. With 620 million tons produced annu-ally worldwide, wheat provides aboutone-fifth of the calories consumed by humans (1).

40|$|Genebanks play {{a pivotal}} role in {{preserving}} the genetic diversity present among old landraces and wild progenitors of modern crops and they represent sources of agriculturally important genes that were lost during domestication and in modern breeding. However, undesirable genes that negatively affect crop performance are often co-introduced when landraces and wild crop progenitors are crossed with elite cultivars, which often limit the use of genebank material in modern breeding programs. A detailed genetic characterization is an important prerequisite to solve this problem and to make genebank material more accessible to breeding. Here, we genotyped 502 bread <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> 293 <b>spelt</b> accessions held in the Swiss National Genebank using a 15 K wheat SNP array.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of sprouts {{and young}} plantlets in human {{nutrition}} is increasing {{because they often}} contain phytochemicals and other high value nutrients. This {{is also the case}} for wheat, although there is no literature for hulled wheat species. Thus we determined total polyphenols, phenolic acids (PAs), fibre and minerals in grains, 5 -day-old sprouts and 12 -day-old wheatgrass of einkorn (cv. Monlis), emmer (cvs Augeo, Rosso Rubino, Zefiro), spelt (cvs Pietro, Giuseppe), durum wheat (cv. Creso) and soft wheat (cv. Orso). RESULTS: Grains of einkorn and emmer contained twice bound PAs as compared to soft and durum <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>spelt,</b> with p-coumaric acid accounting for about 50 % of total bound PAs. In wheatgrass, differences between species for bound PAs decreased due to a decrease in einkorn and emmer and an increase in soft and durum wheat. In all species, total phenols and free PAs increased passing from grains to sprouts and wheatgrass. Neutral and acid detergent fibre content increased with sprouting only in einkorn and emmer. CONCLUSION: Our evidence suggests that the grains of einkorn and emmer and the sprouts and wheatgrass of all Triticum species might potentially be valuable for the development of functional foods...|$|E

The sensitivity profiles of these strains towards azoxystrobin (Amistar®, Syngenta Agro GmbH, Germany) and against epoxiconazole (Opus®, BASF Belgium NV/S A, Brussels, Belgium) were assessed in microplates, allowing to test 10 different concentrations for each active substance (0, 0. 00316, 0. 01, 0. 0316, 0. 1, 0. 316, 1, 3. 16, 10 and 31. 6 μg/mL). 100 μ g/mL of salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) was also {{added to the}} medium, {{in order to prevent}} the strains from using alternative respiration. Results of the sensitivity tests for azoxystrobin showed a dose-dependent decrease of in vitro growth for all the strains. During both years, strains could be divided into two distinct sub-populations in relation to their azoxystrobin sensitivity, thus forming a bimodal distribution commonly reported to be associated with a single gene-mediated resistance. For wheat, the dominant sub-population was the one showing full resistance to azoxystrobin. The results of the sensitivity tests to epoxiconazole in liquid media showed a dose-dependent decrease of fungal growth for all the strains tested. The EC 50 values followed an unimodal distribution. When the sensitivity distribution of the strains collected in 2008 (n= 379) was compared to that observed in 2007, although the populations have remained unimodal, a minor shift towards less sensitive populations was observed.

To indicate the species present in each hybridized sample, annotation information for the 2, 269 oligonucleotides on the microarray was used. The overall hybridization data revealed that after a transition phase of 5 days, in which atypical sourdough LAB species, including Enterococcus species, were found, a stabilized ecosystem was established with Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum as the dominating LAB species. Compared with the combined outcome of culture-dependent and culture-independent identification techniques, the microarray data revealed a functional role for Lactococcus lactis in the early stage ecosystem and the dominance of Pediococcus pentosaceus in most of the fermentations, besides L. plantarum and L. fermentum.

40|$|Celiac {{disease is}} an {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} small intestine in genetically susceptible individuals caused by ingestion of wheat gluten and corresponding proteins from barley and rye. Cereal storage proteins (prolamins) are responsible for immunological response of patients with celiac disease. Prolamins are alcohol soluble fractions, namely gliadins (wheat), hordeins (barley) and secalins (rye). The main triggering factor is wheat fraction with low molecular weight (20 - 30 kDa) called α-gliadins. Immunochemical detection of celiac active proteins is based on reactivity of gluten-detecting antibodies with prolamins extracted from cereals. In our study, we used Western blot analysis for detection of prolamin complex in cereal grains and processed foods (breads).

40|$|Conservation tillage {{could provide}} {{environmental}} benefits to organic farming. However, potential weed problems often tend to discourage farmers from adopting it. The effects of tillage (reduced vs. conventional), fertilisation (slurry vs. manure compost) {{and the application}} of biodynamic preparations (with and without) on crop yield and on weed cover, diversity and biological attributes were investigated in a cropping sequence of wheat, sunflower and spelt. Total weed cover and perennial cover in reduced tillage treatments were two to three times greater than in conventional treatments. Monocotyledon cover in reduced tillage was three times that in conventional tillage in spelt, whereas the dicotyledon Stellaria media dominated in sunflower. Weed diversity was similar across treatments, regardless of cereal crop, whereas lower diversity values were observed with reduced tillage in sunflower, because of the dominance of S. media. There was virtually no effect of fertilisation and biodynamic preparations on weed parameters. Although <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>spelt</b> yield decreased in reduced tillage plots (14 % and 8 % respectively), the sunflower grain yield was unaffected. Reduced tillage could thus be useful in organic cropping systems but would require proper management of perennial and monocotyledonous weeds, which are often problematic for annual crops...|$|E

Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the appetite ratings and postprandial glucose, insulin, and gastrointestinal hormone responses related to hunger and satiety after the intake of a cereal-based bread. Methods: A randomized, controlled crossover trial was conducted in 30 healthy adults (17 men and 13 women) aged 19 – 32 y with body mass index of 19. 2 – 28. 5. Each volunteer consumed the cereal-based bread and the control bread 2 times, with a 1 -wk wash-out period, over a total of 4 sessions. The cereal-based bread contained a variety of cereal flours (<b>wheat,</b> oat, <b>and</b> <b>spelt)</b> <b>and</b> consisted of 22 % dried fruits (figs, apricots, raisins, and prunes). It was also enriched with both fiber (7 % from <b>wheat</b> cross-linked maltodextrins <b>and</b> pea) and protein (10 – 11 % from <b>wheat</b> gluten <b>and</b> hydrolyzed <b>wheat</b> proteins). The control bread consisted of white bread with margarine and jam to control for energy density, fat, and sugar content.
