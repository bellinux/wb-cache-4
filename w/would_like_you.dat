500|$|... "My Love" [...] {{was criticized}} {{for some of the}} lyrics and sounds that were featured. Sanneh {{reported}} that Timberlake [...] "exhales his clumsy pickup lines" [...] with the lyrics [...] "If I told you you were beautiful / Would you date me on the regular?". Murphy contemplated that the song is [...] "ultimately ruined" [...] by a [...] "bizarre Crazy Frog-meets-Laughing-Policeman underlay". Emily Vaughan of North by Northwestern commented that Timberlake claims to have gone around the world twice in [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "Damn Girl" [...] and that he is also [...] "running out of creative ways to say he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> {{to go to bed with}} him". Vaughan, however, was positive towards [...] "My Love", stating that the song, along with [...] "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around", sounded considerably different from the rest of the album.|$|E
500|$|Gandhi's views {{came under}} heavy {{criticism}} in Britain {{when it was}} under attack from Nazi Germany, and later when the Holocaust was revealed. He told the British people in 1940, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them." [...] George Orwell remarked that Gandhi's methods confronted 'an old-fashioned and rather shaky despotism which treated him in a fairly chivalrous way', not a totalitarian Power, 'where political opponents simply disappear.' ...|$|E

500|$|Producers {{used the}} Compact Disc's pregap, so a {{listener}} {{would have to}} actually manually rewind the first track a full nine minutes to hear two additional hidden tracks, [...] "Time Jesum Transeuntum Et Non Riverentum" [...] and a cover of The X-Files theme song, both performed by Nick Cave and Dirty Three. This is hinted at in the album's liner booklet, which notes [...] "Nick Cave and the Dirty Three <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> to know that [...] "0" [...] is also a number". The use of these hidden tracks {{has been described as}} [...] "just the sort of surprise one might have suspected from a show that deals in unexplainable mysteries". Not all CD or DVD players will allow the album to be [...] "rewound" [...] back to these tracks as this violates Red Book standards.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by James Foley, who worked with Madonna in her music video for [...] "Live to Tell", produced by David Naylor and Sharon Oreck, and Michael Ballhaus {{was in charge of}} the photography. The video was shot on location over three days in Staten Island, New York and Manhattan. Staten Island was chosen on Foley's suggestion as it was where he grew up: [...] "We talked about wanting to tap into a working-class environment, because by that time she had done 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virgin' and other stuff that was very glamorous and stylized. She wanted to do something a bit more grounded and 'drama'." [...] Actor Alex McArthur was signed to play Madonna's boyfriend and the father of her child in the video. Madonna had spotted McArthur in a small role as a naive youth in the 1985 film Desert Hearts, and she thought he was a natural to play her mechanic boyfriend. [...] "I was out in the garage working on my Harley," [...] said McArthur, [...] "I answered the phone and a voice said, 'Hi, this is Madonna. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> to be in my next video.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{another popular}} story, the 19th-century monk named Ter Karapet Hovhanesi-Hovakimyan, from a monastery near the village, {{conducted}} burial services at Noraduz; {{in order to}} avoid the two-hour round trip from the cemetery to the monastery he built himself a small cell in Noraduz. When he was 90 years old, he asked his brother monks to bury him alive. His last words were: [...] "I do not fear death. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> to not be afraid also. Never fear anything, but God alone. Let anyone who has fear come to me. Pour water at the burial stone, drink the water, wash your face, chest, arms and legs. Then break the vessel that contained the water. Fear will then abandon you." [...] To this day people come to the monk's grave to perform this ritual, leaving broken pieces of glass scattered all about.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that this not very common scene was a reference to the defeat in 324 by the Emperor Constantine I of his co-emperor Licinius, who was killed in 325 after a period under close guard. [...] Another suggestion is that the colour change from green to red was understood as evoking the ripening of red grapes, so that there was a particular suitability in depicting a scene with the god of wine. [...] The cup may have been intended for use at Bacchic cult celebrations, still very much a feature of Roman religious life around 300. [...] A letter supposedly from the Emperor Hadrian (d. 138) to his brother-in-law Servianus, quoted in a biography in the Historia Augusta, records the gift of two dichroic cups, which the 4th century author had seen: [...] "I have sent you particoloured cups that change colour, presented to me by the priest of a temple. They are specially dedicated to you and my sister. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> to use them at banquets on feast days." ...|$|E
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2003, at the {{suggestion}} of Victor Gao, the Winklevosses and Narendra approached Mark Zuckerberg about joining the HarvardConnection team. The previous HarvardConnection programmers had reportedly made progress on coding front-end pages, the registration system, a database, back-end coding, and a way users could connect with each other, which Gao called a [...] "handshake". In early November, Narendra emailed Zuckerberg saying, “We’re very deep into developing a site which we <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> {{to be a part of}} and ... which we know will make some waves on campus.” Within days, Zuckerberg was talking to the HarvardConnection team and preparing to take over programming duties from Gao. On the evening of November 25, 2003, the Winklevosses and Narendra met with Zuckerberg in the dining hall of Harvard's Kirkland House, where they explained to Zuckerberg the HarvardConnection website, the plan to expand to other schools after launch, the confidential nature of the project, and the importance of getting there first. During the meeting, Zuckerberg allegedly entered into an oral contract with Narendra and the Winklevosses and became a partner in HarvardConnection. He was given the private server location and ...|$|E

[...] Shari Bollers of Afridiziak stated [...] "All the characters were created to enable the audience to warm up to them and to laugh with and at them. With its switching of dual languages of native and English, it was easy to follow. It was a film that included everyone and warmed us with the humour. Whether Nigerian or not you will find this film funny." [...] Caitlin Pearson of The Africa Channel stated: [...] "What makes the plot of Phone Swap engaging are the performances from its all-star cast, and a visual range in its cinematography that allows us to see more of Nigeria than any claustrophobic Nollywood film could ever hope to do. [...] Francis McKay of Flick Hunter gave a 3 out of 4 stars and concluded: [...] "Kunle Afolayan crafted a highly watchable film with a good story and a cast led by two talented actors. The film is a good representation of Nigeria...".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the second}} round of talks, a day before Croitoru's nomination, Băsescu noted: [...] "Some parties have {{proposed}} Klaus Iohannis. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> to know that I have not rejected the possibility for him to become Prime Minister in the condition that my options would be directed towards other [...] solutions. But I have rejected such a proposal because it comes from PSD or another party [...] ", referring to his alleged constraint to consider a proposal of the largest party (PDL), constraint disputed by the other parties. The opposition criticized the President for not designating Iohannis. Social Democrat leader Mircea Geoană accused Băsescu of trying to influence the upcoming presidential elections by having them organised by a sympathetic government. Crin Antonescu, the leader of the National Liberals, vowed his party would derail other nominations but Iohannis'. After the nomination of Croitoru, Antonescu, a candidate in the presidential election, stated that he would nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister if elected President. Three days later, on 18 October Geoană suggested Antonescu was trying to use Iohannis as an [...] "electoral agent" [...] for Antonescu's bid for president. In response, Antonescu told the press that Iohannis [...] "is not the type of person that would let himself being used". Geoană and PSD leadership has held a second meeting with Iohannis in Bucharest in the evening of 18 October. UDMR, which the previous day announced it would also attend, declared in the morning that all their leaders are not in the city. PNL was present at the meeting by lower level representatives, after Antonescu announced in the morning he is on campaign in Cluj-Napoca. On 21 October the Parliament adopted with 252 votes for (of PSD, PNL, UDMR and minorities groups) and 2 against a declaration requesting the President to nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister.|$|E
