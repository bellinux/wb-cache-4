There are a large number of factors that can have an influence on the welding result. These aspects include the arc length, magnitude and pulse frequency of the welding current, welding speed, inert shielding gas, parent material, filler material, weld preparation, and thermal conductivity. Ultimately, a high quality weld is achieved through detailed knowledge of how to precisely adjust all these parameters for each individual welding task.|$|E

The main hollow spindle of the former is positioned horizontally (can also be vertically, if required), located over two tungsten carbide V-bearings and steel ball as end-thrust bearing on a carbide support. This can be rotated about the horizontal axis by a balanced miniature DC motor via a belt-pulley system, reducing the spindle speed to about 3000 rpm (can also be either decreased or increased continuously). This spindle system may also be used as an attachment to any NC table of any type of EDM through its motor housing structure, to receive motions in the horizontal plane. The spindle accomodates micro collets on the free end for holding jobs from 0. 5 to 2 mm diameter. To ensure a compact mono block design with minimal components and low stray capacitance in the system, the entire housing and support structure is of single piece made of ABS plastic.

40|$|This study {{involves}} both {{theoretical and}} experimental thin polymer coating on wire {{as well as}} drawing of wire by hydrodynamic pressure technique. Hydrodynamic pressure technique {{is a relatively new}} and innovative technique for wire drawing and thin polymer coating. The wire submerged in polymer melt inside the pressure unit of different geometry, when pulled developed hydrodynamic pressure in the melt. This pressure is largely responsible for wire drawing or coating. Most of the theoretical works earned out to date on this new process have considered that the viscosity of the polymer remains unchanged dunng the process Change in shear stress was also not accounted for in those studies Also the pressure in the fluid film was considered to be constant across the film thickness. It is felt that any analysis of the process addressing the above shortcoming would give a more thorough understanding of the process. With this aim in view, several numerical and analytical models were developed for the process. These models help to predict the pressure, temperature and deformation profiles for different die geometries. Finite difference and finite element technique were used to obtain the solution. s Theoretical results from these models were compared with previous expenmental and theoretical results. All models predict closer or marginally closer results to the experimental results than the previous. As the wire is first pulled through the polymer melt chamber before the hydrodynamic pressure unit, the first interaction between the wire and the polymer melt plays an important role for subsequent process in the pressure unit. Theoretical study of the effect of the melt chamber condition on the whole process was so far been overlooked. In this project some theoretical models were developed to study the temperature and velocity gradient boundary layer thickness as well as the melting profile of the solid polymer layer within the polymer melt chamber. Finally, most experimental works on the process concentrated on wire or other continuum drawing Works on good thin polymer coating by the process had mixed success. The maximum wire speed attained m these works was 0 6 m/s which is considered to be rather low for industnal scale production. The experimental work in this project was mainly focused to attain at 15 to 20 times higher than the best previous achievement. To this end, the work bench, <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> <b>mechanism,</b> polymer feed system and hydrodynamic pressure units were either modified or designed and manufactured a new.

Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments were conducted with various <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min, and the bead characteristics were evaluated. As shape factors of the weld bead, the bead width, back bead width, and bead cross-section area were measured. According to the weld quality and defined objective functions, the <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed was optimized for various welding speeds. Findings: The <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed that induces the optimum weld quality was found with welding speeds of 0. 5 m/min, 1. 0 m/min, and 1. 5 m/min. The optimum lap welding conditions were then suggested for 1. 6 mm aluminium alloy considering the productivity and quality. Research limitations/implications: The optimization will be extended to various aluminium alloys and the optimized results will be stored in the Al welding database of the intelligent welding power source development. Practical implications: With the increase of the welding speed for aluminium sheet welding, the corresponding <b>wire</b> <b>feed</b> speed should increase as well.
