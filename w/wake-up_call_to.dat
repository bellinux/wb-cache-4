By enhancing a variant of Random Waypoint (RWP) model [1], we propose Mobility Resilient Coverage Control (MRCC) to assure K-coverage in the presence of mobility. Our basic goals are 1) to elaborate the probability of breaking K-coverage with moving-in and moving-out probabilities, and 2) <b>to</b> issue <b>wake-up</b> <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> sleeping sensors to meet user requirement of K-coverage even in the presence of mobility. Furthermore, by separating the mobility behavior into average and individual, the probability of breaking K-coverage can be precisely calculated, hence reducing the number of sensors to be awakened. Our experiments with NS 2 show that MRCC with the individual probability achieves better coverage by 1. 4 % with 22 % fewer numbers of active sensors than that of existing Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP) [2]...|$|R

Fascinated by the character and story, he wanted to make a film grounded in a [...] "relatable" [...] world more reminiscent of a classical drama than a comic-book fantasy. Batman Begins, the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point, premiered in June 2005 to both critical acclaim and commercial success. Starring Christian Bale in the title role, along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson, the film revived the franchise, heralding a trend towards darker films which rebooted (or retold) backstories. It tells the origin story of the character from Bruce Wayne's initial fear of bats, the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight against Ra's al Ghul's plot to destroy Gotham City. Praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance, Kyle Smith of The New York Post called it [...] "a <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> the people who keep giving us cute capers about men in tights. It wipes the smirk {{off the face of the}} superhero movie." [...] Batman Begins was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2005 in the United States and the year's ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards. On the film's 10th anniversary, Forbes published an article describing its influence: [...] "Reboot became part of our modern vocabulary, and superhero origin stories became increasingly en vogue for the genre.

Since then, important steps {{have been taken to}} set rules and ensure their implementation, but financial regulation and supervision do not take place in a vacuum.
