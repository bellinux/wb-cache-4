5|$|Now a Crown property, Dunstaffnage was {{controlled}} {{by a series of}} keepers. James I seized the castle in 1431, following the Battle of Inverlochy, as his enemies were hiding inside. In 1455 James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas stayed at Dunstaffnage, on his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> with John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles. This followed James II's attack on Douglas power, and led to the signing of the Treaty of Westminster-Ardtornish. A later keeper, John Stewart of Lorn, was a rival of Alan MacDougall, and was stabbed by his supporters on his way to his marriage at Dunstaffnage Chapel in 1463, although he survived long enough to make his vows. Although MacDougall took the castle, he was ousted by James III, who granted Dunstaffnage to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll in 1470.|$|E

(1955), Across the Bridge (1957) and Al Capone (1959). After Steiger's performance in The Pawnbroker in 1964, in which he played an embittered Jewish Holocaust survivor working as a pawnbroker in New York City, he portrayed an opportunistic Russian politician in David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965). In the Heat of the Night (1967) won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger, who was lauded for his performance as a Mississippi police chief who learns to respect an African-American officer (Poitier) as they search for a killer. The following year, he played a serial killer of many guises in No <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> <b>Treat</b> a Lady.|$|E

25|$|A {{very large}} {{percentage}} of schizophrenics smoke tobacco {{as a form of}} self-medication. The high rate of tobacco use by the mentally ill is a major factor in their decreased life expectancy, which is about 25 years shorter than the general population. Following the observation that smoking improves condition of people with schizophrenia, in particular working memory deficit, nicotine patches had been proposed as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that a link exists between smoking and mental illness, citing the high incidence of smoking amongst those suffering from schizophrenia and the possibility that smoking may alleviate some of the symptoms of mental illness, but these have not been conclusive. In 2015, a meta-analysis found that smokers were at greater risk of developing psychotic illness.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} years of the 19th century, inner city burial grounds, mostly churchyards, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the dead. In 1837 a {{decision}} was made to lay out a new burial ground in Brompton, London. The moving spirit behind the project was the engineer, Stephen Geary, and it was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the purpose. Securing the land – some 40 acres – from local landowner, Lord Kensington and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge. The cemetery became one of seven large, new cemeteries founded by private companies in the mid-19th century (sometimes called the 'Magnificent Seven') forming a ring around the edge of London.|$|E
25|$|Growing algae as {{a source}} of biofuel has also been shown to have {{numerous}} environmental benefits, and has presented itself as a much more environmentally friendly alternative to current biofuels. For one, it is able to utilize run-off, water contaminated with fertilizers and other nutrients that are a by-product of farming, as its primary source of water and nutrients. Because of this, it prevents this contaminated water from mixing with the lakes and rivers that currently supply our drinking water. In addition to this, the ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates that would normally render the water unsafe actually serve as excellent nutrients for the algae, meaning that fewer resources are needed to grow the algae. Many algae species used in biodiesel production are excellent bio-fixers, meaning they are able to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to use as a form of energy for themselves. Because of this, they have found use in industry as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> flue gases and reduce GHG emissions.|$|E

500|$|These critiques {{were not}} taken seriously by AI researchers, often because they seemed {{so far off}} the point. Problems like intractability and commonsense {{knowledge}} seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference [...] "know how" [...] or [...] "intentionality" [...] made to an actual computer program. Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle [...] "they misunderstand, and should be ignored." [...] Dreyfus, who taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers [...] "dared not be seen having lunch with me." [...] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish.

500|$|By 1805, {{the use of}} rectally applied {{tobacco smoke}} was so {{established}} as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> obstinate constrictions of the alimentary canal that doctors began experimenting with other delivery mechanisms. [...] In one experiment, a decoction of half a drachm of tobacco in four ounces of water {{was used as an}} enema in a patient suffering from general convulsion where there was no expected recovery. The decoction worked as a powerful agent to penetrate and [...] "roused the sensibility" [...] of the patient to end the convulsions, although the decoction resulted in excited sickness, vomiting, and profuse perspiration. [...] Such enemas were often used to treat hernias. [...] A middle-aged man was reported in 1843 to have died following an application, performed to treat a strangulated hernia, and in a similar case in 1847 a woman was given a liquid tobacco enema, supplemented with a chicken broth enema, and pills of opium and calomel (taken orally). [...] The woman later recovered.|$|E

500|$|Jim Shelley of The Daily Mirror {{was also}} {{negative}} about the episode, especially towards Alex Kingston, {{who appeared to}} be acting while [...] "the rest of the cast play their parts perfectly naturally". The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller said that Moffat [...] "delivered a pacy romp" [...] and praised the concept of the Teselecta, but was disappointed with the [...] "wasted opportunity" [...] of the setting. He thought that the setting offered [...] "great dramatic potential" [...] but was [...] "little more than window dressing for the story". He also felt using Hitler as a comic relief [...] "struck a wrong note given the nature of the man and the regime he led" [...] and that it was [...] "an odd <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> such an historically significant character". He was also critical of Moffat's [...] "seeming keenness to kill the regular cast in some way, shape or form".

500|$|In 1968, Steiger {{played a}} serial killer {{opposite}} George Segal in Jack Smight's black comedy thriller No <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> <b>Treat</b> a Lady. During {{the course of the}} film, he adopts various disguises, including those of a priest, a policeman, a plumber, and a hairdresser, to avoid being identified, and to put his victims at ease, before strangling them and painting a pair of lips on their foreheads with garish red lipstick. The film and Steiger's performance were critically acclaimed, with Vincent Canby of The New York Times highlighting Steiger's [...] "beautifully uninhibited performance as a hammy", and a writer for Time Out describing him as [...] "brilliant as a sort of Boston strangler, son of a great actress who has left her boy with a mother fixation". Later in 1968, Steiger played a repressed gay non-commissioned officer opposite John Phillip Law in John Flynn's The Sergeant for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, which earned him the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actor. Despite the award win, film critic Pauline Kael of The New Yorker was particularly critical of the casting of Steiger as a homosexual and felt that he was [...] "totally outside his range", to which Steiger concurred that he was ineffective.|$|E
