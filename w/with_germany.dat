Paris {{fell to the}} Germans on 14 June {{and eight}} days later France signed an {{armistice}} <b>with</b> <b>Germany</b> and was soon divided into German and Italian occupation zones, and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned <b>with</b> <b>Germany.</b> France kept its fleet but the British feared the Germans would seize it, so on 3 July, the British attacked it.|$|E
5|$|Adlertag ("Eagle Day") was {{the first}} day of Unternehmen Adlerangriff ("Operation Eagle Attack"), which was the codename of a {{military}} operation by Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe (German air force) to destroy the British Royal Air Force (RAF).

5|$|Following the British {{declaration}} of war <b>with</b> <b>Germany</b> on 4 August 1914, Speyer resigned as a partner of the Frankfurt branch of the bank. After a Royal Proclamation on 11 September 1914 requiring British subjects to have no links with companies doing business <b>with</b> <b>Germany,</b> Speyer resigned as a partner of the American bank. Nonetheless, suspicions regarding Speyer's German parentage led to a hate campaign against him. Crowds gathered outside his home and jeered visitors. Accusations of his disloyalty and treachery appeared in the Press, and {{he was accused of}} signalling to German submarines from his Norfolk house. Lady Speyer was ostracised from societies and associations of which she had formerly been a member. Speyer was asked to resign from the board of the Poplar Hospital due to threats of substantial reductions in donations if he remained. The couple was asked to remove their children from school as other parents were threatening to remove theirs.|$|E

5|$|Harding made {{it clear}} when he {{appointed}} Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy, a change from Wilson's close management of international affairs. Hughes had to work within some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations, deciding the U.S. would not join even a scaled-down version of the League. With the Treaty of Versailles unratified by the Senate, the U.S. remained technically at war <b>with</b> <b>Germany,</b> Austria, and Hungary. Peacemaking began with the Knox–Porter Resolution, declaring the U.S. at peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles. Treaties <b>with</b> <b>Germany,</b> Austria and Hungary, each containing many of the non-League provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, were ratified in 1921.|$|E

5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral {{for the first three}} years of the war. Tensions <b>with</b> <b>Germany</b> came to a head in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Virginia-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. Starting in September 1918, the ships began to be used as escorts for convoys bringing soldiers to France, though this duty was cut short by the Armistice <b>with</b> <b>Germany</b> signed in November. With the war over, the Virginias were used to ferry American soldiers back from France through mid-1919.|$|E
