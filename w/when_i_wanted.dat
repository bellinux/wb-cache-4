500|$|In 2004, OutKast's {{original}} {{record label}} Arista Records was restructured under the Jive label group. During their hiatus, Big Boi and André 3000 were pressured by Jive {{to produce an}} OutKast album {{instead of focusing on}} their solo work. In July 2009, Big Boi left Jive Records, following creative differences and the label's unwillingness to release and promote his solo album. According to Big Boi, Jive gave him an ultimatum to shop the album elsewhere. In an interview for GQ, he discussed his release from Jive and his discontent with the label for proposing he record a cover of rapper Lil Wayne's [...] "Lollipop", stating [...] "They told me to go in and make my version of Lil Wayne's Lollipop! I love that song... But how you gonna tell me to go bite another MCs style?... That's the highest form of disrespect ever. So that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to get off Jive. And the only honorable thing they've done is allow me to do that". Big Boi expressed that Jive viewed its intended singles as not [...] "radio-friendly" [...] and the album as [...] "a piece of art, and they didn't {{know what to do with}} it".|$|E

Early on during principal photography, Hopkins was intimidated by the amount of dialogue he had to learn, that was being added and changed all the time as he recalled, [...] "There were moments <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to get out, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to just do a nice Knots Landing or something." [...] Sorvino told him that his accent was all wrong. Sorvino claims he told Hopkins that he thought [...] "there was room for improvement" [...] and that {{he would be willing to}} help him. Woods says that Sorvino told Hopkins that he was [...] "doing the whole thing wrong" [...] and that he was an [...] "expert" [...] who could help him. Woods recalls that Sorvino took Hopkins to lunch and then he quit that afternoon. Hopkins told Stone that he wanted to quit the production but the director managed to convince him to stay. According to the actors, this was all good-natured joking. Woods said, [...] "I'd always tell him how great he was in Psycho. I'd call him Lady Perkins all the time instead of Sir Anthony Hopkins." ...|$|E
