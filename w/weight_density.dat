50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} mud properties is the mud <b>weight</b> (<b>density).</b> If the mud weight exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation, the formation may fracture and large quantities of mud are lost to it, in a situation referred to as lost circulation. These cracks can also cause water to seep into the well bore or into a hydrocarbon bearing zone, which would likely impede the ability of the formation to produce oil (or require the separation of large quantities of water).|$|E
50|$|It is {{extremely}} important {{to be able to}} diagnose overpressured units when drilling through them, as the drilling mud <b>weight</b> (<b>density)</b> must be adjusted to compensate. If it is not, there is a risk that the pressure difference down-well will cause a dramatic decompression of the overpressured layer and result in a blowout at the well-head with possibly disastrous consequences. Because overpressured sediments tend to exhibit better porosity than would be predicted from their depth, they often make attractive hydrocarbon reservoirs and are therefore of important economic interest.|$|E

50|$|Locke theorised {{that when}} all {{sensible}} properties were abstracted {{away from an}} object, such as its colour, <b>weight,</b> <b>density</b> or taste, {{there would still be}} something left to which the properties had adhered—something which allowed the object to exist independently of the sensible properties that it manifested in the beholder. Locke saw this ontological ingredient as necessary if one {{is to be able to}} consider objects as existing independently of one's own mind. The material substratum proved a difficult idea for Locke as by its very nature its existence could not be directly proven in the manner endorsed by empiricists (i.e., proof by exhibition in experience). Nevertheless, he believed that the philosophical reasons for it were strong enough for its existence to be considered proved.|$|E

5000|$|Amidst {{the growing}} {{contention}} surrounding {{the validity of}} the ODK hypothesis, a young Southern Rhodesian (now Zimbabwe) researcher, Dr. Charles Kimberlin Brain ("Bob" [...] Brain) became fascinated with Dart's work describing prehistory's [...] "predatory ape-men", and conducted research upon the bone breakage and skeletal element representation patterns expounded in Dart's writings (see above). Brain (1967) examined the remains of goat bones within Hottentot villages in Namibia, finding that the skeletal element representation patterns, which formed the crux of Dart's support for the ODK culture, were more simply explained by the durability and resistance of certain bone elements to soil-chemical weathering and the consumption habits of carnivores. This stimulated Brain's interest in how such patterns within cave systems might be affected by the <b>weight,</b> <b>density,</b> cortical thickness and size of bones in relation to weathering and erosion processes.|$|E
40|$|The major {{ambiguity}} in {{the determination of}} the subsurface structures by the use of downward continuation is due to the existence of multiple interfaces. This is because residual gravity anomalies are the superposition of effects originating from several interfaces from the subsurface at once. The integration of density log helps in the delineation of the multiple interfaces using a <b>weighting</b> <b>density</b> function. Following pre-existing mathematical models, a new formulation for the <b>weighting</b> <b>density</b> function with respect to the wave numbers attenuation, depth and station intervals were established using the concept of equivalent stratum. The logs were stripped into shorter sections at constant intervals so as to generate a density contrast with respect to depth. This is meant to define the various interfaces, the upper and lower depth limits {{and the nature of the}} anomalous mass. From the results obtained, it was observed that the projected residual gravity anomalies showed some increase in amplitude with increase in depth. The weighted density function provided a good estimate of the maximum gravity effect that can be expected from a topographic feature of a given size which lies at a given depth and the fluctuation in the residual gravity anomaly values between negative and positive at intermediate levels showed that the attenuation was minimized. The upper and lower depth limits of the anomalous mass were defined as 2015 m and 2170 m and the density contrast between the upper and lower depth limits suggest that the anomalous mass is gas...|$|R

5000|$|River {{incision}} is {{the narrow}} erosion {{caused by a}} river or stream that is far from its base level. River incision is common after tectonic uplift of the landscape. Incision by multiple rivers result in a dissected landscape, for example a dissected plateau. River Incision is the natural process by which a river cuts downward into its bed, deepening the active channel. Though it is a natural process, it can be accelerated rapidly by human factors including land use changes such as timber harvest, mining, agriculture, and road and dam construction. The rate of incision {{is a function of}} basal shear-stress. Shear stress is increased by factors such as sediment in the water, which increase its density (Lague, et. al. 2005). Shear stress is defined as , where t= Shear Stress (N/m2), g= <b>Weight</b> <b>Density</b> of Water (N/m3, lb/ft [...] ), D = Average water depth (m, ft), and Sw = Water Surface slope (m/m, ft/ft).

50|$|A {{first article}} {{inspection}} (FAI) is a design verification and design history file and a formal method of providing a reported measurement for a given manufacturing process. Both the supplier and purchaser perform the First Article on the ordered product. The evaluation method consists of comparing supplier and purchasers results from measuring the properties and geometry of an initial sample item against given specifications, for example a drawing. Items to be checked by the supplier and purchaser FAI are wide and varied and may include distances between edges, positions of holes, diameters and shapes of holes, <b>weight,</b> <b>density,</b> stiffness, color or surface finish. Despite the name, the inspected article {{may not necessarily be}} the 'first' produced, but a random sample of 3 parts from the first lot provided to the purchaser. First article inspection is typically called for in a purchase order contract between the producer and buyer of some manufactured article, both perform the First Article inspection to ensure that the production process reliably produces what is intended, design verification of the print, and is part of the purchasing, and design control requirements.|$|E

50|$|The Derrickhand or Derrickman {{position}} varies {{greatly from}} one drilling rig to another. He almost always reports {{directly to the}} driller. The name derrickman comes from the position that he normally occupies, {{which is at the}} top of the derrick. From this position he guides the stands of drill pipe, typically 90 feet (27 meters) long, into the fingers at the top of the derrick while tripping (removing the drill string) out of the hole. When tripping into the hole (or Running In) he will pull the pipe out of the fingers and guide it into the elevators suspended from the top drive. Traditionally, the derrickman also works closely with the mud engineer (see drilling fluid) when not tripping pipe since he is not needed in the derrick. In this capacity it is his responsibility for monitoring the pH level, level of Calcium, viscosity and the mud <b>weight</b> (<b>density),</b> adding sacks of chemicals (25-100 lb each) to the mud or oil to maintain the desired properties, and monitor the mud level in the mud pits to aid in the well control.
