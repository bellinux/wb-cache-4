40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} {{database}} of <b>preserving</b> <b>agents</b> for the treatment of farming machinery {{on the basis of a}} comparison to evaluate anticorrosive efficiency of these preservatives in the laboratory and atmospheric tests. Another objective was to determine amounts of individual preservatives required per a square meter and to define costs of their use. In addition to the determination of the protective efficiency of the preservatives, another goal of the work was to demonstrate the influence of environment on the corrosion rate and extent. A database of <b>preserving</b> <b>agents</b> available on the market which are designed for temporary protection of materials, machines and equipment was developed for this dissertation. The database contains 230 preservatives including their name, manufacturer, type, method of application and term of use. The database is available on the attached CD in the file marked as Table of preservatives. Within the framework of the thesis, 12 <b>preserving</b> <b>agents</b> made by eight manufacturers were tested in 6 environments.

That glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic methodologies as opposed to standard passive [...] "tincturing" [...] methodologies that are better suited to alcohol. Glycerol possesses the intrinsic property of not denaturing or rendering a botanical's constituents inert (as alcohols - i.e. ethyl (grain) alcohol, methyl (wood) alcohol, etc., do). Glycerol is a stable <b>preserving</b> <b>agent</b> for botanical extracts that, when utilized in proper concentrations in an extraction solvent base, does not allow inverting or reduction-oxidation of a finished extract's constituents, even over several years. Both glycerol and ethanol are viable <b>preserving</b> <b>agents.</b> Glycerol is bacteriostatic in its action, and ethanol is bactericidal in its action.|$|R
