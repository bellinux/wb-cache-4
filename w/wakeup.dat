ContikiMAC uses Clear Channel Assessments (CCA) for transmitting and receiving packets.

In this paper, {{we argue that}} traditional vision-based techniques for calibrating cameras are not directly suitable for low-power sensors deployed in remote locations. We propose approximate techniques to determine the relative locations and orientations of camera sensors without any use of landmarks or positioning technologies. Our techniques determine the degree and range of overlap for each camera and show this information can be exploited for duty cycling and triggered <b>wakeups.</b> We implement our techniques on a Mote testbed and conduct a detailed experimental evaluation.

This paper argues that road network-aware spatial alarms need to be processed by taking into account spatial constraints on road networks and mobility patterns of mobile subscribers. We show that the Euclidian distance-based spatial alarm processing techniques tend to incur high client energy consumption due to unnecessarily frequent client <b>wakeups.</b> We design and develop a road network-aware spatial alarm processing system, called ROADALARM, with three unique features. First, we introduce {{the concept of}} road network-based spatial alarms using road network distance measures. Instead of using a rectangular region, a road network-aware spatial alarm is a star-like subgraph with an alarm target as the center of the star and border points as the scope of the alarm region. Second, we describe a baseline approach for spatial alarm processing by exploiting two types of filters. We use subscription filter and Euclidean lower bound filter {{to reduce the amount of}} shortest path computations required in both computing alarm hibernation time and performing alarm checks at the server. Last but not the least, we develop a suite of optimization techniques using motion-aware filters, which enable us to further increase the hibernation time of mobile clients and reduce the frequency of <b>wakeups</b> and alarm checks, while ensuring high accuracy of spatial alarm processing. Our experimental results show that the road network-aware spatial alarm processing significantly outperforms existing Euclidean space-based approaches, in terms of both the number of <b>wakeups</b> and the hibernation time at mobile clients and the number of alarm checks at the server.

The HELLO message includes ID, Expected Duty Cycled (EDC) <b>wakeups,</b> and hop distance from the sink. After receiving HELLO messages from the neighbors, the node computes its EDC using Equation 1 and also computes the forwarder set.
