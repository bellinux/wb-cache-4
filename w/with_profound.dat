5|$|The {{political}} scientist Andrew Parkin {{said that one}} of Dunstan's main achievements was to debunk the notion that state governments and parliaments lacked the ability to make significant reforms <b>with</b> <b>profound</b> impacts. He cited Dunstan's sweeping social reforms and the fact that many other state governments followed South Australia's lead as evidence of this.|$|E
5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} {{those that do not}} require an {{external}} tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those <b>with</b> <b>profound</b> disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and dysarthria. The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E
5|$|The Cold War {{split the}} {{temporary}} wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the Soviet Union and the United States as two superpowers <b>with</b> <b>profound</b> {{economic and political}} differences. The USSR was a Marxist–Leninist state led by its Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which in turn was dominated by a leader with different titles over time, and a small committee called the Politburo. The Party controlled the press, the military, the economy and many organizations. It also controlled the other states in the Eastern Bloc, and funded Communist parties around the world, sometimes in competition with Communist China, particularly following the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. In opposition stood the capitalist West, led by the United States, a federal republic with a two-party presidential system. The First World nations of the Western Bloc were generally democratic with a free press and independent organizations, but were economically and politically entwined with a network of banana republics and other authoritarian regimes throughout the Third World, {{most of which were}} the Western Bloc's former colonies. Some major Cold War frontlines such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Congo were still Western colonies in 1947.|$|E

25|$|After the Ba'athists {{took power}} in 1968, Saddam focused on {{attaining}} stability {{in a nation}} riddled <b>with</b> <b>profound</b> tensions. Long before Saddam, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus Shi'ite, Arab versus Kurd, tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant. The desire for stable rule in a country rife with factionalism led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards.|$|E
25|$|In 702, {{with the}} death of Egica, Wittiza as sole king moved his capital to Toledo. In 710, part of the Visigothic {{aristocracy}} violently raised Roderic to the throne, triggering a civil war with the supporters of Wittiza and his sons. In 711, the enemies of Roderic got a Muslim army to cross the Straits of Gibraltar and face him at the Battle of Guadalete. The defeat was the end of Roderic and of the Visigothic rule, <b>with</b> <b>profound</b> consequences for the whole of the Iberian peninsula.|$|E
25|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are in general {{only a few}} nanometers wide. In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for {{a small fraction of}} the material. However, very small grain sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, <b>with</b> <b>profound</b> effects on such properties as diffusion and plasticity. In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an amorphous solid.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} work {{is focused}} on possibilities of a care for children <b>with</b> the <b>profound</b> mental retardation and possibilities of their education in the daily social welfare institution at ARPIDA Centre in České Budějovice. The aim was to chart and evaluate practicable ways of the care, upbringing and education of these children and to judge their effectiveness and meaningfulness. The education of the children <b>with</b> the <b>profound</b> mental retardation is carried out under § 42 of Education Act No. 561 / 2004 of Collection of Laws, which provides that {{the form of the}} education should correspond to psychical and physical possibilities of the children. The education of the children <b>with</b> the <b>profound</b> mental retardation is carried out under an individual educational plan, which takes into account the character and the degree of the disablement of the child and the possibilities of his future development. Specifically provided objectives and methods also {{play an important role in}} the education of the children <b>with</b> the <b>profound</b> mental retardation. An important element in the care for children <b>with</b> the <b>profound</b> mental retardation is a multidisciplinary comprehensive system of rehabilitation using medical, social, pedagogical and working means. It is especially aimed at a mitigation of disability effects, but also at an integration of the disabled person in the society...|$|R

He is particularly known for his stories and essays <b>with</b> <b>profound</b> philosophical content that exposed a vitalism {{that in some way}} anticipated existentialism.

25|$|Upon their {{conquest of}} Iraq, the Arabs {{confirmed}} {{the authority of}} Exilarch Bustanai and the continuation of his governance of the Jewish community. For his services to the caliph during the conquest he received {{the hand of the}} daughter of the former Shah as a wife. The Muslims regarded the office of Exilarch <b>with</b> <b>profound</b> respect because they viewed him as a direct descendant of the prophet David. Under the Abbassids, the Exilarch ruled over more than 90% of the Jewish nation. The subsequent fragmentation of the authority of the Abassids resulted in the waning of the authority of the Exilarch beyond Persia. A struggle for leadership between the Geonim and Exilarchs saw the slow relinquishing of power to the Geonim but remained an office of reverence to which Muslims showed respect.|$|E

The Internet in general and the World Wide Web in particular are important enablers of both formal and informal education.

25|$|Black {{light is}} used {{extensively}} in non-destructive testing. Fluorescing fluids {{are applied to}} metal structures and illuminated with a black light which allows cracks and other weaknesses in the material to be easily detected. It {{is also used to}} illuminate pictures painted with fluorescent colors, particularly on black velvet, which intensifies the illusion of self-illumination. The use of such materials, often in the form of tiles viewed in a sensory room under UV light, is common in the United Kingdom for the education of students <b>with</b> <b>profound</b> and multiple learning difficulties. Such fluorescence from certain textile fibers, especially those bearing optical brightener residues, can also be used for recreational effect, as seen, for example, in the opening credits of the James Bond film A View to a Kill.
