New England had of old times, and has still, perhaps, in her farm-houses, these women who seem from year to year to develop in the spiritual sphere as the bodily form shrinks and fades. While the cheek grows thin and the form spare, the will-power grows daily stronger; though the outer man perish, the inner man is renewed day by day. The worn hand that seems so weak yet holds every thread and controls every movement of the most complex family life, and wonders are daily accomplished by the presence of a woman who seems little more than a spirit. The New England wife-mother was the one little jeweled pivot on which all the <b>wheel</b> <b>work</b> of the family moved.|$|E

Latterly a steam engine was installed to enable the mill to work for longer periods. The mill was demolished in 1858.

30|$|Grinding {{requires}} high {{specific energy}} which develops high temperatures at <b>wheel</b> <b>work</b> piece interface. High temperatures impair work piece quality by inducing tensile residual stress, burn, and micro cracks. Control of grinding temperature {{is achieved by}} providing effective cooling and lubrication. Conventional flood cooling is often ineffective due to enormous heat generation and improper heat dissipation. This paper deals with an investigation on using TRIM E 709 emulsifier with Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles to reduce the heat generated at grinding zone. An experimental setup has been developed for this and detailed comparison has been done with dry, TRIM E 709 emulsifier and TRIM E 709 emulsifier with Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles in grinding EN- 31 steel in terms of temperature distribution and surface finish. Results shows that surface roughness and heat penetration were decreased with addition of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|Grinding {{force has}} a close {{relation}} to grinding inputs such as grinding <b>wheel,</b> <b>work</b> material, interference condition, grinding speed, grinding fluid and machine condition, and therefore varies widely with grinding inputs. On the other hand, grinding force affects significantly grinding outputs which are efficiency and quality evaluated with surface roughness, accuracy, surface integrity and so on. It {{is important to}} make clear the relations between grinding inputs and grinding force {{in order to control}} grinding outputs. In this paper, from the above point of view, the relations between grinding inputs and grinding force are experimentally investigated. It is pointed out that the normal grinding force, the tangential grinding force and its ratio are determined by the product of speed ratio of work speed to wheel speed and setting depth of cut as for interference conditions, and by the product of square of dressing feed and cutting depth of. dresser as for dressing conditions. Furthermore as for characteristics of work materials, the normal grinding force has a close relation to the yield stress, and the force ratio is related to the elongation of work material...|$|E
40|$|Electrification and {{hybridization}} {{constitute an}} expanding paradigm shift in transportation industry towards creation of more efficient alternative propulsion systems. The change {{is driven by}} environmental and market objectives to minimize pollutant emissions and reduce fossil fuel dependence. Nonetheless, the additional complexity of electrified powertrains brings a challenge to derive city and highway fuel consumption estimates. The present work analyzes the role of different driving patterns on energy flow and fuel consumption in a parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) by employing vehicle powertrain simulations. The computational study considers five standard drive cycles representing various traffic conditions and driving styles. The investigation is performed to understand and quantify the effect of drive cycle dynamics on vehicle energy use, fuel consumption, and kinetic energy recuperation through regenerative braking. The results show that a parallel HEV is more efficient in city driving conditions compared to the highway driving. Decreased fuel consumption {{is due to the}} usage of the electric motor, which is more efficient in frequent start-and-stop traffic conditions as the braking energy is recaptured and stored in the battery. The amount of energy recovered by regenerative braking correlates with vehicle inertia <b>wheel</b> <b>work</b> across drive cycles. The internal combustion engine (ICE) is clearly the main parameter affecting vehicle fuel consumption. The impact of the engine operation is characterized by analyzing engine usage duration and engine energy losses. The observations and assessments presented herein are useful inputs for further optimization studies on improving the robustness of optimized vehicle design that is greatly influenced by drive cycle characteristics...|$|E
