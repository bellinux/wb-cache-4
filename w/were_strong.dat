5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than swords, swords <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than axes, and axes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than lances. In magic, fire <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than wind, wind <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than thunder, and thunder <b>is</b> <b>stronger</b> than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than axes and bows, axes and bows <b>were</b> <b>stronger</b> than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken <b>are</b> <b>stronger</b> than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|R

The Signoria send off two thousand soldiers with munitions and provisions to the threatened area. Although Split and Zadar <b>were</b> <b>strong</b> fortresses, they were clearly in danger.|$|E

5|$|After moving inland, the storm's northwestward track {{brought it}} over the Louisiana border on two {{separate}} occasions, first reaching Washington Parish as a minimal hurricane. Winds there <b>were</b> <b>strong</b> enough to bring down hundreds of trees, damaging houses and knocking out power to over 15,000 customers in the process. The hurricane also overturned mobile homes and strewn debris throughout communities such as Bogalusa and Franklinton in Washington Parish, the hardest-hit area in the state. Downed trees caused damage to 200 homes and another 200 businesses, chiefly near Bogalusa.|$|E

5|$|Offshore, a ship called Southern Isle was wrecked by {{the high}} surf.

By October 5, winds <b>were</b> <b>strong</b> and the seas were moderately rough. Very quickly, the ship broke into two, which prevented any time to escape on lifeboats.

5|$|Outside of Nova Scotia, {{the winds}} from Carol <b>were</b> <b>strong</b> enough {{to knock down}} trees and power lines in New Brunswick. Light rainfall, peaking at 2.44inches (62mm) in the province, caused street {{flooding}} in Moncton. The rainfall reached as far west as Ontario, and as far east as Prince Edward Island, where rainfall reached 1.73inches (44mm). Winds in the latter province damaged roofs and downed some trees, resulting in minor power outages. Further north in Quebec, adverse conditions from the storm delayed a search party after a plane crash.|$|E

Five Spitfires and a Mosquito were lost on PR operations in December 1941. The failure to photograph and pin-point {{the location of the}} ships, led to their successful move to Germany in February 1942.
