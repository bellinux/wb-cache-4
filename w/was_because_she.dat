5|$|Bai Ling filmed minor scenes for {{the film}} playing a senator, but her role was cut during editing. She claimed this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> posed for the June 2005 issue of Playboy, whose {{appearance}} on newsstands coincided with the film's May release. Lucas denied this, stating that the cut had been made {{more than a year}} earlier, and that he had cut his own daughter's scenes as well.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich der Grosse {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel; her keel was laid in 1871 under {{construction}} number 1. The ship was launched on 20 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 22 November 1877. Although laid down a year before her sister , Friedrich der Grosse was not completed until a year after; this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was built at a newly established and inexperienced Imperial Dockyard, while Preussen was built by AG Vulcan, an experienced private shipbuilder. The ship cost the German government 7,303,000gold marks.|$|E
5|$|Imelda {{knew that}} her husband Ferdinand Marcos had dreamed of {{becoming}} {{the president of the}} Philippines ever since he was a congressman. One reason why Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was a Romualdez—an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos believed she would not only add light to his daily life but also to his political career.|$|E

[...] Squerciati liked that Burgess was not the perfect officer and made mistakes, as she found it very relatable.|$|R

5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> {{did not know}} exactly what he would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E
5|$|After {{a medical}} exam, Mulder {{finds out that}} Orison has three times the bloodflow {{capacity}} of the brain due to a hole in he has drilled into his own head, allowing him to perform mental tricks by hypnotizing people. Orison hypnotizes the security guard in his room and easily escapes. Meanwhile, at Orison's apartment, a prostitute escapes when Pfaster attacks her for wearing a wig. Orison then finds Pfaster and takes him at gunpoint. In the woods, Orison digs a grave for Pfaster, who morphs into a demonic beast and kills him, burying him in his own shallow grave. Pfaster then calls the police, telling them where Orison is buried, and goes to Scully's house. He attacks Scully, who tells him {{that the only reason}} he was not given the death penalty <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> asked the judge for life. He overpowers her and locks her in her own closet. Mulder thinks something may be wrong when he hears the same song on his radio and calls Scully. After receiving no answer, he goes over to her house and stumbles upon Pfaster, promptly arresting him. Meanwhile, Scully escapes from the closet and shoots Pfaster, despite him being unarmed, killing him. Scully later confides in Mulder, telling him she's scared because she's not sure who's in control of her, God or something else.|$|E

5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Edward was an eighteen-year-old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a flying squirrel. Edward's prototype {{had an average}} height, but retained his automail. In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine Monthly Shonen Gangan, Edward's traits were further modified, leaving his current one. His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse's huge armor. In {{the design of the}} character, Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward's muscles, making his appearance unsuitable for his age. She has also often drawn the character in full body length, but at one point noticed she made it too tall. As the manga continued serialization, Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than Alex Louis Armstrong who tends to show his torso. While stating that this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> wanted to draw Edward's automail, she commented that it was common for men to walk in underwear at their homes.|$|E

25|$|Historians have {{commented on}} her {{reluctance}} {{to write about}} slavery. Perhaps it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had conflicting feelings about the institution.

25|$|White {{was paid}} $122,536 in 2001. Exactly when White took {{a pay cut}} is unclear, how her pay was cut, and why, is unclear. By one report, she {{received}} an $11,000 pay cut shortly before she left. Another report said that her salary decreased in February 2002, but also quoted a spokesman {{as saying that the}} main difference in pay between the years <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> got a bonus in 2001 but not 2002.|$|E
25|$|Although Tamm {{had left}} the show on {{relatively}} good terms and was willing to film a regeneration sequence {{for the start of}} Season 17, she was not invited to do so. It has frequently been mentioned that the real reason Tamm left the show after one year, was that she was pregnant. This is untrue, as often stated by Tamm herself over the years. The revelation is a myth that was started by former producer John Nathan-Turner. Various sources, including some online sites, mention that the reason she couldn't film a regeneration sequence, <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was pregnant.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the same}} time it was noted that Genie took {{pleasure}} in intentionally dropping or destroying small objects, and enjoyed watching someone else do the same to something she had been playing with. Kent wrote that she did the same series of actions several times over and that it appeared to ease some internal tension for her, and therefore thought she did this to gain control of traumatic childhood experiences. She also showed deep fascination with classical piano music played in front of her, which researchers believed <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> could hear some piano music during her childhood. She did not have the same reaction to recordings, and if someone played anything other than classical music she would change the sheet music to a book which she knew had pieces she liked.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 1993, drug {{trafficking}} charges against Ovidio and Ponce Torres were {{dropped in the}} U.S without a stated reason. On May 3, 1994, Aldrete was sentenced to 62 years in prison. Cult members Elio, Serafín Jr., Martínez Salinas, and Serna Valdez, received 67 years each. In {{an interview with the}} press, Kilroy's parents stated that they were relieved to hear that the cultists were sentenced. The charges were multiple homicide (31 years), possession of narcotics (12 years), involvement in organized crime (5 years), police impersonation (2 years), illegal body desecration (2 years), illegal possession of firearms (10 years), and illegal possession of weapons exclusive to the Mexican Armed Forces (5 years). The Mexican federal judge explained that the reason Aldrete received fewer years in prison than the rest <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was not charged with using weapons that were military-exclusive, which carries a 5-year maximum sentence. He also stated that the maximum conviction a person in Mexico can receive for capital murder is 50 years. Since Mexico's judicial system does not have parole, it allows for prisoners to file motions at an appeal court to reduce their sentences after several years. If this condition is denied or granted, inmates can then push for a writ of amparo.|$|E
25|$|Back in {{the present}} time, Jean is being helped by the nurse Marjorie on trying to recall her name. Marjorie starts {{speaking}} name after name and would not stop even though Jean asked her to. Jean became confused and not realizing what she was doing, lost control of her telekinetic powers. This caught Emma Frost's attention when it registered on Cerebro and went {{to pick her up}} with Cyclops. Meanwhile, Jean is being chased by the MRD in the hospital and, once cornered, ratted out by Marjorie, she unintentionally manifested her enormously powerful Phoenix abilities in the heat of her fear and hopelessness, which caused an intense psionic wave that affected almost the entire city. Archangel, under Mr. Sinister's command, went to capture Jean but Cyclops and Emma intervened. They soon discovered that the reason why Jean was not in mental contact with Scott <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had no memory of Scott. Archangel pursued them as they tried to get Jean home, Cyclops desperately fought him, but in the end both he and Jean were captured so that Sinister could take samples of their DNA for his experiments. The X-Men came to rescue them and fought the Marauders, but just as Archangel is about to kill Cyclops, Jean manifests her immensely powerful Phoenix Force abilities and defeats him. Scott was able to calm her down and take her to the Institute for rest and promised her that she would regain her memories in conjunction with Emma's help. Everyone at the institute then became unconscious, except Emma, an undercover agent of the Hellfire Club who now had Jean, and therefore the Phoenix Force itself, in their hands.|$|E
