500|$|Most reviewers {{noted the}} game's {{graphical}} improvement from its predecessors, with the minigames' visual style in particular receiving praise. Although IGN remarked {{that the game}} was graphically a [...] "huge improvement since <b>we</b> <b>last</b> saw the franchise", they proceeded to comment that [...] "It's a mixed bag of good and bad". GameSpot complained that the character animations appear [...] "a bit lifeless" [...] and that the boards were not aesthetically pleasing.

He's a more thoughtful person than he was when <b>we</b> <b>last</b> saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E

A spokesperson for the show said [...] "It's a great comeback for her. She proved really popular with viewers and producers soon realised they should get her back for more." [...] Santer's successor, Bryan Kirkwood told Digital Spy, [...] "When Sam Mitchell is in Albert Square, trouble is never far behind. <b>We</b> <b>last</b> saw her heading for a stretch in prison and ostracised by her family.

2500|$|After {{a series}} of adventures with Generation X, Howard gets {{a job as a}} {{department}} store Santa Claus, which gets him dragged to the North Pole, where the real Santa Claus has sold out to Hydra. [...] Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially Ward and June Cleaver, he has a sister named Princess, and he is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld's version of Reed Richards. [...] This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin's mind, though through the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly. When Franklin understands that he has shaped all these worlds, they find themselves back in Man-Thing's swamp. [...] While Man-Thing became a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard went off on his own and was captured by the Cult of Entropy, who wrapped him in swaddling clothes. [...] Although <b>we</b> <b>last</b> saw him in the swamp, he states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. [...] The cult wants him because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during Heroes Reborn, inside him, which he knows because it is making him nauseous. [...] Man-Thing enters his gullet, and Howard vomits him back out with the fragment, but the former is left desiccated and practically dead. He then encountered Namor, who thought he had slain the creature, but Howard explains {{that he would not be}} lugging his friend's body if that were the case. [...] Howard sets Man-Thing down in the water, and he revives during the conversation with Namor. [...] Once he sees that Man-Thing is alive and well, he bids Namor farewell and says he is returning to Cleveland.|$|E
