40|$|Debris {{flows in}} slopes {{initially}} dry, such as post-wildfire debris flows, are initiated by surface runoff and sediment bulking due to reduced infiltration. Soil water repellency, extreme dry soils, and loose, cohesionless materials influence their initiation. The exact link between these features, the resulting infiltration processes and the initiation mechanism of a debris flow remains unclear. Here, {{we examine the}} relation between soil particle wettability and slope processes in physical models. Flume experiments were conducted in 10 % increments of mass ratios of wettable to <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> sand, subjected to artificial rainfall with monitoring of soil water content, pore water pressure, sediment and water discharge and failure mode. To date, wettability was considered only for the <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> end, because it reduces infiltration, enhancing surface runoff. This study demonstrates that slight wettability changes, in the full wettable to <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> range, impact a variety of slope processes. The two extremes, fully wettable and <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> gave opposite responses, retrogressive slides for infiltration-initiated in wettable sand and erosion by surface runoff in <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> sand. The transition was dominated by surface runoff and preferential flow, yielding a combination of erosion and slides. From the tests, a continuous capping effect generated by water repellency was {{a necessary condition for}} erosion and sand bulking i. e., the generation of runoff-initiated debris flows. The sensitivity of the model slope response to artificial rainfall was particularly acute at high ratios of wettable to <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> sand. For mixtures above a critical ratio of wettable to <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> sand, the measurements with an index test revealed a fully wettable material despite differences in the infiltration, saturation and pore water pressure built-up trends.

In addition, integral <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> concrete was produced by adding 2 % silane emulsion. Then, the specimens were exposed to accelerated carbonation for 7, 28, and 72 days.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>repellent</b> agents, today mainly {{consisting}} of alkylalkoxysilanes, {{are often used}} on concrete to prolong the service life of the structure. This is accomplished by protecting the reinforcement bars from chlorides or by changing the moisture content inside. When the concrete is treated with a <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> agent {{the properties of the}} surface layer turn from hydrophilic to hydrophobic and thereby water droplets are stopped from entering, still allowing water vapour to pass through. This property change can reduce chloride ingression and stop heavy rain from penetrating through the surface layer. This thesis presents results concerning how the moisture transport and fixation in the surface layer of the concrete is affected by a <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> treatment. It also presents an investigation in which the effective penetration depth and the factors that influence it are studied. The methods used covers uni-dimensional transport of moisture using the so called cup method, measurements on moisture fixation using climate boxes with saturated salt solutions, penetration depth by cracking samples and spraying water on them, and field tests in a harsh tunnel environment. The moisture diffusion coefficient for a <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> treated concrete is close to constant and not nearly as dependent on the relative humidity (RH) as for untreated concrete. Unlike untreated concrete, where capillary suction plays an important role for the moisture transport at high RH, the vapour transport is the dominant transport mechanism even at high RH for <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> treated concrete. The moisture fixation is affected by a <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> treatment and the effect is clearest at high moisture levels. There is, however, a certain amount of moisture present in a concrete treated with a <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> agent. It can also be seen that the main {{reason for this is that}} the capillary porosity is affected by the treatment to a relatively high degree while the gel porosity to a large extent remains unaffected. The three most important factors for the penetration of any <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> agent into concrete is time, porosity and degree of saturation. An empirical equation is derived that gives an idea on how much these factors affect the efficient penetration depth of the <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> agent. Measures prolonging the service life of a concrete structure will lead to savings of natural resources and thus both economical and environmental savings for the community.

A numerical model of heat and water movement in furrow-sown <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> sand was developed and validated to help optimize the design of furrow sowing. The model used aerodynamic resistance, soil surface moisture and temperature, and surface evaporative resistance to estimate evaporation from each surface element. Wind speed and radiation was varied by calculation, according to the direction of the Sun or wind to the ridge direction and height. Movement of water and heat in the soil was determined by the initial conditions, boundary conditions, and coupled functions for heat and water movement, as used in many other models. Water repellency effects on drying were included by including the appropriate moisture and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity characteristics. Application of the finite element method to a two-dimensional cross section of a ridge and furrow system allows water to be excluded from a soil region beneath a ridge.
