25|$|Virginians were {{intensely}} individualistic at this point, {{weakening the}} small new communities. According to Breen (1979) their horizon was {{limited by the}} present or near future. They believed that the environment could and {{should be forced to}} yield quick financial returns. Thus everyone <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> for number one {{at the expense of the}} cooperative ventures. Farms were scattered and few villages or towns were formed. This extreme individualism led to the failure of the settlers to provide defense for themselves against the Indians, resulting in two massacres.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} people have claimed to have seen Anne's ghost at Hever Castle, Blickling Hall, Salle Church, the Tower of London, and Marwell Hall. The most famous account of her reputed {{sighting}} has been described by paranormal researcher Hans Holzer. In 1864, Major General J.D. Dundas of the 60th Rifles regiment was quartered in the Tower of London. As he <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> the window of his quarters, he noticed a guard below in the courtyard, in front of the lodgings where Anne had been imprisoned, behaving strangely. He appeared to challenge something, which to the General [...] "looked like a whitish, female figure sliding towards the soldier". The guard charged through the form with his bayonet, then fainted. Only the General's testimony and corroboration at the court-martial saved the guard from a lengthy prison sentence for having fainted while on duty. [...] In 1960, Canon W. S. Pakenham-Walsh, vicar of Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, reported having conversations with Anne.|$|E

500|$|When Phase II was {{discussed}} in the media, the return of Whitney as Rand {{was one of the}} things highlighted. Two weeks before the series was about to shoot, it was canceled by Paramount executives. Instead there was going to be a film. Whitney returned for , with Roddenberry bringing her back as Rand who was now the transporter chief on board the Enterprise. The film reunited the entire main cast of Star Trek. She didn't appear in , and wasn't in the script for [...] But for the latter film, Nimoy, who was directing the movie, gave Whitney a cameo as another character who <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> of a window in spacedock watching the return of the damaged Enterprise at the start of the production. As he was also directing The Voyage Home, he was looking to give Whitney a larger role. By this time, she had hoped that Rand had moved over to become a counselor â€“ an idea originally suggested by a fan. Alongside Majel Barrett as Christine Chapel, the duo were given four pages of dialogue initially which was trimmed down to one scene in the final film. Following the reappearance, Whitney was enthusiastic about returning as Rand, saying [...] "I think Janice Rand is going to be around for a long time, as long as they don't kill our characters off, we have a chance of constantly coming back." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} not without its critics. Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor was not {{impressed}} with the film, and after noting that the character Sydney seemed to be written for Owen Wilson, Rainer remarked, [...] "Maybe Wilson was busy.

Having not been selected for either the Test series or the initial or the first three ODIs, Miller was [...] "surprised" [...] {{to be one of}} three new players called up for the final two ODIs in St Kitts, replacing Suliemann Benn. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> for it [...] because I had a good season so I always kept my mind in tune for that call so that I won't be surprised," [...] said Miller. [...] "I was disappointed [...] but now that I got the chance I have to take it with both hands." [...] The West Indies had already lost the series 30.|$|E
2500|$|From about 1921, Oswald Short {{had been}} {{thinking}} about the construction of seaplane floats and flying boat hulls made from metal, specifically duralumin, rather than the traditional wood. [...] The latter always suffered from water retention and did not last well in the tropics. [...] He assembled a team, including C. P. T. Liscomb who had extensive experience with that alloy to look into the hydrodynamics and corrosion characteristics of such hulls, and by 1924 <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> for an opportunity to apply their results. [...] It came with an Australian order for an aircraft suitable for fishing trips around Botany Bay, which Short proposed should be a small flying boat. [...] It was named the Stellite and was the first aircraft to have a Short's [...] design index number, S.1. [...] When it was built and registered as G-EBKA the Air Ministry [...] objected to the name on the reasonable grounds that the Short Stellite might well be confused with the Short Satellite, built at much the same time; it was therefore renamed the Short S.1 Cockle. [...] It was the smallest flying boat ever built at that time. A contemporary source claimed it to be [...] "the first light seaplane to be built [...] and possibly in the world" [...] and the first British all-metal flying boat.|$|E
