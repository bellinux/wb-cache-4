25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|Rachel's {{cover of}} [...] "Firework" [...] by Katy Perry was {{reviewed}} negatively by Coachman. She wrote, [...] "I'm not loving Michele’s vocals on this track. It {{was like they}} wanted to purposely make her sound like Katy Perry. As much as I really like Katy Perry, Michele has more of a tremendous voice. There are parts <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she sounded really great, {{but for the most}} part this song just wasn't my cup of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage." [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of [...] "Silly Love Songs", writing, [...] "Not only do they sound great , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode." [...] The Marquee Blog at CNN gave the music numbers a positive review. A notable segment reads: [...] "I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", as well as the casts' performances of [...] "P.Y.T." [...] by Michael Jackson and [...] "When I get You Alone" [...] by Robin Thicke. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave Salling's performance a positive review. She wrote, [...] "We were thoroughly entertained by Puck's attempt to win newbie Lauren Zizes over with his tribute to her larger figure. Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade—and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces. Puck is no Freddie Mercury, but he handles the melody well and makes up for lack of range with swagger." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{the band}} chose {{to stay away from}} the {{political}} realm. However, in 2004, upon learning that George W. Bush's presidential campaign was using [...] "Times Like These" [...] at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to John Kerry's campaign - [...] "There’s no way of stopping the president playing your songs, so I went out and played it for John Kerry’s people instead, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> the message would kinda make more sense". Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets. The entire band eventually joined Grohl for a performance in Arizona coinciding with one of the presidential debates.|$|E
60|$|But I reckon it {{was more}} than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was {{spinning}} down a big bend stern first. First <b>I</b> didn't know <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week.|$|R
60|$|CATHLEEN. So you are {{starving}} {{even in this}} wood, <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would find nothing changed. But that's a dream, for the old worm o' the world Can eat its way into what place it pleases.|$|R

2500|$|Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio {{hailed the}} group for their song [...] "Kiss Them for Me". Sitek stated: [...] "I've always {{tried to make a}} song that begins like [...] "Kiss Them for Me". I think songs like [...] "I Was a Lover" [...] or [...] "Wash the Day Away" [...] came from that element of {{surprise}} mode where all of a sudden this giant drum comes in and you're like, what the fuck?! That record was the first one where I was like, okay, even my friends're going to fall for this. I feel like that transition into that record was a relief for me. Really beautiful music was always considered too weird by the normal kids {{and that was the first}} example <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> we've got them, they're hooked! I watched people dance to that song, people who had never heard of any of the music that I listened to, they heard that music in a club and went crazy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really? <b>Where?</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{they only}} {{did that to}} the dear horses. Oh, what a pretty laugh you have! It's so {{pleasant}} to hear anyone laugh, in these days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} prudent," [...] {{retorted}} de Batz. [...] "I {{have taken the}} trouble to make friends there <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I needed them most--the mammon of unrighteousness, you know-what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! you cannot--the English milor' can {{and will}} {{if only we could}} know <b>where</b> he is. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of him the moment I {{received}} that awful man's letter--and then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of you...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that's true. But 'tis {{a melancholy}} thing, and my blood ran cold when you spoke, for I felt {{there were two}} poor fellows <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> only one. 'Tis a sad thing for ye, Christian. How'st know the women won't hae thee?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>where</b> is Chatterton? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he was here--he had {{a sister}} married here last week," [...] inquired Lord William Stapleton, {{addressing}} {{no one in}} particular.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{started off}} {{to search for}} the man under the white {{umbrella}}. I went to <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I had left him, but no white umbrella could I find.|$|E
60|$|No sooner {{said than}} done. We jumped again into our cab and started. As we drove back, Mr. Hayes asked me <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we {{were most likely}} to find it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I bundled {{everything}} up into {{my arm and}} made for the nearest pub, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I would ask for a piece more string and make a neat job of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't imagine <b>where</b> you were. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of {{all sorts}} of things. I almost came round--but I was so horribly afraid I mightn't find you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fallen {{upon one}} of his oldest friends, who {{will take care of}} him, and well {{out of the way of}} the croquet traps. <b>Where's</b> my Lady? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you were with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God," [...] {{repeated}} Aurelia. [...] "Now I {{have you}} nothing will be dreadful. But <b>where</b> am <b>I?</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> once <b>I</b> {{was in a}} boat with you and Eugene, and some one else. Was it a dream? I can't remember anything since that terrible old woman made me drink the coffee. You have not come there, have you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DON'T DISAPPOINT ME. If {{you don't}} {{understand}} me now you will to-morrow or very soon. When I said just now that I {{had a high}} opinion of you, you see I meant it very seriously," [...] she explained. [...] "It wasn't a vain compliment. I believe there's no appeal one may make to your generosity that can remain long unanswered. If this were to happen--if I were to find you selfish <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you generous, narrow <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you large"--and she spoke slowly, her voice lingering with all emphasis {{on each of these}} words--"vulgar <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you rare, I should think worse of human nature. I should take it, I assure you, very hard indeed. I should say to myself in the dull days of the future: 'There was ONE man who might have done so and so, and he too failed.' But this shan't be. You've made too good an impression on me not to make the very best. If you wish to please me for ever there's a way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here I am at your side, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{never more}} to be. Here I speak to you. I see {{you listen to}} me willingly--look at me kindly. Did I count on that? I despaired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} out," [...] she admitted. [...] "I do not think, Capitaine Rotherby, that I {{must tell you}} where I have been, but I went to the one place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that I might have news of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{there you}} are with your {{moderation}} again. Now, I do presume to assert that she must be either one or the other--or {{she would not have}} forbidden Nanina to say anything about her in answer to all my first natural inquiries. <b>Where</b> is Maddalena? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> she was here a minute ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here you are," [...] said Dan, {{taking a}} lump of the desired article from his wallet and handing it to the {{impatient}} man; {{at the same time}} giving a morsel to Elspie. [...] "I knew you would want it in a hurry, and kept it handy. <b>Where</b> is Duncan? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he was with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|I believe Mr. Robbie was {{at least}} three hours gone. I saw him descend from a cab at the door, and almost {{immediately}} after I was shown again into his study, where the solemnity of his manner led me to augur the worst. For some time he had the inhumanity to read me a lecture as to the incredible silliness, [...] "not to say immorality," [...] of my behaviour. [...] "I have the satisfaction in telling you my opinion, because it appears {{that you are going}} to get off scot-free," [...] he continued, <b>where,</b> indeed, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he might have begun.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} seeking you these two days, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you {{were most likely}} to be found,' resumed the other more humbly, 'and I met you here at last, when I had almost given up the hope of encountering you, Mr Nickleby.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I," [...] {{said the}} Countess, [...] "was equally {{surprised}} to find none but these beautiful children in the apartment <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I heard you moving. Our Ellesmere has become silly--your good-nature has spoiled her--she has forgotten the discipline she learned under me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I rode for my life, as a recreant knight must," [...] {{answered}} Lord Evandale, smiling. [...] "I {{took the}} route <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I had least chance of meeting {{with any of}} the enemy, and I found shelter for several hours--you will hardly guess where." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mine {{emulation}} [...] Hath {{not that}} honor in't, it had; for <b>where</b> [...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> to crush {{him in an}} equal force, [...] True sword to sword; I'll potch at him some way, [...] Or wrath, or craft may get him.--My valor (poison'd [...] With only suffering stain by him) for him [...] Shall fly out of itself: not sleep, nor sanctuary, [...] Being naked, sick, nor fane, nor capitol, [...] The prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifices, [...] Embankments all of fury, shall lift up [...] Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst [...] My hate to Marcius.|$|R

60|$|That evening {{will always}} live in my remembrance. My mother was {{brighter}} than I {{had ever seen}} her. A flush was on her cheek and a sparkle in her eye, and looking across {{at her as she}} sat holding a small painted screen to shield her face from the fire, the sense of beauty became suddenly born within me, and answering an impulse I could not have explained, I slipped down, still with my blanket around me, from the doctor's knee, and squatted {{on the edge of the}} fender, from <b>where,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> no one was noticing me, I could steal furtive glances up into her face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Damn you, no," [...] he {{answered}} fiercely in my ear, [...] "those papers {{come from the}} Little Martha ward, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> there wasn't a wrong 'un in the crowd. If they've sold me, I'll be even with them, as sure as my name is Strong." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell: [...] "Put {{it in my}} desk, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I put mine. But {{never mind}} it now. I {{can tell you what}} was in it just as well. Come in here a moment, Margaret." [...] She leads the way to the parlor, whither Miss Rice follows.|$|E
60|$|I gave up {{following}} them after a while--they were too quick {{for me in}} the alder tangle--and came out of the swamp to the ridge. There I ran along a deer path and circled down ahead of them to a thicket of cedar, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> they might pass the night.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wickfield <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could. After {{a little}} discussion, he {{proposed}} to take my aunt to the school, that she might see it and judge for herself; also, to take her, with the same object, {{to two or three}} houses <b>where</b> he <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could be boarded.

60|$|We set out, some on {{horses and}} some on mules, {{as we could}} get them, but the Spaniard and myself rode on two very good horses, being the same that his two sons came on.

6000|$|... "I {{made up my}} {{mind that}} the fellow was in hiding in the house. When I paced one {{corridor}} and found it six feet shorter than the corresponding one below, it was pretty clear <b>where</b> he was. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he had not the nerve to lie quiet before an alarm of fire. We could, of course, have gone in and taken him, but it amused me to make him reveal himself. Besides, I owed you a little mystification, Lestrade, for your chaff in the morning." ...|$|R
