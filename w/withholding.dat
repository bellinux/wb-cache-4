In the majority of jurisdictions, {{when there is a}} clause that the landlord may <b>withhold</b> consent to an assignment, the general rule is that the landlord may not <b>withhold</b> consent unreasonably unless there is a provision that states specifically that the Landlord may <b>withhold</b> consent at Landlord's sole discretion.|$|R
5|$|Coolidge {{continued}} the previous administration's policy of <b>withholding</b> {{recognition of the}} Soviet Union.

5|$|He went to Saudi Arabia from 4 to 6 November {{in hopes}} of obtaining {{financial}} aid and securing trade agreements. However, leaked cables revealed increasingly strained relations between Zardari and Saudi royalty, primarily because of Saudi distrust of Zardari and preference for Sharif.

40|$|Response {{inhibition}} - {{the suppression}} of a prepotent or ongoing action - is an executive function central to the regulation of behaviour. Response inhibition can be assessed in the laboratory using the Go/No-go or Stop-Signal tasks which both assess the capacity to <b>withhold</b> an inappropriate response. In the Go/No-go task, participants are required to respond rapidly to Go stimuli but to <b>withhold</b> that response upon No-go stimuli. In the Stop-Signal task, participants are required to respond to Go stimuli but to <b>withhold</b> the response when an auditory stop signal occurs subsequent to the Go stimulus...|$|R

5|$|The Dulles–Cuhna communiqué {{touched off}} anti-American demonstrations {{in many parts}} of India. On December 6, Dulles held a news conference during which he reaffirmed U.S. {{neutrality}} on the Goa issue, but did not recant claims of Portuguese sovereignty over the region. Prime Minister Nehru announced his intent to file a formal protest with the United States over the communiqué and to address the Indian Parliament about the matter. In the interim, Cooper secured a meeting with Nehru and forestalled both actions. Cooper became even more upset with Dulles when Dulles authorized <b>withholding</b> $10million of a $50million aid package to India; Cooper protested the <b>withholding,</b> and Dulles decided to pay the full amount.|$|E

5|$|Organizations are now {{attempting}} to assist and empower female migrant workers through {{training and education}} on their labor-related rights. Legal clinics have begun to assist female migrants in filing claims against employers and local labor bureaus. One case of female worker exploitation in the Hua Yi garment factory in Beijing resulted in mistreatment by management as well as <b>withholding</b> pay for at least 24 women. After filing complaints, {{in collaboration with the}} Center for Women's Law Studies and Legal Services of Beijing University, the women received 170,000 Yuan in back wages and compensation.|$|E
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for firms to conduct performance evalu-ations of their employees and yet to <b>withhold</b> this information from those employees. This paper argues that firms strategically <b>withhold</b> performance information to retain workers. In particular, if the worker enjoys high outside options and is tempted to quit, the firm chooses not to disclose this information to keep him on the job. The firm’s equilibrium strategy is to fire if performance is sufficiently low, reveal information if performance is sufficiently high, and <b>withhold</b> informa-tion otherwise. This reflects the empirical distribution of performance evaluation ratings observed in practice. ...|$|R

5|$|Pierce charged Treasury Secretary James Guthrie with {{reforming}} the Treasury, which was inefficiently managed and had many unsettled accounts. Guthrie increased oversight of Treasury employees and tariff collectors, {{many of whom}} were <b>withholding</b> money from the government. Despite laws requiring funds to be held in the Treasury, large deposits remained in private banks under the Whig administrations. Guthrie reclaimed these funds and sought to prosecute corrupt officials, with mixed success.|$|E

In {{the aftermath of the}} election Mugabe declared that the state-owned Grain Marketing Board had the sole right to import and distribute grain, with the state distributors giving food to ZANU-PF supporters while <b>withholding</b> it from those suspected of backing the MDC. In 2005, Mugabe instituted Operation Murambatsvina ("Operation Drive Out the Rubbish"), a project of forced slum clearance; a UN report estimated that 700,000 were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the common}} law, {{citizens}} {{have the right}} freely to leave and enter the United Kingdom.

The writ of ne exeat regno {{is also used to}} prevent a person leaving the country. The right to make treaties is a disputed prerogative power: under Blackstone's definition, a prerogative power must be one unique to the monarch.|$|E

5|$|Abdül Kadir was to {{have been}} the Ottoman Navy's first pre-dreadnought battleship. She {{followed}} a series of ironclad warships built in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1876, Sultan Murad V was deposed; the Ottoman Navy had {{played a role in the}} coup, which installed Abdul Hamid II on the throne. The new sultan was as a result suspicious of the navy, and attempted to reduce its power by <b>withholding</b> funding and ordering no new capital ships over the course of the following decade. By the late 1880s, however, the ships built by his predecessors were rapidly becoming obsolescent, especially compared to foreign designs like the British s.|$|E
5|$|Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came {{to suspect}} that Fantasy Records had failed to pay them {{all of the money}} that they were owed from the sale of their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the company had been <b>withholding</b> money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority of the money that was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.|$|E
5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's comments in R. v. Lewes Justices, ex parte Secretary of State for Home Department (1972), {{that there was}} a public interest for certain documents in the police's possession not to be produced during court proceedings, otherwise members of the public might withhold information from the police if they realized the potential existed for the information to be disclosed to the Gaming Board. Such <b>withholding</b> of information would prevent the police from properly discharging their statutory duty of ensuring that unsuitable persons were not granted licences to run gaming establishments. Lord Reid stated that the requirement for natural justice in that case was clearly outweighed by the public interest.|$|E
