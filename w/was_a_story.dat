5|$|A {{spin-off}} novel, Deus Ex: Icarus Effect, {{was written}} by Swallow. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> set {{around the same time}} as the main game, following new characters Ben Saxon and Anna Kelso as they uncover a hidden conspiracy. First announced in July 2010, it was published by Titan Books on February 22, 2011. A second novel by Swallow, Deus Ex: Fallen Angel, was released as a free online download alongside the release of the Director's Cut: the novel details Malik's early life in Hengsha. A film adaptation was also announced, planned by Eidos Montréal and CBS Films: based on the story of Human Revolution, Scott Derrickson was attached as director and co-writer, C.

5|$|Lucas {{planned to}} spend another five weeks in Europe, and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the {{screenplay}} {{by the time he}} returned, but they were about to start on their own film, Messiah of Evil (1972), so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called Barry and the Persuasions, a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the Second Test also {{affected}} the career paths of other players. England's inability to cut down the Australians resulted in the dropping of three of their bowlersWright, Laker and Coxonafter the Lord's Test. Coxon's debut was his only Test match, something believed to be caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that he punched Comptonwhom he disliked and considered self-importantin the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. The match was the last ever Test for Brown, who had struggled out of position in the middle-order, scoring 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. He had scored centuries on his previous Test outings at Lord's in 1934 and 1938, but the third visit {{proved to be the}} end of his international career.|$|E
5|$|The most {{influential}} retelling, {{which according to}} many commentators ensured that the Mary Celeste affair would never be forgotten, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in the January 1884 issue of the Cornhill Magazine. This was an early work of Arthur Conan Doyle, then a 25-year-old ship's surgeon. Doyle's story, entitled J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement, did not adhere to the facts. He renamed the ship Marie Celeste, the captain's name was J. W. Tibbs, the fatal voyage took place in 1873 and was from Boston to Lisbon. The vessel carried passengers, among them the titular Jephson. In the story, another passenger, a fanatic named Septimus Goring with a hatred of the white race, has suborned members of the crew to murder Tibbs and take the vessel to the shores of Western Africa. Here, {{the rest of the}} ship's company is killed, save for Jephson who is spared because he possesses a magical charm that is venerated by Goring and his accomplices. Doyle had not expected his story to be taken seriously, but Sprague, still serving as the US consul in Gibraltar, was sufficiently intrigued to inquire if any part of the story might be true.|$|E

5|$|The race <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of pit strategy, as {{the only}} passing on the circuit was of lapped traffic. Albers w{{as the only}} car to run a three pit stop race, as all other drivers chose to stop only twice. The only lead changes came on lap 26, as Schumacher's 32-second stop gave Barrichello the lead, and on lap 51, as Schumacher turned in the quickest pit stop at 23.615 seconds, giving him enough time to exit pit lane {{at the same time}} as Barrichello, with the result of forcing Barrichello into the grass of Turn One. After this incident, which was not {{investigated}} by race officials, both Ferrari drivers were reminded over their radios not to crash out of the race, and they both settled into a slower pace, comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. All four of the drivers for Jordan and Minardi scored their first points in Formula One at this race. Karthikeyan's points were the first for an Indian driver in Formula One. This was also the final race at which the Minardi team tallied points.|$|E
5|$|England {{made three}} further changes. Spinner Jack Young and paceman Dick Pollard {{replaced}} the spin pair of Doug Wright and Jim Laker in the bowling department, meaning England would only play one slow bowler. Wright and Laker had struggled {{to penetrate the}} Australian batting lineup in the Second Test, taking match figures of 2/123 and 2/128 respectively. In contrast, Pollard had taken match figures of 4/85 for Lancashire in a match against Australia earlier in the season, and had taken 27 wickets in four county matches in the past fortnight. The selection was seen as being influenced by the fact the Test was being staged at Lancashire's home ground, where Pollard {{was familiar with the}} conditions, and the Australians had a high regard for him. In the month since being dropped for the Second Test in favour of Wright, after taking 1/107 in the First Test, Young had returned to play for Middlesex, taking 27 wickets in five matches. Alec Coxon, the Yorkshire allrounder who made his Test debut in the previous match at Lord's and opened the bowling, taking match figures of 3/172 and scoring 19 and a duck, was replaced by Jack Crapp, a debutant batsman. Crapp had scored 100 not out and 32 for Gloucestershire in the preceding match against the tourists. It was only the third century scored against Australia during the tour, and was part of a season in which Crapp had made four centuries and six half-centuries in 16 matches thus far. Coxon's omission was believed to have been caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that he punched Denis Comptonwhom he disliked and considered self-importantin the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. O'Reilly interpreted the omission of the Yorkshiremen Hutton and Coxon {{at the expense of the}} Gloucestershire pair of Crapp and Emmett as symptoms of a regional bias in the English selection panel. He pointed out that only one of the four selectorsEngland captain Norman Yardley, who was also from Yorkshirewas from the north of the country.|$|E

The play had been written by Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton for the 1561/2 Christmas festivities at the Inner Temple in London and appears to have been selected because it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of a divided kingdom descending into anarchy that was applicable to the situation in Ireland {{at the time of the}} performance.
