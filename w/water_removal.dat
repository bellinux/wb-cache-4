2500|$|Osmotherapy {{is the use}} of osmotically active {{substances}} to reduce the volume of intracranial contents. Osmotherapy serves as the primary medical [...] treatment for cerebral edema. The primary purpose of osmotherapy is to improve elasticity and decrease intracranial volume by removing free water, accumulated as a result of cerebral edema, from brain's extracellular and intracellular space into vascular compartment by creating an osmotic gradient between the blood and brain. Normal serum osmolality ranges from 280-290 mOsm/kg and serum osmolality to cause <b>water</b> <b>removal</b> from brain without much side effects ranges from 300-320 mOsm/kg. Usually, 90 mL of space is created in the intracranial vault by 1.6% reduction in brain water content. Osmotherapy has cerebral [...] dehydrating effects. The main goal of osmotherapy is to decrease intracranial pressure(ICP) by shifting excess fluid from brain. This is accomplished by intravenous administration of osmotic agents which increase serum osmolality in order to shift excess fluid from intracellular or extracellular space of the brain to intravascular compartment. The resulting brain shrinkage effectively [...] reduces intracranial volume and decreases ICP.|$|E

40|$|Gas {{dehydration}} {{is widely}} used in natural gas treatment plant as a common process, because water and hydrocarbon can form hydrates (ice formation) which may block valve and pipelines. Water also can cause corrosion {{in the presence of}} acid gas component in natural gas. Until today, the most popular dehydration process is adsorption and absorption process. The objective {{of this study was to}} remove the water content in natural gas for adsorption and absorption process. This study consists of fabricating the lab scale dehydration unit by using PVC-Clear pipe. Two types of desiccant were used in this study which is silica gel for adsorption process and triethylene glycol for absorption process. The various quantity of desiccant was used in this study to get the maximum amount of <b>water</b> content <b>removal</b> from natural gas. In this study, the methods used were designing, fabricating, testing, experimental and analyzing. From the study, the maximum allowable operating pressure for both dehydration unit is 0. 3 bar. Furthermore, the higher quantity of desiccant gives the higher amount of <b>water</b> content <b>removal</b> from natural gas. The result also shows that the increasing operating pressure for the process will decrease the <b>water</b> content <b>removal</b> from natural gas for both processes. Lastly, triethylene glycol is a better desiccant compare with silica gel in dehydration process for this study...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOur {{goal was}} to {{disentangle}} the effects of stress removal and disturbance on plant communities of a Mediterranean rangeland, La Crau (southeastern France). We compared undisturbed reference steppe vegetation with vegetation impacted by changes in land use such as earlier phases of cultivation (dating back 20 years) and/or current water infiltrations (revealed {{by the presence of}} Brachypodium phoenicoides), since the establishment of adjacent hay meadows. We considered plots with and without brambles (Rubus ulmifolius), an indigenous shrub species that had colonized the area after the land-use changes. We monitored the composition and measured the taxonomic richness and richness of functional groups, evenness and similarities of plant communities. The species richness of the undisturbed community was significantly higher than that of all disturbed plant communities. Although cultivation led to the dominance of ruderal species, the <b>removal</b> of <b>water</b> stress had a stronger negative impact, enabling the establishment of herbaceous competitor species such as B. phoenicoides. The dominance of this species resulted in a significant decline in species richness and evenness after <b>water</b> stress <b>removal.</b> The presence of brambles correlating with former cultivation and/or current water infiltration did not {{have a significant impact on}} plant species richness in the vicinity of bramble bushes, although it significantly modified the composition of the adjacent herbaceous vegetation. Our study highlights again the low resilience of Mediterranean dry grasslands after disturbance. While both the disturbance and the <b>water</b> stress <b>removal</b> resulted in changes within the plant community, our findings reveal a stronger impact of the <b>water</b> stress <b>removal.</b> <b>Water</b> infiltration led to decreased plant species richness and evenness because the greater availability of water favored competitor species over the stress-tolerant xeric species. Therefore, for restoring the original steppe species richness, the priority will be to control water infiltrations, even before any scrub-clearing is undertaken to control bramble colonization...|$|R
