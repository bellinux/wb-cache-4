Simon's confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression. He questioned whether he and Art Garfunkel could work together, but contacted Garfunkel, who was vacationing in Switzerland. Garfunkel <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> the idea, and immediately returned to the US.|$|E

25|$|Around the World in Eighty Days {{was written}} during {{difficult}} times, both for France and for Verne. It {{was during the}} Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) in which Verne was conscripted as a coastguard; he was having financial difficulties (his previous works were not paid royalties); his father had died recently; and he had witnessed a public execution, which had disturbed him.

25|$|In February 1975, {{during his}} {{engagement}} in Las Vegas, Presley met with Barbra Streisand and Jon Peters. They discussed {{the possibility of}} Presley's co-starring with Streisand in a remake of the film A Star is Born. Seeing it {{as a chance to}} finally be taken seriously as an actor, Presley agreed to take the role if the contracts could be worked out. According to Presley's friend, Jerry Schilling, Presley <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> the opportunity to take on a new challenge. Streisand's production company, First Artists, offered Presley $500,000 and 10% of the profits. Parker, who had always dealt with Presley's film contracts and viewed the offer as a starting bid, asked for $1 million, 50% of the profits, $100,000 for expenses, and spoke of needing to arrange details of a soundtrack deal. First Artists, unused to such huge demands, didn't put forward a counteroffer and decided instead to offer the role to Kris Kristofferson. Parker later claimed that Presley had asked him to make the contract so demanding so that they would not offer him the part, although many of Presley's friends have said he was furious at losing the role.|$|E
25|$|After Sea Wife, Burton next {{appeared}} as the British Army Captain Jim Leith in Nicholas Ray's Bitter Victory (1957). Burton admired Ray's Rebel Without A Cause (1955) and <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> working with him, but unfortunately despite positive feedback, Bitter Victory tanked as well. By mid-1957, Burton had no further offers in his kitty. He could {{not return to}} the UK because of his self-imposed exile from taxation, and his fortunes in film were dwindling. It was then that film producer and screenwriter Milton Sperling offered Burton to star alongside Helen Hayes and Susan Strasberg in Patricia Moyes' adaptation of Jean Anoulih's play, Time Remembered (Léocadia in the original French version). Sensing an opportunity for a career resurgence, Burton readily agreed to do the role of Prince Albert, who {{falls in love with a}} milliner named Amanda (Strasberg). It was on 10 September 1957, a day before he left for New York, that Sybil gave birth to their first child, Kate Burton. Time Remembered was well received on its opening nights at Broadway's Morosco Theatre and also at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C.. The play went on to have a good run of 248 performances for six months. Burton received his first Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination while Hayes won her second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her role as Burton's mother, The Duchess of Pont-Au-Bronc.|$|E
25|$|Sometime in 1842, the Home Committee {{selected}} the Rev. Johan Georg Widmann, Hermann Halleut and the German-trained Americo-Liberian missionary, George Peter Thompson {{to go to}} Jamaica to recruit Christians of African descent. Andreas Riis and his wife, Anna Wolters, Widmann and Thompson left Basel for the British leeward island of Antigua in the West Indies via Liverpool to engage and recruit black Christian men who would accompany them to West Africa while Halleut {{went directly to the}} Gold Coast to prepare the grounds for their arrival. With the assistance of James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, the Governor of Jamaica at the time, the Rev. Jacob Zorn, the Superintendent of the Moravian Mission in Jamaica, the Rev. J. F. Sessing and the Rev. J. Miller, an agent of the Africa Civilization Society, Riis was able to recruit candidates after a mass appeal across the island and an extensive and rigorous interview process. Many of the volunteers who initially applied to the programme were found to be unsuitable: a few were lapsed Christians, one <b>was</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> the adventure and wished to mine for gold, another had an invalid wife who was too ill to travel while other potential recruits wished merely to return to the motherland, Africa, the mission work not being a top priority in their minds. It was quite an arduous task finding the right candidates to the extent that Riis and other Basel missionaries almost gave up on the initiative.|$|E
