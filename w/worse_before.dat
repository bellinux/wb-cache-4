25|$|At the Manor Christmas party, Will {{once again}} sees Dawson and Old George {{who seem to}} know him well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about {{when and how to}} {{approach}} Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much <b>worse</b> <b>before</b> restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.|$|E
500|$|Another {{consideration}} is loss of sensation, [...] which puts {{people at risk}} for wounds such as pressure sores and injuries that could become <b>worse</b> <b>before</b> being noticed. Friction from sexual activity may damage the skin, so it is necessary after sex to inspect areas {{that could have been}} hurt, particularly the buttocks and genital area. People who already have pressure sores must take care not to make the wounds worse. Irritation to the genitals increases risk for vaginal infections, which get worse if they go unnoticed. Women who do not get sufficient vaginal lubrication on their own can use a commercially available personal lubricant to decrease friction.|$|E
500|$|According to Nolan, an {{important}} {{theme of the}} sequel is [...] "escalation", extending the ending of Batman Begins, noting [...] "things having to get <b>worse</b> <b>before</b> they get better". While indicating The Dark Knight would continue the themes of Batman Begins, including justice vs. revenge and Bruce Wayne's issues with his father, Nolan emphasized the sequel would also portray Wayne more as a detective, an aspect of his character not fully developed in Batman Begins. Nolan described the friendly rivalry between Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent as the [...] "backbone" [...] of the film. He also chose to compress the overall storyline, allowing Dent to become Two-Face in The Dark Knight, thus giving the film an emotional arc the unsympathetic Joker could not offer. Nolan acknowledged the title {{was not only a}} reference to Batman, but also the fallen [...] "white knight" [...] Harvey Dent.|$|E

Annabel thinks she hears some scratching from the well. Miriam look down and says Alice must be dead, but Annabel's anxiety increases further. Miriam starts telling of the spooky things that used to happen, saying [...] "Who's coming up the stairs?" [...] and [...] "Who's going to kiss you goodnight" [...] and starts on a [...] "ghost story". Twelve years old, she sneaked {{out of the house}} to go to a party with, in her father's words, [...] "unsavoury youths", partied away in a silver dress and got propositioned by three boys she didn't fancy. When she returned, her father was waiting in the garden for his disobedient daughter, he would have to “punish” Miriam said she chose to be punished in the garden over indoor, but the punishment was <b>worse</b> ... <b>before</b> she finishes with [...] "Wasn't that a good ghost story!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Seven went on {{to claim}} that [...] "much the {{greatest}} part of the nobility and gentry" [...] were dissatisfied and would rally to William, and that James's army [...] "would be very much divided among themselves; many of the officers being so discontented that they continue in their service only for a subsistence... and very many of the common soldiers do daily shew such an aversion to the Popish religion, that there is the greatest probability imaginable of great numbers of deserters... and amongst the seamen, it is almost certain, {{there is not one}} in ten who would do them any service in such a war". The Seven believed that the situation would be much <b>worse</b> <b>before</b> another year due to James's plans to remodel the army by the means of a packed Parliament or, should the parliamentary route fail, through violent means which would [...] "prevent all possible means of relieving ourselves". The Seven also promised to rally to William upon his landing in England and would [...] "do all that lies in our power to prepare others to be in as much readiness as such an action is capable of".|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1920s, {{this period}} of Harlem's history has been highly romanticized. [...] With the {{increase}} in a poor population, {{it was also the}} time when the neighborhood began to deteriorate to a slum, and some of the storied traditions of the Harlem Renaissance were driven by poverty, crime, or other social ills. For example, in this period, Harlem became known for [...] "rent parties", informal gatherings in which bootleg alcohol was served and music played. [...] Neighbors paid to attend, and thus enabled the host to make his or her monthly rent. Though picturesque, these parties were thrown out of necessity. Further, over a quarter of black households in Harlem made their monthly rent by taking in lodgers, many of whom were family members, but who sometimes brought bad habits or even crime that disrupted the lives of respectable families. Lodgers also experienced disruption, with many having to move frequently when households relocated, roommates quarreled or they could not pay rent. Urban reformers campaigned to eliminate the [...] "lodger evil" [...] but the problem got <b>worse</b> <b>before</b> it got better; in 1940, still affected by the Depression, 40% of black families in Harlem were taking in lodgers.|$|E
2500|$|Lynsey {{decides to}} {{temporarily}} leave the village. Hassan revealed Cheryl's brother, Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), would {{become involved with}} the storyline and would begin {{to think that there}} is something odd about Silas, although Brendan does not think Silas is a murderer. The actress said that this leaves Lynsey to fight her own battles, teasing that the situation gets [...] "even <b>worse</b> <b>before</b> it gets better". Lynsey discovers Texas has been speaking to a girl online. Hassan explained that when Texas is telling Lynsey about the girl she realise that the correspondent is actually Silas who is planning to hurt Texas. Lynsey arranges to meet the correspondent in the woods, planning to take journalist Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) with her. However, Nancy does not plan to turn up following Silas' intervention. Hassan explained that Lynsey is unaware Nancy is not coming until [...] "the penny drops that she's all alone in the woods with Silas, she's absolutely terrified". Lynsey goes missing, with the actress explaining that nobody knows where her character is. Hassan explained that Brendan finds a note which he believes is from Lynsey telling him to meet her in the woods and because he is already suspicious of Silas he come to rescue Lynsey. Brendan arrives at the woods and discovers the body of Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) in his car before the police arrive and arrest Brendan. Lynsey soon after returns home.|$|E
