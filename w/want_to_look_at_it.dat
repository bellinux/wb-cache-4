We lost, and we'll see what happens in the off-season." [...] As the interview session went on, he eventually became emotional and left the clubhouse area to compose himself. Girardi said, [...] "This guy, {{when you look at what}} he did in this series, he was awesome. He's had a tremendous career, and I'm sure he's going to continue to play, and I don't know what's going to happen." [...] Girardi added, [...] "But you talk about being proud of players — what he went through this year and what he gave us in the postseason, I don't think there's a prouder moment that I've had of Jorge." ...|$|E

She had, she said, {{had enough of}} the sea for one while, and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> again till they sailed for home. Boyne turned to his father as if a good deal shaken by this reasoning, and it was Mrs. Kenton who carried the day for going first to a hotel in The Hague and prospecting from there in the direction of Scheveningen; Boyne and his father could go down to the shore and see which they liked best.|$|E

He seemed to have been hours counting. It must, he thought, be nearly time for her to come up now. He threw the bedclothes back. [...] "I'm hot!" [...] he said, and his voice sounded funny in the darkness, like someone else's. Why didn't she come? He sat up. He must look! He got out of bed, went to the window and pulled the curtain a slice aside. It wasn't dark, but he couldn't tell whether because of daylight or the moon, which was very big. It had a funny, wicked face, as if laughing at him, and he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Then, remembering that his mother had said moonlit nights were beautiful, he continued to stare out in a general way. The trees threw thick shadows, the lawn looked like spilt milk, and a long, long way he could see; oh! very far; right over the world, and it all looked different and swimmy. There was a lovely smell, too, in his open window.|$|E

5000|$|When the York University-based Canadian Homelessness Research Network (CHRN) {{released}} the first Canadian Definition of Homelessness in 2012, Goldring, {{a member of}} the Edmonton Committee to End Homelessness, argued that the CHRN's definition painted an overly broad picture including those who were [...] "having a hard time financially." [...] Goldring felt that, [...] "You don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> coldly, but they’re really not in desperate need until they’re holding that eviction notice in their hand." [...] For this, he was heavily criticized for maintaining a lack of knowledge on the subject as well as advocating a lack of inclusivity.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Gaetz, a {{homelessness}} {{researcher at}} York University, {{argued that the}} detailed classification of homelessness, provided governments with more “precision” in {{figuring out how to}} draw up homeless plans. The report cites 4 typologies: unsheltered, emergency-sheltered, provisionally-accommodated, and at risk of homelessness. The definition received a lot of support from advocates for the homeless. Critics included Peter Goldring, an Alberta MP, member of the Edmonton Committee to End Homelessness, who argued that the CHRN's definition of homelessness painted an overly broad picture including those who were [...] "having a hard time financially."

[...] Muir added: [...] "We need to reduce risk levels and see more finishers. We've had three days' racing and one horse that died on the flat and now two in the Grand National. The faller rate is too high and has to be addressed. Is the race cruel? No one put a horse into this race to see it suffer or die for their own gratification.

40|$|Popular {{economic}} {{literature has}} been overcome by competition for trendy titles and unique subject matter. After all, authors dealing with topics {{other than the}} current financial crisis must provide publishers a reason {{to put out the}} book, and prompt readers to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Yet, Matt Ridley seems to rise above it all in his most recent book, The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves (excepting, perhaps, his provocatively titled prologue). Ridley, a journalist by trade, has previously written about the fields of genetics and evolution and his skills make him a natural at answering two questions: how did we get to such prosperity as we have today, and where are we going? His title asserts his straightforward approach to the subject at hand: he offers a view of the future through the lens of the past. Ridley’s tone gives evidence of his journalism background; he uses the assembly of facts as a platform, from which he offers a cohesive explanation. Avoiding spiraling intrigue, Ridley’s research leads us to answers about our future...|$|E

40|$|Digital {{technologies}} have opened a large set {{of opportunities for}} new electronic services (e-commerce, e-health, e-studies etc.). There are many considerations {{that need to be}} made when programmers are building new application software or system software. The software needs to be attractive enough that people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> It also needs to contain all necessary information that developers want to share with their readers (customers, users) in order to help them achieve the objective for which they came to their website, use their software, or interact with their teaching packages. The oversupply of e-services products has created a need for usability research and development. “Usability means making products and systems easier to use, and matching them more closely to user needs and requirements”. Usability is a key concept of the human-computer interface and is concerned with making computer systems easy to learn and easy to use through a user-centered design process. The in-depth understanding of usability concepts and processes are critical for large-scale acceptance of new e-services and knowledge productivity. Poorly designed software can be extremely annoying to users. Smith and Mayes state that „usability is now recognised as a vital determining factor in the success of any new computer system or computer-based service”. Studies have shown that the main health problems of computer users are repetitive strain injuries, visual discomfort and stress-related disorders. Beside other risk factors, such as poor workstation design, uncomfortable work postures, long hours of computer use every day, stress, etc., also poor design and usability of the computer systems, as well as computer technical problems, add to the pressure felt by the user, which may in turn cause stress-related disorders...|$|E
40|$|In this correspondence, we {{analyze the}} {{vulnerabilities}} of biometric authentication protocols {{with respect to}} user and data privacy. The goal of an adversary in such context is not to bypass the authentication but to learn information either on biometric data or on users {{that are in the}} system. We elaborate our analysis on a general system model involving four logical entities (sensor, server, database, and matcher), and we focus on internal adversaries to encompass the situation where one or a combination of these entities would be malicious. Our goal is to emphasize that when going beyond the usual honest-but-curious assumption much more complex attacks can affect the privacy of data and users. On the one hand, we introduce a new comprehensive framework that encompasses the various schemes we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> <b>It</b> presents a system model in which each internal entity or combination of entities is a potential attacker. Different attack goals are considered and resulting requirements on data flows are discussed. On the other hand, we develop different generic attacks. We follow a blackbox approach in which we consider components that perform operations on biometric data but where only the input/output behavior is analyzed. These attack strategies are exhibited on recent schemes such as the distributed protocol of Bringer et al. (ACISP 2007), which is based on the Goldwasser-Micali cryptosystem, the related protocol of Barbosa et al. (ACISP 2008), which uses the Paillier cryptosystem, and the scheme of Stoianov (SPIE 2010), that features the Blum-Goldwasser cryptosystem. All these schemes have been developed in the honest-but-curious adversary model and show potential weaknesses when considered in our malicious insider attack model. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Domestic InFlux” is {{a thesis}} that, through study of past typologies and modern technologies, creates a {{platform}} to produce {{new forms of}} privately owned houses that allows the user to accommodate their changing needs with minimal effort. “Domestic InFlux” overlaps typologies and program so that the occupant can use the house for any function by collapsing certain program and allowing others to expand. Although today’s house is larger than in the past, the average family is smaller. Houses today have also become more segmented, isolating program that has been limited to a predefined area by the architecture. Technology is partially responsible for this change. With improved technology we have become less interested in {{taking advantage of the}} site and environment in our life at home, and more interested in using that technology to help us block {{out the rest of the}} world and disregard the potentials of the site. As technology develops and the world becomes more efficient, so should the house. As a society we have conflicting desires. We want to live in the city, but we also want to live in a mansion. We want more stuff, but we don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Special occasions require increased occupancy in a space that is unoccupied for most of the year. With “Domestic InFlux” a mansion can be fit into a row house, turning it in to a Swiss Army house or a house for every need. The “Domestic InFlux” house is no longer passive. It is interactive and dynamic, influencing the way we perceive space at every scale, including the scale of the neighborhood. As these houses aggregate, the residual spaces become outdoor rooms that can be occupied by the community...|$|E
