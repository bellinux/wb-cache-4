500|$|The {{band was}} {{surprised}} at the length of [...] "A Farewell to Arms" [...] and [...] "Clenching the Fists of Dissent" [...] running over ten minutes, and wondered if their fans would [...] "be able to get their heads around" [...] what the band was doing. Record company Roadrunner Records hesitated the band's decision to open the album with a ten and a half minute song ("Clenching the Fists of Dissent"), and asked the band questions similar to [...] "Are you sure you don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> something a little more direct?" [...] The band disregarded the comment and believed the song set the tone musically {{for the remainder of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by the [...] "special relationship" [...] that was developing between Geri Halliwell and Rowe. Brown hinted at this development in her autobiography commenting: [...] "When he [...] and Geri started making eyes at each other I knew what was going on, even though they denied it. I knew them both too well for it to be a secret for me." [...] Stannard commented about the fondness between Halliwell and Rowe: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the side of things. They were very close. They clicked. And I think the lyrics in [...] "2 Become 1" [...] came from that, especially the first verse, which they wrote together." ...|$|E

500|$|His {{acting in}} State of Play and The Deal won him {{considerable}} acclaim; {{he was nominated}} for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor {{for his role as}} Collins but lost to his co-star Bill Nighy. His performance in The Deal was acclaimed by Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's former spin doctor, and Tim Allan, a deputy press secretary of Tony Blair. A BBC News Online writer praised Morrissey's grasp of Brown's physical tics in a review that criticised the rest of the film. Morrissey's performance won the RTS Programme Award for Best Male Actor the next year, this time beating Nighy. The RTS jury wrote of Morrissey, [...] "The strength of this performance brought to the screen, and to life, all of the characteristics and traits of the man he portrayed {{in a way that was}} both credible and convincing." [...] In 2009, Morrissey declined the opportunity to play Brown again in The Special Relationship, Morgan's third Blair film, as he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the mindset of playing Brown for just one scene.|$|E
500|$|Following the touring cycle for Cross Purposes, bassist Geezer Butler {{quit the}} band {{for the second}} time. [...] "I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much {{preferred}} the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing". Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song [...] "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone ("I heard it's something about me..." [...] said Iommi. [...] "I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really {{paid any attention to}} the lyrics... It's nice to see him doing his own thing – getting things off his chest. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} in Toronto, Coleman met with club president, Peter Bavasi. [...] Despite having rejected Finley's bid to reacquire Coleman, Bavasi informed Coleman {{that he did not}} fit into the Blue Jays' plans. [...] Coleman recalled, [...] "It was a shock to me.

2500|$|I think [...] {{has stated}} that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, and that's as simple as {{they want to keep}} it.

Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. And then you have to test launch it {{to make sure that the}} alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability.|$|E

2500|$|The Ministry of Defence {{had issued}} written {{instructions}} which ordered the Indian Navy [...] "not to proceed {{two hundred miles}} beyond Bombay nor North of the parallel of Porbander". The lack of response by the Indian Navy to the attack on Dwarka led to questions being asked in Indian parliament and was considered a humiliation by Indian citizens and Navy personnel and a challenge to be answered by others. [...] The Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral B.S. Soman was restrained from retaliation for the Dwarka raid by the Defence Minister.

[...] "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [...] comes from something that a lot of people actually believe in". Cantrell also stated that he’s sick of the hypocrisy that’s taken over many facets of organized religion. [...] "I think there’s overwhelming evidence that things aren’t working right now. We need to start growing up as a people. When you’re teaching people that being gay is a mortal sin, yet a good portion of the people teaching this are fucking kids, there’s a huge problem".|$|E
