5|$|Fossas are {{occasionally}} held {{in captivity}} in zoos. They first bred in captivity in 1974 {{in the zoo}} of Montpellier, France. The next year, at a time <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only eight fossas in the world's zoos, the Duisburg Zoo in Germany acquired one; this zoo later started a successful breeding program, and most zoo fossas now descend from the Duisburg population. Research on the Duisburg fossas has provided much data about their biology.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1942, <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> fears of a German victory in the Middle East, Mishmar HaEmek {{was used as a}} {{training}} camp by the British army. 160 Jewish volunteers, who would later become members of the Palmach branch of the Haganah, were trained by Royal Engineers in sabotage and wireless operation. Several tons of explosives were hidden in caches in case the area came under German occupation. This program was terminated immediately upon the training of the volunteers, and orders issued for the collection of all equipment and explosives to be returned to the British.|$|E

During an interleague game against the Minnesota Twins on June 12, he caught a routine fly in right field and threw it into the stands, believing {{it was the third}} out of the inning <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only two outs. The umpire allowed each of the Twins' baserunners to advance two bases as a result.|$|E
5|$|Seventh-century Muslim armies had no siege equipment, and {{typically}} employed siege tactics only <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no other options. Without the necessary siege equipment, armies {{of the early}} Muslim expansion would surround a city, denying it supplies until the city's defenders surrendered. Meanwhile any chance of breaking into the city would be availed, if possible, using stealth and espionage. Muslim armies would usually isolate the city {{from the rest of}} the region and deploy scouts along vital routes.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 {{million years}} ago, <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only two major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, {{is not well}} understood, {{largely due to the}} {{scarcity}} of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as radiators.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of home baking in Israel arising from the years <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> very few bakeries to meet demand. Many professional bakers came to Israel from Central Europe and founded local pastry shops and bakeries, often called konditoria, thus shaping local tastes and preferences. There is now a local style with {{a wide selection of}} cakes and pastries that includes influences from other cuisines and combines traditional European ingredients with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients, such as halva, phyllo dough, dates, and rose water.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman {{helped the}} British to retain Sudanese support during the First World War, {{when they were}} opposed to the Turkish Empire, despite his being a Muslim leader. He lent his support again during a crisis in 1924 <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> anti-British riots in Egypt and the British Governor-General of the Sudan was assassinated. Meanwhile, he grew wealthy from cotton production, for which his {{supporters}} provided labor, and influential among the intelligentsia. The British administration distrusted him. When Governor General Sir Geoffrey Archer paid a formal and friendly visit to Abd al-Rahman in March 1926, Archer was dismissed and Abd al-Rahman was placed under travel restriction.|$|E
5|$|At the conference, {{in light}} of the little {{information}} available on Egyptian dispositions and intentions, and due to a shortage of infantry and artillery, the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future. There was a general consensus to attack Egyptian forces throwing them off balance, but disagreed on how to do so. Southern Command expected to have 640 tanks on Monday October 8, of which 530 tanks would be distributed among three divisions: 200 tanks under Adan, 180 under Sharon, and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced. Estimates put the number of Egyptian tanks at 400, <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> in fact 800 tanks across the canal by Sunday evening. In light of the apparent superiority, Gonen recommended a frontal attack at night with Adan's 162nd Division crossing to the west bank at El-Qantarah and Sharon's 143rd Division crossing into Suez City. Adan however, lacking infantry, urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front.|$|E

5|$|Four Native American {{cultures}} {{are known to}} have lived in the area during the last 10,000years. The first known group, the Nevares Spring People, were hunters and gatherers who arrived in the area perhaps 9,000years ago (7000BC) <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> still small lakes in Death Valley and neighboring Panamint Valley. A much milder climate persisted at that time, and large game animals were still plentiful. By 5,000years ago (3000BC) the Mesquite Flat People displaced the Nevares Spring People. Around 2,000years ago the Saratoga Spring People moved into the area, which by then was probably already a hot, dry desert. This culture was more advanced at hunting and gathering and was skillful at handcrafts. They also left mysterious stone patterns in the valley.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Hedley Marston's {{research}} into nuclear {{fallout from the}} Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter conflict with the Australian government appointed Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. He was vindicated posthumously by the McClelland Royal Commission, which found that significant radiation hazards existed at many of the Maralinga test sites long after the tests. His project tracked fallout across the continent by examining the thyroids of sheep and cattle as well as devices that filtered radioactive elements from air. Later the results, which showed dramatic increases of certain radioactive elements after British Nuclear Tests, caused a further, controversial study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. These tests showed that the tests had increased the concentration of strontium-90 dramatically. As well as finding this after British tests a notable 50% increase was noticed one year <b>when</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no tests and it was cited {{as evidence that the}} previous year's hydrogen bomb tests had contaminated the majority of the world.|$|E

By 2015, 11 of 22 restaurant chains studied by the Vegan Society had at least one vegan main course on their menu, though only 6 of these explicitly labelled them as vegan dishes. Top-end vegetarian restaurants remain relatively few, though they are increasing rapidly: there were some 20 in Britain in 2007, rising to 30 in 2010.|$|E
