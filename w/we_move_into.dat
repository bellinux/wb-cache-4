500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Tanner Gill {{explained that}} the hotel in which the climactic fighting takes place was designed specifically with the fights in mind, saying [...] "The basic environment of the fight had to be constructed to be “stunt friendly.” The space was tailored. Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>into</b> a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we do with that? Are we going to crash into some walls? Are we {{going to go into}} a kitchen? We see what we would get in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so we {{can do a lot of}} different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E

Moore would later guest star in the episodes [...] "Winter Madness", [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter", [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land", and [...] "I Do Do". In an interview with USA Today in October 2009, Fey said that Jack would find more enduring love in the upcoming season. [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>into</b> the back half of the season, we'd like to get [...] into a real adult relationship with some hurdles." [...] In the same interview, Baldwin noted, [...] "Fifty-year-old Jack running around still using women like a drug is not where I'd like him to end up." [...] Actor Larry Wilcox made a cameo in this episode, though, he was in character playing Officer Jon Baker from his old days in the drama show CHiPs, as Liz Lemon had a teen crush on Wilcox. In one scene of this episode, Liz says [...] "shark farts", and when asked about it in an April 2010 interview, Fey revealed that the term [...] "was one that we ad-libbed that we ended up leaving in. The studio asked us not to leave it in, but we left it in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ordinary atomic {{matter as}} we know it is really a mixed phase, {{droplets}} of nuclear matter (nuclei) surrounded by vacuum, which exists at the low-temperature phase boundary between vacuum and nuclear matter, at μ=310MeV and T close to zero. If we increase the quark density (i.e. increase μ) keeping the temperature low, <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>into</b> a phase of more and more compressed nuclear matter. Following this path corresponds to burrowing more and more deeply into a neutron star. Eventually, at an unknown critical value of μ, there is a transition to quark matter. At ultra-high densities we expect to find the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of color-superconducting quark matter. At intermediate densities we expect some other phases (labelled [...] "non-CFL quark liquid" [...] in the figure) whose nature is presently unknown,. They might be other forms of color-superconducting quark matter, or something different.|$|E

We {{report on}} magnetospheric Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortex {{signatures}} detected by THEMIS probes {{located near the}} post-noon magnetopause in the magnetosphere side for northward magnetosheath magnetic field. Oscillations of the magnetic field and of the ion velocity are measured with a period around 300 seconds. Once <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>into</b> a magnetopause boundary coordinate system, the magnetic field and ion velocity oscillations display vortex-like signatures. Yet ion spectrograms show no strong magnetosheath/magnetosphere plasma mixing and these vortices appear mostly as magnetospheric vortices. Numerical simulations of the KH instability are presented to support this possibility...|$|R
