5|$|Beginning in November 1895, {{artist and}} author Alfred Lambourne {{spent a year}} living on the remote Gunnison Island, where {{he wrote a book}} of musing and poetry, Our Inland Sea. From November 1895 to March 1896, he <b>was</b> <b>alone.</b> <b>In</b> March, a few guano sifters arrived to harvest and sell the guano of the nesting birds as fertilizer. Lambourne {{included}} musings about these guano sifters in his work. Lambourne left the island early in the winter of 1896 along with the first group of guano sifters.|$|E
5|$|Till {{arrived in}} Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955. On August 24, he and cousin Curtis Jones skipped church where his great-uncle Mose Wright was preaching and joined some local boys {{as they went}} to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to buy candy. The {{teenagers}} were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. Carolyn <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the store that day; her sister-in-law was {{in the rear of}} the store watching children. Jones left Till with the other boys while Jones played checkers across the street.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day on}} September 3, KMAG {{advisers}} at P'ohang-dong sent Coulter {{a message}} that the ROK 3rd Division commander was preparing to withdraw from P'ohang-dong. Coulter went immediately to the ROK I Corps commander and had him order ROK 3rd Division would not withdraw. Coulter checked every half-hour {{to see that the}} division stayed in its P'ohang-dong positions. That night, September 3–4, the remainder of the ROK I Corps front collapsed. Three North Korean T-34 tanks overran a battery of ROK artillery and then scattered two battalions of the newly arrived ROK 5th Regiment. Following a mortar preparation, the North Koreans entered An'gang-ni at 02:20. An hour later the command post of the Capital Division withdrew from the town and fighting became increasingly confused. By 0400 American tanks ceased firing because remnants of the Capital Division had become intermingled with North Korean forces. At daylight, G Company, US 21st Infantry, discovered that it <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> An'gang-ni, nearly surrounded by the North Koreans. ROK troops had disappeared. At 18:10, G Company withdrew from the town and dug in along the road eastward near the rest of the 2nd Battalion, 21st Infantry at the bridge over the Hyongsan-gang. North Koreans held the town and extended southward along the railroad.|$|E

5|$|The {{victory was}} well {{received}} among the Albanians, and Skanderbeg's recruits increased as documented by Geraldini: Skanderbeg {{was in his}} camp with 16,000 men and every day his camp grows with young warriors. The victory was also well received in Italy with contemporaries hoping for more such news. But, despite the Ottoman loss, the victory did not signal {{an end to the}} war. Skanderbeg's damaged forces, however, had been renewed with northern warriors and Venetian battalions. The situation remained critical, however, due to the economic hardships suffered during the siege. Skanderbeg's only expectancy was for help to come from Italy, but the Italian states, despite sending contragulatory messages, send no financial aid. Hungary continued its defensive war and thus Skanderbeg's only remaining ally was Venice. Even Venice became skeptical of continuing the war and <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> allying with Skanderbeg. Venice reported to Hungary that Mehmed had offered peace and was willing to accept it. Hungary also opted for peace, but Mehmed only sought peace with Venice in order to isolate Skanderbeg and thus peace was not signed. Skanderbeg and Venice continually began to worry about the Ottoman garrison in Elbasan. Skanderbeg led some assaults on the fortress after being urged to by Venice but failed to capture it due to lack of artillery. According to Critobulos, Mehmed was troubled after learning of the Ottoman defeat and began preparations for a new campaign. Venice itself was in conflict with its Italian neighbors who had grown wary of its increasing influence in the Balkans. With the western powers fighting among themselves, the road to Albania was open. Mehmed thus decided to send a force to subdue Albania conclusively which resulted in a new siege on Krujë.|$|E

Wessels <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> {{resisting}} the devastating bowling of Richard Hadlee, scoring 70 out of Australia's first innings total of 179. He scored only 3 in the second innings, with Australia suffering its heaviest defeat against New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless other 19th century contemporaries {{were much}} more skeptical; for example, British jurist Sir Robert Phillimore {{discussed}} the partition {{as a violation of}} international law; German jurist Heinrich Bernhard Oppenheim presented similar views. Other older historians who challenged such justifications for the Partitions included French historian Jules Michelet, British historian and politician Thomas Babington Macaulay, and Edmund Burke. Edmund Burke <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> criticizing the immorality of this act.|$|E

His team mates, however, had anticipated Walters' expectations and were hidden in the shower room. Ian Chappell, the Aussie skipper, <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the room, hunched over a newspaper crossword. Chappell looked up as Walters entered, well ahead of his fellow batsmen.

25|$|Of {{the twenty}} {{who survived the}} sinking, only one was a female. Anna Boecker was a shy, quiet maid in the {{employment}} of an elderly lady, travelling with her employer to Southampton. In the panic and confusion of the collision she had been unable to save her employer. She joined the terrified crush of passengers lowered into the first lifeboat. When it capsized under the sheer weight of numbers, Anna ended up in the ocean. All the others from her lifeboat clambered back onto the sinking ship. Anna <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the treacherous sea until the survivors in the second lifeboat spotted her foundering in the water and pulled her up to safety.|$|E
25|$|Once the anti-Venizelists came {{to power}} it became {{apparent}} that they intended to continue the campaign in Asia Minor. However, dismissal of the war experienced pro-Venizelist military officers for petty political reasons and underestimating the capabilities of the Turkish army, influenced the subsequent course of the war. Italy and France also found a useful pretext in the royal restoration for making peace with Mustafa Kemal (leader of the Turks). By April 1921 all Great Powers had declared their neutrality; Greece <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> continuing the war. Kemal launched a massive attack on 26 August 1922 and the Greek forces were routed to Smyrna, which soon fell to the Turks on 8 September 1922 (see Great Fire of Smyrna).|$|E

25|$|Stanton met {{a cabinet}} in disarray {{over the issue}} of secession. Buchanan did not want to agitate the South any further, and sympathized with the South's cause. On December 9 Buchanan had agreed with South Carolinian congressmen that the {{military}} installations in the state would not be reinforced unless force against them was perpetrated. However, on the day that Stanton assumed his position, Maj. Robert Anderson moved his unit to Fort Sumter, South Carolina, which the Southerners viewed as Buchanan reneging on his promise. South Carolina issued an ordinance of secession soon after, declaring itself independent of the United States. The South Carolinians demanded that federal forces leave Charleston Harbor altogether; they threatened carnage if they did not get compliance. The following day, Buchanan gave his cabinet a draft of his response to the South Carolinians. Secretaries Thompson and Philip Francis Thomas, of the Treasury Department, thought the President's response too pugnacious; Stanton, Black and Postmaster General Joseph Holt thought it too placatory. Isaac Toucey, Secretary of the Navy, <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> his support of the response.|$|E
500|$|In 1933, Brownlee was {{appointed}} to the Royal Commission on Banking and Currency as a representative of unorthodox economic views (despite his conservative approach to Alberta's finances - outside of the province he was viewed as a spokesperson of the progressive movement). [...] Brownlee argued that banks were treating Eastern and Western debtors unequally, and that they were charging predatory interest rates to farmers.

[...] She agreed with Alito's expectation of privacy reasoning with respect to long-term surveillance, but she went a step further, by also disputing the constitutionality of warrantless short-term GPS surveillance as well.

When Marina kisses her, Jenny sees her life going into a tailspin and forces her to reckon with herself. Jenny acknowledges her passion for Marina, but realizes that being unfaithful will ruin [...] "the one stable relationship she's ever had". However, they begin an affair.

500|$|Early breaker Denifl <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> {{front and}} had {{about two minutes}} of an {{advantage}} with [...] to go.

Pinot passed the passive Denifl before the arch signaling the last kilometer (flamme rouge) and took a solo victory. Pozzovivo finished second while Špilak settled for third. However, it became soon apparent that Dumoulin would not lose much more than the minute and a half that was his objective. He passed the line 1' 37" [...] down on Pinot.
