5|$|The Scottish Terrier {{typically}} has a hard, wiry outer coat <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft,</b> dense undercoat. The coat {{should be}} trimmed and blended into the furnishings {{to give a}} distinct Scottish Terrier outline. The longer coat on the beard, legs and lower body may be slightly softer than the body coat but should not be or appear fluffy.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{typically}} {{breed in}} small groups: the Mascarene martin builds a shallow cup nest of twigs and coarse plant material <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> inner lining, whereas Brazza's martin makes a small heap of soft material such as feathers or dry grass {{at the end}} of a typically 50-cm (20-in) tunnel in a riverbank. The normal clutch is three eggs for Brazza's martin, two for Mascarene martins on Madagascar and Mauritius, and two or three for those on Réunion. As with other swallows, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts.|$|E
5|$|Some {{robotics}} {{research is}} exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{never knew}} <b>a</b> man <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> heart or <b>with</b> <b>a</b> finer spirit. I believe as I sit here {{that if he}} were married to-morrow, his vices would fall from him like old clothes." ...|$|R
5|$|The game began {{development}} in September 1995, {{as part of}} a publishing deal with BMG Interactive. When this deal fell through, the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware also shaped the game's humour and style, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> focus look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models. The game's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games. Similarly, the game's music was created to resemble B movies.|$|E
5|$|The {{song of the}} American {{goldfinch}} is {{a series}} of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit call is often given in flight; it may also be described as per-chic-o-ree. While the female incubates the eggs, she calls to her returning mate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> continuous teeteeteeteete sound. The young begin to use a call of chick-kee or chick-wee shortly before fledging, which they use until they have left the nest entirely. There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a sweeet call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators, and a bearbee used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|There are two modern breeds of cocker spaniel, the English Cocker Spaniel and the American Cocker Spaniel. They were bred as gun dogs; to {{use their}} sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler in order to flush birds into the air to be shot, and {{to use their}} eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to {{retrieve}} the bird <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> mouth. The major differences between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller with a shorter back, a domed head and a shorter muzzle, while the English variety is taller with a narrower head and chest.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturer}} {{was acquired}} by Fazer in 1975, and in 1987 Fazer released <b>a</b> new product <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> toffee covered in chocolate and packaged in a candy wrapper, which is now named Dumle original.|$|R
50|$|Rib Mountain, {{also known}} as Rib Hill, is a glacially-eroded monadnock in central Wisconsin, located in the Town of Rib Mountain in Marathon County. Composed of {{quartzite}} covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> syenite sheath, it was intruded about 1.5 billion years ago.|$|R
25|$|The Dream Sequencer {{features}} a musical style quite disparate from its counterpart , {{telling the story}} of a trip through time from a variety of perspectives, it {{features a}} prog-infused atmospheric feeling, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> and more melodic sound than that of Flight of the Migrator.|$|R
5|$|This martin nests under a cliff {{overhang}} or on {{a man-made}} structure, building a neat half-cup mud nest <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> lining. Both adults incubate {{the two to}} four eggs and feed the chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, {{but it is more}} gregarious outside the breeding season. It feeds a wide variety of insects that are caught as the martin flies near to cliff faces. It may be hunted by large bats as well as birds of prey, but its extensive and expanding range and large population mean that there are no significant conservation concerns.|$|E
5|$|When an {{adequate}} band of attached tissue is absent, {{it can be}} recreated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> tissue graft. There are four methods {{that can be used}} to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), gingiva from the palate can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from the palate can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} austerity of post-war Britain, Larwood's business made little money. He was persuaded, largely by his erstwhile opponent Jack Fingleton, {{that he would}} find better prospects and a warm welcome in Australia, {{and he decided to}} emigrate there with his family, which by then included five daughters. On 1 April 1950 the Larwoods sailed on SS Orontes—the ship that had carried Jardine's party 18 years previously. On arrival in Australia the welcome was warm and immediate. During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel, unbeknown to them half their bills were paid by the former prime minister Ben Chifley. Despite a housing shortage, the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford, and Larwood found steady employment <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> drinks firm. Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other, and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter.|$|E
50|$|Mahamoggallana's {{stone box}} {{enclosed}} another steatite casket, {{similar to that}} of Sariputra but slightly smaller and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> surface. Inside it were two bone relics of Mahamoggallana, smaller than those of Sariputra, the larger of them being less than half an inch long.|$|R
40|$|Are we {{heading for}} <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> Brexit after the Conservatives’ electoral setback? Piers Ludlow doubts it. There {{is little to}} suggest voters were warning Theresa May off a hard Brexit. The Cabinet {{reshuffle}} is unlikely to tip the balance, and even if she returns from Brussels <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> deal {{it is far from}} clear that Labour would back it...|$|R
50|$|In-dough fat {{affects the}} texture and lift of predough. Although {{higher levels of}} dough fat may lower dough lift during baking, it also {{correlates}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> end product. <b>As</b> such, the main function of in-dough fat is to produce a desirable softness in the final croissant.|$|R
5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E

25|$|Some hand axes {{were formed}} {{with a hard}} hammer and {{finished}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> hammer. Blows that result in deep conchoidal fractures (the first phase of manufacture) can be distinguished from features resulting from sharpening <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> hammer. The latter leaves shallower, more distended, broader scars sometimes with small, multiple shock waves. However, marks left a small hard hammer can leave similar marks to a soft hammer.|$|E

50|$|Belgian pralines {{consist of}} <b>a</b> {{chocolate}} shell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer,</b> sometimes liquid, filling, traditionally made of {{different combinations of}} hazelnut, almonds, sugar, syrup and often milk-based pastes. These high-fat, low-melting point chocolates are at the luxury end of Belgian chocolate and represent an important product of many Belgian chocolatiers.|$|R

25|$|Ragtop: Originally an open {{car like}} a roadster, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> top (cloth top) {{that can be}} raised or lowered. Unlike a convertible, it had no roll-up side windows. Now often used as slang for a convertible.|$|E
25|$|Optional cups offer {{additional}} {{protection for}} contact sports and {{are made of}} hard plastic or steel, perforated for ventilation. A more flexible and comfortable soft cup is also offered for low contact sports. A flex cup variation features a hard exterior melded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> lining.|$|E

25|$|Working <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> hammer {{allows a}} knapper greater {{control of the}} knapping and reduces waste of the raw material, {{allowing}} the production of longer, sharper, more uniform edges that will increase the tool's working life. Hand axes made <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> hammer are usually more symmetrical and smooth, with rectilinear edges and shallow indentations that are broad and smooth {{so that it is}} difficult to distinguish where one flake starts and another ends. They generally have a regular biconvex cross-section and the intersection of the two faces forms an edge with an acute angle, usually of around 30°. They were worked with great skill and therefore they are more aesthetically attractive. They are usually associated with periods of highly developed tool making such as the Micoquien or the Mousterian. Soft hammer manufacturing is not reliable as the sole dating method.|$|E
25|$|The Tower usually appears {{illuminated}} {{in white}} {{light in the}} evening, but is lit in various color schemes for special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments. To mark more somber events, such as the passing of {{a former president of}} the university, the Tower remains darkened <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> grey glow through the night.|$|E
25|$|Like many breeds of island sheep, Santa Cruz sheep are {{relatively}} small and extremely hardy: they are good foragers and need no assistance with lambing. However, because of the fine–wooled breeds that they are derived from, Santa Cruz sheep are unique among formerly feral island breeds in their medium to fine wool <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> feel. Their fleeces are mostly white, but some colored sheep are known among the breed.|$|E
50|$|Featuring {{designs that}} center upon elegant, {{curvilinear}} botanical motifs, and consisting of superior materials, Amritsar carpets were intentionally manufactured to be desirable {{and easy to}} appreciate for the metropolitan collectors of London, the United States, Canada, and other Western markets. Amritsar rugs are generally made <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer,</b> earthier palette, often <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tendency to burgundy or aubergine tones.|$|R
50|$|Pink Bubbles Go Ape is {{the fourth}} studio album by German power metal band Helloween, {{released}} in 1991. It marked the departure of guitarist Kai Hansen, with Roland Grapow replacing him. Musically it was written <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer,</b> less epic, and sometimes humorous approach, which would be later fully implemented in the band's following album Chameleon (1993).|$|R
50|$|The {{front and}} rear spring rates have been increased, and the {{internal}} valving of the dampers revised. New front damper mounting brackets are fitted together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> front anti-roll bar. These changes, {{in combination with the}} revised wheel/tyre equipment, provide a nose down rake and slightly lowered ride height, and produce the driving characteristics described above.|$|R
