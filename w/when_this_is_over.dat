A month before this, Capaldi stated [...] "This could be my final year it's terrifying, I love Doctor Who {{but it can be}} an insular world and I do want to do other things. There will come a time <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> but I knew that when I started.

30|$|Now the Downloading Phases are overlapping, {{and both}} the master and the slave proceed the {{download}} without cooperation. The overall system can be improved by adding a proxy server working as an intermediate processing unit between the master phone and the web server (see Figure 6). This approach {{is referred to as}} Proxy Enabled Web Browsing. The master phone sends the header request of the specified web page to the proxy instead of sending it directly to the web server. Upon receiving the request, the proxy establishes a TCP connection to the web server forwarding the request for the header. The proxy is now in charge of the Web Page Processing Phase. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> the Web Page Components Downloading Phase starts. In this second approach, the proxy does the job that previously was done by the master phone in the Web Page Processing Phase.|$|E

40|$|The goal {{of storage}} is to {{maintain}} the characteristics that seeds have immediately after processing; however, <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>over</b> longer periods, storage may cause loss in quality. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of treatment with insecticide and fungicide on corn seeds harvested in kernel form and in the ear over the time of storage in two environments for 360 days. The seeds were subjected to the following treatments: T 1 - control; T 2 - Deltamethrin + Pirimiphos-methyl + Fludioxonil; T 3 - Deltamethrin + Pirimiphos-methyl + Fludioxonil + Thiamethoxam; T 4 - Thiamethoxam, and T 5 - Fenitrothion. They were then placed in paper bags and stored in two environments, in a cold room with an average temperature of 16 ºC and RH of 60 % and in a non-controlled environment (an average room temperature of 25 ºC and RH of 70 %) located in the municipality of Pelotas, RS, Brazil. Every four months (0, 120, 240 and 360 days), seed germination and vigor was evaluated by the first count of germination test and cold test. Reduction in germination and vigor of corn seeds, conditioned by the insecticides and fungicide used in the seed treatment, vary according to the product and the time over which the seeds remain stored. The seeds harvested in the ear show lower loss of physiological quality than those harvested in kernel form...|$|E
40|$|First paragraph:  The enemy must fear us. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> {{there will}} be much more fear in the world. […] Give the {{government}} an ultimatum. Say, “This was just the trailer. Just wait till you see the rest of the film. ”   The overhanging statement – which draws attention to troubling links interconnecting action cinema and acts of terrorism – is delivered towards the end of Dan Reed’sTerror in Mumbai(UK, 2009), an insightful documentary that unfolds a balanced enquiry into the November 2008 massacre by the South Asian terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (the Army of the Righteous). The film weaves hours of phone intercepts between a Pakistani handler and Lashkar-e-Tayyaba agents into a collage of recovered CCTV footage, live news reportage, survivor testimonies and interviews. The documentary also embeds alarming images from Mohammed Ajmal Kasab’s interrogation, the sole captured terrorist, as he describes his background, training, and the motivation behind his participation in the attacks. The mosaic film thus builds up a complicated three-dimensional story that offers viewers an atypical glimpse into and behind this phenomenon. The police interview with Kasab in particular sheds rare light into a dark world of hate, want, and ignorance lurking behind extremist violence; where war, poverty, destitution, death, exclusion, indoctrination and inculcated desires lead to desperate acts. These sketchy details immediately complicate banal one-dimensional tabloid narratives of Islamic terrorists being inhuman embodiments of pure Evil. Thus, contra the aphorism that proposes “if you do not understand why terrorists do what they do, then it might be because you are watching it on television” (Whittaker 91), Reed’s televisual documentary allows viewers to perceive these South Asian terrorists as flawed and desperate human beings who are forged in pressurized crucibles of poisonous socio-political forces, discourses, factors, and actors. At the same time, the film refrains from painting the inverse picture, wherein the West becomes the geopolitical straw man solely responsible for producing this growing army of anonymous ideological puppets. As such, Reed’s multi-perspectival treatment of this complicated subject matter emerges as a thought-provoking ethical documentary about early twenty-first century terrorist violence...|$|E

I’m sorry I’ve been so lousey [sic] about writing honey but with the Christmas rush and History, etc. both {{of us have been}} pretty busy. I’m at work right now in the first free period I’ve had in several days. The weather has been bad down here and consequently everyone flies the link then. I’m getting to like it more everyday. It’s fun teaching this stuff. We got a tough break here, they closed the Women’s Clinic the first of November. We found an excellent Doctor in Selma however, so don’t worry. The prices are high as hell down here though, it seems that Selma is a medical center and all the Doctors here (there are hundreds) are the best. So we think we picked {{the best of the best}} so don’t worry, hon. Dottie has been going regularly and everything is O. K. ! It’s a shame that the Clinic had to close but we’ve been watching our pennies and I know everything will be honkey-donkey! I got your Xmas packages off today. It’s a very small Christmas as I promised, but there’s a lot of thought behind it honey, and we both wish all of you at home the very merriest Christmas you ever had, followed by a very prosperous and Happy New Year!!!! I hear you had some snow around home, boy I wish I could see it, it never snows down here. However it’s been quite cold here lately, today has been the coldest yet. I sent in my fourteenth Unit in History this morning, so far they have all come back marked about ninety. Only two more to go! I’ll be glad <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>over.</b> I think I’ll take a radio course when I’m through this one. As Bobbie knows I’m not so good at radio work. How’s Ace’s photography getting along. What kind of a camera has he got? Some of my equipement [sic] is stored away somewhere. He can use it if he wants to. I guess you know w{{here it is}} hon. Thanks for sending us some sheets angel. We haven’t gotten the house yet but we ought to soon. Craig was made a Tactical Field Friday at midnight so there should be an exodus of personnel here in the near future. I’m so glad to hear the G. D. [F]ullers are out. I wish I’d been there to boot her one in the ass! These scientists are looking for things to test the Atomic Bomb on why don’t they use her? I was worried about what that nut might do to you she’s so damned jealous of you. Don’t ever give her a chance Mom, that dame is a crackpot. When you see the Van Alen’s again give them my regards, they’re truly wonderful people. I hope Kenneth’s cold is all better, give him a hand shake from uncle, he’s getting to [sic] old for kissin! It’s so nice to realize that we’re all together again, how if we were home everything would be perfect. We send our love to all of you, Nan, Joe, Ken, Ace, Bobbie, Rickey, Ronnie, and to you my sweet Mom. A very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from you[r] lovin’ chillin’s— Dottie 2 ̆ 6 Judd O O O X X X Love 2 ̆ 6 Kisses from my link trainer. [Transcription ends...|$|E
