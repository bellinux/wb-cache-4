And {{even if it}} were a rendition, we understand as a government what our obligations are with respect to anyone who is rendered by this government to another country, and that is that we seek to satisfy ourselves {{that they will not be}} tortured.

Although Morrison suggested that an individual aggrieved by such a law could bring a claim for relief under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, he argued that such a claim {{is unlikely to be}} successful because the law will likely be upheld when reviewed under the rational basis test. The rational basis test asks [...] "there is some rational relationship between disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{reflecting}} on the casting of James Pickens, Jr., Spotnitz called him [...] "another great find", adding that [...] "so {{many times over the}} course of the series we just got so lucky with the actors that we cast in these guest parts and just kept bringing them back because they were so wonderful. That's what happened with William B. Davis as the Cigarette-Smoking Man and with Nick Lea as Krycek, and with Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner, and that's <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> with James Pickens. Just a fantastic actor, not at all like this person, really transformed himself to play this part". Spotnitz thought that, for a viewer who had weekly been watching The X-Files sixth season, there was a great sense of gratification when—in the final moments of [...] "One Son"—Spender essentially withdraws and tells Kersh that Mulder has been right, all along, precisely because the last thing that Kersh wanted was for Spender to behave in this way.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} Benioff {{said about}} Daenerys Targaryen's transformation during the series, [...] "I think Dany's been becoming a Targaryen {{ever since the}} beginning of Season 1". According to Weiss, [...] "She's not her father and she's not insane and she's not a sadist, but there's a Targaryen ruthlessness that comes with even the good Targaryens". Benioff concluded, [...] "If you're one of the lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come and you get word of <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. You've got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she has a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she's got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she has three dragons who are now pretty close to full grown. So if she can {{make it all the way}} across the Narrow Sea and get to Westeros, who's going to stand in her way?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The Conservative government's {{move was}} {{seen by many as}} {{motivated}} by a desire to destroy the Liberal party and cripple all other parties, not by concern over taxpayer dollars.

500|$|On September15,2000, US songwriters Seth Swirsky and Warren Campbell filed {{a lawsuit}} against Carey at the [...] 9th Circuit for {{copyright}} infringement, [...] "reverse passing off" [...] and false designation, claiming that [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] borrowed heavily from a song they composed called [...] "One of Those Love Songs". It was recorded by the R group Xscape in 1998 for their album Traces of My Lipstick. The lawsuit claimed that Carey wrongfully gave the songwriting credits to Jam and Lewis. Swirsky and Campbell had sold the rights of the song to So So Def Recordings in 1998. [...] "I'm a fan of Mariah Carey; this is nothing personal against her. But I really do believe there's accountability, and it's very clear <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here.</b> I've never sued anybody before", Swirsky said. According to the district court, an expert witness (chair of the Musicology Department at the University of California at Los Angeles) determined that the songs shared a [...] "substantially similar chorus". The expert stated that although the lyrics and verse melodies of the two songs were different, the songs' choruses [...] "shared a 'basic shape and pitch emphasis' in their melodies, which were played over 'highly similar basslines' and chord changes, at very nearly the same tempo and in the same generic style." [...] He noted both the songs had their choruses sung in the key of B. The expert further remarked that [...] "the emphasis on musical notes" [...] on the two songs was the same, which [...] "contribute to the impression of similarity one hears when comparing the two songs." [...] He presented a series of visual transcriptions of his observations. The transcriptions contained details about the pitch sequence of both the songs' chorus, melody, and bassline.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2013 David Cameron {{became the}} first serving British Prime Minister to visit the site, laid a wreath at the memorial, and {{described}} the Amritsar massacre as [...] "a deeply shameful event in British history, one that Winston Churchill rightly described at that time as monstrous. We must never forget <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> and we must ensure that the UK stands up for the right of peaceful protests". Cameron did not deliver an official apology.|$|E
2500|$|... “The simple {{interpretation}} is that genetic rescue doesn’t work,” said Dr. Vucetich, {{an assistant professor}} of wildlife ecology at Michigan Technological University. “But <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>here</b> is that when the immigrant came in 1997, in the decade that followed, the moose population declined radically. It’s plausible that we didn’t see an effect because the wolves were suffering from some other trouble that disguised the benefit. What if wolf No. 93 had never arrived? Dr. Vucetich said {{that it is impossible to}} know for sure, but the Isle Royale wolves might have disappeared completely. It may be that the Old Gray Guy arrived just in time." ...|$|E

Second, the pharmaceutical sector is the most important internationally as far as the registration of trademarks is concerned - <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>here</b> has a powerful influence elsewhere.
