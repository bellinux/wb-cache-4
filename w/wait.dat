40|$|Besley, Hall, and Preston (1999) {{estimated}} a {{model of}} the demand for private health insurance in Britain as a function of regional <b>waiting</b> lists and found that increases {{in the number of people}} <b>waiting</b> for more than 12 months (the long-term <b>waiting</b> list) increased the probability of insurance purchase. In the absence of <b>waiting</b> time data, the length of regional long-term <b>waiting</b> lists was used to capture the price-quality trade-off of public treatment. We revisit Besley et al. ?s analysis using Australian data and test the use of <b>waiting</b> lists as a proxy for <b>waiting</b> time in models of insurance demand. Unlike Besley et al., we find that the long-term <b>waiting</b> list is not a significant determinant of the demand for insurance. However we find that long <b>waiting</b> times do significantly increase insurance. This suggests that the relationship between <b>waiting</b> times and <b>waiting</b> lists is not as straightforward as is commonly assumed. <b>waiting</b> time, <b>waiting</b> lists, health insurance, regional aggregation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Strategic {{customers}} {{take their}} <b>waiting</b> time into consideration upon making decisions. While satisfactorily completed service increases utility of a customer, <b>waiting</b> {{to be served}} decreases this utility in a queueing type service system. In this system, <b>waiting</b> can be classified into two: in queue <b>waiting</b> and in service <b>waiting.</b> Unlike the literature, proposed model assumes <b>waiting</b> in a queue, while other customers are being served, differs from <b>waiting</b> in service where the former one decreases the utility of a customer more. This paper analyzes decision making of a customer under this assumption. Comparing decision of the customer under proposed assumption and literature assumption, this paper shows that in queue <b>waiting</b> differs in service <b>waiting.</b> Index Term [...] Strategic customer, M/M/ 1, in queue <b>waiting,</b> in service <b>waiting,</b> observable queues, unobservable queue...|$|R

40|$|<b>Waiting</b> {{for care}} {{has been and}} {{continues}} to be a major issue for the healthcare sector in Canada. While considerable gains have been made regarding valid and reliable information on <b>waiting</b> times, gaps remain.

The survey offers several advantages, including <b>waiting</b> time information that is comparable across time and space, enhanced patient information and information regarding patients’ experiences in <b>waiting</b> for care. The results for 2005 indicate that median <b>waiting</b> time for all specialized services was between 3 and 4 weeks and remained relatively stable between 2003 and 2005. <b>Waiting</b> times for specialist visits did not vary by income. In addition to being asked how long they <b>waited,</b> individuals were asked about their experiences in <b>waiting</b> for care. While the majority of individuals <b>waiting</b> for care indicated that their <b>waiting</b> time was acceptable, there continues to be a proportion of Canadians who feel they are <b>waiting</b> an unacceptably long time for care.

Data were summarised across the care categories and health districts to present the total number and percentage of people <b>waiting</b> for care and who have <b>waited</b> beyond the desirable period. As of 31 December 2012 there were 130 546 people on the dental <b>waiting</b> list; of these 85. 8 %, 8. 5 % and 2. 2 % were <b>waiting</b> for general care desirable within 24, 12 and 3 months, respectively.

40|$|<b>Waiting</b> time is an {{important}} issue in service operations management because of its impact on customer satisfaction and operations capabilities. This paper examines <b>waiting</b> time from a social and psychological perspective. It provides a conceptual framework which identifies social and psychological factors that affect perceptions of <b>waiting.</b> The conceptual framework enables service managers to rethink operational issues, such as layout design, process choices, and service delivery from customers' perceptions of <b>waiting.</b> Assimilation-contrast theory suggests that perceived <b>waiting</b> time be linked to expected <b>waiting</b> time and its gap leads to customers' overall evaluation of service. A customer's willingness to accept delay is related to the causes for delay as explained by attribution theory. Approaching <b>waiting</b> time from a stress management theory, this paper provides service managers with various stress-reduction mechanisms such as giving customers advance notice of expected <b>waiting</b> time, speeding up pre-process <b>waiting</b> time, and acknowledging customers' rights to quick service. These practical suggestions can aid service managers in reducing perceived <b>waiting</b> time, enhancing customers' <b>waiting</b> experience, and improving queue management.
