5|$|A female P. labiata {{more often}} pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey. While it more often catches small jumping spiders than larger ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web spiders up to twice P. labiata′s size. A female P. labiata is effective against insects up to twice P. labiata′s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's <b>web,</b> <b>and</b> against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in the open. A female P. labiata very seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in her own <b>web,</b> <b>and</b> is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E

Web application is an interactive one since it came into being. How to model <b>and</b> test <b>Web</b> interactions is a challenge in software engineering. Web navigation models are useful to clarify requirements and specify implementation behaviors. <b>Web</b> frameset <b>and</b> <b>Web</b> browsers interactions are wildly used in todays Web applications. The behaviors of <b>Web</b> frameset <b>and</b> <b>Web</b> browser interactions changed the traditional <b>Web</b> navigation <b>and</b> influence the functionalities of Web applications. In this study, we took <b>Web</b> frameset <b>and</b> <b>Web</b> browsers interactions into account and proposed an approach to modeling the <b>Web</b> applications navigation <b>and</b> generating tests with <b>Web</b> framesets <b>and</b> browsers interactions. The construction formal semantics of structure composition of Web frameset is give out. Based on the formal semantics, the Web navigation with Web framesets is modeled. The Extended Browser Loading Model with <b>Web</b> frameset (EBLM) <b>and</b> the extended FSM is employed to formalize the navigation models with <b>Web</b> framesets <b>and</b> browsers interactions and a FSM Test-Tree (FSM-TT) is constructed using present construction algorithm. At last, test generation is given out which satisfies the corresponding coverage criteria. This study resolves the following research problems: (1) propose an approach to modeling Web applications with <b>Web</b> framesets <b>and</b> <b>Web</b> browsers interactions, (2) give the formal construction semantics of <b>Web</b> frameset <b>and</b> (3) formalize the navigation model and generating tests...|$|R
