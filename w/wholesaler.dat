Relationship among <b>wholesalers</b> (toke) and smallholder farmers isreferred {{to as the}} patron-client relationship. In such a relationship, the <b>wholesalers</b> arecalled patron, while smallholders are called clients. The research objective was todetermine the marketing channels of oil palm fresh fruit bunches (FFB) of swadaya-scheme farmers and to analyze the factors which lead to patron-client relationship. Theresearch was conducted in Mahato and North Tambusai Village, North Tambusai Sub-District, Rokan Hulu District. This research used survey method.

40|$|As in the past, <b>wholesalers</b> {{that have}} a weak ability to collect fruit and {{vegetables}} have depended on the transfer from <b>wholesalers</b> and secondary <b>wholesalers</b> in another wholesale market {{that have a}} stronger ability. In recent years, however, more that more of these weak <b>wholesalers</b> are acquiring the formal buying right for different, stronger, wholesale market. This paper aims to clarify the significance of <b>wholesalers</b> acquisition of such formal buying rights. the analysis yielded the following results. First, the institutional characteristic of such collecting with a formal buying right compared to transfer are the payment is through the official payment system of the wholesale market, the cost of credit investigation {{and the risk of}} bill collection are shared by authorized buyer's unions and a bill adjustment company, and the incentive for payment by the deadline is provided by supply-side <b>wholesalers</b> to collection-side <b>wholesalers.</b> Second, the merits for supply-side <b>wholesalers</b> are reduced cost of credit investigation and lower risk of bill collection by using official payment systems of their wholesale markets, swift bill collection, and securing of collection-side <b>wholesalers</b> as stable buyers. Third, the merits for collection-side <b>wholesalers</b> are obtaining discretion for transportation, reliable collection, the ability to collect from many <b>wholesalers</b> and secondary <b>wholesalers</b> in the market, and a certain part of the payment of charges is refunded as an incentive for full payment by the due date. These merits for both supply-side and collection-side <b>wholesalers</b> are leading more and more <b>wholesalers</b> to acquire the formal buying right for another wholesale market...|$|R

Poppe of Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS), the company which operated one the city tramways. This time the plans were slightly changed, with the route proposed built with a tramway {{rather than as a}} railway. In particular, the line was to connect to the Gamleby Line (then called the Oslo Line) of KSS's network and run up Ekeberg to an intersection between Ekeberveien and Kirkeveien. The plans called for a regular street tram with regular city tram vehicles. At the time, the city limits of Oslo went at Sjømannskolen. The application for the part within Oslo was sent to the city, while for the section outside the city, the application was sent to the Ministry of Labour. Within Oslo, a new line would only have to be built from Oslo Hospital to Sjømannskolen, while from Oslo Hospital to the city center, the line would follow the Gamleby Line.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study on the}} {{measures}} to provide vegetables and fruits for food service industry by leading <b>wholesalers</b> in wholesale markets. Conclusion is as follows: 1) The supply for food service industry by these <b>wholesalers</b> started from 2000 's, and as yet has a small market share in these companies but is increasing rapidly. 2) These <b>wholesalers</b> fix the monthly sale price for the previous month and get the weekly order from the previous week from food service industries. Both the sale price and quantity to food service industries are decided in the longer span than large scale retailers which fix the price a week before and order the previous day. 3) Some <b>wholesalers</b> sell vegetables and fruits through secondary <b>wholesalers,</b> others sell directly to food service industries. In the case of the latter, <b>wholesalers</b> conduct the delivery function by themselves. 4) These <b>wholesalers</b> procure vegetables and fruits mainly from agricultural cooperatives because agricultural cooperatives are the main suppliers for wholesale markets and can build trace back systems easier than middlemen. 5) The procurement of vegetables and fruits is classified into contract dealing and spot dealing. In the case of contract, <b>wholesalers</b> fix price and quantity at planting period. But it is very risky for <b>wholesalers</b> to procure all vegetables and fruits by contract, so <b>wholesalers</b> partially purchase from spot markets. Even in the case of spot, <b>wholesalers</b> procure vegetables and fruits from suppliers which can assure the traceability...|$|R
