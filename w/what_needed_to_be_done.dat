5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, {{the ability to see}} at a glance <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E
5|$|From Liverpool's {{point of}} view, the {{situation}} was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley, who had succeeded him as manager, {{even to the point}} of actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> But, as a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had to point out to Shankly that he didn't work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he had things which he wanted to do with the team.|$|E

25|$|The {{passing of}} the Land Drainage Act 1930 held promise for the future. The many bodies {{responsible}} for small parts of Somerset's flood defences were swept away, and replaced by the Somerset Catchment Board. More importantly, perhaps, {{they did not have}} to prove that benefits would occur to a particular community in order to issue rates for drainage work, but could raise rates based on the rateable values of properties. This should have worked, but they soon became apprehensive, and reverted to producing reports, which were not actioned. However, inactivity gave way to action in 1939, when a new engineer was appointed, who saw it as his job to direct <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Work began on improvements to the King's Sedgemoor Drain in 1939. The items to be addressed were the size of the channel, the size of the bridges, and the size of Dunball clyse, all of which were too small. The onset of the Second World War, just a few months later, threatened to stop the scheme, but did not.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the capital}} {{investment}} needed to build the railroad was generated by selling government-guaranteed bonds (granted per mile of completed track) to interested investors. The Federal donation of right-of-way saved money and time as {{it did not have}} to be purchased from others. The financial incentives and bonds would hopefully cover most of the initial capital investment needed to build the railroad. The bonds would be paid back by the sale of government-granted land, as well as prospective passenger and freight income. Most of the engineers and surveyors who figured out how and where to build the railroad on the Union Pacific were engineering college trained. Many of Union Pacific engineers and surveyors were Union Army veterans (including two generals) who had learned their railroad trade keeping the trains running and tracks maintained during the U.S. Civil War. After securing the finances and selecting the engineering team, the next step was to hire the key personnel and prospective supervisors. Nearly all key workers and supervisors were hired because they had previous railroad on-the-job training, knew <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> and how to direct workers to get it done. After the key personnel were hired, the semi-skilled jobs could be filled if there was available labor. The engineering team's main job was to tell the workers where to go, what to do, how to do it, and provide the construction material they would need to get it done.|$|E

500|$|Napoleon {{maintained}} strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; {{he had to}} win {{at everything}} he attempted. He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine history to ask what Hannibal or Alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, [...] "Give me lucky generals", aware that [...] "luck" [...] comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it. Dwyer states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805–06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility.|$|E
500|$|After the {{aircraft}} had landed at Gardermoen at 17:20, contact was established between Keč {{and the police}} negotiator Morten, who also had been the prime negotiator during Aeroflot Flight 137, a hijacking that also had taken place at the airport. Keč predominantly spoke English and insisted that he simply {{be referred to as}} [...] "the Bosnian". He immediately informed that he had not hurt any of the crew or passengers, and that he was not affiliated with anyone. His immediate demands were that official representatives were to tell the world <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to solve the conflict in Bosnia. He then gave a presentation of the situation and that his only intentions were to help his countrymen. For several minutes, the conversion was about the lack of help Keč felt was being given to his home country.|$|E

The mix of European physicists and his own students—a group including Robert Serber, Emil Konopinski, Felix Bloch, Hans Bethe and Edward Teller—busied themselves calculating <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> and in what order, to make the bomb.|$|E

To do so he spent {{several days in}} London where {{he spoke to the}} US Military Attaché, Colonel William Lassiter, and various British officials. Dodd {{submitted}} his report to the AEF on 20 June 1917 with a recommendation on <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Dodd first used the term [...] "Air Service" [...] in a memo to the {{chief of staff of the}} AEF on 20 June 1917. The term also appeared on 5 July [...] 1917, in AEF General Order No. 8, in tables detailing staff organization and duties. The Air Service, American Expeditionary Forces was formally created on 3 September 1917 when General Order 31 was published, and remained in being until demobilized in 1919. Dodd, however, had been superseded as Aviation Officer by Colonel William Mitchell, who outranked him. Mitchell replaced Dodd on 30 June 1917, with the position renamed [...] "Chief of Air Service" [...] and its duties changed and rewritten.|$|E

Patriarch Karekin II asked the attendees at the meeting <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> and the opinion that emerged from the meeting was that the Armenians in Turkey needed to communicate with the society at large. The group held a widely covered press conference, followed by monthly press events and eventually formed Agos.|$|E

2500|$|Kutuzov {{returned}} to the Russian Army in 1776 and again served under Suvorov - in the Crimea - {{for the next six}} years. He learned that letting the common soldier use his natural intellect and initiative made for a more effective army. Suvorov also taught him how to use mobility in order to exploit the constantly changing situation on the battlefield. By 1782 Kutuzov had been promoted to brigadier general as Suvorov recognised Kutuzov's potential as a shrewd and intelligent leader. Indeed, Suvorov wrote that he would not even have to tell Kutuzov <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in order for him to carry out his objective. [...] In 1787 Kutuzov was again wounded in the left temple, in almost exactly the same place as before, and again doctors feared for his life.

2500|$|By 2004, it {{had become}} obvious to the Windows team at Microsoft that they were losing sight of <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to {{complete}} the next version of Windows and ship it to customers. Internally, some Microsoft employees were describing the Longhorn project as [...] "another Cairo" [...] or [...] "Cairo.NET", referring to the Cairo development project that the company embarked on through {{the first half of}} the 1990s, which never resulted in a shipping operating system (though nearly all the technologies developed in that time did end up in Windows 95 and Windows NT.) Microsoft was shocked in 2005 by Apple's release of Mac OS X Tiger. It offered only a limited subset of features planned for Longhorn, in particular fast file searching and integrated graphics and sound processing, but appeared to have impressive reliability and performance compared to contemporary Longhorn builds. Most Longhorn builds had major Explorer.exe system leaks which prevented the OS from performing well, and added more confusion to the development teams in later builds with more and more code being developed which failed to reach stability.|$|E
2500|$|These events {{known as}} the Haymarket Riots angered many people and gave a bad {{impression}} of the labor unions due to the violence that they had incurred. [...] However, protests such as these helped to make an impression upon the industrial heads. [...] It made them start {{to realize that they}} were going to have to make changes for the workers or suffer the consequences. [...] The Haymarket Riots were one of the things that set the era of worker reform into motion to help millions of people improve their lives. [...] Working to reform the eight-hour day paid off eventually and continues on today. [...] This showed the people in charge that laborers were no longer willing to be treated so inhumanely and that they would do <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in order to change what they wanted. [...] Because of this push for the eight-hour day, doors were open for reform of other unfair treatments of laborers. [...] It helped to work towards a more just labor system in general. [...] Young Jay Fox had been a part of this at the age of sixteen; he had helped in a cause to make a difference. [...] Not only this but he was able to leave behind writings that let future generations know what had happened in his account of the event “I Was At Haymarket.” [...] Through this piece of writing he showed what was going on at the time, what people decided to do about the unfair treatment, and the injustice of the authorities handling the situation.|$|E

2500|$|Empire State Inc. hired William F. Lamb, {{from the}} {{architectural}} firm Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, {{to design the}} building. Lamb produced the building drawings in just two weeks, using the firm's earlier designs for the Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as a basis. Meanwhile, Lamb's partner Richmond Shreve created [...] "bug diagrams" [...] of <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> simultaneously, coordinating tasks to the hour. Because of the 1916 Zoning Act, Lamb could not build a structure with walls that ascended straight up from the street; instead, {{they were required to}} incorporate setbacks, making the lower floors much larger than the upper floors. As a result, the tower was designed from the top down, which gave it a [...] "pencil"-like shape. During the design process, Raskob put a large pencil on a table and asked Lamb, [...] "How high could you make it so it won't fall down?" [...] The original plan for the building was slated to be 50 stories, but the height was later increased to 60 and then 80 stories. The planned 80-story building, with a height of about , would have height limits on nearby buildings ensuring that the top fifty floors would get expansive views of the city. The New York Times lauded the site's proximity to transportation, with the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit's 34th Street station and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad's 33rd Street terminal one block away, as well as Penn Station two blocks away and the Grand Central Terminal nine blocks away at its closest.
