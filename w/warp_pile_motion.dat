By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain velvets have been woven {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two simple warp tensioning systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for the <b>pile</b> <b>warp.</b> 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (spaced dyed) pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 striped warps mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of velvet (cut and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (cut or uncut). All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of the <b>pile</b> <b>warp,</b> which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose pile uniformly covers the whole fabric surface. 3 This velvet can be woven on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation <b>warp</b> and <b>pile</b> <b>warp</b> separately tensioned with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. Solid velvet <b>pile</b> <b>warps</b> can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all the <b>pile</b> <b>warps</b> are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two pile shafts and two <b>pile</b> <b>warps,</b> one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single <b>pile</b> <b>warp</b> in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, the pile shafts 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of the two pile shafts. This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each pile shaft separately on uniformly tensioned warp beams or with live weights. Without separate tension, a recurring build-up of slack pile ends will interfere with smooth weaving and an even pile height...|$|R

50|$|Bergama carpets are woven with {{symmetric}} knots. <b>Warps,</b> wefts and <b>pile</b> {{are made}} of sheep wool. The knotting density of around 12 knots per cm² is rather coarse. They are typically three to four meters square in size. Bergama carpets often show nicely woven Kilim ends, sometimes with an integrated pile-woven pattern.|$|R
50|$|A knotted-pile carpet is {{a carpet}} {{containing}} raised surfaces, or piles, from the cut off ends of knots woven between the warp and woof. The Ghiordes/Turkish knot and the Senneh/Persian knot, typical of Turkish carpets and Persian carpets, {{are the two}} primary knots. A flat or tapestry woven carpet, without pile, is a kilim. A pile carpet is influenced by width and number of <b>warp</b> and weft, <b>pile</b> height, knots used, and knot density.|$|R
50|$|Turkmen carpets can be woven {{with both}} symmetric, and {{asymmetric}} knots, {{open to the}} left and to the right. Irregular knots are also frequent, including missed warps, knots over three or four warps, single warp knots, or knots sharing one warp, are seen, both symmetric and asymmetric. Often warps are deeply depressed. <b>Pile,</b> <b>warp</b> and weft yarns are excellently balanced. The ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1. Rugs woven in this manner are very dense and durable.|$|R
50|$|An oriental rug is woven by {{hand on a}} loom, with <b>warps,</b> wefts, and <b>pile</b> made {{mainly of}} natural fibers like wool, cotton, and silk. In {{representative}} carpets, metal threads made of gold or silver are woven in. The pile consists of hand-spun or machine-spun strings of yarn, which are knotted into the warp and weft foundation. Usually the pile threads are dyed with various natural or synthetic dyes. Once the weaving has finished, the rug is further processed by fastening its borders, clipping the pile to obtain an even surface, and washing, which may use added chemical solutions to modify the colours.|$|R
25|$|Fragments of pile rugs from findspots in {{north-eastern}} Afghanistan, reportedly {{originating from}} {{the province of}} Samangan, have been carbon-14 dated to a time span {{from the turn of}} the second century to the early Sasanian period. Among these fragments, some show depictings of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for <b>warp,</b> weft, and <b>pile,</b> the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets. Every three to five rows, pieces of unspun wool, strips of cloth and leather are woven in. These fragments are now in the Al-Sabah Collection in the Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah, Kuwait.|$|R
50|$|The Persian carpet or Persian rug is an {{essential}} and distinguished part of Persian culture and art, and dates back to ancient Persia.Persian carpets are classified by the social setting {{in which they were}} woven (nomads, villages, town and court manufactories), by ethnic groups (e.g. Kurds, nomadic tribes such as the Qashqai or Bakhtiari; Afshari, Azerbaijani, Turkmens) and others, or by the town or province where carpets are woven, such as Heriz, Hamadan, Senneh, Bijar, Arak (Sultanabad), Mashhad, Isfahan, Kashan, Qom, Nain, and others. A technical classification for Persian carpets is based on material used for <b>warps,</b> wefts, and <b>pile,</b> spinning and plying of the yarn, dyeing, weaving technique, and aspects of finishing including the ways how the sides (selvedges) and ends are reinforced against wear.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{additional}} instruments {{are used for}} packing the weft. Some weaving areas in Iran known for producing very fine pieces use additional tools. In Kerman, a saber like instrument is used horizontally inside the shed. In Bijar, a nail-like tool is inserted between the warps, and beaten on in order to compact the fabric even more. Bijar is also famous for their wet loom technique, which consists of wetting the warp, weft, and yarn with water throughout the weaving process to compact the wool and allow for a particularly heavy compression of the <b>pile,</b> <b>warps,</b> and wefts. When the rug is complete and dried, the wool and cotton expand, which results in a very heavy and stiff texture. Bijar rugs are not easily pliable without damaging the fabric.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{textbook}} on Persian carpets, still famous amongst carpet collectors today, A. C. Edwards {{has documented}} how {{he set up}} OCM's rug production in the western Iranian town of Hamadan. This region was characterized by a tradition of rural village rug weaving, no rugs were woven in the town itself by 1912. Edwards started with eight looms, {{set up in a}} small workshop. By 1948, when Edwards retired, more than 1,000 looms were active in the town, with the largest workshop operating 120 looms. He describes in detail the technical and quality criteria which OCM had defined for their production. Several factors were taken into account: The type of knot which was to be used (i.e., symmetrical or [...] "turkish" [...] vs. asymmetrical or [...] "persian"), the knot density, twisting and thickness of the yarns used for <b>warps,</b> wefts, and <b>pile,</b> the section of appropriate colours, the patterns and motifs of the rug design, always considering the costs of goods and labour.|$|R
2500|$|The town of Bijar lies around [...] {{northeast}} of Sanadij. Together, these two towns and their surrounding {{areas have been}} major centers of rug production since the eighteenth century. Carpets woven in Bijar and the surrounding villages show more varied designs than Senneh rugs, {{which has led to}} the distinction between [...] "city" [...] and [...] "village" [...] Bijar rugs. The Bijar rug is distinguished by its highly packed pile, which is produced by a special technique known as [...] "wet weaving", {{with the help of a}} special tool. <b>Warps,</b> weft and <b>pile</b> are constantly kept wet during the weaving process. When the finished carpet is allowed to dry, the wool expands, and the fabric becomes more compact. The fabric is further compacted by vigorous hammering on nail-like metal devices which are inserted between the warps during the weaving. Alternate warps are moderately to deeply depressed. The fabric is further compacted by using wefts of different thickness. Usually one of three wefts is consideravly thicker than the others. The knots are symmetrical, at a density of 60 to over 200 per square inch (930–2100/dm2), rarely even over 400 (6200/dm2).|$|R

Kuba rugs are classified as town rugs, with dense ornamentation, high knot density, and short <b>pile.</b> <b>Warps</b> are made of wool, not dyed and dark ivory. Wefts are of wool, wool and cotton, or cotton. One of two wefts is often deeply depressed. Knots are symmetrical. Plain-woven Soumakh ends of dark wool or light blue cotton are frequent, white cotton soumakhs are rare. The fringes are braided, pleated, or artistically knotted. The selvedges are mainly round (in that case, in dark blue wool) or 0.3-1 cm wide and made of light blue wool, reinforced over two ribs by figure-of-eight wrapping with supplemental threads. The colours are dark and the rugs look hardly polychrome {{despite the fact that}} they use 10-12 different colours, because their ornaments are small and arranged densely on the rug. The majority of Kuba rugs have a dark blue background. Red or dark red rarely occur, sometimes ivory, rarely yellow and hardly any green.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{by means}} of Contact Dynamics simulations the transient dynamics of a 2 D granular <b>pile</b> set into <b>motion</b> by applying shear velocity during a short time interval to all particles. The spreading dynamics is directly controlled by the input energy whereas in recent studies of column collapse the dynamics scales with the initial potential energy of the column. As in column collapse, we observe a power-law dependence of the runout distance {{with respect to the}} input energy with nontrivial exponents. This suggests that the power-law behavior is a generic feature of granular dynamics, and the values of the exponents reflect the distribution of kinetic energy inside the material. We observe two regimes with different values of the exponents: the low-energy regime reflects the destabilization of the pile by the impact with a runout time independent of the input energy whereas the high-energy regime is governed by the input energy. We show that the evolution of the pile in the high-energy regime can be described by a characteristic decay time and the available energy after the pile is destabilized...|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{analysis}} of bridge structures is often performed using the substructure method {{in which the}} foundation is replaced by an equivalent "spring" representing foundation impedance. Ground motions from seismic hazard analyses correspond to a free-field condition, and therefore should be modified to account for kinematic soil-structure interaction effects before being used as input to the springs. This paper presents closed-form analytical solutions for the response of an elastic pile subjected to harmonic seismic excitation in uniform elastic soil. We use these solutions to compute transfer functions relating foundation input motion to free-field ground motion and use the results to verify predictions from a beam-on-Winkler-foundation numerical model. The two approaches show good agreement, indicating that the numerical modeling method is appropriate for investigating more complex effects such as soil and <b>pile</b> nonlinearity. Ground <b>motion</b> deamplification due to kinematic SSI is demonstrated to be significant for stiff foundations in soft ground conditions. Numerical simulations using recorded ground motions demonstrates that transfer functions can be computed only from frequency bands for which the motions contain adequate energy...|$|R

Plants are useful for treating a variety of diseases of man and also animals. The Chichawatni Plantation Forest located in Sahiwal District is designated as Reserve Land. This involves huge biological landscape, constituting numerous valuable medicinal plants. The aim of this specific study has been to document conventional knowledge of plant usage and its significance to the local people; identifying the flora; assess the abundance and measures necessary to be taken for protection of plant species. Ethno-medicinal questionnaire had been got filled by people residing in the periphery of Chichawatni Plantation Reserved Forest. This questionnaire provided information about many plants growing at study area. Some of the plants having medicinal value included Trianthema portulacastrum, Calotropis procera, Xanthium strumarium, Cordia myxa, Chenopodium album, Citrullus colocynthis, Cuscuta reflexa, Cyperus rotundus etc. Local people use them for treating anemia, paralysis, fever, jaundice, <b>piles,</b> diabetes, diarrhea, <b>motion</b> respectively. Some of the plants such as Capparis deciduas, Prosopis cineraria, Salvadora oleoides, Suaeda fruticosa and Malvastrum coromendelianum were present in less number perhaps because of overexploitation as having greater medicinal importance, indicating requirement of their preservation. There is need for sustainable use and conservation of useful medicinal plants in the area so that their constant availability is ensured...|$|R
60|$|It {{has been}} said that the Hurons did not observe the sudden {{disappearance}} of Hurry. In his present situation he was not only hid from view by the platform, but, as the Ark drew slowly ahead, impelled by a sail that was now filled, he received the same friendly service from the piles. The Hurons, indeed, were too intent on endeavoring to slay their Delaware foe, by sending a bullet through some one of the loops or crevices of the cabin, to bethink them at all of one whom they fancied so thoroughly tied. Their great concern was {{the manner in which the}} Ark rubbed past the <b>piles,</b> although its <b>motion</b> was lessened at least one half by the friction, and they passed into the northern end of the castle in order to catch opportunities of firing through the loops of that part of the building. Chingachgook was similarly occupied, and remained as ignorant as his enemies of the situation of Hurry. As the Ark grated along the rifles sent their little clouds of smoke from one cover to the other, but the eyes and movements of the opposing parties were too quick to permit any injury to be done. At length one side had the mortification and the other the pleasure of seeing the scow swing clear of the piles altogether, when it immediately moved away, with a materially accelerated motion, towards the north.|$|R
40|$|Woven in Iran {{during the}} seventeenth century, the {{magnificent}} velvet {{that is the}} subject of this paper (figure 1) testifies to the splendor of the reign of the Safavid Shahs (1501 - 1722). A curious blending of Persian and European elements, it features four women holding various objects against the backdrop of a flowering landscape. The figures stand along the weft axis. The fragment in figure 1, from the collection of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York, features a full technical repeat unit, measuring over seven feet in warp direction, and 28 inches, or the full loom width, in weft direction. For Safavid silk weaving, this is an enormous technical repeat unit. The velvet is woven of silk; the numerous colors of the pile are formed by the labor intensive Persian technique of <b>pile</b> <b>warp</b> substitution. The background of the design is formed of gold wefts; the ponds along the lower selvedge, of silver wefts; and selected details are embellished by silver loops. Despite the European elements in the pattern, the technical details of its weave structure leave no doubt that this velvet was woven in Iran. 1 Its magnificence and extravagance suggest t,hat it was a court, and probably a royal, commission. This paper shall examine only one aspect of this velvet, the pattern, and discuss what might be its meaning. Even more narrowly, it will only examine those elements seeming to derive from European art. The Persian elements are of equal importance, but given the theme of this conference, textiles and trade, analysis will be limited to the European, hence alien, elements. Due largely due to the ambition and vision of Shah Abbas I (1587 - 1629), a new era in Persia 2 ̆ 7 s relations with the West began at the end of the sixteenth century. To bypass Ottoman control of overland routes to the West, Abbas I courted and rewarded the interests of the European trading companies, particularly the English and the Dutch. These commercial relationships were to have long-lasting repercussions for the Iranian economy and culture. 2 Persian art was changed irrevocably. Abbas I 2 ̆ 7 s xenophile tendencies, including relative tolerance towards Christians and a genuine interest in European art and culture, were to be characteristic of most of the later Safavid Shahs, particularly Abbas II (1642 - 1666). Although starting out slightly later than their English rival, the Dutch East India Company quickly made up for lost time. A national institution with vast resources, the Dutch East India Company overwhelmed all European rivals from the 1640 s through 1670 s. ...|$|R
40|$|Pile {{foundations}} are {{the most}} known and used deep foundation technique in civil engineering to support structures. This research treats the problem of dynamic pile loading in both steady state and transient conditions, when a non-axial load is applied at the pile head. The objective of the present research is to investigate the effects of non-axial loading on the dynamic axial pile response. A horizontally coupled axial soil reaction (so-called impedance) is first developed in harmonic loading for a soil disk based on analytical and semi-analytical solutions. Then, coupled soil impedances are introduced into the <b>pile</b> equation of <b>motion</b> to solve the pile-soil vibration problem. It is concluded that the soil disk impedance {{as well as the}} axial pile-soil response in coupled analysis are affected by the lateral load depending on the loading intensity, soil parameters, frequency, etc. Transient pile loading as imposed by high strain dynamic loading tests (a pile driving test) are addressed {{in the second part of}} the thesis. Full-scale pile tests from three sites are considered: Limelette (Belgium), Tessenderlo (Belgium), and Loon-Plage (France), where measurements of axial and flexural pile resistance are presented. An analytical solution and a numerical program to take into account the non-axial pile behaviour are proposed. The analytical solution provides a first indication of the transient pile bending in pile driving. The numerical model (called LPDM for Lateral Pile Driving Model) is more advanced than the proposed analytical solution and gives an insight of the whole problem including non-axial pile head impact, axial and lateral pile and soil vibrations. Finally, the hypoplastic soil model for sandy soils is integrated into LPDM to account for large deformations and non-linear behaviour of the soil. Hypoplastic parameters for Brusselian sand, located in the Limelette site, are calibrated based on advanced laboratory tests. The axial pile response recorded from in-situ pile tests is better fitted by LPDM simulations where both low and high strain behaviour of the soil are well captured. A parametric analysis is also performed to generate axial-lateral interaction diagrams of a soil disk subjected to a pile translation. (FSA - Sciences de l) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
