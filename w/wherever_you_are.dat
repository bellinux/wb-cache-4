5|$|In {{recording}} Revelation, Third Day {{aimed to}} produce a southern rock album while being more creative musically; the band felt the end result was their best record to date. As a whole, the album is noted as adopting a heavier and edgier rock sound than Third Day's previous adult contemporary-projects such as <b>Wherever</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> (2005), while the album's lyrics reflect Christian themes. The album features guest appearances from Chris Daughtry, Lacey Mosley of alternative metal band Flyleaf, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph.|$|E
5|$|Revelation was {{released}} on July 29, 2008 and debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, selling at total of 75,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was their best week to date in both sales and chart position; their previous career high was when their 2005 album <b>Wherever</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> debuted and peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, selling a total of 63,000 copies. Revelation also debuted at #1 on the Christian Albums chart, their fourth career number-one album on that chart, at No. 2 on the Rock Albums chart, and at No. 6 on the Digital Albums chart. In 2011, the album peaked at No. 3 on the Top Catalog Albums chart.|$|E
25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and <b>wherever</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> capable of going.|$|E

500|$|Revelation {{possesses}} a heavier, edgier rock sound {{than many of}} Third Day's previous albums, which leaned towards an adult contemporary sound; this is particularly noticeable when compared to 2005's <b>Wherever</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are.</b> The opening track [...] "This Is Who I Am" [...] is a southern rock song seen by reviewers as demonstrating the band's confidence and security in their musical style. Its lyrics call for God to accept people for their flaws and make them better. [...] "Slow Down" [...] is a rock song featuring backing vocals from Chris Daughtry of the rock band Daughtry and lyrics asking that God [...] "pace our lives". [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Call My Name", is a pop rock song, while [...] "Run to You" [...] is a mid-tempo ballad set in 6/8 time.|$|E

Kitty Empire, writing for The Observer, {{said that it was}} a [...] "low key treat" [...] that contained [...] "effortless prettiness." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Andy Beta called the album [...] "daring and expansive" [...] and said that [...] "the scope and ambition of Morning/Evening is profound, and will hopefully inspire producers to take bigger chances and not be satisfied with pop- or club-friendly lengths." [...] NME called [...] "Morning Side" [...] "one of the most moving pieces of music Hebden has ever put his name to" [...] and said the album ranked [...] "alongside Four Tet's very best work." [...] Critic Nina Corcoran of Consequence of Sound said that [...] "Hebden has done what he does best: create an atmosphere so encompassing that you lose sight of <b>wherever</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> while you're listening". Spins Dan Weiss called the album [...] "ambitious" [...] and [...] "beautiful in its own right, if you’re patient." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1990s, INXS {{achieved}} a greater fan following through Hutchence's romance with fellow Australian singer Kylie Minogue, and achieved greater acclaim in the United Kingdom. However, starting with Welcome to <b>Wherever</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are,</b> in 1992, they achieved less {{success in the}} United States. After Hutchence {{was found dead in}} his hotel suite in Sydney in November 1997, the band did not perform publicly for a year. They made appearances with several guest singers, including Jimmy Barnes, Terence Trent D'Arby and Jon Stevens; Stevens formally joined the band for a tour and recording session in 2002. In 2005, members of INXS participated in , a reality television series broadcast worldwide, culminating in the selection of their new lead singer, Canadian J.D. Fortune. With Fortune, the band released [...] "Pretty Vegas" [...] and [...] "Afterglow" [...] as singles, and the album Switch.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} amount of the correspondence between Fronto and Marcus has survived. The pair were very close. [...] "Farewell my Fronto, <b>wherever</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> my most sweet love and delight. How is it between you and me? I love you {{and you are not}} here." [...] Marcus spent time with Fronto's wife and daughter, both named Cratia, and they enjoyed light conversation. He wrote Fronto a letter on his birthday, claiming to love him as he loved himself, and calling on the gods to ensure that every word he learned of literature, he would learn [...] "from the lips of Fronto". His prayers for Fronto's health were more than conventional, because Fronto was frequently ill; at times, he seems to be an almost constant invalid, always suffering—about one quarter of the surviving letters deal with the man's sicknesses. Marcus asks that Fronto's pain be inflicted on himself, [...] "of my own accord with every kind of discomfort".|$|E
2500|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 20th century in the Pirot District, south-eastern Serbia, the head of household would go out to his woodpile, where he would invite German (pronounced [...] ) – a male mythological being associated with bringing rain and hail. He would take with him a loaf of bread called good luck, prepared particularly for this ritual, rakia, wine, and a wax candle. At the woodpile, he would shout three times, [...] "German, German, <b>wherever</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> come to dinner right now, and in the summer do not let me see your eyes anywhere!" [...] He would then light the candle, take a sip of rakia, taste some bread, drink wine, and go back into his house. Asked what happened with German, he would answer, [...] "He came, so we dined and drank amply of rakia and wine, and then we parted." [...] This ritual was intended to prevent summer hailstorms.|$|E

How many millions of yards of the thick, excellent, but hateful material the Italian government must have provided I don't know: but enough to cover Italy with a felt carpet, I should think. It is everywhere. It cases the tiny children in stiff and neutral frocks and coats, it covers their extinguished fathers, and sometimes it even encloses the women in its warmth. It is symbolic of the universal grey mist that has come over men, the extinguishing of all bright individuality, the blotting out of all wild singleness. Oh democracy! Oh khaki democracy! ...|$|R
2500|$|In October 2009, {{electronic}} musician Ulrich Schnauss's record labels, Independiente and Domino, sued Guns N' Roses, {{alleging that}} the band had committed copyright infringement by using portions of his compositions in the song [...] "Riad 'n the Bedouins". The suit alleges that the portions used were from Schnauss' 2001 <b>Wherever</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> and 2003 A Strangely Isolated Place. Brian Caplan, attorney for Domino, stated that they first contacted the Geffen label on February 26. The label [...] "attempted to explain [...] away", Caplan told the New York Daily News [...] "They tried to justify it." [...] Guns N' Roses vigorously denied the allegations. Guns N' Roses manager Irving Azoff stated that [...] "The snippets of 'ambient noise' in question were provided {{by a member of}} the album's production team who has assured us that these few seconds of sound were obtained legitimately." [...] Going further, he added [...] "While the band resents the implication that they would ever use another artist's work improperly and are assessing possible counterclaims, they are confident this situation will be satisfactorily resolved." [...] The two labels are seeking $1 million in damages against Geffen for the unauthorized use of the composition samples.|$|E
2500|$|Welcome to <b>Wherever</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> was {{released}} in August 1992 but INXS did not tour to support the album. It received good critical reviews and went to No.1 in the UK and in Sweden; No.2 in Australia and Switzerland, and No.3 in Norway; but had less chart success in the U.S. peaking at No.16. Also in August 1992, Helena Christensen and Hutchence were walking after drinking heavily when he refused to move for a taxi. The taxi driver then assaulted him, causing him to fall backwards and hit {{his head on the}} roadway. Hutchence suffered a fractured skull in the altercation. Hutchence did not immediately seek medical assistance for the injury, instead waiting several days before seeing a doctor. As a result, Hutchence's fractured skull left him with an almost complete loss of the sense of smell and significant loss of taste. This led to periods of depression and increased levels of aggression; he had not fully recovered after two weeks in a Copenhagen hospital. According to INXS bandmate Beers, Hutchence pulled a knife and threatened to kill him during the 1993 recording of Full Moon, Dirty Hearts on the isle of Capri. [...] "Over those six weeks, Michael threatened or physically confronted nearly every member of the band. Suicide blonde, right?" ...|$|E
