This methodology allows the definition of a number of competitiveness indicators based on the performance and setting of an industrial sector, and their implicit relationships. In this way it is possible to obtain a Competitiveness Index that allows a company to know its relative position with respect to other companies in the sector, and establish a ranking of the companies ordered by their competitiveness level <b>within</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> industrial sector.|$|R

40|$|The Glyoxalase {{system is}} {{composed}} of two metalloenzymes, Glyoxalase I and Glyoxalase II, that catalyze the conversion of toxic, metabolically produced alpha-ketoaldehydes, such as methyglyoxal, {{in the presence of}} a thiol cofactor, such as glutathione, into their corresponding nontoxic 2 -hydroxycarboxylic acids, leading to detoxification of these cellular metabolites. Previous studies on the first enzyme in the Glyoxalase system, Glyoxalase I (GlxI), in yeast, protozoa, animals, human, plants and Gram-negative bacteria suggest two metal activation classes, zinc-activation or non-zinc-activation (but exhibiting selective nickel/cobalt-activation).

40|$|Employing {{livestock}} {{to manipulate}} vegetation {{is as old}} as grazing itself. Promoting grazing to manage vegeta-tion as a paid service – typically called prescribed or targeted grazing – is a more recent phenomenon. As target-ed grazing has gained a foothold in the land management arena, both research and experience have evolved to provide land managers and grazing service providers with more definitive tools for managing vegetation. This handbook represents a compilation of the latest research on harnessing livestock to graze targeted vegetation in ways that improve the function and appearance {{of a wide variety of}} landscapes. The handbook is organized both as an introduction to targeted grazing for the novice and as a useful reference for those already familiar with the topic. The chapters can be studied collectively or individually, depending on a reader’s needs, and they’re written toward an audience that includes livestock producers, land managers, landown-ers, grazing enthusiasts, or simply interested observers. Readers will note that the same topics appear more than once throughout the handbook, for example, discus-sions on animal diet selection, fencing, predators, and integration with other vegetation management tools. In each instance, the editors have tried to assure that the topics are in context and germane to <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> <b>discussion.</b> Organization The sequence of topics is designed so that the firs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{integrated}} building performance simulation can substantially help in improving a building design {{with regards to}} comfort levels and fuel consumption, while reducing emission of greenhouse gasses. However, the traditional tools that are closed for inter-communication, limit the modeler to use of components only available <b>within</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> package. This paper gives an overview of distributed simulation approach that can alleviate above limitation. Each program can represent {{only a part of}} a building system that is able to model, exchanging the necessary information during the execution and bridging the gaps between the tools. Several important issues closely connected with its implementation, such as synchronization, are pointed out, and the sensitivity of a model on different coupling strategies is studied. The paper concludes with highlighting the gained flexibility in modeling and simulation of building performance that arises from the distributed approach...|$|R
50|$|The {{selected}} watersheds have {{to implement}} a system of practices that address nitrogen and phosphorus generation. MRBI approved practices help avoid, trap, and control nutrients from agricultural runoff. Multiple core and supporting conservation practices provide options for producers depending on their location and existing operations. Approved core practices were selected based on what proved to be most important in reducing the downstream loading of nutrients. Core practices include planting cover crops, constructing grassed waterways or riparian forest buffers, and wetland creation or enhancement. The NRCS allowed State Conservationists to choose supporting practices that address the primary water concerns <b>that</b> have developed <b>within</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> state. Supporting practices include pasture and hayland planting, deep tillage in fields, field borders, and constructing a water and sediment control basin. Payment is received as the implementation of core and supporting practices proceed in a selected watershed.|$|R

Under this premise the present work tries to explain the importance of Industrial Ecology and propose its implementation in an industrial park in Valencia. We analyse some companies and their possible interrelations, by creating synergies between them. A project which involves five companies is proposed and some synergies are identified.

40|$|Abstract This master thesis {{explores the}} impact of {{entrepreneurial}} communities on entrepreneurs. It aims to advance {{the understanding of the}} relevance of the social capital concept <b>within</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> field of entrepreneurship research. This qualitative research study addresses the research question in the context of Startup Grind, a global entrepreneurial community. The data consists of 32 interviews with chapter directors conducted in Silicon Valley in February 2015. The data suggests a relationship between social interaction, social capital and potential entrepreneurial outcomes. The data also unveils elements that cannot be explained within the concept of social capital. This is particularly true for the concept of inspiration. It seems that inspiration plays an important role among community members in order to pursue their entrepreneurial endeavor. However, inspiration hardly finds any acknowledgment in the existing entrepreneurial literature. Finally, the study suggests that {{the impact of}} entrepreneurial communities can occur on multiple levels, which should be accounted for in future research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture for an agent based personalised electronic program guide. It provides the user both with content and collaborative based recommendations. The user’s viewing profile is represented as separate categories of interest such as dramas and game shows, where each category {{in turn is}} made up of programs the user liked and disliked. The profile is continuously updated via feedback to represent the user’s changing viewing preferences. Further these profiles are used to dynamically form viewer groups, which is a process of pre-clustering users based on their viewing profiles. When one user within a group discovers a new and interesting program which they have watched and enjoyed then this information gets disseminated to every user <b>within</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> group. These groups are dynamically updated to reflect the users evolving viewing preferences over time. The system also supports a multi-modal interaction interface allowing the user to interact with more than one interaction interface in any given time...|$|R
5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, {{a fundamental shift}} in the punishment of murderers may have occurred {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, the punishment of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, that is, that the offended family was given full licence in how to mete out what they deemed to be an appropriate punishment to the murderer of a family member. <b>Within</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of the punishment by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|R
