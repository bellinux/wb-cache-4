5|$|Later on June20, {{convection}} {{near the}} center of circulation began to decrease–an indication of weakening–and the eye was no longer visible. Upper-level wind shear rapidly increased to 55km/h (35mph), preventing re-intensification of the cyclone. Taking a more northward track than anticipated, Linfa began to interact <b>with</b> <b>land</b> and was downgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC on June21. Around 1230UTC, the storm made landfall in southern Fujian as a tropical storm with winds of 85km/h (50mph 10-minute winds). Deep convection rapidly dissipated shortly thereafter due to interaction <b>with</b> <b>land.</b> Several hours later, the JTWC downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression. The following day, the JMA also downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression as the storm moved away from the Chinese coastline. The system later dissipated just offshore; a circulation was no longer evident on satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} systems made {{landfall}} shortly after weakening from a Category5. This weakening {{can be caused by}} dry air near land, shallower waters due to shelving, interaction <b>with</b> <b>land,</b> or cooler waters near shore. In southern Florida, the return period for a Category5 hurricane is roughly once every 50 years.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{weakened}} after interacting <b>with</b> <b>land,</b> and the JTWC downgraded it to a typhoon on October 6 as {{it emerged}} into the South China Sea. An area of high pressure built over China, pushing Angela towards the southwest. Wind shear {{over the area}} weakened somewhat, and the typhoon re-intensified. However, as it passed south of Hainan, the cyclone again weakened due to the interaction <b>with</b> <b>land.</b> At 0600 UTC on October 10, Angela struck the coast of Vietnam and moved ashore. The JTWC issued their final advisory on the system at 1200 UTC, at which time the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm, to a tropical storm six hours later, and to a tropical depression early on October 11.|$|E

5|$|A band of {{convection}} formed {{northeast of}} Greg early on September7, inducing moderate to strong northeasterly wind shear on the cyclone. Combined <b>with</b> <b>land</b> interaction, the storm weakened to tropical storm intensity by 18:00UTC that day, and Greg made landfall near Cabo San Lucas three hours later, with winds of 60mph (95km/h). After turning west-northwest and then west, the cyclone moved over progressively cooler waters {{and continued to}} lose strength, although a small area of deep convection persisted. Greg weakened to a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September8 before succumbing to the unfavorable environment and dissipating a day later west of Baja California Sur.|$|E

5|$|Fishermen have {{traditionally}} used seabirds {{as indicators of}} both fish shoals, underwater banks that might indicate fish stocks, and of potential landfall. In fact, the known association of seabirds <b>with</b> <b>land</b> was instrumental in allowing the Polynesians to locate tiny landmasses in the Pacific. Seabirds have provided food for fishermen away from home, as well as bait. Famously, tethered cormorants {{have been used to}} catch fish directly. Indirectly, fisheries have also benefited from guano from colonies of seabirds acting as fertilizer for the surrounding seas.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated {{with the}} legal hassles that went <b>with</b> <b>land</b> speculation, in 1788, Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia).

In 1791, {{he was elected to}} the Virginia legislature for the third time. He contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping.|$|E
5|$|Gert {{continued}} to move northwest after becoming a tropical storm, and reached a peak intensity of 45mph (70km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1005mbar (29.68inHg). Gert made landfall just 6miles (10km) {{to the southeast}} of Pánuco, still at peak intensity, at 10:00p.m. CDT (0000 July 25, UTC). However, due to its interaction <b>with</b> <b>land,</b> the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression strength early on July 25, and became a remnant low twelve hours after that. Six hours later, just a day after it made landfall, it dissipated over the mountains of central Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Later on January2, the {{combination}} of the subtropical ridge to the north, an approaching mid-latitude trough and moderate to strong westerlies caused Severe Tropical Storm Cyprien to turn towards the southwest. Slight weakening took place shortly before the storm made landfall in Morombe; maximum winds decreased to 50mph (85km/h 10-minute winds). Increased wind shear and interaction <b>with</b> <b>land</b> caused the deep convection to become substantially displaced to the east from the center of circulation. Early on January3, Cyprien was downgraded to a tropical depression by both agencies; however, some areas were still reporting gale-force winds. It turned to the northeast over land, dissipating late on January3.|$|E

5|$|Postan {{argued that}} {{demography}} {{was the principal}} driving force in the medieval English economy.
