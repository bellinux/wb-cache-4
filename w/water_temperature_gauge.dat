2500|$|Initially, the Escort {{was sold}} as a two-door saloon (with {{circular}} front headlights and rubber flooring on the [...] "De Luxe" [...] model). The [...] "Super" [...] model featured rectangular headlights, carpets, a cigar lighter and a <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b> A two-door estate was introduced {{at the end of}} March 1968 which, with the back seat folded down, provided a 40% increase in maximum load space over the old Anglia 105E estate, according to the manufacturer. The estate featured the same engine options as the saloon, but it also included a larger, [...] clutch, stiffer rear springs and in most configurations slightly larger brake drums or discs than the saloon. A panel van appeared in April 1968 and the 4-door saloon (a bodystyle the Anglia was never available in for UK market) in 1969.|$|E
50|$|Instruments {{were limited}} to a speedometer, a fuel gauge and a <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{state of}} the car is {{monitored}} by a brace of custom Jaeger instruments all bearing the Monica name. Gauges include a speedometer, tachometer, oil temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge, ammeter, <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> fuel gauge, and clock.|$|E
5000|$|... 1962: [...] "De Luxe" [...] and [...] "Super" [...] {{designation}}s discontinued. [...] "Super de Luxe" [...] designation introduced. Modified {{instrument panel}} now included oil pressure and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{standard}} (GL) single cab Datsun 720 {{came with}} a front bench seat made of single color non-patterned cloth and leather in blue, black, or tan to match the interior trim color of the vehicle. It had optional factory air-conditioning and contained a simple gauge cluster with speedometer, fuel, and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges</b> (with blank faces {{in place of the}} tachometer and clock), as well as sliding glass rear window. A radio and cruise control were options installed by the dealership. These vehicles came in long bed, short bed, or cab-and-chassis styles with the later having a [...] "heavy duty" [...] option of dual rear wheels.|$|R
5000|$|... 1968 - The R16 TS is introduced. It {{features}} a new 1565cc engine, an all-new instrument panel {{that includes a}} tachometer and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> and many other new features including two-speed windscreen wipers, rear defroster, passenger reading light, and optional powered windows.|$|E
50|$|The car {{tested by}} The Times also had white leather {{upholstery}} and deep lambswool carpets, tachometer, ammeter, oil gauge, clock, headlamp flasher (vital) and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b> Further extras were: a laminated wood steering wheel to maintain firm grip (by soaking up sweat), automatic red caution lights on open doors, a reading light, cigar lighter, twin-speaker radio and {{an air blower}} to demist the rear window.|$|E
50|$|The Bedford CA was {{designed}} {{in an era}} when semi-conductor devices were state-of-the-art, and not affordable for automotive applications. Water temperature was thus measured mechanically, via a capillary tube connected to capsule containing a volatile liquid. The capsule was screwed into the body of the water pump. As the engine coolant temperature increases, the volatile liquid expands, altering the pressure on a mechanical linkage in the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> which moves the position of the needle. Later models used an electric gauge.|$|E
50|$|Inside {{the cabin}} the padded vinyl {{dashboard}} was characterised by a concave horizontal fascia, finished in grey anti-glare crackle-effect paint. Four round instruments were inset in the fascia {{in front of}} the driver. The larger diameter inner pair were tachometer and speedometer; the outer ones were smaller combination instruments, the left hand one holding oil pressure and fuel level gauges, the right hand one oil and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges.</b> The steering wheel was non-dished, with three aluminium spokes, a thin bakelite rim and a centre horn button. Vinyl-covered seats with cloth centres and a fully carpeted floor were standard, while leather upholstery was an extra-cost option.After initially marketing it as a four-seater, Alfa Romeo soon changed its definition of the car to a more realistic 2+2.|$|R
5000|$|Inside {{there were}} {{separate}} front seats trimmed in PVC with leather {{as an option}} and two circular instruments {{in front of the}} driver one containing the speedometer and the other, fuel and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges.</b> De Luxe models from the second dashboard update in 1959 included glove box locks. [...] The gear change was floor-mounted. The heater was an optional extra. The windscreen wipers were powered by the inlet manifold vacuum; when the engine was working hard, the vacuum fell away and the wipers slowed or stopped. The dashboard was revised twice; the binnacle surrounding the steering column was replaced by a central panel with twin dials towards the driver's side in 1956; the last from 1959 had twin dials in a binnacle in front of the driver and 'magic ribbon' AC speedo similar to the 1957 E-series Vauxhall Velox/Cresta and '58/'59 PA models.|$|R
50|$|A {{new version}} of the Giulietta Berlina debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1959. Mechanical changes were limited to {{shifting}} the fuel pump from the cylinder head to a lower position below the distributor, and moving the previously exposed fuel filler cap from the tail to the right rear wing, under a flap. The bodywork showed a revised front end, with more rounded wings, recessed head lights, and new grilles with chrome frames and two horizontal bars. The rear also showed changes, with new larger tail lights on vestigial fins, which replaced the earlier rounded rear wings. The interior was much more organized and upholstered in new cloth material; the redesigned dashboard included a strip speedometer flanked by two round bezels, that on the T.I. housed a tachometer and oil and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges.</b> The T.I. also received a front side repeater mounted in a small spear, unlike the Normale which kept the earlier small round lamp with no decorations. During 1959 the type designation for all models was changed from 750 and 753 to 101.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> is {{replaced}} by warning lamp on dashboard, grille shield {{is replaced}} by lion.The optional automatic transmission (which is now 6 positions: PRN 3 2 1) is available {{until the end of}} 1974.In May 1975, production of European passenger models ceased. [...] By this time Peugeot customers in Europe strongly favoured the newer 304 and 504 models, and French 404 production was much reduced, with only 15,780 - all berlines/saloons/sedans produced during the first five months of 1975.|$|E
50|$|The {{dashboard}} is lit using electroluminescent {{panels in}} the gauge pods {{and on a}} call-out strip across the dash. This system did not use bulbs; instead, an inverter and transformer raised the battery voltage to over 100 volts AC and passed that high voltage through special plastic layers, causing the gauges to glow with a blue-green light. Instead of a <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> the Chrysler Turbine has a Turbine Inlet temperature gauge with numbers 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. All 55 turbine cars used identical ignition keys.|$|E
50|$|The RZV500R was {{designed}} {{exclusively for the}} Japanese home market although many have been exported privately. The RZV500R features upgraded parts not found on the standard RD500LC and RZ500. A major difference is the hand-welded aluminium frame, which is significantly lighter than the steel version used on standard models. The <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> also doubles as a fuel tank contents gauge at {{the push of a}} RHS lever (very useful feature given their fuel consumption) and the front-fork preload can be altered {{from the top of the}} forks. There is also a red light mounted within the tachometer housing that comes on at the equivalent of 55 mph (Japanese maximum national speed limit). The speedo is of course calibrated in KPH.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study quantifies for {{the first}} time the {{influence}} of flow regulation on the river thermal behaviour of an ungauged basin located in central-eastern Argentina. A 30 -day data set of continuous summer hourly data was assembled for eight <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauging</b> sites deployed along the main channel upstream and downstream from the impoundment. Analysis methods include descriptive statistics of daily temperature data, classification of diurnal regimes by relative differences in the ‘shape’ and the ‘magnitude’ of the thermographs (RSMC), and quantification of the climatic sensitivity of <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> regimes using a sensitivity index. Results revealed that temporal fluctuations in <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> were linked to meteorological drivers; however, spatial variability in the shape and the magnitude of the thermographs revealed the effects of the dam in regulating river thermal behaviour downstream. <b>Water</b> <b>temperatures</b> immediately below the dam were reduced notably; diurnal cycles were reduced in magnitude, delayed in timing, and revealed overall climatic insensitivity and high temporal stability in regime shape. Dam effects persisted along the 15 -km stretch monitored, although declined in the downstream direction. These findings provide new scientific understanding about the river water quality and inform river management about potential shifts in summer <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> with great implications for the diversity and lifecycles of Neotropical river fauna. The use of the RSMC and sensitivity index approaches in <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> assessment is novel and has wider applicability for quantifying river thermal regimes and their sensitivity to drivers of change over a range of temporal and spatial scales...|$|R

50|$|The two-door sportsman's Weymann saloon was a {{comfortable}} 4-seater and {{two-thirds of the}} roof could be folded back. The safety glass windscreen could be opened to avoid turbulence and allow an unobstructed view in poor weather. Instruments included a fuel gauge and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b> A cupboard was fitted {{either side of the}} instruments. There was a scuttle ventilator, two interior lights and ashtrays for all seats. Rear passengers were given an arm roll either side. The doors were very wide and the front seats could slide and had hinged backrests. A small part of the front section of the window in each door could be wound down out of sight with a quick action handle. There were tools under the front cushions and a spare wheel and tyre in a well on the left hand side front mudguard A coachbuilt saloon was also available anda seven-seated coachbuilt limousine de luxe. A range of specialised bodies by leading coach builders remained available.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 American ECD came {{standard}} with a 170 gross hp [...] inline six engine with a single-barrel Carter carburetor, electronic ignition, 266 degree camshaft, and 7.6:1 {{compression ratio}} with regular cooling system. Included were manual front disk brakes with rear drums, power steering, {{heavy duty suspension}} with front sway bar, Chrysler TorqueFlite A904 three-speed automatic transmission, and 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The exterior of the model incorporated a full vinyl roof with bright moldings, regular bright molding package (wheel lip, rocker panels, drip rails, and between taillights molding), luxury wheel covers, [...] "American" [...] and [...] "Automático" [...] emblems on the rear panel, [...] "258" [...] emblems on rear quarter panels, and golden [...] "ECD" [...] emblems over {{the base of the}} C-pillars.

2500|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} the new , 9.5:1 compression ratio [...] six-cylinder engine with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor. It was VAM's second self-engineered engine, taking the Javelin up to performance levels of its V8 competition. The Go Pack version of this engine took the car to its zenith in terms of performance. The new engine was announced by two [...] "4.6" [...] emblems on both front fenders. The only other technical difference of the new version was a 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for units equipped with automatic transmission. The interior saw more changes starting with all-new non-reclining high-back bucket seats with built-in [...] "J" [...] emblems on the seat backs {{as well as on}} the center of the rear seat back. The dashboard was restricted to the unit with woodgrain overlays only; the instrument cluster was once again completely different from the AMC Javelins. The right pod housed a clock and tachometer hybrid with the same design and appearance as the US Rallye Pak units, except that it was tuned for six cylinder engines. The center pod had a 240km/h speedometer, a range that put it on par as an equivalent to AMC's 140 MHP unit of the Rallye Pak; but the colors, graphics, and typography of the dial were the same as the standard gauges. This created a high contrast between the speedometer and the clock/tack hybrid. On the left pod were the fuel and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges</b> with no oil pressure and ammeter gauges present. Like the AMC Javelins, the car now held a single dome light at the center of the headliner and a new brake pedal design for units with automatic transmission.|$|R
