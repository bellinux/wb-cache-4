5|$|American {{public opinion}} blamed the {{violence}} on British interference in American affairs through financial and munitions {{support for the}} Indians. This led to a further deterioration of relations with Britain and was a catalyst of the War of 1812, which began six months later. By the time the US declared war on the United Kingdom in June 1812, Tecumseh's confederacy was ready to launch its war against the United States in alliance with the British. In preparation, the Natives soon rebuilt Prophetstown. Frontier violence in the region would continue until <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> War of 1812, although Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the Battle of the Thames.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{problems}} with the original design, in summer 1542 work recommenced on the castle, <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> initial invasion scare was over, lasting until August 1543. The decision to rectify the problems with the castle may have been taken by King Henry himself. Oxenbridge appears to have stayed on as the pay master and acted as the master of the works, with von Haschenperg remaining in his role as engineer almost {{until the end of the}} project, despite the difficulties with his earlier work. The cost of the second phase of work was much higher than the first, around £10,000.|$|E
5|$|Following the French colonization, the {{language}} of instruction and media changed from Malagasy to almost exclusively French. Moreover, the first French governor-general, Gallieni, also encouraged the French officials to learn Malagasy as <b>well.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> advent of the Malagasy independence, the Madagascans tried to reinstate Malagasy as a language of instruction especially in secondary schools. However, {{the language}} policy was inadequately planned and Malagasy was struggling to surpass French as {{the language of}} instruction.|$|E

5|$|In his {{political}} tracts, written <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Conservative Party's demise, I. C. Filitti preserves the orthodox conservative principles of Maiorescu. His attachment to boyar tradition was expanded into {{a critique of}} centralized government, etatism and Romanian liberalism. Toward {{the end of his}} life, he supported the dictatorial regime known as National Renaissance Front.|$|E
5|$|Incidents {{had also}} {{occurred}} in the Soviet space program, but due to the government's policy of secrecy, these were not disclosed until <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Apollo 1 fire. Cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko died on March 23, 1961, from burns sustained in a fire while participating in a 15-day endurance experiment in a high-oxygen isolation chamber, {{less than three weeks}} before the first Vostok manned space flight; this was disclosed on January 28, 1986.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
50|$|On April 28, 2010, Hyper Magazine {{released}} its 200th issue. Daniel Wilks was the then editor of Hyper since 2007 and the 200th issue was his last. He then passed the baton onto deputy editor Darren <b>Wells,</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> {{success of the}} 200th issue release.|$|R

On April 11, 2016, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> hiatus, the series returned to Investigation Discovery for a sixth season. The series was renewed for a seventh season, which premiered March 26, 2017.|$|R
5|$|Lava Fork volcano is {{associated}} {{with a small group of}} related volcanoes called the Iskut-Unuk River Cones. This forms part of the much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which extends from the Alaska–Yukon border to near the port city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Eruptive activity at The Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic studies have shown that The Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400years; this is <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> last glacial period, which ended about 10,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Nick Saban {{resigned}} as Toledo's head coach on February 13, 1991, after one season to become defensive {{coordinator of the}} National Football League's Cleveland Browns under Bill Belichick. As defensive coordinator for the New York Giants, Belichick had to postpone assembling his new coaching staff until after Super Bowl XXV. Therefore, Saban's resignation wasn't announced until <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> season had ended. Additionally, Saban wanted any potential move to occur after February 6, National Signing Day for recruits.|$|E
5|$|The CPS men served without {{wages and}} minimal {{support from the}} federal government. The cost of {{maintaining}} the CPS camps and providing {{for the needs of}} the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families. CPS men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> end of the war. Initially skeptical of the program, government agencies learned to appreciate the men's service and requested more workers from the program. CPS made significant contributions to forest fire prevention, erosion and flood control, medical science and reform of the mental health system.|$|E

5|$|The {{depositions}} that Hutchinson {{collected and}} sent to London were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston. Drawn mainly from depositions by soldiers, its account of affairs sought to blame selfish Bostonians for denying the validity of Parliamentary laws. It also blamed the city's hoodlums and gangs for the lawlessness preceding the event, and claimed that they set up an ambush of the soldiers. However, as it was not published until <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first pamphlet had arrived in London, it ended up having a much smaller {{impact on the public}} debate there.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} of the site is lost due to the catastrophic defeat of the polity in AD 735 by the nearby Petexbatun kingdom with its capital at Dos Pilas, {{resulting}} {{in the destruction of}} its earlier sculpted monuments. Seibal was reduced to being a vassal state until the destruction of the Petexbatun kingdom in the late 8th century AD. In AD 830 a new elite installed itself at the site with the arrival of Wat'ul Chatel from Ucanal to the east. This new arrival reinvigorated Seibal and allowed it to last to the dawn of the 10th century, <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the region.|$|E
5|$|The first weather maps in the 19th {{century were}} drawn <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> fact to help devise a theory on storm systems. After {{the advent of}} the telegraph, {{simultaneous}} surface weather observations became possible for the first time, and beginning in the late 1840s, the Smithsonian Institution became the first organization to draw real-time surface analyses. Use of surface analyses began first in the United States, spreading worldwide during the 1870s. Use of the Norwegian cyclone model for frontal analysis began in the late 1910s across Europe, with its use finally spreading to the United States during World War II.|$|E

5|$|The mass {{distribution}} of the Neptunian moons is the most lopsided of the satellite systems of the giant planets in the Solar System. One moon, Triton, makes up {{nearly all of the}} mass of the system, with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent. This is similar to the moon system of Saturn, where Titan makes up more than 95% of the total mass. This may be because Triton was captured <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> formation of Neptune's original satellite system, much of which would have been destroyed in the process of capture.|$|E
5|$|Well {{in advance}} of Vera's landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} ahead of the typhoon occurred across the Tōkai region of Japan starting on September23, when the storm reached peak intensity over open waters. In Nagoya, rainfall totals reached 10cm (4in). In {{other parts of the}} Tōkai region, nearly 20cm (8in) of rain was reported. The precipitation caused flooding along several river basins in the swath of rain. Steady rainfall occurred throughout Vera's passage of Honshu, though the worst of the rain-induced flooding occurred <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> typhoon's initial landfall. In Kawakami, Nara, a landslide killed 60people after crushing 12homes.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{returned}} to the West Indies to face England (represented by the MCC as was usual in those days) in a four-match Test series early in 1930. The first Test was drawn; Constantine scored few runs, but bowled {{for a long time}} and fielded <b>well.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> game, he was awarded a bat for his contribution. Calthorpe, the MCC captain, criticised his use of short-pitched bowling to a leg side field; one such ball struck Andy Sandham, but Constantine only reverted to more conventional tactics after a request from the MCC manager. During the second Test Constantine scored a rapid 58 and took six wickets, but the West Indies lost by 167 runs. In the following match the West Indies recorded their first win in Test matches; after centuries from George Headley and Clifford Roach, Constantine took four for 35 and five for 87 to secure the victory. Constantine was omitted from the final match in Jamaica, because inter-island politics meant that selectors tended to pick players from the island hosting the Test. In the series, 29 players represented the West Indies and the team had a different captain in each match. In the three matches in which he played, Constantine scored 144 runs at 14.40 and took 18 wickets at 27.61.|$|E

5|$|In eastern Herzegovina, the KPJ {{had little}} impact until mid-August 1941, <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> initial revolt had been suppressed. During the lead-up {{to the mass}} uprising, the KPJ {{organisation}} in Herzegovina would not commit itself, as it was waiting for orders from the provincial organisation in Sarajevo, which was expecting direction from the KPJ Central Committee to launch a general uprising across Yugoslavia. Once they {{became aware of the}} German attack on the Soviet Union, the KPJ in Herzegovina voted to join the mass uprising, but this only occurred on 24 June, when the uprising was already in full swing. According to Milazzo, the rebels remained a threat throughout eastern Herzegovina well into July, although the uprising in Herzegovina did not advance until the Bosnia-wide revolt occurred at the end of July, by which time the KPJ was ready for active involvement in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of 2003, {{thirteen}} disturbances formed, of which eight developed into tropical cyclones; six intensified further and became severe tropical cyclones. January 2003 featured four disturbances and three cyclones. Cyclones Ami and Beni were both severe tropical cyclones, with the first extensively impacting Fiji. The month of February was less active compared to January; only two disturbances formed, Cyclone Dovi and Tropical Disturbance 10F, although Dovi would become a Category5 cyclone on the Australian cyclone scale. March was slightly more active than February; the month featured three tropical depressions and two severe tropical cyclones, Cyclone Erica and Cyclone Eseta, although Erica originally formed west of 160°E. After an easterly wind anomaly arose in April, cyclone activity was suppressed during the month, totalling three tropical disturbances and one cyclone. In June, Cyclone Gina formed {{as a result of a}} strong ER wave and later became a severe tropical cyclone, <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> end of the season. Its dissipation on June 9 marked the end of the cyclone season.|$|E
5|$|Jaime I {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval {{shipyard}} in Ferrol on 5 February 1912. She was launched on 21 September 1914, {{less than two months}} after the start of World War I. Spain remained neutral during the conflict, but because Britain supplied much of the armament and other building materials, work on Jaime I was considerably delayed. The ship was ready to go to sea by 1917, but she was not completed until <b>well</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> end of the war; work was finally finished on 20 December 1921. Upon her completion, she joined her two sister ships in the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. Jaime I saw action against insurgents in Morocco in the Rif War during the early 1920s along with her two sisters. Rif insurgents operating a coastal battery damaged the ship in 1924.|$|E
