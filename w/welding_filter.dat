Even though the energy level used is fairly low (85 joules), the low-impedance, low-inductance circuit produces {{a flash of}} 24,000,000 watts. With an arc temperature of 17,000 K, the radiation output is centered at 170 nanometers, in the far UV. The intense burst of radiation easily penetrates the shade #10 <b>welding</b> <b>filter</b> which shields the camera.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the poor optical angular properties displayed by the majority of automatically darkening welding filters currently on the market that are based on liquid crystal technology. It is shown that by reducing the twist-angle present in the liquid crystal cell to below that of 90 together with employment of a novel polariser arrangement, an optical shutter design based on a double-cell construction is obtained that boasts a reduced angular transmittance variation when in the activated phase. This gives an optical filter possessing a wide central viewing cone whilst maintaining the remaining optical parameters at a high level. The only point of compromise comes from the voltage increase requirement upon reduction of the twist- angle in order to maintain cell contrast. Although this inflates the power consumption of the system, beneficial effects upon the total light scattering provoked by the device are also observed. The final sections deal with a new mode of operation for a twisted-nematic liquid crystal cell when placed between crossed polarisers together with an interference filter possessing a high optical transmittance over {{the central part of the}} visible spectrum. This mode of operation means that the cell is in a dark state when inactivated. Application of a small stimulating voltage transmutes the unit into the light state, where upon further increment of the driving electronics beyond this point reverts the system back into a low transmittance phase. Such a mode of operation for a twisted-nematic cell offers several advantages over that of the normally white mode when considering the optical lens of an automatically darkening <b>welding</b> <b>filter.</b> In particular, a dark, fail-safe state is provided should the controlling electronics malfunction preventing the unit from holding in a potentially hazardous light phase, a property usually associated with the normally black mode of operation, whilst the fast switching speed from the light to the dark state associated with the normally white mode of operation is maintained. It is shown that there are only two cell types that display this phenomenon and the optical properties of these two systems are analysed in some detail with the view of developing an automatically darkening <b>welding</b> <b>filter</b> based on this technology.

40|$|Testing was {{completed}} {{to compare the}} filtration performance of modified monosodium titanate (mMST) with that of monosodium titanate (MST) with the rotary microfilter. In addition, {{the performance of the}} new laminated filter disk was compared to that of the original baseline <b>welded</b> <b>filter</b> disk. Results showed that flux rates for mMST exceeded that of MST with both the baseline and laminated filter disks in deployment concentrations of 0. 2 g/L of mMST and 0. 4 g/L of MST. The filtration rate of the mMST with the laminated filter disk exceeded that of the baseline filter disk. However, the baseline filter disk filtration rate for MST was greater than that of the laminated disk. The measured sample turbidity for all tests was 1. 06 NTU or less. A contract was established with SpinTek Filtration{trademark} to operate a 3 -disk pilot scale unit with prototypic filter disks and various feeds and two different filter disk membranes. SpinTek evaluated a set of the baseline 0. 5 micron filter disks as well as a set of laminated filter disks using the same 0. 5 micron filter disks. The membrane used for both disk sets was manufactured by the Pall Corporation (PMM 050). Each set of disks was run with monosodium titanate (MST) and modified monosodium titanate (mMST).

When the ultrasonic energy of a measurement location is less than the ultrasonic energy of the adjacent measurement locations, the measurement location is a potential defect location.

40|$|Funded by the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management, EM- 31, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{partnered with}} SpinTek Filtration{trademark} {{to develop a}} filter disk that would {{withstand}} a reverse pressure or flow during operation of the rotary microfilter. The ability to withstand a reverse pressure and flow eliminates a potential accident scenario that could have resulted in damage to the filter membranes. While the original <b>welded</b> <b>filter</b> disks {{have been shown to}} withstand and reverse pressure/flow in the static condition, the filter disk design discussed in this report will allow a reverse pressure/flow while the disks are rotating. In addition, the laminated disk increases the flexibility during filter startup and cleaning operations. The new filter disk developed by SRNL and SpinTek is manufactured with a more open structure significantly reducing internal flow restrictions in the disk. The prototype was tested at the University of Maryland and demonstrated to withstand the reverse pressure due to the centrifugal action of the rotary filter. The tested water flux of the disk was demonstrated to be 1. 34 gpm in a single disk test. By comparison, the water flux of the current disk was 0. 49 gpm per disk during a 25 disk test. The disk also demonstrated rejection of solids by filtering a 5 wt % Strontium Carbonate slurry with a filtrate clarity of less the 1. 4 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) throughout the two hour test. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has been working with SpinTek Filtration{trademark} to adapt the rotary microfilter for radioactive service in the Department of Energy (DOE) Complex. One potential weakness is the loose nature of the membrane on the filter disks. The current disk is constructed by welding the membrane at {{the outer edge of the}} disk. The seal for the center of the membrane is accomplished by an o-ring in compression for the assembled stack. The remainder of the membrane is free floating on the disk. This construction requires that a positive pressure be applied to the rotary filter tank to prevent the membrane from rising from the disk structure and potentially contacting the filter turbulence promoter. In addition, one accident scenario is a reverse flow through the filtrate line due to mis-alignment of valves resulting in the membrane rising from the disk structure. The structural integrity of the current disk has been investigated, and shown that the disk can withstand a significant reverse pressure in a static condition. However, the disk will likely incur damage if the filter stack is rotated during a reverse pressure. The development of a laminated disk would have several significant benefits for the operation of the rotary filter including the prevention of a compromise in filter disk integrity during a reverse flow accident, increasing operational flexibility, and increasing the self cleaning ability of the filter. A laminated disk would allow the filter rotor operation prior to a positive pressure in the filter tank. This would prevent the initial dead-head of the filter and prevent the resulting initial filter cake buildup. The laminated disk would allow rotor operation with cleaning fluid, eliminating the need for a recirculation pump. Additionally, a laminated disk would allow a reverse flow of fluid through the membrane pores removing trapped particles...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} systems for remotely monitoring automatic welding operations, and more particularly {{to a system}} wherein the welder is readily positionable, while components of the optical system remain fixed. A welder having an electrode is mounted in an enclosure containing a pair of mirrors. The electrode passes through {{an opening in the}} first mirror and a gas cup. The mirror reflects an image of a welding operation taken through the opening of the gas cup to the second mirror. The second mirror then reflects the image through a rotary coupling to a third mirror which, in turn, reflects the image to a receiving lense mounted to a second rotatable coupling. The image is then projected via a fiber optic bundle to a filter unit where selected wavelengths of light are <b>filtered</b> from the <b>welding</b> image.
