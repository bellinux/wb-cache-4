5|$|The comic and science-fiction {{bookshop}} Forbidden Planet {{was established}} at No. 23 in 1978 {{before moving to}} New Oxford Street and becoming an international chain. When Douglas Adams attempted to attend a signing for the first The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy book in October 1979, the queue to the shop <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that Adams thought a demonstration was taking place elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Filmmaker Terrence Malick {{originally}} {{worked on}} a screenplay limited to Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. When financing fell through, Malick left the project, and Soderbergh subsequently agreed to direct the film. He {{realized that there was}} no context for Guevara's actions in Bolivia and decided that his participation in the Cuban Revolution and his appearance at the United Nations in 1964 should also be depicted. Peter Buchman was hired to write the screenplay: the script <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that Soderbergh decided to divide the film into two parts, one chronicling Cuba and other depicting Bolivia. Soderbergh shot the installments back-to-back starting at the beginning of July 2007, with Guerrilla first in Spain for 39 days, and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an interception <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long,</b> the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Capp {{earned a}} Newsweek cover story. That same year the New Yorker's profile on him <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that it ran in {{consecutive}} issues. In 1948, Capp reached a creative peak {{with the introduction}} of the Shmoos, lovable and innocent fantasy creatures who reproduced at amazing speed and brought so many benefits that, ironically, the world economy was endangered. The much-copied storyline was a parable that was metaphorically interpreted in many different ways {{at the outset of the}} Cold War.|$|E
25|$|Cathay's Jurong Drive-In cinema {{opened on}} 14 July 1971 and was, at that time, {{the first of}} its kind in Singapore and Malaysia, and the largest in Asia. The 5.6 hectare site was {{equipped}} with 899 speaker stands, 300 seats at the gallery for walk-in customers and the screen was elevated 25 feet from the ground. Cathay distributed Golden Harvest films and when Jurong Drive-In screened Bruce Lee's Big Boss, the line-up of cars <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that many got out and walked. The show was scheduled for midnight but didn't start screening until 1am.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of its publication, A Storm of Swords was the longest novel in the series. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that in the UK, Australia and Israel its {{paperback}} edition was split in half, Part 1 being published as Steel and Snow in June 2001 (with the one-volume cover) and Part 2 as Blood and Gold in August 2001 (with a specially-commissioned new cover). The same division was used in the Polish and Greek editions. In France, {{the decision was made to}} cut the novel into four separate volumes.|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} Louis XIV <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that he outlived both {{his son and}} eldest grandson. He was succeeded by his {{great-grandson}} Louis XV. Louis XV was born on 15 February 1710 and was thus aged only five at his ascension, the third Louis in a row to become king of France {{before the age of}} thirteen (Louis XIII became king at 9, Louis XIV at almost 5 and himself at 5). Initially, the regency was held by Philip, Duke of Orléans, Louis XIV's nephew, as nearest adult male to the throne. This Regence was seen as a period of greater individual expression, manifested in secular, artistic, literary and colonial activity, in contrast to the austere latter years of Louis XIV's reign.|$|E
25|$|Stamp {{portrayed the}} Kryptonian supervillain General Zod in Richard Donner's Superman (1978), {{in which he}} {{appeared}} in a scene with Marlon Brando. The film and its first sequel were originally conceived as one film, with Zod and his evil conspirators returning later in the film to challenge Superman, but the screenplay <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that the producers elected to split it into two parts. Both parts began shooting simultaneously, but production on the sequel was halted partway through due to budget and time constraints. Stamp reappeared as General Zod in the second part, Superman II (1980), as the movie's primary villain. Donner was replaced as director on the sequel with Richard Lester, who completed the film using portions of Donner's original footage combined with newly filmed scenes.|$|E

25|$|Because Ritter's line {{of defense}} <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long,</b> his flanks were unable to support each other. That, {{combined}} with his lack of forces to man such a wide perimeter adequately, caused his left flank to falter when the South African forces advanced upon it. Fearful his lines would break, Ritter pulled back to the hills of Otavifontein and to Otavi mountain. Despite {{the fact that these}} new positions held the high ground, the Germans had not prepared any fortifications there. With no artillery and no solid defensive positions, the German force easily broke into a general retreat when pressed by Botha's troops. By 1pm the battle had ended, with Ritter pulling back to positions near Gaub and leaving Botha with a clear path to the main German body at Tsombe.|$|E
25|$|On 26 February 1649, Christina {{announced}} that she {{had decided not to}} marry and instead wanted her first cousin Charles to be heir to the throne. While the nobility objected to this, the three other estates– clergy, burghers, and peasants– accepted it. The coronation took place on 22 October 1650. Christina went to the castle of Jacobsdal where she entered in a coronation carriage draped in black velvet embroidered in gold and pulled by three white horses. The procession to Storkyrkan <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that when the first carriages arrived, the last ones had not yet left Jacobsdal. All four estates were invited to dine at the castle. Fountains at the market place splashed out wine for three days, roast was served, and illuminations sparkled, followed by a themed parade (The Illustrious Splendors of Felicity) on 24 October.|$|E

500|$|Whitehead and Russell {{had thought}} {{originally}} that Principia Mathematica {{would take a}} year to complete; it ended up taking them ten years. When {{it came time for}} publication, the three-volume work <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> (more than 2,000 pages) and its audience so narrow (professional mathematicians) that it was initially published at a loss of 600 pounds, 300 of which was paid by Cambridge University Press, 200 by the Royal Society of London, and 50 apiece by Whitehead and Russell themselves. [...] Despite the initial loss, today there is likely no major academic library in the world which does not hold a copy of Principia Mathematica.|$|E
500|$|A portage was {{necessary}} {{from the shore}} of Lake Superior past the High Falls. Southwest of {{the mouth of the}} Pigeon River is Grand Portage Bay; about [...] inland there is a gap through the surrounding hills and bluffs which provides a gradual ascent to Cascade Falls. The river is navigable by canoe beyond the Cascade Falls. The Sioux and Chippewa created a [...] long portage from Grand Portage Bay to bypass the three falls and several kilometers of turbulent river up to the Cascade Falls, probably by following animal trails. The French called this trail the Great Portage because it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E
500|$|Tritons keel {{was laid}} down on 29 May 1956 in Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation. Her length {{presented}} Electric Boat with many problems during her construction. She <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> her bow obstructed the slipway's railway facility, used for transporting material around the yard. Consequently, {{the lower half}} of her bow was cut away to facilitate yard operations, and the bow was re-attached just days prior to her launch. Similarly, the last [...] of her stern was built on an adjoining slip and attached {{to the rest of the}} hull before Tritons launch. Her sail was found to be too high to go under the scaffolding, so the top [...] was cut away and re-attached later.|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} {{originally}} planned to contain 16 episodes; eight were filmed {{before the start}} of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. [...] Following the strike's resolution, it was announced that only five more episodes would be produced to complete the season; however, the season finale's script <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that network executives approved the production of a 14th episode as part of a three-hour season finale split over two nights. The fourth season aired Thursdays at 9:00 pm from January 31 to March 20, 2008, and at 10:00 pm from April 24 to May 15, 2008. The two-hour finale aired at 9:00 pm on May 29, 2008. Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the season on DVD and Blu-ray Disc under the title Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience on December 9, 2008, in Region 1; however, it was released earlier—on October 20, 2008—in Region 2.|$|E
500|$|Once Newman and Robbins signed on, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films {{agreed to}} co-finance the film with Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures. The film was shot on five sound stages at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina {{beginning}} on November 30, 1992. Raimi served as second unit director, shooting the hula hoop sequence and Waring Hudsucker's suicide. Production designer Dennis Gassner {{was influenced by}} fascist architecture, particularly the work of Albert Speer, [...] as well as Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985), Frank Lloyd Wright and the Art Deco movement. [...] Gassner contemplated using five huge rooms needed to accommodate the sound stages. Gassner noted [...] "You see, we wanted things to be big." [...] He said that the huge 1950's-inspired table up in the boardroom <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long,</b> {{it had to be}} built in five sections and later on assembled on the soundstage. The intention for the set sizes was to generate an oppressive feel. Principal photography ended on March 18, 1993.|$|E
500|$|The {{performers}} {{category is}} meant for recording artists and bands that have [...] "influence and {{significance to the}} development and perpetuation of rock and roll." [...] Artists become eligible for induction in that category 25 years {{after the release of}} their first record. In order to be inducted, an artist must be nominated by a committee that selects anywhere from nine to a dozen candidates. Ballots are sent to 600 [...] "rock experts" [...] who then evaluate the candidates and vote on who should be inducted. The performers who receive the highest number of votes and more than 50 percent of the vote are inducted. In 2011, the number inducted was five. The rest of the categories are voted on by special committees. In 2012, six additional bands and groups were inducted as performers by a special committee, due to the controversial nature of their band being excluded when their lead singer was inducted. [...] "There was a lot of discussion about this," [...] said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. [...] "There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question – it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result." ...|$|E
