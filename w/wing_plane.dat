He then worked on the draughtsmanship for the Avro 500, 501 and 503, which led to Avro's World War I light bomber and trainer, the Avro 504. In 1915 at age 22, Chadwick designed the Avro Pike, a twin-engined pusher biplane bomber. That year, when starting to design entire aircraft, he was based at Hamble, near Southampton. In 1918 he designed the Avro Baby and in 1920, the Avro Aldershot, the world's largest single-engined bomber and variants of the Aldershot, the Avro Ava and the Avro Andover. In 1925 he designed an all-metal plane, the single-seater fighter Avro Avenger and in 1926, the Avro Avian. In 1928, he {{moved back to the}} Avro factory in Woodford, Greater Manchester, used today by BAE Systems. That year, he designed an eight-passenger high <b>wing</b> <b>plane,</b> the Avro 10 and a 4-passenger version, the Avro 4. In 1929, he designed the RAF trainer, the Avro Tutor, a smaller version, the Avro Cadet and an enclosed version, the Avro Commodore. This was followed by the Avro Anson, used in World War II for training crews and as transport aircraft.|$|E

40|$|The stress {{relations}} to the fabric and the rib consequent upon {{a change of}} spacing between ribs in a <b>wing</b> <b>plane</b> are discussed.

Since the bulge and the structural dimensions remain geometrically similar, the whole distended plane remains so, and hence should have the same pressure distribution and efficiency. If therefore the Burgess rule of making the rib spacing always one-fifth of the chord of the plane be valid, it must be valid for all others that are mechanically similar in structure and covering...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made in the Mach number range from 1. 60 to 2. 86 to determine the static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of close-coupled wing-canard configurations. Three canards, ranging in exposed planform area from 17. 5 to 30. 0 percent of the wing reference area, were employed in this investigation. The canards were either located in the plane of the wing or in a position 18. 5 percent of the wing mean geometric chord above the <b>wing</b> <b>plane.</b> Most data obtained were for a model with a 60 deg leading-edge-sweep wing; however, a small amount of data were obtained for a 44 deg leading-edge-sweep wing. The model utilized two balances to isolate interference effects between wing and canard. In general, it was determined that at angle of attack for all configurations investigated with the canard in the plane of the wing an unfavorable interference exists which causes the additional lift on the canard generated by a canard deflection to be lost on the wing due to an increased downwash at the wing from the canard. Further, this interference decreased somewhat with increasing Mach number. Raising the canard above the plane of the wing also greatly decreased the interference of the canard deflection on the wing lift. However, at Mach 2. 86 the presence of the canard in the high position had a greater unfavorable interference effect at high angles of attack than the canard in the <b>wing</b> <b>plane.</b> This interference resulted in the in-plane canard having better trimmed performance at Mach 2. 86 for the same center-of-gravity location.
