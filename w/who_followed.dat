5|$|Civilians {{who took}} part in the {{evacuation}} suffered the consequences of the military action along Route 7. Most of the civilians <b>who</b> <b>followed</b> the military convoy were either relatives of soldiers or officers in the army, or were government civil servants. Of the estimated 400,000 civilians who initially took part in the march, only a handful actually reached their destinations in the Mekong region. In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by North Vietnamese artillery, the civilians were also hit by air strikes from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. As a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‘convoy of tears’.|$|E
5|$|Giving Jharokha Darshan {{from this}} jharokha was a daily feature. This {{tradition}} was also continued by rulers <b>who</b> <b>followed</b> Akbar (r. 1556–1605 CE).

However, this ancient practice was discontinued by Aurangzeb during his 11th year of reign as he {{considered it a}} non-Islamic practice, a form of idol worship. In Agra Fort and Red Fort, the jharokha faces the Yamuna and the emperor would stand alone on the jharokha to greet his subjects.|$|E

He was replaced by George Meade, <b>who</b> <b>followed</b> Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture.

State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
