5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> {{on the surface of}} the moon. <b>Water</b> <b>ice</b> absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter <b>water</b> <b>ice,</b> decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|Titania is {{the largest}} and most massive Uranian moon, and the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System. Its density of 1.71 g/cm³, which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> and dense non-ice components; the latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001–2005, which have revealed crystalline <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> {{on the surface of the}} moon. <b>Water</b> <b>ice</b> absorption bands are slightly stronger on Titania's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on Oberon, where the trailing hemisphere exhibits stronger <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> signatures.

5|$|Umbriel is {{the third}} largest and fourth most massive of Uranian moons.

The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> {{on the surface of}} the moon. <b>Water</b> <b>ice</b> absorption bands are stronger on Umbriel's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere.

5|$|Oberon is {{the second}} largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Oberon's density of 1.63g/cm³, which {{is higher than the}} typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds.

This is the opposite of what is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to sputter (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{chemical and}} physical processes in electron-irradiated ammonia-water ices at temperatures of 10 and 50 K. Chemically speaking, {{the formation of}} hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) was observed in electron-irradiated ammonia-water ices. The synthesis of molecular hydrogen (H 2), molecular nitrogen (N 2), molecular oxygen (O 2), hydrazine (N 2 H 4), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), which was also monitored in previous irradiation of pure ammonia and <b>water</b> <b>ices,</b> was also evident. These newly formed species were trapped inside of the ices and were released into the gas phase during the warm-up phase of the sample after the irradiation. A quantitative {{analysis of the data}} showed that the production rates of the newly formed species at 10 K are higher compared to those at 50 K. Our studies also suggest that hydroxylamine is likely formed by the recombination of amino (NH 2) with hydroxyl (OH) radicals inside of the ices. Considering the physical effects on the ice sampled during the irradiation, the experiments provided compelling evidence that the crystalline ammonia-water ice samples can be partially converted to amorphous ices during the electron irradiation; similar to the chemical processes, the irradiation-induced amorphization of the ices is faster at 10 K than that at 50 K s a finding which is similar to electron-irradiated crystalline <b>water</b> <b>ices</b> under identical conditions. However, the amorphization of <b>water</b> in water-ammonia <b>ices</b> was found to be faster than that in pure <b>water</b> <b>ices</b> at identical temperatures. 1...|$|R

5|$|Radar {{results from}} SHARAD {{suggested}} that features termed lobate debris aprons (LDAs) contain {{large amounts of}} <b>water</b> <b>ice.</b> Of interest {{from the days of}} the Viking Orbiters, these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth. SHARAD has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that pure <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections). Based on the experiments of the Phoenix lander and the studies of the Mars Odyssey from orbit, <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> is known to exist just under the surface of Mars in the far north and south (high latitudes).|$|E
