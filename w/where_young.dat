5|$|After adolescence, most {{physical}} training for males {{was of a}} military nature. The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field <b>where</b> <b>young</b> men developed the skills of horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake, and condemned Nero's efforts to encourage gymnastic games in the Greek manner.|$|E
5|$|Frank M. Young was {{the first}} {{executive}} director of the 5th Avenue Musical Theatre Company. From 1989 to 1999 a collaborative partnership existed between the 5th and Houston's Theatre Under the Stars (TUTS) <b>where</b> <b>Young</b> also served as executive director. This partnership produced 10 seasons of musical theater, including both national tours and self-produced musicals. On October 17, 1989, the first 5th Avenue/TUTS self-produced musical was presented: Mame, starring Juliet Prowse. In 1995, after premiering at the 5th, Jekyll & Hyde became the first 5th Avenue Theatre production to open on Broadway in April 1997. The show was produced in cooperation with Houston's Alley Theatre and TUTS.|$|E
5|$|On October 4 the Richards party reached Salt Lake City and conferred with {{president}} Brigham Young and other Church leaders. The {{next morning the}} Church was meeting in a general conference, <b>where</b> <b>Young</b> and the other speakers called on the Church members to provide wagons, mules, supplies, and teamsters for a rescue mission. On the morning of October 7 the first rescue party left Salt Lake City with 16 wagon-loads of food and supplies, pulled by four-mule teams with 27 young men serving as teamsters and rescuers. The party elected George D. Grant as their captain. Throughout October more wagon trains were assembled, {{and by the end}} of the month 250 relief wagons were on the road.|$|E

5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, which {{is divided into}} three classes: Moto3, Moto2 and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 250cc, 125cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. Moto3 replaced the 125cc class in 2012. Moto3 runs 250cc single-cylinder engines as opposed to the 125cc engines used previously. The engines have single cylinders, as opposed to the four cylinders used in MotoGP. Moto3 is the class <b>where</b> <b>young</b> riders first participate in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. The minimum age for a rider is 16 years and the maximum is 28 years. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship.|$|E
5|$|His father, Euzebiusz Słowacki, a Polish nobleman of the Leliwa coat of arms, taught rhetoric, poetry, Polish language, and {{the history}} of {{literature}} at the Krzemieniec Lyceum in Kremenets; from 1811 he held the chair (katedra) of rhetoric and poetry at Vilnius Imperial University. He died in 1814, leaving Juliusz to be raised solely by his mother, Salomea Słowacka (née Januszewska, a noblewoman of disputed descent), who was of either Jewish or Armenian descent. In 1818 she married a professor of medicine, August Bécu. She ran a literary salon <b>where</b> <b>young</b> Juliusz was exposed to diverse influences. It was there in 1822 that the 13-year-old met Adam Mickiewicz, the first of the Three Bards of Polish literature. Two years later, in 1824, Mickiewicz was arrested and exiled by the Russian authorities for his involvement in a secret patriotic Polish student society, the Philomaths; Słowacki likely met with him on Mickiewicz's final day in Wilno.|$|E
5|$|The Mounted Infantry Depot was a post <b>where</b> <b>young</b> {{officers}} {{could be}} stationed, forming a ready reserve of young, educated officers available as volunteers for staff or command positions in African colonial campaigns. It was whilst {{attached to this}} post that Alderson saw service in the First Boer War in 1881 in the Transvaal. The following year, Alderson served in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, fighting at the battles of Kassassin and Tel-el-Kebir. Two years later, Alderson {{was attached to the}} Mounted Camel Regiment during the failed expedition to relieve Khartoum and rescue General Gordon. During this campaign, Alderson was presented with the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society after diving into the Nile to rescue a drowning soldier. For his service in these campaigns, Alderson was promoted to Captain and was stationed at Aldershot with the European Mounted Infantry Depot. The same year he married the daughter of the vicar of Syresham, Northamptonshire, a Miss Alice Mary Sergeant.|$|E

5|$|The mid-to-late 1970s saw {{a decline}} in Celtic's European achievements, with first-round exits in the European Cup against Olympiacos in 1974 and in the UEFA Cup against Wisła Kraków in 1976. In between these very brief campaigns, Celtic reached the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup in season 1975–76, but disappointingly were knocked out by East German side Sachsenring Zwickau, whose play was unimpressive despite winning the tie. The tie is best remembered for the bizarre {{situation}} <b>where</b> <b>young</b> Roy Aitken had to be 'adopted' by Celtic {{to be allowed to}} enter East Germany to play the away leg. At only 17 years old, the authorities there did not consider him to be an adult. Celtic's last European campaign under Jock Stein was again very short, a second round exit against Wacker Innsbruck in the 1977–78 European Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service <b>where</b> <b>young</b> Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E
5|$|York {{started the}} season with a 2–1 defeat at home to Kidderminster Harriers, who opened the scoring with a goal direct from a corner kick. After Michael Rankine {{equalised}} on 68 minutes with a penalty, Kidderminster won the match with a penalty three minutes later. Hopcutt was loaned out to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Whitby Town for a month. The team's first away match of the season was against Grimsby Town, with the match finishing a 0–0 draw. This was followed by another away draw, with Michael Gash and Till scoring against Bath City as the match finished 2–2. York then drew 0–0 at home to Barrow and the team's first victory of the season came after Rankine and Richard Brodie scored to beat Altrincham 3–0 at home. The team were defeated 2–1 away by Fleetwood Town, <b>where</b> <b>Young</b> made his debut and scored York's only goal. Brodie joined fellow Conference Premier club Crawley Town for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £300,000, with the transfer being completed three minutes before the transfer deadline.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge-based {{authentication}} {{is almost}} ubiquitous due to low cost and relatively straightforward implementation. Despite its popularity, {{there are some}} well-known problems associated with knowledge-based authentication, such as the cognitive load of memorising multiple codes. As people age and their memory declines, remembering multiple codes is even more challenging. Due to lack of objective evidence regarding the performance of older adults with existing knowledge-based systems, a study was carried out <b>where</b> <b>younger</b> and older participants were required to learn and remember multiple PIN codes and their performance was evaluated over a three-week period. The results from this PIN study demonstrated a clear age effect <b>where</b> <b>younger</b> participants performed significantly more accurately and faster than the older participants. These results reiterated the need for authentication systems that are inclusive of older users and provided a benchmark performance measure for future evaluations.
