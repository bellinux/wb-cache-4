5|$|Manson {{first began}} work on the album with guitarist Tim Sköld. However, Sköld left the band when the vocalist reunited with former bassist Twiggy Ramirez. The album was {{produced}} by Manson and Twiggy (<b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> the Ramirez moniker) along with former Nine Inch Nails co-producer and keyboardist Chris Vrenna, as well as Antichrist Superstar (1996) and Mechanical Animals (1998) co-producer Sean Beavan. It was the last album to feature the band's long-time drummer Ginger Fish.|$|E

5|$|Murphy {{was hired}} by Joseph L.

Michael Redgrave replaced Laurence Olivier <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> out when Clift withdrew. The cold-war drama filmed in Vietnam was a departure from the genre in which Murphy had normally been cast.|$|E

5|$|A primary issue {{during the}} {{election}} was {{the construction of a}} dam on the Red River. Cook opposed the dam, but Ford supported it and allocated some of the state's budget surplus to its construction. In the election, Ford defeated Cook by a vote of 399,406 to 328,982, completing his revitalization of the state's Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from major office. Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a higher standing in seniority in the Senate. Ford resigned as governor to accept the seat, leaving the governorship to Carroll, <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> state support for the project, killing it.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Morton Blackwell, then a field {{representative}} for the CRNC to Kentucky, developed many of the principles now used by the College Republicans. As the college organizer supporting Louie Nunn's campaign for Governor of Kentucky, Blackwell organized approximately 5,000 college student volunteers <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> 93,000 pieces of literature, posted 20,000 flyers, mailed 15,000 hand-addressed and signed postcards to friends of known student supporters of Nunn, and processed over 8,000 absentee ballots. On election day, Nunn became the first Republican Governor of Kentucky in 20 years. The New York Times and Louie Nunn himself credited the efforts of Blackwell's volunteers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1903 Tour de France, the {{organisation}} guaranteed {{that the first}} 50 cyclists in the final general classification would earn at least 5 francs per day. In 1904, if not more than 50 cyclists would finish, also cyclists <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> out during the race would still get 5 francs for the days {{they had been in}} the race. This rule was added to attract cyclists who otherwise would not enter, because the Tour needed enough competitors to remain credible.|$|E

Those <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> out before the race began included Henri Desgrange, a prominent track rider {{who went on to}} organize the Tour de France. The starters did include Maurice Garin, who went on to win Desgrange's first Tour and was the local hope in Roubaix because he and two brothers had opened a cycle shop in the boulevard de Paris the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} {{creating}} a landing ground at Folks Wood, Lympne, {{in the autumn}} of 1915. This site soon proved unsuitable and another site was sought. Lympne was established in March 1916 as an Emergency Landing Ground for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) home defence fighters defending London against Zeppelins and Gothas. No.1 Advanced School of Air Gunnery operated from Lympne during January and February 1917. In January 1917 it was designated as No.8 Aircraft Acceptance Park for delivery of aircraft to, and reception from, France. On 25 May 1917 Lympne was bombed by Gotha G.IV bombers of Kagohl 3 <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> 19 bombs on the airfield.|$|E

5|$|His first call-up to {{the senior}} {{national}} squad came in October 2004, for World Cup qualifiers against Belgium and Lithuania, {{as a replacement for}} Juanito <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> out of the original selection because of injury. Carlos Marchena and Carles Puyol were the centre-back pairing in possession, and Pablo remained on the bench for both games. He made his international debut on 17 November 2004 in a friendly against England in Madrid. He entered the game as a half-time substitute for Marchena, with Spain leading 1–0; with 20 minutes left, he appeared to foul Alan Smith in the act of shooting, but no penalty was awarded, and Spain had no difficulty retaining their lead. Pablo replaced Iván Helguera, who had previously been a regular selection, in the squad for Spain's next match, a World Cup qualifier at home to San Marino in February 2005, but did not play.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the races meant Markelov moved into {{the lead of the}} Drivers' Championship with 54 points, ahead of Nato <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> to second. Giovinazzi's two {{victories}} meant he moved into third place. Gasly remained in fourth place on 45 points, but was now two points ahead of nearest rival Marciello in fifth. Russian Time remained in the lead of the Teams' Championship with 97 points, and were eight points in front of Prema Racing in second place. Racing Engineering dropped to third position on 73 position, while DAMS moved down one place to fourth. ART Grand Prix rounded out the top five on 60 points, with seven rounds left in the season.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine whether}} unregulated, private {{insurance}} markets efficiently provide insurance against reclassification risk (the {{risk of becoming}} a bad risk and facing higher premiums). To do so, we examine the ex-post risk type of individuals <b>who</b> <b>drop</b> their long-term care insurance contracts relative {{to those who are}} continually insured. Consistent with dynamic inefficiencies, we find that individuals <b>who</b> <b>drop</b> coverage are of lower risk ex-post than individuals who were otherwise-equivalent at the time of purchase but <b>who</b> do not <b>drop</b> out of their contracts. These findings suggest that dynamic market failures in private insurance markets can preclude the efficient provision of insurance against reclassification risk. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{win over}} #14Virginia Tech enabled the Bulldogs {{to break into}} the Top25 rankings in the final college {{football}} poll of the season. Georgia was ranked#23 in the country thanks to its win over the Hokies, <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> to #19nationally following the loss. The loss snapped a six-game winning streak by Virginia Tech and ended the Hokies' bid at becoming just the fourth team in school history to win 11 games in a season. The 2006 Georgia Bulldogs, consequently, became the first team in school history to defeat three consecutive ranked teams. No.5 Auburn, No.16 Georgia Tech, and No.14 Virginia Tech all fell to Georgia in November or December. The game and {{the tens of thousands of}} fans it attracted injected an estimated $35million into the Atlanta area economy, mostly as a result of food, hotel, and other expenses incurred by visiting fans.|$|E
5|$|After King Inge's {{death in}} 1217, a dispute erupted over {{who was to}} become his successor. In {{addition}} to Haakon who gained {{the support of the}} majority of the birkebeiners including the veterans who had served under his father and grandfather, candidates included Inge's illegitimate son Guttorm (<b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> out very soon), Inge's half-brother Earl Skule Bårdsson who had been appointed leader of the king's hird at Inge's deathbed and was supported by the Archbishop of Nidaros as well as part of the birkebeiners, and Haakon the Crazy's son Knut Haakonsson. With his widespread popular support in Trøndelag and in Western Norway, Haakon was proclaimed king at Øyrating in June 1217. He was later the same year hailed as king at Gulating in Bergen, and at Haugating, Borgarting and local things east of Elven (Göta Älv). While Skule's supporters initially had attempted to cast doubt about Haakon's royal ancestry, they eventually suspended open resistance to his candidacy. As the dispute could have threatened to split the birkebeiners in two, Skule settled on becoming regent for Haakon during his minority.|$|E
5|$|Another local {{man called}} Tom Austin was hanged in August 1694. He {{inherited}} a farm {{with an annual}} income of £80 and then married {{the daughter of a}} neighbouring farmer with a dowry of £800. He lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent all of his money. His farm, having been neglected could not provide sufficient income for him and he borrowed a lot of money from neighbours and friends. He then turned to highway robbery and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The proceeds from his crimes supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he went to visit his uncle. His uncle was not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around £60 from the house. On returning home he was asked about the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife. He then killed her and his two children. His uncle <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> in to visit him on his way home knocked Tom Austin unconscious and he was arrested and later hung at Exeter Jail.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who {{promptly}} removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand. This brought Lindwall’s tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again {{and this time the}} England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{survived the}} last 15 {{minutes on the}} first evening to reach stumps on 0/17, with Morris on 10. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled by Jim Laker's off spin for 31. Barnes batted confidently, while the {{hesitant}} Morris shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes, During this period, Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from seamer Alec Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> the catch. He recomposed himself and hit left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. Morris fell {{when he tried to}} force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad; the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Australia went on to amass 509, and when England batted again, they lost their third wicket at 150. Joe Hardstaff junior came in, and on the third ball he aimed a cut that went low to second slip, just as he did in the first innings. However, Morris dropped the catch. Hardstaff exploited his second chance to make 43 before falling at 4/243.|$|E
5|$|Later, it was {{announced}} that should a sequel or reboot not start filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the Daredevil franchise would revert from Fox back to Marvel. In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade, <b>who</b> <b>dropped</b> out of the director's chair due to scheduling conflicts. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, for the job—however, Carnahan said on Twitter that his pitch, described as a hard-boiled '70s thriller, had gone up in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox had given up on the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights revert to Marvel and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned to Marvel Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix Daredevil television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role.|$|E
