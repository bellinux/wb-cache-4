40|$|RFX, {{the largest}} RFP machine, has air-core poloidal windings. A tree-shaped {{earthing}} geometry {{has been adopted}} for all the machine components, to avoid electrical loops. Nevertheless, during the first operation phase a number of accidental contacts occurred, which caused loops currents high enough to distort plasma equilibrium. These loops could be detected by means of RGM, a system designed to perform fast <b>winding</b> <b>protection,</b> but able to detect accidental earth currents as well. After careful analyses of the signals, these earth faults were always located and removed. The use of a compass resulted particularly useful in the occasion {{of a number of}} these faults, the others were detected by means of Rogowski coil probes...|$|E
40|$|Differential, {{overcurrent}} {{and ground}} fault relays {{are used for}} protecting transformers in electric. power systems. Several algorithms, that perform these functions and are suitable for implementation on microprocessors, have been proposed in the past. This thesis describes and evaluates an improved technique for modelling inverse-time overcurrent relay characteristics. This technique, which is used in a digital overcurrent relaying algorithm, is simple and requires a modest amount of computer memory. The proposed algorithm performs most computations in an off-line mode and, therefore, requires few on-line computations. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using computer simulations. Some test results are reported in the thesis. Digital algorithms that can detect winding faults in power transformers are described in the thesis. The algorithms use non-linear models of a transformer to determine its health. The algorithms take the non-linearity and hysteresis of the transformer core into account, however, these do not explicitly {{become part of the}} algorithms. They are suitable for protecting transformers whose winding currents can not be measured at the terminals. The performance of the algorithms is studied for a variety of operating conditions simulated on a digital computer using the Electro-Magnetic Transient Program (EMTP). Some results of the simulation studies are reported in the thesis. The proposed algorithms for overcurrent relaying and transformer <b>winding</b> <b>protection</b> are implemented in a microprocessor-based system. The design implementation and, testing of the system are presented in the thesis. The system includes a man-machine interface for changing relay settings and relay software, and for uploading the relay signals for further analysis. The performance of the system was checked in the laboratory. The testing procedure and some test results are also presented...|$|E

It {{is equipped with}} wireless communication, sandwich facets, <b>wind</b> <b>protection</b> devices for <b>wind</b> load reduction, rim drives with winch wheels and ground anchor foundation. Crucial {{for the development of}} the light-weight structures is the precise determination of the maximum loads. By full scale wind load measurements the duration of the peak loads could be determined. They are caused by gusts with such short duration that their energy can be dissipated by shock absorbers protecting the structure.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the interaction between}} the wind regime and the landscape. Examples of objects of landscape architecture in high-tech and science-intensive spheres, such as the launch pad of a spacecraft, are given. <b>Wind</b> <b>protection</b> is represented as a result of work on wind power engineering and a means of increasing bioclimatic comfort. The terms of landscape architecture are disclosed and mutual influence on the climate and impact on woody-shrub vegetation and field crops are analyzed. The phenomenon of air permeability for optimal operation of windproof structures and orientations of geoplastics and dendroplastics is described. In this paper, a classification of terrain types is described with a description of their elemental composition, as well as various categories of landscape. The proposal to consider the landscape as a territorial complex, and landscape buildings, landscape-architectural structures as objects of landscape architecture possessing properties of <b>wind</b> <b>protection</b> and air permeability was introduced. Thus, the concept of a landscape-architectural complex as a single group of landscape-architectural objects located on the territory and connected by a common system of communications, functions, technical elements and a visual image is formulated. Further research is based on the rationale {{for the use of the}} term ensemble in relation to the objects of the landscape and architectural complex and the identification of their design and planning features that can affect the parameters of <b>wind</b> <b>protection</b> and air permeability. The paper concludes that frequent coincidence of favorable for the fauna wind regime and mimicry of landscape architecture objects. The combination in the landscape of functions for <b>wind</b> <b>protection</b> and aesthetics is analyzed with analysis of such elements of landscape architecture as hedges and windproof properties of green plantations. In the work examples of wind engineering small architectural forms are shown in the form of sculptures moving from air streams, which also change the speed and direction of the wind.

Wind speeds were measured at two heights (1. 0 and 2. 5 m) along transects perpendicular to the prevailing wind; tree density ranged from 60 to 150 stems/ha. A simple model was formulated for average wind reduction within such canopies. Average wind speeds decreased with increasing distance from the woodland edge, until they become almost constant (saturation reduction).

50|$|Gumbo-limbo is a {{very useful}} plant {{economically}} and ecologically. It is well adapted to several kinds of habitats, which include salty and calcareous soils (however, it does not tolerate boggy soils). Due to this fact and its rapid growth, B. simaruba is planted for various purposes, notably in coastal areas. In addition, gumbo-limbo is also {{considered one of the}} most wind-tolerant trees, and it is recommended as a rugged, hurricane-resistant species in south Florida. They may be planted to serve as <b>wind</b> <b>protection</b> of crops and roads, or as living fence posts, and if simply stuck into good soil, small branches will readily root and grow into sizeable trees in a few years. However, it has been noted in Central America that posts do not produce a tap root, only side roots, thus questioning the real value of <b>wind</b> <b>protection</b> as such fence posts would not be as sturdy as a true, naturally occurring sapling. In addition, gumbo-limbo wood is suitable for light construction and as firewood, and the tree's resin, called chibou, cachibou or gomartis, is used as glue, varnish and incense. Gumbo-limbo is the traditional wood used for the manufacture of carousel horses in the United States.|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted over 4 years {{to evaluate the}} effects of antitranspirant (Folicote, Aquatrol Inc., Paulsboro, N. J.) and polyacrylamide gel (SuperSorb, Aquatrol Inc., Paulsboro, N. J.) on early growth of transplanted muskmelon grown either protected by tree windbreaks or exposed to seasonal winds. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) with split plot arrangement was used with <b>wind</b> <b>protection</b> (sheltered and exposed) areas as the main treatment and use of an antitranspirant spray or gel dip as subtreatments. Based on destructive harvests in the field, treatments and subtreatments did not affect dry weight or leaf area index in the first 2 years. Specific contrasts, however, showed that gel application significantly increased fresh weight, dry weight, and leaf area index over that of the untreated transplants whereas the spray application tended to reduce these factors during the first 3 weeks after transplanting. Significant differences between gel and spray subtreatments disappeared by 5 weeks after transplanting. Shelterbelts ameliorated crop microclimate thereby enhancing plant growth. Significantly, wind velocity at canopy height was reduced 40 % on average and soil temperatures were about 4 % warmer in the sheltered plots compared to the exposed plots during the first 5 weeks post-transplant. Muskmelon plants in the sheltered areas grew significantly faster than the plants in the exposed areas in 2 of the 3 years reported, with the 3 -year average fresh weight increased by 168 % due to <b>wind</b> <b>protection.</b> Overall transplanting success and early growth were enhanced the most by <b>wind</b> <b>protection,</b> followed by the polyacrylamide gel root dip, and least by the antitranspirant foliar spray. We conclude that microclimate modification by wind speed reduction can increase early muskmelon plant growth more consistently than the use of polyacrylamide gel as a root dip at transplanting {{or the use of}} an antitranspirant spray. A polyacrylamide gel root dip generally will provide more benefit during early muskmelon growth than the use of an antitranspirant spray...|$|R
