50|$|In 1999, the <b>warty</b> <b>comb</b> <b>jelly</b> colonized the Caspian Sea via the UDWS. The {{establishment}} {{of this population}} led to a 60% {{reduction in the number}} of sprat, which in turn led to a reduction in the population of sturgeon and seals.|$|E
50|$|Mnemiopsis leidyi, the <b>warty</b> <b>comb</b> <b>jelly</b> or sea walnut, is {{a species}} of tentaculate ctenophore (comb jelly), {{originally}} native to the western Atlantic coastal waters. Three species have been named in the genus Mnemiopsis, but they are now believed to be different ecological forms of a single species M. leidyi by most zoologists.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decline in}} macrophytes was further {{compounded}} by overfishing during the 1970s, while the invasive ctenophore Mnemiopsis reduced {{the biomass of}} copepods and other zooplankton in the late 1980s. Additionally, an alien species—the <b>warty</b> <b>comb</b> <b>jelly</b> (...) —was able to establish itself in the basin, exploding from a few individuals to an estimated biomass of one billion metric tons. The change in species composition in Black Sea waters also has consequences for hydrochemistry, as Ca-producing coccolithophores influence salinity and pH, although these ramifications {{have yet to be}} fully quantified. In central Black Sea waters, Si levels were also significantly reduced, due to a decrease in the flux of Si associated with advection across isopycnal surfaces. This phenomenon demonstrates the potential for localised alterations in Black Sea nutrient input to have basin-wide effects.|$|E

50|$|The benthic <b>comb</b> <b>jelly</b> is a <b>comb</b> <b>jelly</b> {{living in}} the Ryukyu Trench near Japan. Found {{at a depth of}} 7217 m, it is the deepest {{dwelling}} ctenophore discovered.|$|R
50|$|Lampocteis is a {{monotypic}} genus of <b>comb</b> <b>jellies,</b> {{the only}} genus in family Lampoctenidae. The sole species {{in this new}} genus is Lampocteis cruentiventer, the bloodybelly <b>comb</b> <b>jelly.</b> This ctenophore was first collected in the Pacific Ocean {{off the coast of}} San Diego, California, in 1979. It was described to science in 2001. Two morphological differences separating it from previously known <b>comb</b> <b>jellies</b> warranted the naming of a new family for this animal.|$|R
40|$|Gene {{structure}} {{data can}} substantially advance {{our understanding of}} metazoan evolution and deliver an independent approach to resolve conflicts among existing hypotheses. Here, we used changes of spliceosomal intron positions as novel phylogenetic marker to reconstruct the animal tree. This kind of data is inferred from orthologous genes containing mutually exclusive introns at pairs of sequence positions in close proximity, so-called near intron pairs (NIPs). NIP data were collected for 48 species and utilized as binary genome-level characters in maximum parsimony (MP) analyses to reconstruct deep metazoan phylogeny. All groupings that were obtained with more than 80 % bootstrap support are consistent with currently supported phylogenetic hypotheses. This includes monophyletic Chordata, Vertebrata, Nematoda, Platyhelminthes and Trochozoa. Several other clades such as Deuteros-tomia, Protostomia, Arthropoda, Ecdysozoa, Spiralia, and Eumetazoa, however, failed to be recovered due to a few problematic taxa such as the mite Ixodes and the <b>warty</b> <b>comb</b> <b>jelly</b> Mnemiopsis. The corresponding unexpected branchings {{can be explained by}} the paucity of synapomorphic changes of intron positions shared between some genomes, by the sensitivity of MP analyses to long-branch attraction (LBA), and by the very unequal evolutionary rates of intron loss and intron gain during evolution of the different subclades of metazoans. In addition, we obtained an assemblage of Cnidaria, Porifera, and Placozoa as sister group of Bi-lateria + Ctenophora with medium support, a disputable, but remarkable result. We conclude that NIPs can be used as phylogeneti...|$|E

Beroe is found in all the world's oceans and seas, and the monotypic Neis occurs only near Australia; all beroids are free-swimmers that form part of the plankton.|$|R

2500|$|Jellyfish, <b>comb</b> <b>jellies,</b> {{and related}} animals have diffuse nerve nets {{rather than a}} central nervous system. [...] In most {{jellyfish}} the nerve net is spread more or less evenly across the body; in <b>comb</b> <b>jellies</b> it is concentrated near the mouth. [...] The nerve nets consist of sensory neurons that pick up chemical, tactile, and visual signals, motor neurons that can activate contractions of the body wall, and intermediate neurons that detect patterns of activity in the sensory neurons and send signals to groups of motor neurons as a result. [...] In some cases groups of intermediate neurons are clustered into discrete ganglia.|$|R
