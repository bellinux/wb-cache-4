5000|$|Sheep's wool {{insulation}} {{is a very}} efficient thermal insulator with a higher performance than glass fibre and no reduction in performance even when condensation is present. It is made from the <b>waste</b> <b>wool</b> that the carpet and textile industries reject, it is available in both rolls and batts for both thermal and acoustic insulation of housing and commercial buildings. Wool {{has the ability to}} absorb significant levels of condensation, 40% of its own weight, and yet still be dry. As wool absorbs moisture it heats up and therefore reduces the risk of condensation. It has the unique ability to absorb VOC gases such as formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and lock them up permanently. [...] Sheep's {{wool insulation}} has a long lifetime due to the natural crimp in the fibre, endurance testing has shown it has a life expectancy of over 100 years.|$|E

The largest of these were those operated by the brothers John Muir Hetherington and Thomas Ridley Hetherington, which were established in 1830. Eventually the company became known as John Hetherington and Sons Ltd and the principal factory was at Vulcan Works on Pollard Street. The company was also the proprietor of Curtis, Sons & Company, which was established in 1804 at the Phoenix Works, which were on both sides of Chapel Street (now Chapeltown Street). On one side of the street there was a brass and iron works {{and on the other side}} there was a machinery factory. Hetherington's produced a huge range of machinery for the textile industry that included machinery for opening, preparing, spinning and doubling cotton, cotton <b>waste,</b> <b>wool</b> and worsted. Their speciality was a machine called a Combined Opener and Scutcher that was very effective in the cleaning of most types of cotton without damaging the staple or losing serviceable fibre.|$|E

The proteins of the wool fibres in waste carpets adsorbed either copper(II) nitrate or iron(II) ions to form nanoparticles of Hydrated Ferric Oxide (HFO). The copper(II) ions reversibly bound to the wool carpet. The strongest binding of the nanoparticles of HFO occurred after first oxidizing the surface epicuticle layer of the wool fibres and this binding was studied by FTIR and SEM. In a batch anion exchange process the HFO supported on oxidized carpet efficiently adsorbed phosphate.

40|$|Soil based {{construction}} materials (SBCMs) are formed of {{a mixture of}} gravel, sand and clay which, when mixed with water, {{may be used for}} construction. They can be an environmentally-friendly alternative to more traditional {{construction materials}} such as concrete and fired brick. SBCMs commonly incorporate foreign material into the soil to enhance the material properties. Many guides on SBCM construction advocate the use of cement as a stabiliser to strengthen the material, which detracts from the environmental credentials that earthen construction materials possess. Alternatives methods to strengthen SBCMs are therefore needed. In this thesis, <b>waste</b> <b>wool</b> fibres from a carpet manufacture are investigated as a potential alternative fibrous reinforcement in rammed earth (RE), and its effect on the behaviour of stabilised and unstabilised RE is assessed. Compressive tests, shear tests and splitting tests are performed to study the effect of fibrous (wool) and chemical (cement) stabilisation on RE, and recommendations on further use of these materials are made. Tests are also performed to investigate the shrinkage of different clays (bentonite and kaolinite) used in RE when mixed with sand or wool, {{in order to determine the}} effects of these materials on shrinkage behaviour.

In laboratory leaching experiments, the lime and bottom ash columns proved very effective, removing> 95 % of applied heavy metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The other media, particularly sphagnum, were effective in removing heavy metals, but not PAHs, although wool felt was not tested for PAHs removal.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the practical investigation {{and analysis of}} traditional materials and processes used {{in the production of}} hand made felt. Specifically, the research examines the potential of certain British wool types that are currently undervalued (and often overlooked in the production of fine craft felt). These wools are frequently referred to as ‘waste’ wools. The research further explores aspects of the UK’s wool economy and the problematic issue of <b>waste</b> <b>wool.</b> The aim being to locate and articulate the creative potential of a selection of these wools within the field of fine felt craft practice, and in so doing raise an awareness of their potential diversity and relevance. The investigation questions felt’s marginal status within the textile hierarchy, and problematizes notions of the familial and self-conscious attributed to felt craft by some of its makers. By examining distinctions between craft and industrial felt production, the research considers both the opportunities and limitations of these relationships within the context of designer maker practice. The purpose and focus of this material-led examination is to develop inventive, progressive methods in fine felt craft and couture application seeking material currency with appropriate use of waste wools for handwork production. The practical experimentation was conducted using a practice-led research approach through which materials and sampling methods emerged within a studio-based environment. The study focuses on the use of carding, wet and dry felting and post felting manipulation of surface design using hand-pleating applications. Whilst not specifically suggesting new techniques in felt-making, the modification of existing processes has formed a central part of the contribution to new knowledge created within the work. Therefore the qualitative nature of the research methodology establishes a new perspective on both the value and integrity of British waste wools for the production of fine craft felt-making. The portfolio of fabrics produced confirmed the suitability of materials for fine craft felt-making and further suggested their appropriateness for product development and use. The fabric prototypes and exposition collection evidence new design concepts, situating the practical investigations in a cultural and critical context and in so doing reposition the material in a more valuable and original light. The sampling process identified key areas for innovation and aesthetic appeal suggesting that further research could be developed using other wools and wool blends. From this thesis emerges a vibrant platform for fresh interpretation and potential for British waste wools in fine craft felt-making, further strengthening the creative interplay between material and technique.

40|$|The use {{of mineral}} wool is {{becoming}} more widespread due to increased acoustic and thermal demands of Spanish Technical Building Code. This increase affects both in rehabilitation and new construction projects. Therefore, waste generation {{of this type of}} insulating material is having more importance. The main objective of this research is to study the possibility of recycling fiber obtained from mineral wool of the C&DW as an alternative material to chopped glass fibers that are currently used as reinforcing elements in the prefabricated plaster. To achieve this objective, series are made of plaster E- 35 additived with rock wool residue and glass wool residue at different rates of addition. These series are repeated by changing the additive by E fiberglass (length of 25 mm) to make a comparative analysis with respect to the series additived with mineral <b>wool</b> <b>waste.</b> All the series are subjected to the test to determine Shore C surface hardness and mechanical testing to determine the compressive and flexural strength. From the results it can be concluded that: with rock wool residue, increases Shore C hardness up to 15 % with respect to the glass fiber and 9 % with respect to the glass wool, with a percentage of addition 2 %. With rock wool residue, weight is decreased by 5 % with respect to the glass fiber and 4 % with respect to the glass <b>wool</b> <b>waste,</b> with an addition percentage of 4 %. For an addition rate of 4 %, results in the flexural strength test with fiberglass are 85 % higher than those obtained with glass wool residue. However, for a percentage of 1 % addition, the results obtained with glass wool residue are 35 % higher than those obtained with fiberglass. For an addition rate of 3 % results in the compressive strength test with fiberglass are 54 % lower than those obtained with rock <b>wool</b> <b>waste</b> and 70 % lower than those obtained with glass <b>wool</b> <b>waste.</b> Comparing the two mineral wools, it can be concluded that up to 3 % of the addition, the glass wool series results obtained are 10 % higher than those additived with rock wool.
