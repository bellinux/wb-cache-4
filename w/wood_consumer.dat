40|$|The present {{domestic}} energy {{situation in}} Nigeria has made many families {{to go back}} to the use of fuel wood/charcoal owing to high prices or scarcity of kerosene and other alternative cooking fuels. Therefore, this study analysed the economic determinants of quantity demanded and supplied, cost and returns and the cost advantages of fuel <b>wood</b> utilization by <b>consumers</b> to other substitutes in Bosso Local Government Area of Niger State, Nigeria. Data were collected from 50 randomly selected fuel wood (charcoal and firewood) producers from Beji and Garatu communities and 60 randomly selected consumers from Maikunkele, Bosso/Maitumbi, Dutsenkura/Kpakungu communities. Analysis of data was done with the use of descriptive statistics, multiple regression analysis, cost and return analysis. Result shows that 72. 2 % of the variation in quantity demanded by the fuel <b>wood</b> <b>consumers</b> in the study area was explained by the identified determinants, 94. 6 % of the variation in the quantity the producers supplied. The average return realized by the charcoal producers per quantity produced in bags /month is N 7800. The average return realized by the firewood producers per quantity produced in Dyna truck/month is N 6600. The average return realized by the firewood producers per quantity produced per pickup truck/month is N 1600.

40|$|The {{ability to}} consume wood as food (xylotrophy) is unusual among animals. In {{terrestrial}} environments, termites and other xylotrophic insects are the principle <b>wood</b> <b>consumers</b> while in marine environments wood-boring bivalves fulfill this role. However, the evolutionary origin of wood feeding in bivalves has remained largely unexplored. Here we provide data indicating that xylotrophy has arisen just once in Bivalvia {{in a single}} wood-feeding bivalve lineage that subsequently diversified into distinct shallow- and deep-water branches, {{both of which have}} been broadly successful in colonizing the world's oceans. These data also suggest that the appearance of this remarkable life habit was approximately coincident with the acquisition of bacterial endosymbionts. Here we generate a robust phylogeny for xylotrophic bivalves and related species based on sequences of small and large subunit nuclear rRNA genes. We then trace the distribution among the modern taxa of morphological characters and character states associated with xylotrophy and xylotrepesis (wood-boring) and use a parsimony-based method to infer their ancestral states. Based on these ancestral state reconstructions we propose a set of plausible hypotheses describing the evolution of symbiotic xylotrophy in Bivalvia. Within this context, we reinterpret {{one of the most remarkable}} progressions in bivalve evolution, the transformation of the "typical" myoid body plan to create a unique lineage of worm-like, tube-forming, wood-feeding clams. The well-supported phylogeny presented here is inconsistent with most taxonomic treatments for xylotrophic bivalves, indicating that the bivalve family Pholadidae and the subfamilies Teredininae and Bankiinae of the family Teredinidae are non-monophyletic, and that the principle traits used for their taxonomic diagnosis are phylogenetically misleading...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Small landowners in {{the state}} of Oregon find it {{difficult}} to be competitive with larger companies to provide traditional forest products to consumers. Additionally, many landowners hope to be profitable from their land, but are not necessarily interested in or have the capability to harvest large tracts of timber. Specialty and niche forest products can potentially offer opportunities for many of Oregon's small landowners to improve stewardship and profitability from their land. To assess aspects of the current local specialty and niche forest products markets, interviews and surveys were conducted. Local area experts were interviewed to understand current market dynamics, a mail survey was administered to landowners and manufacturers in Clackamas and surrounding counties in Oregon, and a consumer survey was administered to attendees of a Local Forest Products Market. Topics that these surveys addressed included interest in specialty and niche forest products, barriers for landowners and manufacturers, the role of forest certification and forest stewardship at the local level, and what additional resources landowners and manufacturers would find most helpful. Results show that landowners, manufacturers, and consumers desire a stronger local economy and agree that forest stewardship is beneficial to the economy, society, and the environment. While landowners and manufacturers are most interested in pursuing markets for building materials and specialty <b>woods,</b> <b>consumers</b> are most interested in purchasing forest based foods and handicraft items. Landowners and manufacturers agree that the largest barriers to improving the local forest products sector are government regulations, and both agree that more marketing resources would be the most helpful. Some potential economic development projects for the region as identified by the results of this work include developing more outlets for regional forest products sales, development of educational materials for the public and forest sector employees, and the adoption of agroforestry practices to help landowners diversify forestlands and income...|$|R

40|$|A {{review was}} made of the current and past use of {{long-term}} supply contracts in the forestry, coal, and natural gas industries to assess the applicability of long-term supply contracts in bioenergy and why they are not prevalent. To assess past use, an extensive literature review was undertaken. In determining the current use of long-term supply contracts, professionals throughout woody biomass supply chain were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Participants represented forest landowners (non-industrial and industrial), pellet and biofuel producers, forestry management consultants, procurement firms, and energy producers (Biomass facilities, investor-owned utilities, and electric cooperatives). Participants were asked about their experiences with long-term supply contracts, willingness to enter into future long-term supply contracts, and factors that impact the decision-making process for decided whether to sell on the spot market or enter a long-term contract. Current use of long-term supply contracts was mixed, with only a few participants having willingly entered into a long-term supply contract. Several participants, who currently did not utilize long-term supply contracts, believed they had a system that worked and saw no need to change what “wasn’t broken. ” At the same time, many of these participants were open to considering long-term supply contracts in the future. Participants indicated several factors that were important to them when considering long-term supply contracts. Loss of control was particularly important for nonindustrial private timberland owners. Control was also important to other stakeholders in the bioenergy supply chain. These stakeholders believed long-term contracts could help them control the market by minimizing risk. Other important factors mentioned were the scale of operations to back a contract, pricing, use of long-term offtake agreements, building mills in areas with less competition, and the higher costs of bioenergy. Results from this study suggest the current lack of long-term supply contracts is attributable to a combination of relatively easy availability of <b>wood,</b> <b>consumers</b> not willing to pay a premium for a less efficient energy source as compared to coal, and stakeholders in the bioenergy supply chain being satisfied with their current system to procure/sell fiber. So is the current status quo likely to change? The answer is complicated. Due to the inefficiencies of woody biomass for energy and the efficiencies of using fossil fuels, bioenergy is not likely to gain significant market share without consumers being willing to pay more for energy. In places where it has expanded in use, contracts have usually been backed by subsidies. In the end, possibly the most important factor is how stakeholders view long-term contracts as a strategy. Buyers in this study mentioned them being financial undesirable due to their higher costs associated with price premiums. Sellers, on the other hand, said they felt long-term contracts would limit their ability to receive maximum value for their timber. Is it possible for them to be both? Well if the contract includes a rolling average pricing mechanism, it’s possible that at times it will be the highest priced/cost timber, and at other times the lowest priced/cost timber. It will however, never reach the market peaks or troughs that parties might experience in the spot market. Thus, if layered appropriately, it’s possible to keep your revenue/expenses relatively flat compared to participating in the spot market. This strategy is utilized by many Utilities and allows them to focus on eliminating inefficiencies elsewhere in their business while guaranteeing a steady supply/price. Thus, if parties looked at long-term contracts as a way to minimize market risk, via lowering market swings, we could see an increased future use of long-term contracts in the bioenergy and forestry industries...|$|R
40|$|In December of 2010, the Connecticut Departments of Agriculture and Environmental Protection {{agreed to}} extend the Connecticut Grown label {{associated}} with agricultural products to forest products traceable to Connecticut sources. 85 percent of the forests in Connecticut are privately owned, {{which has led to}} the preliminary promotion of the label to be connected to small local enterprise. Furthermore, wood must be harvested following environmental guidelines set by the DEEP. The success of this program hinges on consumer interest in a locally grown label and how it relates to the wood products being purchased. Little research has been done on consumer perceptions of local origin outside of food products. This gives rise to several relevant questions: Which aspects of this “Connecticut Grown” label add value to wood products? What are the opinions and attitudes of <b>wood</b> purchasing <b>consumers</b> and how do they relate to preferences for labeled products? What type of consumers should this label be marketed towards, and which aspects motivate their interest? To elicit consumer preferences for various aspects of the Connecticut Grown label, 6 choice experiments were designed for three different products (a small bundle of firewood, a cord of firewood, and hardwood flooring) for a total of 18 choice experiments. To examine how consumer preferences relate to one another, both a multinomial logit and a latent class model are estimated, revealing purchase preferences as well as which attributes drive those preferences. If rural enterprises can create value then forestlands may be less at-risk to development. This creates public benefits, including decreased transportation and energy use and increased environmental stewardship. The results of this research will help the state of Connecticut with promotion and implementation of Connecticut Grown labels by identifying who is likely to purchase Connecticut Grown products and the factors that are important in their decisions...|$|R

We tested the bonding of wood veneers, using phenolic resins in which part of the phenol-formaldehyde was replaced with carbohydrates. Our experiments show that the addition of non-reducing carbohydrates and various polyols to phenol-formaldehyde resol-resins does not adversely affect the dry- or wet-shear strength of 2 -ply Douglas-fir panels bonded with the modified resins. Reducing carbohydrates, however, cannot be used as the modifier. In general, addition of about 0. 6 - 1. 0 mole of modifier per mole of phenol is optimal in the formulation of carbohydrate-or polyol-modified resin. results show that part but not all of the modifier is chemically bound into the resin, apparently through an ether linkage. The water prehydrolysate of southern red oak wood, when reduced with sodium borohydride to convert the reducing sugars to alditols, can be used to modify phenol-formaldehyde resins.

40|$|In Senegal, {{as in most}} {{developing}} countries, domestic energy, much {{of which}} is used for preparing meals, is essentially drawn from fuelwood and charcoal. Extensive woodfelling for energy purposes causes severe damages to natural forests, already badly hit by drought {{and other types of}} human mismanagement. In this dissertation, it is argued that forest resources, wood energy producers, <b>wood</b> energy <b>consumers</b> and the State are part of a system, the dynamics of which can be represented by simple laws. A simulation model based on these laws is put forward as a tool for preparing the country's long term energy and forestry policies. In this model, the quantities of commercial wood fuels consumed, which affect the dynamics of forest resources, are determined by seeking an equilibrium of prices and consumed quantities on a spatial domestic energy market. The modelisation of price formation over space allows for an estimation of prices as a function of consumed quantities. Price formation is modelized not only for fuelwood and charcoal, but also for the main substitutes. Distances between production sites and consumers play an important role as they determine transport costs. The modelisation of consumption allows for an estimation of consumed quantities by fuel, as a function of prices. Consumers are classified by zone and type of village or town. Consumption by fuel is a result of energy requirements, stove-efficiencies and interfuel-substitution. Interfuel substitution is achieved by letting the part of each fuel (within the total energy requirements) slowly tend towards long-term equilibrium parts. The long term parts are themselves variables given by a linear logistic model as a function of explanatory variables. The importance of fuel prices and consumer income, within these explanatory variables, is highlighted. Apart from the extraction of commercialized wood fuels, the following phenomena are among those affecting the dynamics of forest resources in the model : natural vegetation growth (with yield reductions in case of vegetation depletion or drought), forest clearing for agricultural purposes, forest management (including establishment of fuelwood plantations), and extraction of uncommercial fuelwood. Decision variables, present {{at all levels of the}} model, allow for an evaluation of forestry and energy policies. This is shown by some examples of simulation results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a UK Open University research project which surveyed consumers’ reasons for adoption – and non-adoption – of domestic energy efficiency measures and renewable energy systems – collectively called low and zero carbon (LZC) technologies. Data was gathered during 2006 via an on-line questionnaire with nearly 400 responses, mainly from ‘green’ consumers, supplemented by 83 in-depth telephone interviews. These consumer surveys also identified problems and benefits experienced by adopters of these LZC technologies. The paper outlines some results of these surveys, for four established energy efficiency measures – loft insulation, condensing boilers, heating controls, and energy-efficient lighting – and for four renewable energy technologies – solar water heating, solar photovoltaics (PV), micro-wind turbines and <b>wood</b> stoves. These <b>consumers</b> typically adopted the energy efficiency measures and renewable energy systems to save energy, money and/or the environment, which many considered they achieved despite some rebound effects. The reasons for considering but rejecting these LZC technologies include the familiar cost barriers, {{but there were also}} other obstacles that varied according to the product or system concerned. An important finding is that most adopters of renewable energy systems have previously adopted two or more energy efficiency measures. Thus one conclusion is: sell energy efficiency first, then renewables. Whilst in the UK very few people have adopted household renewable energy systems, {{about a third of the}} consumers in our on-line survey said that they seriously considered adopting a renewable energy technology, although, only about 20...|$|R
40|$|Consumers in the United States are {{increasingly}} {{interested in buying}} locally grown/produced (LG/P) agricultural products (Connor et al. 2009). In comparison, consumer interest in buying local wood products is not evident. In {{the same way that}} the LG/P agriculture phenomenon has helped preserve farmland and foster awareness of where food originates, expanding local production of forest products may also create similar benefits for forestland both locally and globally. However, studies examining the “Buy Local” phenomenon and its potential to inform the local production of wood products are not apparent in the literature. This study examined consumer attitudes and beliefs that influence consumption of locally grown or produced agricultural products using the Pioneer Valley of western Massachusetts as a case study. Opinion leader interviews and consumer surveys were designed to answer the questions: why do consumers purchase local agriculture products; what are the consumer attitudes towards buying local agricultural products; and would these attitudes also support local wood consumption? Results from this case study revealed that consumers in the Pioneer Valley buy locally produced agriculture because they have favorable attitudes towards supporting local economies, and because of personal connections with local farmers. It was further revealed that attitudes that support local agriculture would also support purchasing local <b>wood</b> products, but <b>consumers</b> may not associate buying local wood products with supporting local economies. As such, educational and marketing efforts will be required to make clear connections between using local wood products and supporting local economies and communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in western wildfires over recent decades past {{can be attributed}} to accumulations of fuels and climate change that dries fuels and extends fire seasons. Silvicultural designed to reduce fuels while restoring other desirable conditions and providing a range of ecosystem services is an effective strategy for mitigating climate change. Fuel reduction treatments at a scale large enough to modify wildfire behavior will produce not only substantial quantities of <b>wood</b> to make <b>consumer</b> products and substitute for fossil energy but also additions to the workforce that will help revitalize rural economies. Forests also {{play a key role in}} the global carbon cycle by capturing, storing, and cycling carbon, functions that can be enhanced by active management. In addition to federal energy policy ambiguity (discussed earlier in “Towards a Cohesive Federal Policy for Wood Bionergy”) regulatory uncertainty for biomass energy production arises from the “carbon neutrality” debate about accounting for “biogenic” greenhouse gas emissions. A narrow focus on Clean Air Act implementation may overlook the carbon balance effect of sustainable forest management. Biomass utilization faces two economic challenges; neither is insurmountable. First, high costs of harvesting and transporting low-value biomass can be reduced with public subsidies. Benefits from avoided costs of wildfire suppression and site rehabilitation may exceed fuel treatment costs and create a rationale for subsidies. A policy choice is whether the subsidy should be merchantable timber, cash payments, or tax credits. The second challenge is long-term supply. Unless entrepreneurs can demonstrate reliable biomass supplies for 10 or 20 years, private capital is unlikely. On federal lands biomass supply planning is problematic, as are long-term contract mechanisms. Changes in agency policies could improve both problems. Large-scale restoration treatments in the short term provide a “triple win”: improved forest conditions, renewable energy feedstocks, and revitalized rural communities. The reduction of carbon emissions from burning wood in a boiler to make energy instead of open burning, whether in wildfires or slash piles, is a bonus. The long-term payoff from large-scale restoration treatments will be enhanced energy security, along with other benefits to society that ought to be mentioned in the same breath as treatment cos...|$|R
40|$|Production of {{commercial}} agricultural commodities for {{domestic and foreign}} markets is increasingly driving land clearing in tropical regions, creating links and feedback effects between geographically separated consumption and production locations. Such teleconnections are commonly studied through calculating consumption footprints and quantifying environmental impacts embodied in trade flows, e. g., virtual water and land, biomass, or greenhouse gas emissions. The extent to which land-use change (LUC) and associated carbon emissions are embodied in the production and export of agricultural commodities has been less studied. Here we quantify tropical deforestation area and carbon emissions from LUC induced by the production and the export of four commodities (beef, soybeans, palm oil, and wood products) in seven countries with high deforestation rates (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea). We show that in the period 2000 - 2011, {{the production of the}} four analyzed commodities in our seven case countries was responsible for 40 % of total tropical deforestation and resulting carbon losses. Over a third of these impacts was embodied in exports in 2011, up from a fifth in 2000. This trend highlights the growing influence of global markets in deforestation dynamics. Main flows of embodied LUC are Latin American beef and soybean exports to markets in Europe, China, the former Soviet bloc, the Middle East and Northern Africa, whereas embodied emission flows are dominated by Southeast Asian exports of palm oil and <b>wood</b> products to <b>consumers</b> in China, India and the rest of Asia, {{as well as to the}} European Union. Our findings illustrate the growing role that global consumers play in tropical LUC trajectories and highlight the need for demand-side policies covering whole supply chains. We also discuss the limitations of such demand-side measures and call for a combination of supply- and demand-side policies to effectively limit tropical deforestation, along with research into the interactions of different types of policy interventions.

40|$|Southeast Europe (SEE) {{has been}} lagging in {{transition}} and development. For political, security and institutional reasons, it has {{developed in a}} non-standard way. However, the prospects for reforms and growth are now better {{than they have been}} in a decade, if not longer. There are positive political changes and there are signs of economic recovery. Also, there is increased openness to foreign business participation. In the SEE countries, stabilization has been put ahead of institutional transformation in almost all cases. As a consequence, significant macroeconomic disequilibria have emerged, especially in external economic relations and on labour markets trade and current account deficits are high as are the unemployment rates. However, price stability seems to have been sustained in most of the region and growth rates are turning positive throughout the region. Thus, with further reforms, a momentum may develop for sustained development. SEE is a diverse region in terms of development and in terms of intra-regional and inter?regional integration. GDP per capita is low on average, but it varies significantly across countries in the region. There are too many borders that are often quite difficult to cross. Also, the countries in the region have quite diverse relations with the European Union. After years of negative growth, most countries in the region are growing. This growth should continue. There may be problems with macroeconomic adjustments and with institutional reforms, but there are signs that the current growth is coming as a consequence of restructuring that is taking place. If that proves to be true, the region may offer significant business opportunities as it is in fact rather large (55 million people) with a reasonably skilled work force. There is an increasing inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI). This is driven by the need to substitute non-debt-creating financial inflows for debt-creating ones. The financial inflows are necessary because foreign debt is, as a rule, high and because current accounts are almost invariably and persistently in the red. Also, privatization is speeding up and fiscal constraints are pushing companies to adjust to the markets and thus to look for better owners and better managers. One sector that is especially weak is banking. Though there were attempts in many cases to preserve the monopoly of the domestic banks, those efforts invariably failed and much of the industry is being sold to foreigners. The prospects are that the whole industry will be mainly foreign-owned. The region offers significant comparative advantages. Human capital endowment is one. Wages are low and labour is relatively skilled. Thus, the region has advantages in all sectors which are labour-intensive. This goes for agriculture, certain industries (textiles, leather, shoes), extraction, which is still somewhat important, <b>wood,</b> durable <b>consumer</b> goods, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Services, tourism, construction, transportation (vehicles, ship-building) as well as internet-based economic activities offer significant opportunities. SEE economies are mostly small (except for Romania) and are actually or potentially open or very open economies. Their main trading partners are in the EU. Intra-regional trade is important only exceptionally. This direction of trade will remain in the future, and will probably be strengthened once trade distortions are removed. The flow of investments shows the same direction. Therefore, economic integration with the EU is all but inevitable. The labour markets present major problems. Both employment and unemployment are unsatisfactory. There is too much black market employment and too little regular employment. The unemployment rates vary from significant to high to catastrophic. There are any number of other problems with the labour markets that {{have to be dealt with}} through restructuring. Prospects for EU integration are also better than they have been for a long while. Bulgaria and Romania are candidate countries while the rest are candidates for Stabilization and Association Agreements. This asymmetry is creating problems of perception in the region, i. e., everybody thinks that the chances of joining the EU are remote, thus these prospects do not play too much of a role in the day-to-day politics. Still, the effort that is put in the Stability Pact may prove helpful in forging a better chance for the region to move more quickly towards adopting those reforms and policies that would bring it closer to the EU. In conclusion, business opportunities are bound to improve in SEE. The conditions are going to remain less than standard, but there is an international effort to help the business community to enter this region and help in its transformation. This is going to be done by public investments and by public and other guarantee schemes for prospective private investors, both domestic and foreign. If growth stabilizes, business should be good. development, FDI, growth, integration...|$|R
