The original pole had a brass <b>wash</b> <b>basin</b> at the top (representing the vessel in which leeches were kept) and bottom (representing the basin that received the blood). The pole itself represents the staff that the patient gripped during the procedure to encourage blood flow.|$|E
500|$|Each of {{the upper}} floors of the tower block has a kitchen, a laundry and wash rooms as well as ten [...] "study-bedrooms" [...] and two larger rooms linked by a lobby. Each study room has a <b>wash</b> <b>basin</b> and fitted wardrobe. Originally the {{interior}} walls of the extension were not plastered since a plastic-faced plywood framework {{had been used to}} give a higher quality finish to the concrete, rendering plastering unnecessary. As a result, internal decoration was applied directly to the concrete walls.|$|E

2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking, a {{daughter}} of Oglala Lakota Chief American Horse, {{was among the first}} wave of children brought from Rosebud and one of Captain Pratt's model students. Maggie had difficulty adjusting to the demands of her new lifestyle at Carlisle, and once slapped Miss Hyde, the matron, when Hyde insisted that Maggie make her bed every day and keep her room clean. Instead of retaliating, Miss Hyde stood her ground and Maggie acquiesced. Like most of the Carlisle students, Maggie was enrolled in the Summer Outing Program. After her arrival to her country home, Maggie wrote a letter to Pratt. [...] "Dear Captain Pratt: What shall I do? I have been here two weeks and I have not bathed. These folks have no bath place.

2500|$|After her arrest, she {{was held}} at an annex to the Old Capitol Prison before being {{transferred}} to the Washington Arsenal on April 30. Two armed guards stood before {{the door to her}} cell from the beginning of her imprisonment until her death. Her cell, while airy and larger than the others, was sparsely furnished, with a straw mattress, table, <b>wash</b> <b>basin,</b> chair, and a bucket. Food was served four times a day, always of bread; salt pork, beef, or beef soup; and coffee or water. The other arrested conspirators had their heads enclosed in a padded canvas bag to prevent a suicide attempt. Sources disagree as to whether Surratt was forced to wear it as well. Although the others wore iron manacles on their feet and ankles, she was not manacled. (Rumors to the contrary were raised by reporters at the trial who could not see her or [...] "heard" [...] the clank of chains about her feet. The rumors were repeatedly investigated and denied.) She began to suffer menstrual bleeding and became weak during her detention. She was given a rocking chair and allowed visits from her daughter, Anna. She and Powell received the most attention from the press. The Northern press was also highly critical of her.|$|E

60|$|The {{room was}} the typical bedroom {{of the typical}} boarding-house, {{furnished}}, insofar {{as it could be}} said to be furnished at all, with a severe simplicity. It contained two beds, a pine chest of drawers, a strip of faded carpet, and a <b>wash</b> <b>basin.</b> But there was that on the floor which set this room apart from a thousand rooms of the same kind. Flat on his back, with his hands tightly clenched and one leg twisted oddly under him and with his teeth gleaming through his grey beard in a horrible grin, Captain John Gunner stared up at the ceiling with eyes that saw nothing.|$|E

60|$|But Mr. McCaskey was no 50-cent table d'hôter. Let cheap Bohemians {{consider}} coffee the end, if they would. Let {{them make}} that faux pas. He was foxier still. Finger-bowls were not beyond the compass of his experience. They {{were not to}} be had in the Pension Murphy; but their equivalent was at hand. Triumphantly he sent the granite-ware <b>wash</b> <b>basin</b> at the head of his matrimonial adversary. Mrs. McCaskey dodged in time. She reached for a flatiron, with which, as a sort of cordial, she hoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close. But a loud, wailing scream downstairs caused both her and Mr. McCaskey to pause in a sort of involuntary armistice.|$|E
60|$|Where in {{the world}} the soul goes to under such {{influences}} nobody knows; one would really think the sea tipped it all out of a man, just as it does {{the water out of}} his <b>wash</b> <b>basin.</b> The soul seems to be like one of the genii enclosed in a vase, in the Arabian Nights; now, it rises like a pillar of cloud, and floats over land and sea, buoyant, many-hued, and glorious; again, it goes down, down, subsiding into its copper vase, and the cover is clapped on, and there you are. A sea voyage is the best device for getting the soul back into its vase that I know of.|$|E
60|$|As soon as Rollo and Jane found {{themselves}} thus established {{in their state}} rooms, they began to examine the furniture and fixtures around them with great curiosity. They were particularly interested in observing the precautions which had been taken in securing every thing which the state rooms contained, from the danger of being thrown about by {{the motion of the}} ship. The <b>wash</b> <b>basin</b> was made of marble, and was firmly set in its place, so as to be absolutely immovable. There was a hole in the bottom of it, with a plug in it, so that, by drawing out the plug, the water could be let off into a pipe which conveyed it away. There was a small chain attached to this plug, by means of which it could be drawn up when any one wished to let the water off. The pitcher was made broad and flat at the bottom, and very heavy, so that it could not be easily upset; {{and then there was a}} socket for it in the lower part of the wash stand, which confined it effectually, and prevented its sliding about when the ship was rolling in a heavy sea.|$|E
