Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as <b>wool</b> <b>insulation.</b> In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E

Finally in 2001, Berkshire acquired 87 percent of Dalton, Georgia-based Shaw Industries, Inc. Shaw is the world’s largest carpet manufacturer based on both revenue and volume of production and designs and manufactures over 3,000 styles of tufted and woven carpet and laminate flooring for residential and commercial use under approximately 30 brand and trade names and under certain private labels.

40|$|An in situ {{experiment}} {{in a full}} scale timber frame test building was carried out to compare the hygrothermal performance of Hemp and Stone <b>Wool</b> <b>insulations</b> of identical thermal conductivity. Hemp and Stone <b>Wool</b> <b>insulations</b> were installed in timber frame wall panels without vapour barrier. The comparison was made in terms of heat transfer properties, likelihood of mould growth and condensation. Step changes in internal relative humidity were performed to explore the effect of high and normal internal moisture load on the wall panels. No {{significant difference between the}} average equivalent thermal transmittance (U-values) of the panels incorporating Hemp and Stone <b>Wool</b> <b>insulations</b> was observed. The average equivalent U-values of the panels were closer to the calculated U-values of the panels based on the manufacturers’ declared thermal conductivity of Hemp and Stone <b>Wool</b> <b>insulations.</b> It was observed that the placement of heat flux sensor along the depth of the insulation had significant influence on the measured equivalent U-value of the panels during high internal moisture load. The frequency and likelihood of condensation was higher in the interface of Stone Wool and Oriented Strand Board (OSB). In terms of the parametric assessment of mould germination potential, relative humidity, temperature and exposure conditions in the insulation-OSB interfaces were found to be favourable to germination of mould spore. However, when the insulations were dismantled, no mould was visually detected...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Wool</b> <b>insulation</b> is {{made from}} sheep wool fibres that are either {{mechanically}} held together or bonded using between 5% and 20% recycled polyester adhesive to form insulating batts, rolls and ropes. Natural <b>wool</b> <b>insulation</b> is effective for both thermal and acoustic insulation. The wool is often sourced from the less expensive black wools of the UK and Europe. Batts are commonly used in the walls and ceilings of timber-frame buildings, rolls can be cut to size for lofts, and ropes can be used between the logs in log homes. Natural <b>wool</b> <b>insulation</b> should be distinguished from mineral <b>wool</b> <b>insulation,</b> also called slag wool or rock wool, which only resembles natural wool fibers.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} whether application of <b>insulation</b> <b>wool</b> adversely affects lung volumes {{and increases the}} occurrence of symptoms of airway irritation. METHODS: Data from nationwide health check ups in 1981 - 93 of male construction workers born in 1955 or later were used to investigate cross sectional (n = 96, 004) and longitudinal (n = 26, 298) associations between lung volumes, vital capacity (VC), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and exposure to <b>insulation</b> <b>wool</b> by combining a job exposure matrix (JEM) and self reported exposure. Data on 12 month prevalence of persistent cough not associated with the common cold was available for the period 1989 - 92. Potential confounding from smoking, exposure to asbestos, silica, and isocyanates, was considered in the analyses. RESULTS: For those in the highest exposure category (self reported duration of exposure of > or = 11 years, and high exposure according to the JEM) VC was on average 2. 5 cl lower (95 % CI - 6. 5 to 1. 5) than in those with no exposure. The corresponding figures for FEV 1 was - 2. 4 cl (95 % CI - 6. 1 to 1. 3). In the longitudinal analyses, the yearly change in VC {{between the first and}} last spirometry for those in the highest exposure category was 0. 50 cl (95 % CI - 0. 97 to 1. 98) less than in the unexposed category. The corresponding figure for FEV 1 was 0. 89 cl (95 % CI - 0. 70 to 2. 06). High exposure to <b>insulation</b> <b>wool,</b> asbestos, or silica, during the 12 months preceding the check up was associated with increased odds ratios (ORs) for persistent cough of the same magnitude as current smoking.
