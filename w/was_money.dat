5|$|The first {{history of}} Christian Science {{appeared}} in McClure's magazine in 14 installments from January 1907 to June 1908, preceded by {{an editorial in}} December 1906. The essence of the articles, which included court documents and affidavits from Eddy's associates, was that Eddy's chief concern <b>was</b> <b>money,</b> {{and that she had}} derived Christian Science from Quimby. The material was also published as a book, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science (1909). It became the key source for most non-church histories of the religion. The editor-in-chief assigned five writers to work on the series, including the novelist Willa Cather as the principal author. The book was kept out of print from early in its life by the Christian Science church, which bought the original manuscript. It was republished in 1971 by Baker Book House when its copyright expired, and again in 1993 by the University of Nebraska Press.|$|E

25|$|Key {{architectural}} {{references in}} the development of the Somerset towers were Gloucester Cathedral, Wells Cathedral (begun around 1180 and consecrated 1239), and Glastonbury Abbey (begun 1184) and their renovations into the 14th century.

Rome's allies the Aedui had been defeated by their Gallic rivals, {{with the help of a}} contingent of Germanic Suebi under Ariovistus, who had settled in conquered Aeduan land, and the Helvetii were mobilising for a mass migration, which the Romans feared had warlike intent.

25|$|French arms at Heidelberg, Rosas, Huy, Landen, Charleroi and Marsaglia had {{achieved}} considerable battlefield success, {{but with the}} severe hardships of 1693 continuing through to the summer of 1694 France was unable to expend {{the same level of}} energy and finance for the forthcoming campaign. The crisis reshaped French strategy, forcing commanders to redraft plans to fit the dictates of fiscal shortfalls. In the background Louis XIV's agents were working hard diplomatically to unhinge the coalition but the Emperor, who had secured with the Allies his 'rights' to the Spanish succession should Charles II die during the conflict, did not desire a peace that would not prove personally advantageous. The Grand Alliance would not come apart as long as there <b>was</b> <b>money</b> available and a belief that the growing strength of their armies would soon be much greater than those of France.|$|E

60|$|There {{has been}} a great amount of {{discussion}} and argument on the question whether several of these forms of credit, and in particular whether bank-notes, ought to <b>be</b> considered as <b>money.</b> It seems to be {{an essential part of the}} idea of <b>money</b> that it <b>be</b> legal tender. An inconvertible paper which is legal tender is universally admitted to be money; in the French language the phrase papier-monnaie actually means inconvertibility, convertible notes being merely billets à porteur. An instrument which would be deprived of all value by the insolvency of a corporation can not <b>be</b> <b>money</b> in any sense in which <b>money</b> <b>is</b> opposed to credit.

500|$|In his {{tribute to}} the writer, Bernard Hayes said [...] "Tunis has {{probably}} made good readers of millions of young people." [...] His success with the juvenile audience helped change the publishing industry.

His influence went beyond simply creating a market for young adult books. [...] "In his attempt to link sports with the communities in which they are played, he broached some highly significant issues in the literature written for and about America's youth", according to John S. Simmons in John R. Tunis and the Sports Novels for Adolescents: A Little Ahead of His Time. Tunis never considered himself a writer of boys' books, insisting his stories could be read and enjoyed by adults. He felt that the word [...] "juvenile" [...] was an [...] "odious... product of a merchandising age". Despite his dislike of the term, Tunis' novels helped create and shape the juvenile fiction book market.|$|E

500|$|He led {{guerrilla warfare}} against Swedish troops of Charles X, {{a type of}} a {{campaign}} he authored, despite the objections of the hetmans, who by that time returned to serve under John Casmimir Vasa. The mobile Swedish forces, even with their significant firepower, proved to be rather vulnerable to Czarniecki's guerrilla-style warfare. Czarniecki was defeated {{at the battle of}} Gołąb in mid-February 1656, but later inflicted serious defeats upon the Swedes, notably at the Battle of Warka in April that year. The tide of the war turned several times that year, and he was again defeated at the battle of Kłecko and battle of Kscynia. His defeats, however, were limited, and in most cases he was able to retreat with most of his army in good order. Under his direction the popular rising against the Swedish troops in Greater Poland proved highly successful. It was against his advice that the battle of Warsaw was fought, and his subsequent strategy neutralized the ill effects of this defeat. Despite support from the king, Czarniecki was seen by many older, established noble family as an arrogant newcomer, and they prevented him from getting the hetman office that year; instead early next year he received the office of the voivode of Ruthenia, and an extraordinary title of the [...] "general and vice commander of the royal forces", which put him in a position of an unofficial hetman-like authority. The Field Crown Hetmanship went to Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, also an accomplished commander, if not so much as Czarniecki – but from a magnate Lubomirski family; Czarniecki commented famously that [...] "Not of salt, or fields, I am, but from what hurts me", alluding to the fact that Lubormirski family built its fortune on salt trade and agriculture, whereas his smaller one was built through military service – yet it <b>was</b> <b>money</b> and politics, not military experience, that decided who was to get the hetman's office.|$|E
