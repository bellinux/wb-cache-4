Some believed Parkman had simply left the city; others thought he had been beaten up for the money he always carried with him. Unsigned letters mailed from Boston proposed various scenarios. Marshal Tukey had the Charles River and Boston Harbor dragged for a body, and sent men to neighboring towns to check. Search parties were formed that went out day and night. The police searched Parkman's buildings, both rented and vacant, and even abandoned buildings {{that he did not}} own. Officer Derastus Clapp and other police officers from Francis Tukey's newly formed professional police force made their first search of his rooms. They returned once, each time placing special emphasis on the laboratories and dissecting vaults, but they found nothing to indicate that Parkman had been there.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century the basic Clarendon face was radically altered by {{foundries}} in the United States, resulting in the production of the 'French Clarendon' type style, which had enlarged block serifs at top and bottom.
