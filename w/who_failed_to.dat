5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century, {{four types}} of {{midshipman}} existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (apprentice officer), and midshipman ordinary. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, {{some members of the}} original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.|$|E

Edwards clinched his eighth pole position during his career, {{with a time}} of 26.224 seconds, which was a new track record. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Kurt Busch. Kahne qualified third, Kyle Busch took fourth, and Smith started fifth. Joey Logano, Martin Truex, Jr., McMurray, Keselowski, and Biffle rounded out the first ten positions.

5|$|In 2010, Lim mooted {{the idea}} that the {{proportion}} of each Primary 1 cohort that would be seeking a university education should be increased beyond the 30% by 2015 that the Government was planning. She noted that in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2006 about 37% of each age cohort received a degree-level education, and that a sizeable number of Singaporean students <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> gain entry into local universities had done well in reputable universities overseas. She also suggested giving concessionary fares to disabled individuals who make up 2% of the adult population under 60 years.|$|E

The triumvirs then set in motion proscriptions in which 300 senators and 2,000 equites allegedly were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and, for those <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> escape, their lives.|$|E

5|$|On 12 May 1942, Soviet forces {{under the}} command of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko {{launched}} an offensive against the German 6th Army from a salient established during the winter counter-offensive. After initial promising signs, the offensive was stopped by German counterattacks. Critical errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly trained forces, led to a German pincer attack which cut off advancing Soviet troops {{from the rest of the}} front. The operation caused almost 300,000 Soviet casualties compared to just 20,000 for the Germans and their allies.|$|E
5|$|The DDoS {{attacks were}} at first {{carried out with}} the Gigaloader and JMeter {{application}}s.

The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal; however, it would also lead {{to a number of}} arrests of less experienced Anons <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> conceal their IP addresses.

5|$|The genus Iridomyrmex {{was first}} {{described}} by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862, {{but it had}} no designated type species until 1903.

The genus {{was placed in the}} subfamily Dolichoderinae in 1878, the same year the subfamily was established. Since the establishment of the genus, it suffered taxonomic misunderstanding due to the gradual development of unrelated ants being designated into the genus by early researchers <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> identify easily recognisable features that would make them distinct from the genus Iridomyrmex.|$|E
