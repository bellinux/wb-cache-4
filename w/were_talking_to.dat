X-Ray Company was {{conducting}} an operation alongside Afghan National Army troops to dominate areas posing a dangerous threat to British forces and the local Afghan population. The men who were killed were members of the Quick Reaction Force (QRF) which was working in support of the company operation. The members of the QRF <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> locals when a 13-year-old boy pushed a wheelbarrow containing an explosive device toward them, which was then detonated killing the marines and killing and injuring a number of children and civilians. It is thought that the boy did not know about the explosives in the wheelbarrow and was an unsuspecting victim of the blast.|$|E

In one scene, Stewie mentions the time [...] "Peter went after that hockey coach" [...] (making a veiled reference to [...] "Hockey Dad" [...] Thomas Junta), in the expectation of a cutaway gag. However, nothing happens, and Stewie comments, [...] "Oh, no clip? Thought we had a clip". This scene was described as being a one off.|$|E
500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> me about going different routes. I could feel people up in my face, and I was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E

2500|$|The pre-Broadway run in Washington, D.C. was a {{critical}} and commercial success, although none of the reviews mentioned Sondheim, listed as co-lyricist, who was overshadowed by the better-known Bernstein. Bernstein magnanimously removed his name as co-author of the lyrics, although Sondheim was uncertain he wanted to receive sole credit for what he considered to be overly florid contributions by Bernstein. Robbins demanded and received a [...] "Conceived by" [...] credit, {{and used it to}} justify his making major decisions regarding changes in the show without consulting the others.

2500|$|In Czech, an {{apostrophe}} is {{used for}} writing to indicate spoken or informal language where the writer wants to express the natural way of informal speech, but {{it should not be}} used in formal text or text of a serious nature. E.G: Instead of [...] "četl" [...] ("he read"), the word form [...] "čet'" [...] is used. [...] "Čet'" [...] is the informal variant of the verb form [...] "četl", at least in some varieties. These two words are the same in meaning, but to use the informal form gives the text a more natural tone, as though a friend <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you. Furthermore, the same as in the Slovak case above holds for lowercase t and d, and for the two-digit year notation.|$|E

The announcers spoke in stentorian tones, as if giving a formal speech to a crowd and not communicating on a personal level. Godfrey vowed that {{when he returned to the}} airwaves, he would affect a relaxed, informal style as if he <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> just one person. He also used that style to do his own commercials and became a regional star.

2500|$|Controversy {{arose in}} the court case of the 26 accused as the state was alleged to have {{suppressed}} the legal rights of the accused. On 23 October [...] lawyers of the accused walked out in protest against the stand taken by the Metropolitan Magistrate. The lawyers wanted to meet the accused alone, however, they had moved an application stating that police did {{not allow them to}} meet their clients alone and that the Court should direct the police not to remain present while they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the accused. The Metropolitan Magistrate countered that it was not possible as police had to be with the accused. He is said to have hinted at collusion between the lawyers and the accused, causing a walk out by the accused's lawyers. The next day, in two different cases, the designated Metropolitan Court remanded all the 26 accused to police custody till 31 October.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum {{created a}} program which {{appeared}} to pass the Turing test. The program, known as ELIZA, worked by examining a user's typed comments for keywords. If a keyword is found, a rule that transforms the user's comments is applied, and the resulting sentence is returned. If a keyword is not found, ELIZA responds either with a generic riposte or by repeating one of the earlier comments. In addition, Weizenbaum developed ELIZA to replicate the behaviour of a Rogerian psychotherapist, allowing ELIZA to be [...] "free to assume the pose of knowing almost nothing of the real world." [...] With these techniques, Weizenbaum's program was able to fool some people into believing that they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a real person, with some subjects being [...] "very hard to convince that ELIZA [...] is not human." [...] Thus, ELIZA is claimed {{by some to be}} one of the programs (perhaps the first) able to pass the Turing Test, even though this view is highly contentious (see below).|$|E

2500|$|Hawking has {{estimated}} that he studied about a thousand hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, {{and he decided to}} answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) necessary. Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the oral to describe his future plans, he said, [...] "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First." [...] He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners [...] "were intelligent enough to realise they <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> someone far cleverer than most of themselves". After receiving a first-class BA (Hons.) degree in natural science and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.|$|E
