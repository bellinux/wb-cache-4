5000|$|Since {{the neutral}} pion is not {{electrically}} charged, {{it is more}} difficult to detect and observe than the charged pions are. Neutral pions do not leave tracks in photographic emulsions, and neither do they in <b>Wilson</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers.</b> The existence of the neutral pion was inferred from observing its decay products from cosmic rays, a so-called [...] "soft component" [...] of slow electrons with photons. The [...] was identified definitively at the University of California's cyclotron in 1950 by observing its decay into two photons. Later in the same year, they were also observed in cosmic-ray balloon experiments at Bristol University.|$|R
5000|$|Schlieren is the German plural of schliere, {{which is}} German for the English word streak. Schlieren are visible streaks {{produced}} in a transparent medium {{as a result}} of variations in the medium's density leading to variations in refractive index. [...] Anything that disturbs the atmosphere may be detected (Schlieren Photography) because of the Schlieren effect caused by that atmospheric disturbance. This type of Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) detection falls under the category of Electro-optical MASINT. A telephoto or telescopic picture of a jet passing between the photographer and a full moon will sometimes show the outline of the aircraft as well as the atmospheric distortions of the exhaust plumes. This passive principle can be used at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Passive signature intelligence has captured stealth aircraft in flight by accident, when such aircraft fly between Earth imaging satellites and ground (can be seen in products like Google Earth). Once a stealth signature has been captured, it may be loaded into a database library for an active and live satellite search at any point in the future. Ground at past versus ground at present differential comparisons can be made to determine flight paths and altitudes of stealth aircraft. This disturbance and disturbing influence method has been used for finding ships at sea through wake generation tracking and even in <b>Wilson</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> for particle discovery and tracking. The key principle is that the disturbance is much more visible in area and volume than the disturbing point source and converges attention to the much smaller disturbing source.|$|R
5000|$|Nuclear {{mushroom}} {{clouds are}} {{often accompanied by}} short-lived vapour clouds, known variously as [...] "Wilson clouds", condensation clouds, or vapor rings. The [...] "negative phase" [...] following the positive overpressure behind a shock front causes a sudden rarefaction of the surrounding medium. This low pressure region causes an adiabatic drop in temperature, causing moisture {{in the air to}} condense in an outward moving shell surrounding the explosion. When the pressure and temperature return to normal, the <b>Wilson</b> <b>cloud</b> dissipates. Scientists observing the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946 at Bikini Atoll named that transitory cloud a [...] "Wilson cloud" [...] because of its visual similarity to a <b>Wilson</b> <b>cloud</b> chamber; the <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> uses condensation from a rapid pressure drop to mark the tracks of electrically charged subatomic particles. Analysts of later nuclear bomb tests used the more general term [...] "condensation cloud" [...] in preference to [...] "Wilson cloud".|$|R

40|$|Although radon {{professionals}} are frequently {{asked to explain}} the health hazards caused by the inhalation of radon decay products and the subsequent impact of alpha particles on delicate lung tissues, very few radon testers and/or mitigators have actually "seen " an alpha particle. One of the time honored methods of viewing alpha particles in motion is to insert an alpha radiation source into a diffusion <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> and to watch the tracks made by the alpha particles in real time as they traverse a cloud made by a supersaturated solution of methyl alcohol in air. Commercial <b>cloud</b> <b>chambers</b> are costly ($ 500. 00 and up).

50|$|Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869-1959), a Scottish physicist, is {{credited}} with inventing the <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber.</b> Inspired by sightings of the Brocken spectre while working on the summit of Ben Nevis in 1894, he began to develop expansion <b>chambers</b> for studying <b>cloud</b> formation and optical phenomena in moist air. Very rapidly he discovered that ions could act as centers for water droplet formation in such chambers. He pursued the application of this discovery and perfected the first <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> in 1911. In Wilson's original chamber the air inside the sealed device was saturated with water vapor, then a diaphragm was used to expand the air inside the chamber (adiabatic expansion), cooling the air and starting to condense water vapor. Hence the name expansion <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> is used. When an ionizing particle passes through the chamber, water vapor condenses on the resulting ions and {{the trail of the}} particle is visible in the vapor <b>cloud.</b> <b>Wilson,</b> along with Arthur Compton, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his work on the <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber.</b> This kind of chamber is also called a Pulsed Chamber because the conditions for operation are not continuously maintained. Further developments were made by Patrick Blackett who utilised a stiff spring to expand and compress the chamber very rapidly, making the chamber sensitive to particles several times a second. A cine film was used to record the images.|$|R

In a <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber,</b> particles pass though gas and collide with metal plates that obscure the scientists' view of the event. The <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber</b> also needs time to reset between recording events and cannot keep up with accelerators' rate of particle production.|$|R

5000|$|Scientists {{observing the}} Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946 at Bikini Atoll named that {{transitory}} cloud a [...] "Wilson cloud" [...] {{because of its}} similarity to {{the appearance of the}} inside of a <b>Wilson</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>chamber,</b> an instrument they would have been familiar with. (The cloud chamber effect is caused by a temporary reduction in pressure in a closed system and marks the tracks of electrically-charged sub-atomic particles.) Analysts of later nuclear bomb tests used the more general term condensation cloud.|$|E
5000|$|These {{condensation}} clouds {{can often}} be seen appearing around space-bound rockets as they accelerate through the atmosphere. For example, they were frequently seen during Space Shuttle launches, about 25 to 33 seconds after launch, when the vehicle was traveling at transonic speeds.

High-energy X-rays were applied to ionize gas particles and observe photoelectric electrons. The observation of electron tracks that were independent of the frequency of the incident photon suggested a mechanism for electron ionization that was caused from an internal conversion of energy from a radiationless transition. Further investigation, and theoretical work using elementary quantum mechanics and transition rate/transition probability calculations, showed that the effect was a radiationless effect more than an internal conversion effect.|$|E
