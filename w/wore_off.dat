5|$|Grand Duchess Marguerite Louise and Dowager Grand Duchess Vittoria vied {{with each}} other for power. The Dowager, after a {{protracted}} battle, triumphed: The Grand Duke assigned his mother the day-to-day administration of the state. Cosimo III commenced his reign with the utmost fervour, attempting to salvage the sinking exchequer and allowing his subjects to petition him for arbitration in disputes. The novelty soon <b>wore</b> <b>off,</b> however. Vittoria, Cosimo having lost his taste for administration, was further empowered by admission to the Grand Duke's Consulta (Privy Council). Marguerite Louise, deprived of any political influence, went about arranging Prince Ferdinando's education and aruing with Vittoria over precedence, which only further encamped Cosimo on his mother's side. In the midst of this, on the first anniversary of Ferdinando II's death, Gian Gastone was born to the grand ducal couple.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Shackleton {{returned}} to New Zealand from the Ross Sea, having {{picked up the}} survivors of the winter party, Worsley travelled to England aboard the RMS Makura. As an RNR officer, he wanted to join in the fight against Imperial Germany. After arriving in Liverpool, {{he made his way to}} London and was quickly assigned to HMS Pembroke, the shore station at Chatham. Here, for three months, he learned about fighting U-boats, which were causing considerable damage to supply convoys crossing the Atlantic. Several tactics were deployed against the U-boats. One of these involved the use of Q-ships, small merchant vessels fitted out with hidden armament that could be deployed against any U-boats which surfaced and approached the seemingly unarmed ship. Another tactic was the use of P-boats, which were patrol boats that carried out convoy escort duties and anti-submarine work. The P-boats had a distinctive profile, and their effectiveness <b>wore</b> <b>off</b> as U-boat commanders began to recognise and avoid them. The later built P-boats were designed with a more conventional profile approximating that of a merchant ship, and thus were similar to Q-ships.|$|E
25|$|The {{third season}} (after Ritter's death) took a {{creative}} turn, revolving more around cousin C.J.

This <b>wear</b> <b>off,</b> however, appealed only to middle-class voters.|$|R

25|$|During the 18th century, opium {{was found}} to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its {{sedative}} and tranquilizing properties, it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis, help with people who were considered insane, and also to help treat patients with insomnia. However, despite its medicinal values in these cases, it was noted that in cases of psychosis, it could cause anger or depression, and due to the drug's euphoric effects, it could cause depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects <b>wore</b> <b>off</b> because they would get used to being high.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{with the}} 1986 model year, the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada {{mandated}} that all new passenger cars come {{equipped with a}} CHMSL. The requirement was extended to light trucks and vans for the 1994 model year. Early studies involving taxicabs and other fleet vehicles found that a third, high-level stop lamp reduced rear-end collisions by about 50%. Once the novelty effect <b>wore</b> <b>off</b> as most vehicles on the road came to be equipped with the central third stop lamp, the crash-avoidance benefit declined. However, it did not decline to zero, and a CHMSL is so inexpensive to incorporate into a vehicle {{that it is a}} cost-effective collision avoidance feature even at the long-term enduring crash-reduction benefit of 4.3%.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Winfrey and King decided to go on an 11-day road trip across America, from California to New York, 3,600 miles. They were excited to meet people from small towns and see how America really lives. However, the initial {{excitement}} quickly <b>wore</b> <b>off.</b> The friends had minor meltdowns and fought for control over the radio; King likes to have music constantly playing while driving, Winfrey prefers silence. Despite {{the challenges of the}} road trip, they got to see the beauty of Sedona, meet the people of Navajo Nation, crash a couple of weddings, take a dip in the healing waters of Pagosa Springs, and learn about Amish culture. Winfrey's many driving anxieties and King's tone-deaf singing made the trip a huge hit with viewers.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of LSVT-BIG for advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with <b>wearing</b> <b>off</b> {{remains to be}} determined. Therefore, we evaluated whether LSVT-BIG improves motor disability in eight PD patients with <b>wearing</b> <b>off.</b> Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores, daily off time, and mobility assessments were evaluated during the “on” time {{before and after the}} LSVT-BIG course. LSVT-BIG significantly improved UPDRS III scores at 4 weeks and UPDRS II scores in the “off” state at 12 weeks, with no changes in the other measures. The findings suggest that LSVT-BIG may be an effective therapy for advanced PD patients with <b>wearing</b> <b>off...</b>|$|R

25|$|Estrogen cycling was {{reported}} at the 31st annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. About {{a third of the}} 66 participants - women with metastatic breast cancer that had developed resistance to standard estrogen-lowering therapy - a daily dose of estrogen could stop the growth of their tumors or even cause them to shrink. If study participants experienced disease progression on estrogen, they could go back to an aromatase inhibitor that they were previously resistant to and see a benefit - their tumors were once again inhibited by estrogen deprivation. That effect sometimes <b>wore</b> <b>off</b> after several months, but then the tumors might again be sensitive to estrogen therapy. In fact, some patients have cycled back and forth between estrogen and an aromatase inhibitor for several years. PET (positron emission tomography) scans before starting estrogen and again 24 hours later predicted those tumors which responded to estrogen therapy: the responsive tumors showed an increased glucose uptake, called a PET flare. The mechanism of action is uncertain, although estrogen reduces the amount of a tumor-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1).|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} {{a year in}} Virginia, the novelty {{of being in a}} new place <b>wore</b> <b>off,</b> and Latrobe was lonely and restless in Virginia. Giambattista Scandella, a friend, suggested Philadelphia as an ideal location for him. In April 1798, Latrobe visited Philadelphia for the first time, meeting with Bank of Pennsylvania president Samuel J. Fox, and presented to him a design for a new bank building. At the time, the political climate in Philadelphia was quite different than Virginia, with a strong division between the Federalists and Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans, along with anti-French sentiment, thus the city was not entirely welcoming for Latrobe. On his way to Philadelphia, Latrobe passed through the national capital city of Washington, D.C., then under construction (congress and the president would not arrive until the year 1800), where he met with the first architect of the capitol, William Thornton, and viewed the United States Capitol for the first time. He stopped by Washington again {{on his way back to}} Richmond. Latrobe remained in Richmond, Virginia, until November 1798, when his design was selected for the Bank of Pennsylvania. He moved to Philadelphia, so that he could supervise the construction, although he continued to do occasional projects for clients in Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} offshore, the raiding party {{waited until}} dawn {{to take to}} the water in order to conceal their approach as best as possible. The force was broken up into three detachments with Pedder commanding the centre, the second in command, Major Geoffrey Keyes commanding the right detachment and Captain George More commanding the left detachment. Although the landing was unopposed, the southern detachment under Keyes soon discovered that they had been put ashore by mistake {{on the wrong side of}} the river. As Pedder's detachment advanced on the target, the French colonial troops from the 22nd Algerian Tirailleurs that were defending the area opened fire and in the ensuing engagement Pedder was killed and a number of other officers in the centre detachment were wounded. Nevertheless, the detachment pressed on and, under the command of the Regimental Sergeant Major, they succeeded in securing one of the barracks buildings near the redoubt that formed the key to defence of the position. At the same time the left detachment under More captured a number of howitzers and field guns, as well as a number of prisoners, but as the initial surprise of the attack <b>wore</b> <b>off,</b> the defenders were able to organise themselves. The fighting became more intense, and as the French brought up mortars and artillery, a stalement developed.|$|E

500|$|MacFarlane {{explains}} {{that he is a}} fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology [...] "Suspense", which led him to give early episodes ominous titles like [...] "Death Has a Shadow" [...] and [...] "Mind Over Murder". MacFarlane explained that the team dropped the naming convention after individual episodes became hard to identify, and the novelty <b>wore</b> <b>off.</b> For {{the first few months of}} production, the writers shared one office, lent to them by the King of the Hill production crew.|$|E
500|$|With two new batsmenCompton and Jack Crappat the crease, Australia quickly made further inroads. Toshack bowled Crapp {{for five}} with an inside-edged half volley to leave England at 447/5.

However, after the shine <b>wore</b> <b>off</b> {{and the ball}} went soft, Compton could not score for 25 minutes. O'Reilly decried Compton's [...] "helpless" [...] effort in failing to dispatch the tired Australian bowling as [...] "the worst Test innings I have seen him play".|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} season, the writers shared a single office lent {{to them by}} the King of the Hill {{production}} crew. A majority of the writers had to agree on an episode idea before sending it to MacFarlane for approval; the concepts ultimately had to receive endorsement from Fox before production could begin. In interviews and on the DVD commentary of season one, MacFarlane explained that he is a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology Suspense; thus the early episode titles [...] "Death Has a Shadow" [...] and [...] "Mind Over Murder".

500|$|The Mega-CD {{sold only}} 100,000 units {{during its first}} year in Japan, falling well below expectations. [...] Although many {{consumers}} blamed the add-on's high launch price, it also suffered from a tiny software library; only two titles being available at launch. [...] This was {{due in part to}} the long delay before Sega made its software development kit available to third-party developers. [...] Sales were more successful in North America and Europe, although the novelty of FMV and CD-enhanced games quickly <b>wore</b> <b>off</b> as many of the system's later games were met with lukewarm or negative reviews.

[...] Astrid Kirchherr also supplied Sutcliffe and the other Beatles with Preludin, which when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until {{the early hours of}} the morning. Looking back, Harrison said that the whole group would be [...] "frothing at the mouth" [...] and would sometimes stay awake for days. Lennon recalled, [...] "The waiters always had these pills , so when they saw the musicians falling over with tiredness or drink, they'd give you the pill.

500|$|Playing a close-passing {{game that}} made them better {{able to cope with}} the high winds and blizzards that had caused the {{postponement}} of several League matches, Nottingham Forest earned themselves a Christmas bonus of 10s a man for inflicting Small Heath's first home defeat of the season. Boxing Day produced a 2–0 defeat to a Sheffield Wednesday team playing a better all-round game, and the next day, Small Heath beat a touring Scottish Borderers side 11–1. Injury deprived Small Heath of four regular first-team players for the last game of the year, at home to Liverpool, and both Tilson Pritchard and Ernie Moore made their debuts at full-back. Jenkyns moved back to play behind the other half-backs to protect the understandably nervous reserves, and once the nerves <b>wore</b> <b>off,</b> Pritchard in particular [...] "could scarcely be improved upon." [...] Mobley opened the scoring in the first half, and with the wind behind them in the second half, Small Heath won 3–0 to go into the new year in 10th place in the League.|$|E
500|$|The same year, {{the comedian}} lent {{his name and}} writing talents to Dan Leno's Comic Journal. The paper was {{primarily}} aimed at young adults and featured a mythologised version of Leno– the first comic paper to take its name from, and base a central character on, a living person. [...] Published by C. Arthur Pearson, Issue No. 1 appeared on 26 February 1898, and the paper sold 350,000 copies a year. Leno wrote most of the paper's comic stories and jokes, and Tom Browne contributed many of the illustrations. The comedian retained editorial control of the paper, deciding which items to omit. The Journal was known for its slogans, including [...] "One Touch of Leno Makes the Whole World Grin" [...] and [...] "Won't wash clothes but will mangle melancholy". [...] The cover always showed a caricature of Leno and his editorial staff at work and play.

Following the performance at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show, digital downloads for the song increased by 44% the next week to 165,000 copies, and the song reached number 10 on the Hot 100. It became Madonna's first top-ten single since [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and was her 38th song to reach the top-ten, thereby extending her record as the artist with the most top-ten songs on the Hot 100.
