And there are friends of mine--lads of our own village, men who hate the Kernogans as bitterly as I do myself--who are only too ready to lend Louise a hand in case of violence.

No, I don't; I only want to find out about him. He is very young, little and lean, and active and dark, with bright black eyes which say to me plainly, 'We belong to a man with brains in his head and a will of his own; a man who hasn't always been hanging about a country house, in attendance on a fool.' Yes; I am positively certain Mr. Midwinter has done something or suffered something in his past life, young as he is; and I would give I don't know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at it.
