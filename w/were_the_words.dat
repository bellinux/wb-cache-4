Similarly in Hawaii'an Mau means to strive or persevere, and is often linked with Hawaii'an poetry relating to independence and sovereignty struggles.|$|E

This was up and running by 25 November 1950, less than seven weeks after its western counterpart, albeit for a much shorter time period. (It was demolished on 29 January 1953.) Facing towards West Berlin was the proclamation DER KLUGE BERLINER KAUFT BEI DER H.O. (The Wise Berliner Buys With The H.O.)

Along with a few buddies on the park house roof, he painted the phrase in large white letters {{across the front of}} the building. Fekner appropriated the name of the popular hit written and recorded by the Small Faces about a park in Newham, England. Subsequently, the Jackson Heights local football team took the name, Itchycoo Chiefs in the 1970s. Ten years later, Fekner used the park as a base for his stencils projects. In May 1978, he curated the Detective Show with help from the Institute for Art and Urban Resources (P.S. 1). A group of thirty artists including Gordon Matta-Clark, Don Leicht, Lucio Pozzi, Lou Forgione, Richard Artschwager and Claudia De Monte hid art and created subtle art work in situ throughout the park.|$|E

[...] D-846 powder burned faster than normal powder, which meant that it exerted greater pressure on the shell when fired.

[...] Skelley's plan was for Turret Two to fire ten 2,700-pound practice (no explosives) projectiles, two from the left gun and four rounds each from the center and right guns.

500|$|A {{divide and}} rule policy was {{formulated}} with Japan {{trying to play}} Aboriginals and Han against each other to their own benefit when Japan alternated between fighting the two with Japan first fighting Han and then fighting Aboriginals. Nationalist Japanese claim Aboriginals were treated well by Kabayama. [...] unenlightened and stubbornly stupid <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> used to describe Aboriginals by Kabayama Sukenori. A hardline anti Aboriginal position aimed at the destruction of their civilization was implemented by Fukuzawa Yukichi.

Aboriginals continued {{to fight against the}} Japanese after 1915. Aboriginals were subjected to military takeover and assimilation. In order to exploit camphor resources, the Japanese fought against the Bngciq Atayal in 1906 and expelled them. The war is called [...] "Camphor War" [...] (樟腦戰爭).|$|E
500|$|The episode makes {{prominent}} use of John 11:25–26 {{from the}} Christian Bible, which reads [...] "Who soever liveth and believeth in me shall never die". These <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> that {{were believed to}} have been said by Jesus when he raised Lazarus of Bethany from the dead; biblical scholars have noted that the verse was also intended as a foreshadow of his resurrection. For this reason, the verse is used in the episode to represent a physical resurrection from the dead. However, Amy Donaldson, in her book We Want to Believe, notes that the verse is used for the wrong reasons in [...] "Millennium"; the necromancer is able to successfully raise the dead by reciting the line, but only their bodies, resulting in mindless zombies. Later, the verse reappears in the eighth season episode [...] "Deadalive" [...] during Mulder's funeral. In this instance, the verse is used to symbolize its true intentions, and Mulder is returned from the dead, both in mind and body.|$|E

[...] Bidding rules prohibit logos containing the Olympic symbol, motto, flag or other imagery including a flame, torch or medal. [...] Chicago agreed to revise the logo. The current redesigned logo was released on September 19, 2007.

Each point represents an Olympic value: Hope, Respect, Harmony, Friendship, Excellence and Celebration. The warm colors initially represented in the flame (or top) of the image refer to the sun, the cool colors represent the green parklands and blue waters of Lake Michigan.
