5|$|In {{the poem}} Alvíssmál, Thor tricks a dwarf, Alvíss, to his doom upon finding that {{he seeks to}} wed his {{daughter}} (unnamed, possibly Þrúðr). As the poem starts, Thor meets a dwarf <b>who</b> <b>talks</b> about getting married. Thor finds the dwarf repulsive and, apparently, realizes that the bride is his daughter. Thor comments that the wedding agreement was made among the gods while Thor was gone, and that the dwarf must seek his consent. To do so, Thor says, Alvíss must tell him {{what he wants to}} know about all of the worlds that the dwarf has visited. In a long question and answer session, Alvíss does exactly that; he describes natural features as they are known in the languages of various races of beings in the world, and gives an amount of cosmological lore.|$|E

They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor (Jim Siedow) tells them the pumps are empty.|$|E
5|$|The {{theoretical}} concerns surrounding throffers {{have been}} practically applied concerning workfare programmes. In such systems, individuals receiving social welfare have their aid decreased if they refuse {{the offer of}} work or education. Robert Goodin criticised workfare programmes which presented throffers to individuals receiving welfare, and was responded to by Daniel Shapiro, who found his objections unconvincing. Several writers have also observed that throffers presented to people convicted of crimes, particularly sex offenders, can result in more lenient sentences if they accept medical treatment. Other examples are offered by psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez, who presents concerns about throffers in community psychiatry, and management expert John J. Clancey, <b>who</b> <b>talks</b> about throffers in employment.|$|E

500|$|Bart had {{originally}} been envisioned as [...] "a much milder, troubled youth given to existential angst <b>who</b> <b>talks</b> to himself", but the character was changed based on Cartwright's voice acting. Groening has credited several different figures with providing inspiration for Bart: Matt Groening's older brother Mark provided much of the motivation for Bart's attitude. Bart was conceived as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening describes Bart as [...] "what would happen if Eddie Haskell [...] got his own show". Groening has {{also said that he}} found the premise of Dennis the Menace disappointing and was inspired to create a character who was actually a menace.|$|E

500|$|The {{two most}} overtly [...] "political" [...] tracks on Phantom Power are [...] "The Piccolo Snare" [...] and [...] "Liberty Belle". [...] "The Piccolo Snare" [...] is about [...] "societies {{torn apart by}} war and the waste of human life". The track uses the {{vocabulary}} of the Falklands War (Tumbledown, Skyhawks etc.) but Rhys claims it is applicable to any war. [...] "Liberty Belle" [...] {{tells the story of}} two cartoon characters devised by Rhys, 'Liberty Belle' and 'Memory Lane', the former representing the [...] "bells of freedom", specifically the American Dream, and the latter representing [...] "history's harsh lessons" [...] which Liberty Belle has failed to learn. The song is told {{from the perspective of a}} [...] "bird living almost in a parallel universe to humans, oblivious to the gravity of the games which are being played around us", something which Rhys admits to feeling himself much of the time. [...] "Venus and Serena" [...] uses a story of a child <b>who</b> <b>talks</b> to his pet tortoises, Venus and Serena, as he can't communicate with his elders to make a similar point: that people feel alienated from their elected leaders. Both [...] "Out of Control" [...] and [...] "Slow Life" [...] feature regurgitated media buzzwords, with [...] "Out of Control's" [...] "flippant" [...] lyrics designed to create the feel of [...] "an over-dramatic theme to a current affairs programme".
