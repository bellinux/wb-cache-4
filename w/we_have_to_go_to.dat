It was criticised by the new Sports minister Kate Hoey, who suggested the club were treating its supporters in a [...] "shabby way". Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision, which aimed to solidify England's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid: [...] "The Government are saying that we should be in the FA Cup, but they are the very people that were saying originally that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Brazil. They could tell us quite clearly: 'Do not bother about the World Cup bid, leave that to us. It should not be Manchester United's responsibility.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the false}} {{breaking}} news story, Lester Holt references the 2007 monster movie Cloverfield. After {{learning about the}} toxic leaks in the building, in which Frank, Toofer, and Lutz need to strip down, Frank says [...] "So much of my life was wasted creating hats!" [...] This is a reference to Judah Friedlander, who portrays Frank in the show and {{who is known for}} his trademark trucker hats which he wears {{in and out of the}} Frank character. When Liz tells Floyd that she saw him on The Today Show, on which she learned he is getting married, Floyd says [...] "Dammit! I could have sworn you watch The Early Show on CBS", to which Liz replies, [...] "The Early Show? What am I, in a hospital?". Liz reveals that she once participated in a reenactment on America's Most Wanted playing a woman who is strangled on a toilet. Jenna and Tracy, who are having strange dreams about Kenneth, decide they [...] "have to Elm Street this. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep and kill Kenneth in our dreams!" [...] This references the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, in which the movie's main character—Freddy Krueger—stalks and kills his victims in their dreams.|$|E

"Pete" [...] {{also tells}} host Ponek that the Angels were hired by Cutler {{because of some}} rowdy, anxious on-stage {{incidents}} during the Stones' Oakland and Miami concerts weeks earlier. As security guards, Pete said [...] "we ain't into that security", but that they agreed after the beer offer. He also claimed that, other than being told to [...] "just keep people off the stage", Cutler gave the Hells Angels very little specific instructions for stage security: [...] "They didn't say nothing to us about any of that." [...] And although the Angels are not security guards, [...] "If we say we're going to do something, we do it. If we decide to do it, it's done. No matter what, how far <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> do it." [...] The similar lack of detailed security instructions by the concert's management was also mentioned by Barger during his telephone call-in.|$|E

[...] On the song [...] "Virgin Killer", time is the virgin killer. But then, {{when we had to}} do the interviews about it, we said [...] "Look, listen to the lyrics and then you'll know what we're talking about. We're using this only to get attention. That's what we do." [...] Even the girl, when we met her fifteen years later, had no problem with the cover. Growing up in Europe, sexuality, of course not with children, was very normal. The lyrics really say it all. Time is the virgin killer. A kid comes into the world very naive, they lose that naiveness and then go into this life losing all of this getting into trouble.

6000|$|... "'Tis ever so, dame; but I {{agree with}} you, and deem {{that it would}} be better for England if we did not hold a foot of ground in France, and if English kings and nobles were content to live quietly among their people. We have spent more money than ever we made in these wars, and even were our kings to become indeed, as they claim, kings of France as well as England, the ill would be much greater, as far as I can see, for us all. Still there may be things, dame, that we country folks don't understand, and I suppose that it must be so, else Parliament would not be so willing to vote money always when the kings want it for wars with France. The wars in France don't affect us as much as those with Scotland and Wales. When our kings go to France to fight they take with them only such as are willing to go, men-at-arms and archers; but when we have {{troubles}} such as took place but five or six years ago, when Douglas and Percy and the Welsh all joined against us, then the lords call out their vassals and the sheriffs the militia of the county, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> fight willy- nilly. Our lord had a hundred of us with him to fight for the king at Shrewsbury. Nigh thirty never came back again. That is worse than the French wars, dame." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the cloth}} was withdrawn, the Colonel bending his head said, [...] "Thank God {{for what we}} have received," [...] so reverently, and with an accent so touching, that Fred Bayham's big eyes as he turned towards the old man filled up with tears. When his mother and {{grandmother}} rose to go away, poor little Boy cried to stay longer, and the Colonel would have meekly interposed, but the domineering Campaigner cried, [...] "Nonsense, let him go to bed!" [...] and flounced {{him out of the}} room: and nobody appealed against that sentence. Then we three remained, and strove to talk as cheerfully as we might, speaking now of old times, and presently of new. Without the slightest affectation, Thomas Newcome told us that his life was comfortable, and that he was happy in it. He wished that many others of the old gentlemen, he said, were as contented as himself, but some of them grumbled sadly, he owned and quarrelled with their bread-and-butter. He, for his part, had everything he could desire: all the officers of the Establishment were most kind to him; an excellent physician came to him when wanted; a most attentive woman waited on him. [...] "And if I wear a black gown," [...] said he, [...] "is not that uniform as good as another, and if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church every day, at which some of the Poor Brothers grumble, I think an old fellow can't do better; and I can say my prayers with a thankful heart, Clivey my boy, and should be quite happy but for my--for my past imprudence, God forgive me.

6000|$|The reason, indeed, is very simple. A man {{cannot be}} {{wise enough to}} be a great artist without being wise enough to wish to be a philosopher. A man cannot have the energy to produce good art without having the energy to wish to pass beyond it. A small artist is content with art; a great artist is content with nothing except everything. So we find that when real forces, good or bad, like Kipling and G. B. S., enter our arena, they bring with them not only startling and arresting art, but very startling and arresting dogmas. And they care even more, and desire us to care even more, about their startling and arresting dogmas than about their startling and arresting art. Mr. Shaw is a good dramatist, but what he desires more than {{anything}} else to be is a good politician. Mr. Rudyard Kipling is by divine caprice and natural genius an unconventional poet; but what he desires more than anything else to be is a conventional poet. He desires to be the poet of his people, bone of their bone, and flesh of their flesh, understanding their origins, celebrating their destiny. He desires to be Poet Laureate, a most sensible and honourable and public-spirited desire. Having been given by the gods originality--that is, disagreement with others--he desires divinely to agree with them. But the most striking instance of all, more striking, I think, even than either of these, is the instance of Mr. H. G. Wells. He began in a sort of insane infancy of pure art. He began by making a new heaven and a new earth, with the same irresponsible instinct by which men buy a new necktie or button-hole. He began by trifling with the stars and systems in order to make ephemeral anecdotes; he killed the universe for a joke. He has since become more and more serious, and has become, as men inevitably do when they become more and more serious, more and more parochial. He was frivolous about the twilight of the gods; but he is serious about the London omnibus. He was careless in [...] "The Time Machine," [...] for that dealt only with the destiny of all things; but he is careful, and even cautious, in [...] "Mankind in the Making," [...] for that deals with the day after to-morrow. He began {{with the end of the}} world, and that was easy. Now he has gone on to the beginning of the world, and that is difficult. But the main result of all this is the same as in the other cases. The men who have really been the bold artists, the realistic artists, the uncompromising artists, are the men who have turned out, after all, to be writing [...] "with a purpose." [...] Suppose that any cool and cynical art-critic, any art-critic fully impressed with the conviction that artists were greatest when they were most purely artistic, suppose that a man who professed ably a humane aestheticism, as did Mr. Max Beerbohm, or a cruel aestheticism, as did Mr. W. E. Henley, had cast his eye over the whole fictional literature which was recent in the year 1895, and had been asked to select the three most vigorous and promising and original artists and artistic works, he would, I think, most certainly have said that for a fine artistic audacity, for a real artistic delicacy, or for a whiff of true novelty in art, the things that stood first were [...] "Soldiers Three," [...] by a Mr. Rudyard Kipling; [...] "Arms and the Man," [...] by a Mr. Bernard Shaw; and [...] "The Time Machine," [...] by a man called Wells. And all these men have shown themselves ingrainedly didactic. You may express the matter if you will by saying that if we want doctrines we go to the great artists. But it is clear from the psychology of the matter that this is not the true statement; the true statement is that when we want any art tolerably brisk and bold <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the doctrinaires.|$|E
