Previous work investigating the impact of taxes and benefits on <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> has tended to ignore these dynamic considerations. In this paper, we use a dynamic model to show how a lifecycle perspective alters our impression {{of the effect of}} the tax and benefit system on female <b>work</b> <b>incentives.</b> We describe how <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> change over the life and show how they depend on lifecycle circumstances. We also devise a forward-looking measure of <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> that incorporates all the dynamic considerations likely to affect work decisions at any given age. We find that individuals experience considerable variability in <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> across life that outweighs the variability across individuals. Changes pattern of family types across life is key to explaining these patterns: <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> vary dramatically depending on family composition, and most women experience a number of different family types during the course of their lives.

Although people with disabilities are generally not "sick," they often have conditions that require greater than average use of medical and long-term care services.

In this paper, show how a lifecycle perspective alters our impression of how the UK tax and benefit system affects women's <b>work</b> <b>incentives.</b> Given that actual longitudinal data conflates age effects, cohort effects and policy effects, and, in the UK, is not available covering the full lifecycle, we use simulated data produced by a rich, dynamic structural model of female labour supply and human capital that incorporates family formation and fertility. We find that individuals experience considerable variability in <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> across life that outweighs the variability across individuals. Changes {{in the presence of}} children and a partner, as well as the level of any partner's earnings, are key to explaining these patterns: <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> vary dramatically depending on family composition and the earnings of any partner, especially for the lower-skilled – with women's own earnings explaining less than a seventh of the variation in <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> – and most women experience a number of different family types during the course of their lives...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews various {{techniques}} for quantifying financial <b>incentives</b> to <b>work,</b> shows how financial <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> have changed across the population since 1979, and estimates {{how much of}} these changes are due {{to changes in the}} tax and benefit system. Two aspects of financial <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> are important: the incentive to be in work at all, and the incentive to progress in work (i. e. increase earnings). We measure the incentive to progress using the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR); we measure the <b>incentive</b> to <b>work</b> at all using the replacement rate (RR) and the participation tax rate (PTR). In all three cases, higher rates correspond to weaker <b>work</b> <b>incentives.</b> Our measures of incentives incorporate income tax, employee National Insurance contributions, council tax, tax credits and social security benefits; they do not take account of taxes formally incident on companies (such as employer National Insurance contributions) or indirect taxes. We find that <b>work</b> <b>incentives</b> are generally weaker for people who are not working than for people who are working.

40|$|Using net {{replacement}} rates between net household income while {{out of work}} and in work, the authors investigate to what extent taxes and benefits may affect <b>work</b> <b>incentives.</b> They find that in 2006, {{net replacement}} rates are higher for low-income households and for households with children and a partner, attenuating <b>work</b> <b>incentives.</b> <b>Work</b> <b>incentives</b> are significantly affected by eligibility rules and the amounts of benefits, particularly unemployment benefit and social assistance. Next, the authors examine how the reform of social benefits introduced in 2007 affects <b>work</b> <b>incentives.</b> While social assistance is less generous, diminishing the incidence of high net replacement rates, the reform gives preferential treatment to households with some work income. Net replacement rates are also higher for households with children, who receive a substantially higher housing benefit, but some less well-off households consequently receive less social assistance. The authors also see that increased parental allowance has the same crowding-out effect on other income-tested benefits as higher housing benefit has on social assistance. In addition, the rise in parental allowance may lock eligible individuals in non-employment, increasing the loss of human capital. This is particularly important for lone parents, who face the highest specific unemployment rate compared to other household types. labor supply, microsimulations, net replacement rate, tax-benefit system...|$|R
