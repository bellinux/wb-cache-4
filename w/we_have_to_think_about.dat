5000|$|The Makah had {{retained}} {{the right to}} practice whaling under the Treaty of Neah Bay in 1855, the only tribe in the continental United States to do so. The Makah stopped whaling in the 1920s due to {{the decline of the}} gray whale population, but decided to resume the harvest in the 1990s after the Pacific gray whale was removed from the list of endangered species in 1994. Whale meat had been a vital component of the diet of the Makah people for hundreds of years. Johnson, a proponent of the 1999 hunt, worried that the cultural significance of whaling would be lost on younger Makah members if the harvest did not resume. In a 2009 interview with the Peninsula Daily News, Johnson reflected on the long-term significance of the 1999 hunt on the Makah, [...] "I should feel happy about that day, but I'm not because we have people that are still against us...It gets old.

[...] In the beginning was intelligence, purpose, and wisdom. The Bible had that right and the materialist scientists are deluding themselves....In summary, we have to educate our young people; we have to give them the armor they need. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how we're going on the offensive rather than staying on the defensive. And above all, we have to come out to the culture with the view that we are the ones who really stand for freedom of thought. You see, we don't have to fear freedom of thought because good thinking done in the right way will eventually lead back to the Church, to the truth-the truth that sets people free, even if it goes through a couple of detours on the way. And so we're the ones that stand for good science, objective reasoning, assumptions on the table, a high level of education, and freedom of conscience to think as we are capable of thinking. That's what America stands for, and that's something we stand for, and that's something the Christian Church and the Christian Gospel stand for-the truth that makes you free. Let's recapture that, while we're recapturing America. Johnson ...|$|E
5000|$|In June 1990, the Los Angeles Library Commission {{voted to}} close the old library and re-open the Washington Irving Branch in a {{different}} location. The majority of 62 speakers at a public forum on the closure spoke in favor of saving the old branch by renovating and expanding the existing structure. Commission President Martha D. Katsufrankis said at the time: [...] "I'm old and I appreciate old things, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> serving the whole community for the future." [...] At the time, City Councilman Nate Holden guaranteed that another [...] "viable funded" [...] use, such as a community center, would be found for the old structure. Area residents, however, were skeptical about promises to preserve the old building, one stating, [...] "I don't believe that for one second. What {{are they going to}} turn it into-a police station? A fire station? It's a library, damn it." [...] The library commission agreed in 1991 not to move the Irving branch from its historic Mid-City home of 65 years until a new tenant could be found to take over the building. Residents had feared that the library would be closed and the building left vacant. Library Commissioner Douglas Ring noted at the time: [...] "Everyone knows if you vacate a building and don't have an alternative tenant it is the same as destroying it. That's not what anyone wants."Despite the promises, a new tenant or use was not found. The new Washington Irving Branch opened in 2000, and the old branch on Arlington Avenue has been vacant, boarded up, and fenced for many years. As of 2008, it was marred with graffiti and the lot covered with weeds and litter.|$|E

5000|$|Tonalist {{began his}} second season at Gulfstream Park in Florida, winning a maiden race over nine furlongs in January and running second to Constitution in an {{allowance}} race a month later. Any chance he had of competing in the major trials for the Triple Crown ended when he contracted a lung infection which disrupted his training schedule. In May he was moved up sharply in class when he contested the Grade II Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park. Wearing blinkers for the first time, he was ridden by Joel Rosario and started the 6-5 favorite against six opponents on a [...] "sloppy" [...] track. He stumbled at the start but recovered {{to take the lead}} after {{a quarter of a mile}} and went clear in the straight to win by four lengths from Commissioner. After the race Clement commented [...] "What impressed me was the last eighth of a mile, when he opened up again. I was very worried about the wet track. I don't breeze my horses on the wet track so that was a complete question mark. He answered that pretty nicely. Let's see how the horse comes out of it, but of course <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the Belmont Stakes". Rosario said [...] "He was doing it easy; he was doing it on his own. I don't think we were going that fast. He can go a mile and a half; I think he can run all day. He's a big horse with a long stride, when you get him in the bridle, the more you ask, the more he'll give".On June 7, in front of a crowd of 120,000, Tonalist contested the 146th running of the Belmont Stakes which attracted much attention as California Chrome, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes attempted to become the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to complete the Triple Crown. Clement professed his lack of concern when Tonalist was drawn on the complete outside of the eleven runner field, saying [...] "He's a really, really big horse with a long stride, so he can basically run his own race without worrying about anybody else." [...] After a late surge of support in the betting, he started the 9.2/1 fifth choice behind California Chrome, Wicked Strong, Ride on Curlin (runner-up in the Preakness) and Commanding Curve (runner-up in the Derby). Tonalist broke well from his outside draw and was third behind Commissioner and General A Rod after the first half mile. He maintained his position despite being forced four wide on the final turn and gradually wore down the opposition in the straight to win by a head from Commissioner, with Medal Count in third and California Chrome dead heating with Wicked Strong for fourth. After the race Rosario commented [...] "He was going easy, I didn't want to be too far behind. When I got to the three-eighths pole I was a little confident. I was worried a little bit turning for home, but he started picking them up." [...] Evans said [...] "This morning I went to my father's grave and thanked him for putting me in this position. I've been where Steve Coburn has been, and it's not fun. I remember it was real quiet after we lost Pleasant Colony finished third in the Belmont in 1981." [...] When asked to respond to Coburn's statement that he had taken the [...] "coward's way" [...] by not running his horse in the first two legs of the series, Evans said [...] "I don’t think I have a comment on that".|$|E
