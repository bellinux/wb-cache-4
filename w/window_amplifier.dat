40|$|A fully {{connectorized}} {{diode laser}} pumped first <b>window</b> <b>amplifier</b> has been constructed, {{for the first}} time, around a thulium doped fluoride fiber. For a 780 / 806 nm combination of pump and signal wavelengths intrinsic small signal gains of 25 - 26 dB and gain efficiencies of 2. 4 dB/mW have been achieved. In addition output powers approaching + 13 dBm from the doped fiber were possible for launched pump powers of 31 mW, which corresponds to a pump to signal conversion efficiency of around 64 %. Minimum noise figures of 4 - 5 dB have been achieved with characteristics which mirror the output power performance. The 3 dB gain bandwidth for this transition has been measured at 9 - 10 nm for small signals, increasing to better than 15 nm under signal saturation condition...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study on}} the design of {{variable}} gain-flattened erbium-doped fiber amplifier operating in L-band transmission <b>window.</b> Four <b>amplifiers</b> divided into five stages became the basis of the design with distributed pumping configuration. A dispersion compensating module was incorporated into the architecture as a way to combat dispersion. The amplifier was able to generate variable gain from 15 up to 30 dB under different input signal powers with a maximum output power of 23 dBm. Excellent gain flatness averaging around 0. 8 dB was accomplished while four-wave mixing effect was significantly reduced...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a three year study into the use of trivalent rare-earth doped fluorozirconate fibre for potential diode-pumped amplifiers and upconversion lasers. A diode-pumped, high-gain, thulium-doped, fluoride-fibre optical amplifier around 0. 8 µm, for use in the first optical communications window, is reported. Using only one 100 mW single stripe diode laser as the pump source for this first <b>window</b> optical <b>amplifier,</b> small-signal gains in excess of 20 dB are reported for input signals of - 10 dBm tunable from 801 nm to 810 nm. The noise figure for this amplifier was around 5 to 6 dB, limited by back-reflected amplified spontaneous emission caused by the detection technique. Without this the noise figure would be below 4 dB. The amplification of Q-switched AlGaAs diode lasers to high power using a similar thulium-doped fibre amplifier is also described. Peak powers of 12. 5 W useable output were observed. The pulses were 15 ps long and amplified at a repetition rate of 7 MHz using one 100 mW single-stripe diode laser as the pump source. Thulium and praseodymium doped fluorozirconate fibres have also been investigated as possible infrared-pumped, visible upconversion lasers. Blue lasing using a praseodymium doped fibre has been optimised, while various spectroscopic measurements have been made of possible thulium upconversion systems...|$|R
5000|$|Efficiency {{should not}} be {{confused}} with effectiveness: a system that wastes most of its input power but produces exactly what it is meant to is effective but not efficient. The term [...] "efficiency" [...] makes sense only in reference to the wanted effect. A light bulb, for example, might have 2% efficiency at emitting light yet still be 98% efficient at heating a room (In practice it is nearly 100% efficient at heating a room because the light energy will also be converted to heat eventually, apart from the small fraction that leaves through the <b>windows).</b> An electronic <b>amplifier</b> that delivers 10 watts of power to its load (e.g., a loudspeaker), while drawing 20 watts of power from a power source is 50% efficient.
