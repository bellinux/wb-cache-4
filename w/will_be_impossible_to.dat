The bill allowed for DNA and other scientific evidence {{to be used in}} prosecuting rape cases. The passing of the Bill and the consequent signing of it into law by President General Pervez Musharraf invoked protests from hard-line Islamist leaders and organisations.

25|$|While {{most of the}} Millennium Development Goals face a {{deadline}} of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability. Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, thus placing {{the rest of the}} development agenda at risk. It is extremely important that girls have access to an education. For every additional year girls go to school, they receive 20 percent higher wages and suffer 10 percent fewer child deaths. Women with some formal education are more likely to seek medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children’s nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be healthier and better nourished. According to The International Center for Research on Women, the education that a girl receives is the strongest predictor of the age she will marry and is a critical factor in reducing the prevalence of child marriage. The World Bank estimates that an additional year of schooling for 1,000 women helps prevent two maternal deaths. Also, each additional year of formal education that a mother completes translates to her children staying in school an additional one-third to one-half of a year.|$|E
50|$|Because {{developing}} {{and maintaining a}} coherent verbal identity across an organisation requires {{a high degree of}} unified strategy, a number of problems may be encountered. For example, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> nearly <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> implement a sound strategy for verbal identity if communication channels within a business are unclear or disrupted. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> similarly <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> make meaningful advances if an analysis of the specific company and sector needs in the area has not been made. Organisations which are particularly fragmented or which rely on heavily devolved structures in their governance will also find verbal identity implementation difficult without clear lines of responsibility and authority.|$|R

[...] "to provide {{educational}} {{assistance to}} the dependents of Federal law enforcement officials who are killed or disabled {{in the performance of}} their duties." [...] In 2001 Frank co-sponsored [...] "the MX Missile Stand-Down Act" [...] (01-HR2718) to take fifty Peacekeeper missiles off of high-alert status as well as the Landmine Elimination and Victim Assistance Act (01-HR948). As of December 2003, Frank had an 89% rating by Peace Action, indicating a pro-peace voting record. In 2005, he co-sponsored [...] "Rail Security Act" [...] (S.1379/H.R.153) (05-S1379) giving higher priority to rail transportation security. In 2008, he co-sponsored the [...] "Veterans Suicide Study Act" [...] ( [...] (S.2899/H.R.4204) 08-S2899) designed to study and address suicides among veterans. As of the 111th Congress, Frank is advocating a 25-percent reduction in the overall Military budget of the United States. [...] "The math is compelling: if we do not make reductions approximating 25 percent of the military budget starting fairly soon, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> continue to fund an adequate level of domestic activity...," [...] wrote Frank. He claimed that such a significant reduction would have no effect on the United States' ability to defend itself. [...] "If," [...] he said, [...] "beginning one year from now, we were to cut military spending by 25 percent from its projected levels, we would still be immeasurably stronger than any combination of nations with whom we might be engaged." [...] Frank supports having fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes, but also supports a $3-billion backup engine project that the Pentagon does not want. [...] Frank told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann that he actually wanted to cut the entire F-35 program, but as long as military spending continued, he would fight for his district's share of it.|$|E
