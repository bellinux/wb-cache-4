A 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on , have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes and are consumed by 200 million {{people on a}} daily basis. Insect infestation is a major constraint {{to the production of}} cowpea, sometimes causing losses of over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer Maruca vitrata is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea and the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus the main post-harvest pest.|$|E
5|$|Multi-platform {{releases}} {{were common}} {{in the early days}} of RPGs, but there was a period during the 1990s when this was not generally the case. The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume the practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles. The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of programming tools. Multimedia and art assets, <b>which</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> a greater proportion of the development budget than in the past, are easily transferable between multiple platforms.|$|E

40|$|This {{instrumental}} study {{aimed to}} replicate the exploratory {{factor analysis of the}} Referential Thinking Scale (REF) which has been carried out in other research studies. The REF consists of 34 items which assess the frequency of referential thinking on a dichotomic scale (True/False). The analyzed data come from a sample of 193 participants (67. 36 % women, mean age 28. 36 years, SD = 10. 35), 131 of whom were patients. By means of the Principal Component Analysis method and varimax rotation, five factors were identified that <b>account</b> <b>for</b> 37. 35 % of the variance of rotated factor solution. The five factors were labelled as: Laughing, Commenting (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 8. 92 % of variance); Guilt, Shame (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 8. 77 % of variance); Causal Explanations (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 7. 17 % of variance); Songs, Newspapers, Books (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 6. 44 % of variance); and Attention, Appearance (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 6. 04 % of variance). These results confirm the multidimensionality of the REF scale since the same five factors as in previous studies were isolated...|$|R

Reading's first high-rise dwellings—three eight-storey tower blocks—were built in Southcote in the late 1950s. Home ownership in Southcote is 58.3%, which is average for the Reading area. Use of social housing is above the local average at 29.2%.|$|E
5|$|West Antarctica {{is covered}} by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, {{possibility}} of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, ocean levels would rise by several metres in a relatively geologically short period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries.

5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, <b>which</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E

5|$|Type II {{diamonds}} {{have very}} few if any nitrogen impurities. Pure (type IIa) diamond can be colored pink, red, or brown owing to structural anomalies arising through plastic deformation during crystal growth; these diamonds are rare (1.8% of gem diamonds), but constitute {{a large percentage of}} Australian diamonds. Type IIb diamonds, <b>which</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> ~0.1% of gem diamonds, are usually a steely blue or gray due to boron atoms scattered within the crystal matrix. These diamonds are also semiconductors, unlike other diamond types (see Electrical properties). Most blue-gray diamonds coming from the Argyle mine of Australia are not of type IIb, but of Ia type. Those diamonds contain large concentrations of defects and impurities (especially hydrogen and nitrogen) and the origin of their color is yet uncertain. Type II diamonds weakly absorb in a different region of the infrared (the absorption is due to the diamond lattice rather than impurities), and transmit in the ultraviolet below 225nm, unlike type I diamonds. They also have differing fluorescence characteristics, but no discernible visible absorption spectrum.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. Maternal mortality in western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, maternal mortality in the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported {{in the rest of the}} world, with the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, <b>which</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, maternal health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E
