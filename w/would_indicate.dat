5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> a plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered {{by the presence of}} symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials {{similar to those found}} in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
5|$|In September 2012, Hopsin {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} self-produce {{the majority of the}} album, with drummer Travis Barker producing one or two tracks. Later that month, Hopsin <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> interest in working with Childish Gambino. In addition, Hopsin approached Macklemore in January 2013 to get him featured in the album.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  1, a {{comparison}} of managers’ perception for tourists’ expectation and the tourists’ themselves expectation. The result indicted that, the overall Gap 1 score was − 0.583, which <b>would</b> <b>indicated</b> that managers {{do not have a}} good understanding of tourist expectation. This finding contrasts with previous studies (Nel and Pitt 1993; Tsang and Qu 2000) but consistent with past research (Choy et al. 1986; Wei et al. 1989).|$|R

5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along {{the path of the}} sun, whose rays <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory.|$|E
5|$|The {{possible}} Sinosauropteryx specimen GMV2124 (Sinosauropteryx?sp.) {{was found}} with three mammal jaws in its gut region. Hurum, Luo, and Kielan-Jaworowska (2006) identified two of these jaws as belonging to Zhangheotherium and the third to Sinobaatar, showing that these two mammals {{were part of the}} animal's diet. Zhangheotherium is known to have had a spur on the ankle, like the modern platypus, which <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> that Sinosauropteryx fed on possibly venomous mammals.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Miriam {{hugged the}} coast of Central America and reached its peak of 986millibars on October 24. Ordinarily, a {{pressure}} this low <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> a Category1 hurricane, but due to its disorganized convection, Miriam was not upgraded to a hurricane. Land interaction and wind shear weakened Miriam to a tropical depression on October 26. Low-level winds carried the system out to sea, and its convection dissipated on October 28.|$|E

5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will attain a score of 1, since this <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> that the candidate is identical {{to one of the}} reference translations. For this reason, {{it is not necessary to}} attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
5|$|The British {{official}} casualty return gave 15 killed, 46 {{wounded and}} 30 missing. As was often done in casualty returns with officers (but not with enlisted men), Lieutenant King of Royal Artillery and Lieutenant Lamont of the 49th {{were included in}} the “wounded” category although they were also taken prisoner. The Americans took 34 prisoners, including Lamont and King, which <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> that two of the enlisted men who were thought to have been killed were in fact captured. This gives a revised British loss (with Lamont and King counted among the prisoners rather than the wounded) of 13 killed, 44 wounded and 34 captured.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at the}} data is required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} the collider implications of Split Universal Extra Dimensions. The non-vanishing fermion {{mass in the}} bulk, {{which is consistent with}} the KK-parity, largely modifies the phenomenology of Minimal Universal Exta Dimensions. We scrutinize the behavior of couplings and study the discovery reach of the Tevatron and the LHC for level- 2 Kaluza-Klein modes in the dilepton channel, which <b>would</b> <b>indicates</b> the presence of the extra dimensions. Observation of large event rates for dilepton resonances can result from a nontrivial fermion mass profile along the extra dimensions, which, in turn, may corroborat...|$|R
5|$|The Papuan swiftlet, Aerodramus papuensis, {{has three}} toes {{instead of the}} usual four in this group. It has the ability to echolocate, but whereas other {{previously}} studied species use echolocation primarily while flying in their caves, the Papuan swiftlet appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses echolocation while active outside at night. It uses single, not double, clicks. DNA sequence data provides strong support for a basal relationship between A. papuensis and other Aerodramus taxa and suggest that this species and the waterfall swift Hydrochous gigas, are sister taxa, a relationship that <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> paraphyly of the genus Aerodramus.|$|E
5|$|The buttons worn on the Infantryman's {{clothing}} {{is not as}} minor a detail as it would sound. The average infantryman may have had his uniform made for him in Richmond, Virginia, however, the man enlisted in Georgia, and is now marching through the former state. In reflection to his loyalties to home, this man, for example, could have adorned his uniform with Georgia State buttons. This <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> to his fellow soldiers his allegiance to both his state and his military unit. This was common practice during the war for {{both sides in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|The dating of {{the monuments}} to the Late Preclassic {{indicate}} that the potbelly style may be a later derivative of earlier Olmec colossal heads, although it does not {{answer the question of}} the ethnicity of the sculptors. Potbelly monuments were sometimes reused by later peoples in the region, such as at Sin Cabezas, Copán and Teopán. Arguing against the theory of potbelly sculpture being an Olmec influenced art form is that the direction of diffusion of the style appears to have been from south to north, while the Olmec heartland lies to the north, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, which <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> an expected diffusion from north to south if the Olmecs were indeed the origin of the style.|$|E

5|$|Unless the {{pituitary}} {{damage is}} being {{caused by a}} tumor that overproduces a particular hormone, it {{is the lack of}} pituitary hormones that leads to the symptoms described above, and an excess of a particular hormone <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> the presence of a tumor. The exception to this rule is prolactin: if a tumor compresses the pituitary stalk, a decreased blood supply means that the lactotrope cells, which produce prolactin, are not receiving dopamine and therefore produce excess prolactin. Hence, mild elevations in prolactin are attributed to stalk compression. Very high prolactin levels, though, point more strongly towards a prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting tumor).|$|E
5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within a quarter of a mile. The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} to Jableh, al-Qassam {{commenced}} a program of Islamic revival based on moral reforms which included the encouragement of maintaining regular salaah (prayer) and the sawm (fasting) during Ramadan as well as advocating an end to gambling and alcohol consumption. Al-Qassam's campaign highly influenced Jableh's residents who increasingly adopted his reforms. He developed amiable relations with the local Ottoman police who he would call upon to enforce Sharia law on rare cases of major violations. In some occasions, he would send disciples as vigilantes to intercept caravans transporting alcohol which would then be disposed of. Despite the support for Arab nationalism from some of his fellow alumni at al-Azhar and among Syrian notables, al-Qassam's loyalties most likely laid with the Ottoman Empire as {{his relationship with the}} authorities <b>would</b> <b>indicate.</b> He was well-regarded among much of Jableh's population where he gained a reputation for piety, simple manners and good humor.|$|E
