2500|$|Thirteen years earlier, Zeca had {{remarked that}} [...] "If rock is the musical style {{that the young}} prefer, then <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> for good quality rock music".|$|E
2500|$|Hamid al-Ahmar, {{a leading}} {{member of the}} Yemeni Congregation for Reform, that {{supported}} Morsi since the movement was formed {{by members of the}} Yemeni Muslim Brotherhood, said: [...] "What happened in Egypt was an overturn of democracy. With sincere hearts, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> God to help Morsi." ...|$|E

6000|$|Meg {{lifted her}} eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once, [...] "Of course you may. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> have <b>asked</b> you before, only {{we thought you}} wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this." ...|$|R
2500|$|Larry Laudan has {{suggested}} pseudoscience has no scientific meaning and is mostly {{used to describe}} our emotions: [...] "If we would {{stand up and be}} counted on the side of reason, we ought to drop terms like 'pseudo-science' and 'unscientific' from our vocabulary; they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us". Likewise, Richard McNally states, [...] "The term 'pseudoscience' has become little more than an inflammatory buzzword for quickly dismissing one's opponents in media sound-bites" [...] and [...] "When therapeutic entrepreneurs make claims on behalf of their interventions, we should not waste our time trying to determine whether their interventions qualify as pseudoscientific. Rather, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> them: How do you know that your intervention works? What is your evidence?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Orthodox Church {{there are}} no [...] "categories" [...] of sin as found in the Christian West. In the pre-Vatican II Catholic catechism, sins were {{categorized}} as [...] "mortal" [...] and [...] "venial." [...] In this definition, a [...] "mortal" [...] sin was one which would prevent someone from entering heaven unless one confessed it before death... These categories do {{not exist in the}} Orthodox Church. Sin is sin. Concerning Confession, having a list of deadly sins could, in fact, become an obstacle to genuine repentance. For example, imagine that you commit a sin. You look on the list and do not find it listed. It would be very easy to take the attitude that, since it is not on a list of deadly sins, it is not too serious. Hence, you do not feel the need to seek God's forgiveness right away. A week passes and you have completely forgotten about what you had done. You never sought God's forgiveness; as a result, you did not receive it, either. We should go to Confession when we sin—at the very least, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> God to forgive us daily in our personal prayers. We should not see Confession as a time to confess only those sins which may be found on a list.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.” ...|$|E
40|$|Debating markets {{requires}} debating values. To {{answer questions}} of how free markets affect women, {{we must first}} ask about standards of measurement. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>ask</b> how <b>we</b> can have a “free” market when the participants can never be free from gender bias. Gender, markets, economic anthropology, morality, social values,...|$|R
6000|$|... 106. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> then {{naturally}} <b>ask</b> {{what kind}} of embroidery Athena put on her own robe; [...] "[Greek: peplon heanon, poikilon hou r autê poiêsato kai kame chersin]." ...|$|R

2500|$|Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe fame played drums on [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". Due {{to various}} {{personal}} and legal struggles, Lee {{was living in}} the studio for a time during the recording of the album. Humphrey was a good friend of Lee's, and had previously worked with his band prior to the production of Hellbilly Deluxe. Zombie later asked Lee to appear on the album, with Lee agreeing to do so. On the collaboration, Lee stated [...] "I went to his house after I got out of jail to stay for a while, and I think I was there about a day or two and they were working on the record downstairs and Scott and Rob were like, 'Dude, Tommy’s upstairs, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> him to play.' And they asked me to play and I was like, 'I would love to play right now. I could really use ... you know, just kind of check out, really do some music' and I ended up playing like four tracks or so on the record." [...] Lee is credited as the drummer for [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] was originally referred to as [...] "Creature Core" [...] prior to the release of the album. Danny Lohner provided additional guitar recordings for [...] "Meet the Creeper". Zombie recorded a song titled [...] "Wish It Away" [...] for the album, though it was not included on the final product.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Ducaine," [...] he said, [...] "we have {{discussed}} this matter thoroughly, {{and we are}} all practically agreed that {{there is no reason why}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> you to give up your position." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems to}} follow {{here as a}} natural inquiry, after what has been said, that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask,</b> How is this to be done, and by what method can the people of England {{increase}} the home consumption of their woollen manufactures? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, who can say? I {{should tell}} her mother, and I suppose <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have to <b>ask</b> {{her father to}} receive her. I know what his answer will be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. March," [...] she said, {{in a low}} voice, {{and with}} a curious, apologetic kind of embarrassment, [...] "we have come--Fay wanted <b>we</b> <b>should</b> come and <b>ask</b> if you knew about her father--" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{were not}} {{sufficient}} reasons to unleash {{a war against}} Iraq," [...] he said on {{a press conference in}} 2003. [...] "To say nothing of the fact that, given the new weapons that make possible destructions that go beyond the combatant groups, today <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be <b>asking</b> ourselves if it is still licit to admit the very existence of a 'just war'.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hermione Roddice {{suggested}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> Gudrun {{to teach}} her to draw and to model in clay. You know Winnie is astonishingly clever with that plasticine stuff. Hermione declares she is an artist.' Gerald spoke in the usual animated, chatty manner, as if nothing unusual had passed. But Birkin's manner was full of reminder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} must be asked," [...] said Cherry. Cherry was sitting {{opposite}} to the other girls writing {{on a lot of}} envelopes the addresses of the notes which were afterwards to be prepared. [...] "We told her <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> her." [...] And as she spoke she addressed a cover to [...] "Miss Ray, Bragg's End Cottage, Cawston." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gracie dear," [...] said Miss Ferguson, [...] "this sort {{of thing}} will never do. If you meet your brother in this way, you will throw him off, and, maybe, make a fatal breach. Meet it like a good Christian, as you are. You know," [...] she said gently, [...] "where {{we have a right}} to carry our troubles, and of whom <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> guidance." ...|$|E
6000|$|O eloquent and famed Boccaccio! [...] Of thee <b>we</b> now <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> {{forgiving}} boon; [...] And of thy spicy myrtles as they blow, [...] And of thy roses amorous of the moon, [...] And of thy lilies, that do paler grow [...] Now {{they can}} no more hear thy ghittern's tune, [...] 150 [...] For venturing syllables that ill beseem [...] The quiet glooms of such a piteous theme.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] {{said the}} officer. [...] "In fact, {{we heard the}} detonation. Still, I daresay there are several things <b>we</b> <b>should</b> like to <b>ask</b> each other about, and you {{suggested}} going across to your steamer." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Richard {{acknowledged}} {{this remark}} {{with a little}} bow. [...] "Now, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> like to <b>ask,</b> {{if you have no}} objection, what is your chief object in the mission at--what did you say its name--ah! George Yard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have {{a message}} for you, Señor, from a certain comrade of ours, one Andrew, a Scotchman, whom you met a few nights ago," [...] replied the {{spokesman}} of the pair. [...] "He is dead, but still he sends his message, {{and it is that}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> you to join him at once. Now, all of us brothers have sworn to deliver that message, and to see that you keep the tryst. If some of us should chance to fail, then others will meet you with the message until you keep that tryst." ...|$|E
60|$|If <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> our garrulous guide {{why this}} {{treasure}} {{had not been}} dug up {{by the people of}} the place, he would probably shake his head and declare that personally he knew nothing about it, but that it was generally believed that it was there, and he had heard that there had been people who had tried to find it, but if they did find any they never said anything about it, and it was his opinion that if Captain Kidd ever put any gold or silver or precious stones under the ground on that part of the coast these treasures were all there yet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not saying}} that his view may not be correct, Kennedy. I am only saying that the view {{would be a very}} unpopular one, among the Brigade. We are {{fighting}} for France because we believe that France, in turn, will aid in placing our rightful king on the throne, and if we once entertained the notion that Louis was deceiving us, that {{he had no intention of}} helping us, and that, if he did place James on the throne, he would alienate all his sympathizers at home, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> ourselves of what use was it, spending our blood in fighting the battles of France." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does not {{my father}} think that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> go?" [...] <b>asked</b> Cheenbuk, {{who began to}} feel uneasy as a fresh burst of flame {{set fire to the}} canvas awning, and made the place they stood on unpleasantly hot.|$|R
40|$|We conceptualize {{new ways}} to qualify what themes should {{dominate}} the future international business and management (IB/IM) research agenda by examining three questions: Whom <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>ask?</b> What <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>ask,</b> and which selection criteria <b>should</b> <b>we</b> apply? What are the contextual forces? Our main findings are the following: (1) wider perspectives from academia and practice would benefit both rigor and relevance; (2) four key forces are climate change, globalization, inequality, and sustainability; and (3) we propose scientific mindfulness as the way forward for generating themes in IB/IM research. Scientific mindfulness is a holistic, cross-disciplinary, and contextual approach, whereby researchers need {{to make sense of}} multiple perspectives with the betterment of society as the ultimate criterion...|$|R
5000|$|Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code outlaws disaffection {{against the}} state, {{and allows for}} {{penalties}} of life imprisonment.Jawaharlal Nehru told the Indian parliament in 1951 that [...] "the sooner {{we get rid of}} it the better".In January 2012 Rajinder Sachar said [...] "It seems tragic that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be <b>asking</b> the government to redeem the pledge of Nehru. For having a democratic society, it is necessary that these laws go".|$|R
6000|$|... "It is well," [...] said he, {{and with}} a shake of the bridle rode on down the {{woodland}} path. [...] "I would have you bear in mind," [...] he continued to his squires, [...] "that gentle courtesy is not, as is the base use of so many false knights, to be shown only to maidens of high degree, for there is no woman so humble that a true knight may not listen to her tale of wrong. But here comes a cavalier who is indeed in haste. Perchance it would be well that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> him whither he rides, for it may be that he is one who desires to advance himself in chivalry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, if {{you begin}} {{fault-finding}} with creation, {{there will be}} no end to it. It might be answered that, in this case, you can walk about and a tree cannot; you can call upon me and a tree cannot. And other things. Come! the trees have not got it all their own way. Besides, imagine the discomforts of a human springtime, blowing hot and blowing cold, freezing, thawing, raining, and drouthing, and never being sure whether we are young or old, May or December. We should be such nuisances to one another that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> the gods to take back their gift, and you know very well they cannot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'These last, you know, {{we teach}} in the {{interest}} of the State, as well as of the Negro: and if <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> the State for aid, in order that we may teach them, over and above a little reading and writing--which will not be taught save by us, for we only shall be listened to--are we asking too much, or anything which the State will not be wise in granting us? We can have no temptation to abuse our power for political purposes. It would not suit us--to put the matter on its lowest ground--to become demagogues. For our congregations include persons of every rank and occupation; and therefore it is our interest, as much as that of the British Government, that all classes should be loyal, peaceable, and wealthy.|$|E
5000|$|Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, [...] "Maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all <b>ask</b> Santa for {{the show}} to keep to this path upon its return in January? (And maybe a little {{stocking}} filler of Meisner?) Grimm is at its best when it gathers its fantastic ensemble cast together in big, action-filled storylines that peel away {{a little more of}} the curtain between the human world and Wesen. Let’s hope for more in 2016." ...|$|R
5000|$|Is a person's {{ethnic group}} self-defined?Yes. Membership of {{an ethnic group}} is {{something}} that is subjectively meaningful to the person concerned, and this is the principal basis for ethnic categorisation in the United Kingdom. So, in ethnic group questions, we are unable to base ethnic identification upon objective, quantifiable information as we would, say, for age or gender. And this means that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> rather <b>ask</b> people which group they see themselves as belonging to.|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} {{will soon be}} placing job coaches in GP surgeries in Islington {{as part of a}} pilot to “coach” the unemployed into work. What is the aim of this process, how will its results going to be evaluated, and who will deliver it? Here, Elizabeth Cotton explains that {{the devil is in the}} detail and raises the questions <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be <b>asking</b> so that people who are vulnerable are not put in an even more precarious position...|$|R
