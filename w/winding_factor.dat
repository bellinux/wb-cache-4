5000|$|In power engineering, <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> is a {{technique}} that is employed to improve the rms generated voltage or emf in a three-phase AC electrical machine so that the output voltage and hence torque {{does not have any}} harmonics in it which may reduce efficiency. This is because the armature winding of each phase is distributed in a number of slots. Since the emf induced in different slots are not in phase, their phasor sum is less than their numerical sum. This reduction factor is called distribution factor Kd. Another factor that can reduce the <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> is when the slot pitch is smaller than the pole pitch, called pitch factor Kp. The <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> can be calculated as Kw = Kd * Kp To calculate the <b>winding</b> <b>factor,</b> Kw=Kd X Kp [...] ----(1) Where Kd=~1 (point here {{to keep in mind is}} that all(three phase) motors are balanced systems. Kp=Cos(a/2) ----(2) where a is the value of by which the coil is short-pitched To calculate a, one need to know and hence calculate the coil pitch and pole pitch of the motor. coil pitch It is the 2pi/number of slots. It needs to be in electrical degrees so divide the answer by 2. pole pitch It is 2pi/number of poles. Again, divide the answer by 2 to get elec deg.|$|E

40|$|Purpose This {{paper is}} aimed at general {{investigation}} of winding topologies for flux-switching motors (FSM) with various segment-tooth combinations and different excitation methods. Design/methodology/approach For the ac winding of FSM, two winding topologies, namely the concentrated winding and the distributed winding, are compared {{in terms of the}} <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> and efficiency. For the field winding of dc-excited FSM (DCEFSM), another two winding topologies, namely the lap winding and the toroidal winding, are compared in terms of effective coil area, end-winding length, and thermal conditions. Analytical derivation is used for the general <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> calculation. The calculation results are validated using finite element analysis (FEA). Findings Winding factors can be used as an indication of winding efficiency for FSMs {{in the same manner as}} done for synchronous motors (SMs). For FSMs with concentrated windings, the <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> increases when the rotor tooth number approaches a multiple of the stator segment number. For FSMs with certain segment-tooth combinations, e. g. 6 / 8, the theoretical maximum <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> can be achieved by implementing distributed windings. Furthermore, the toroidal winding can be an efficient winding topology for DCEFSMs with large stator diameter and small stack length. Research limitations/implications This work can be continued with investigating the variation of reluctance torque with respect to different segment-tooth combinations of FSM. Originality/value This paper proposes a general method to calculate the <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> of flux-switching motors using only the phase number, the stator segment number, the rotor tooth number, and the skew angle. Using this method, a table of winding factors of FSMs with different segment-tooth combinations is provided. Principle of design of FSMs with high winding factors are hence concluded. This paper also proposed the implementation of distributed windings for FSM with certain segment-tooth combinations, e. g. 6 / 8, by which means a theoretical maximum <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> is achieved. In addition, different winding topologies for the field winding of DCEFSM are also investigated...|$|E

The calculation of the frequency losses in the design optimization of the hub motors is specifically considered.

40|$|For a {{power range}} from 10 to 30 kW, 5 -phase {{machines}} are well adapted to low-voltage (48 V) supply {{thanks to their}} reduced current per phase.

Careful measurement of surface currents via Lagrangian drifters requires a drifter design appropriate to both the depth of current to be measured and the tide and wind conditions of interest. The use of remote sensing to track drifters contributes additional constraints on drifter design. Several designs of biodegradable drifters which emit uranine dye plumes, resolvable in aerial imagery to 1 : 60, 000 scale, were tested for wind drag in field conditions against data from calibrated current meters.
