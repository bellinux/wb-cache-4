They <b>are</b> therefore also <b>scattered</b> by magnetic fields. When neutrons <b>are</b> <b>scattered</b> from hydrogen-containing materials, they produce diffraction patterns with high noise levels. However, the material {{can sometimes be}} treated to substitute deuterium for hydrogen.|$|R

5|$|As a result, {{leaves of}} the codex <b>were</b> <b>scattered</b> in several places of the monastery, from where they were {{collected}} on several occasions by people from France, Russia, and Italy. The first was Pierre Séguier (1588–1672), who bought 14 leaves which, known later as Fragmenta Coisliniana, and {{became a part of}} the Fonds Coislin. They were held in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In 1715 Bernard de Montfaucon published text of these 14 leaves. He made a few mistakes corrected by Tischendorf (in 1865). Tischendorf observed in Paris additional passage. Montfaucon used the manuscript for his palaeographical studies.|$|E
