5|$|Following Germany's capitulation, the Allies {{demanded that}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet be interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. On 21 November 1918, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, the ships sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Once the ships were interned, their breech blocks were removed, which disabled their guns.|$|E

One peripheral controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game light gun.

5|$|Nuclear weapons {{manufacture}} and other nuclear physics applications {{are a major}} source of artificial lithium fractionation, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles {{to such an extent that}} it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.|$|E

Most of the surface forces went to sea early on the following morning; the 7th Cruiser Squadron, which had been added to provide further support to the Harwich Force, left port later in the day.|$|E

5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E

As the Pacific War was ending on 15 August, they swept the Strait of Malacca and the approaches to Singapore. Together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> cruiser , Pelorus {{was one of the}} first British ships to re-enter Singapore harbour. She returned home in May 1946 and was paid off.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{commander}} of the German High Seas Fleet, decided that another raid on the English coast should be {{carried out in the}} hopes of luring a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be destroyed. At 03:20, CET on 15 December 1914, Blücher, Moltke, Von der Tann, the new battlecruiser , and Seydlitz, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, Graudenz, and two squadrons of torpedo boats left the Jade estuary. The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, until they reached the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet, consisting of 14 dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts and a screening force of two armored cruisers, seven light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats, departed to provide distant cover for the bombardment force.|$|E

5|$|Derfflingers first combat {{operation}} was {{a raid on}} the English coastal towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. One raid had already been conducted by the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group, on the town of Yarmouth in late 1914. Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{the commander of the}} High Seas Fleet, decided to conduct another raid on the English coast. His goal was to lure a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be isolated and destroyed. At 03:20 on 15 December, Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, with his flag in , departed the Jade estuary. Following Seydlitz were Derfflinger, , , and , along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two squadrons of torpedo boats.

5|$|Despite {{these initial}} {{developments}} the Depression {{in the early}} 1930s largely halted the development of armour in Australia, although a limited capability was maintained by the regular tank cadre which operated mainly in an instructional role. The 1st Tank Section was disbanded in November 1937 with the men and equipment transferred to the newly created 1st Light Tank Company based at Randwick. It was not the Australian Army's only armoured unit as the Second World War approached. The 2nd Light Tank Company was formed as a Militia unit at Caulfield, Victoria in March 1939 and was also equipped with Vickers Medium Mark II medium tanks. The light tank companies were then equipped <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> Tank Mark VIa, 10 {{of which had been}} acquired to replace the ageing Mark IIs. In addition, the 1st Royal New South Wales Lancers, which had been serving as a Light Horse regiment, having converted from horses to armoured vehicles to become a light cavalry (reconnaissance) regiment and took on the role of a motorised machine-gun regiment during the inter-war years. It subsequently saw action in the Second World War as the 1st Armoured Regiment equipped with Matilda infantry tanks.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{armistice}} with Germany in November 1918, {{the majority of}} the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Bayern was listed as one of the ships to be handed over, though Baden initially was not. The battlecruiser , which the British believed to be completed, was requested instead. When it became apparent to the Allies that Mackensen was still under construction, Baden was ordered to replace it. On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Baden arrived at Scapa Flow separately on 14 December 1918.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} on 12 December 1903. She was assigned to I Subdivision of the Cruiser Division of the Active Fleet. Along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> cruisers , , and , Friedrich Carls subdivision {{was attached to the}} I Squadron of the Active Fleet. Friedrich Carl was the flagship of Rear Admiral Schmidt, the commander of the Cruiser Division. A second subdivision, composed of an armored cruiser and three light cruisers was attached to the II Squadron. On 20 September 1906, Franz von Hipper took command of the ship. Under his leadership, the gunners aboard Friedrich Carl won the Kaiser's Prize for best shooting in the fleet in 1907. Hipper remained in the position until March 1908.|$|E
