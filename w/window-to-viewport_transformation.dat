Clipping to the world-coordinates window is usually applied to the objects before they are passed through the <b>window-to-viewport</b> <b>transformation.</b> For a 2D object, the latter transformation is simply a combination of translation and scaling, the latter not necessarily uniform. An analogy of this transformation process based on traditional photography notions is to equate the world-clipping window with the camera settings and the variously sized prints that can be obtained from the resulting film image as possible viewports.|$|E
