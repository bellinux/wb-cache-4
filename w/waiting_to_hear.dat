25|$|When readers {{process a}} local ambiguity, they settle {{on one of}} the {{possible}} interpretations immediately without <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> or read more words that might help decide which interpretation is correct (the behaviour is called incremental processing). If readers are surprised by the turn the sentence really takes, processing is slowed and is visible for example in reading times. Locally-ambiguous sentences have, therefore, been used as test cases to investigate the influence of a number of different factors on human sentence processing. If a factor helps readers to avoid difficulty, {{it is clear that the}} factor plays a factor in sentence processing.|$|E
25|$|The city is <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{whether it}} will be {{selected}} by the Government of Ontario as the area for testing driverless cars on public roads. The entire city would become a test centre; this would require the installation of a major new digital infrastructure to enable communications between vehicles, with the roadway and with traffic signals. Preliminary testing of driverless cars has been done here already, by the Waterloo's Centre for Automotive Research, affiliated with the University, but the decision as to where the multimillion-dollar technology grid will be installed has not yet been made by the Province. The city's free Wi-Fi network may be of value to IT industries and is an indicator of its serious interest in advanced technology.|$|E
25|$|After viewing Kohler's tape, Langdon, Vittoria and the {{cardinals}} confront the camerlengo. Shortly before the novel begins, the Pope met with Leonardo Vetra {{who believed that}} antimatter was capable of establishing a link between science and God. Vetra's beliefs caused great discomfort to the camerlengo. While discussing Vetra, the pope reveals that his support is due to science having given him a son. Without <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the explanation (that the child {{was the result of}} artificial insemination) and horrified that the Pope appeared to have broken his vow of chastity, the camerlengo plots to rectify the situation. He poisoned the pope and, under the guise of an Illuminati master (Janus), he recruited the assassin to kill Vetra, steal the antimatter and kidnap and murder the preferiti. The camerlengo planted the antimatter in St. Peter's basilica, feigned his last minute vision from God and retrieved the canister just in time to save the Vatican from the ensuing explosion. This was in hope to unite the struggling Catholic Church. The Illuminati involvement was merely a plot engineered by the camerlengo to cover his own involvement. Upon the discovery and the camerlengo's attempts to justify his murder of the Pope, Cardinal Saverio Mortati, Dean of the College of Cardinals, reveals that the camerlengo is in fact the late pope's biological son, conceived with a nun through artificial insemination. Overcome with guilt, Ventresca soaks himself in oil and sets himself on fire before a crowd of onlookers in St. Peter's Square. His ashes are recovered by Mortati, who places them in an urn which is placed inside his father's sarcophagus. It is revealed that {{the cardinals}}' endorsing of him would have made him Pope by acclamation. Mortati is unanimously elected pope by the cardinals and Langdon and Vittoria reunite at Hotel Berniniwhere they share an extensive meal before making love. The last brand, the Illuminati Diamond, is given to Langdon on indefinite loan, provided he return it to the Vatican in his will.|$|E

[...] He finally received a promise of a Cabinet position, should he and the Liberals be elected; Howe would not have stood without such an undertaking. [...] On 14 October 1935, Howe was comfortably elected to the Commons from Port Arthur, amassing a majority of 3,784. Across the country the Liberals won a landslide victory, with 173seats in the House of Commons to the Conservatives's 40.|$|E

2500|$|Denkinger was {{the first}} base umpire in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series. The St. Louis Cardinals led the Kansas City Royals by 3 games to 2 and had taken a 1–0 lead in the 8th inning. Jorge Orta, the leadoff batter for the Royals hit a slow roller to first baseman Jack Clark, who tossed to Worrell {{covering}} first base. Denkinger called Orta safe, even though television replays and photographs clearly showed that he was out by half a step. The Royals {{went on to win}} Game 6 by the score of 2–1. Denkinger believed he had made the right call until he later met with Commissioner Peter Ueberroth after the game and had the opportunity to see the replay himself. He said he was <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the ball land in Worrell's glove while watching the bag for Orta's foot and due to the crowd noise he never heard Worrell catch the ball. As crew chief of the 1985 World Series umpiring unit, Denkinger was scheduled to work behind home plate in Game 7, a fact that further upset the Cardinals and manager Whitey Herzog.|$|E

[...] Hovind stated that he did not recognize the government's right to try him on tax-fraud charges. At first he attempted to enter a plea of [...] "subornation of false muster," [...] but then entered a not guilty plea [...] "under duress" [...] when the judge offered to enter a plea for him. When asked about his home, Hovind called it a [...] "church parish", and denied any residence except the [...] "church of Jesus Christ", worldwide. Hovind's passport and guns were seized. Hovind protested, arguing that he needed his passport to continue his evangelism work, and that [...] "thousands and thousands" [...] were <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> him preach in South Africa the following month.

2500|$|In 2016, Suu Kyi {{was accused}} of failing to protect Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims during the 2016–17 persecution. State crime experts from Queen Mary University of London warned that Suu Kyi is “legitimising genocide” in Myanmar. Despite {{continued}} persecution of the Rohingya well into 2017, Suu Kyi was “not even admitting, let alone trying to stop, the army’s well-documented campaign of rape, murder and destruction against Rohingya villages.” On 4 September 2017, Yanghee Lee, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, criticised Suu Kyi’s response to the “really grave” situation in Rakhine, saying: “The de facto leader needs to step in – {{that is what we}} would expect from any government, to protect everybody within their own jurisdiction.” The BBC reported that “Her comments came as the number of Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh reached 87,000, according to UN estimates”, adding that “her sentiments were echoed by Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, who said she was <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from Ms Suu Kyi – who has not commented on the crisis since it erupted.” The next day George Monbiot, writing in The Guardian, called on readers to sign a change.org petition to have the Nobel peace prize revoked, criticising her silence on the matter and asserting “whether out of prejudice or out of fear, she denies to others the freedoms she rightly claimed for herself. Her regime excludes – and in some cases seeks to silence – the very activists who helped to ensure her own rights were recognised.” The Nobel Foundation replied that there existed no provision for revoking a Nobel Prize. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a fellow peace prize holder, also criticised Suu Kyi’s silence: in an open letter published on social media, he said “If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep ... It is incongruous for a symbol of righteousness to lead such a country.” On September 13 it was revealed that Suu Kyi would not be attending a UN General Assembly debate being held the following week to discuss the humanitarian crisis, with a Myanmar government spokesman stating “perhaps she has more pressing matters to deal with”.|$|E
