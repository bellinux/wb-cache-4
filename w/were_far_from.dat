5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Army leaders {{including}} General Eric Shinseki began shifting the Army force toward brigade centered operations. All separate brigades had been inactivated in the 1990s {{as part of}} the U.S. Army's drawdown following the end of the Cold War. These inactivations, along with subsequent reorganization of U.S. Army divisions, saw several divisional brigades stationed in bases that <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the division's headquarters and support units. These brigades had difficulty operating without support from higher headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Finucane {{spent the}} winter of 1939–40 gaining as much flight {{practice}} as possible. He was unable to gain any hours in fighter aircraft and was abruptly transferred to the practice and parachute test flight centre at RAF Henlow and {{had to settle for}} making trips around airfields in an antiquated Vickers Virginia as a co-pilot ferrying engineers and ground crew from 16 September 1939. That month German forces invaded Poland (1 September) prompting Britain and France to declare war on Germany and beginning the war in Europe. Finucane's piloting skills <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> being at the acceptable level for a fighter pilot. He continued in this trend until May 1940 until he was assigned to flying Miles Magister training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} {{first two}} missions–Operation Biting, a parachute landing in France, and Operation Freshman, a glider mission in Norway–were both raids. Part {{of the division}} was sent to North Africa {{at the end of}} 1942, where it fought in the Tunisian Campaign, and when the Allies invaded Sicily in July 1943, the division undertook two brigade sized landings. The first, Operation Ladbroke, carried out by glider infantry of the 1st Airlanding Brigade and the second, Operation Fustian, by the 1st Parachute Brigade, <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> completely successful. The 1st Airborne Division then took part in a mostly diversionary amphibious landing, codenamed Operation Slapstick, as part of the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Raziel {{discovers the}} Oracle's Cave, where Moebius the Time Streamer once hid the Chronoplast, a magical time machine. Raziel {{traverses}} the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is angered {{over what he}} has learned, and Kain says his actions are justified due to his being subject to destiny, before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them to be when the latter demands to know why he created him, which Raziel refuses to listen to. Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of Soul Reaver 2.|$|E

5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus had to {{deal with}} the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were {{currently}} at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel assumed {{command of}} the newly formed Anzac Mounted Division on 16 March 1916, the day after it {{relieved}} the 1st Division on the Suez Canal defences. Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches {{for his part in}} the defence of the Canal. His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, {{the northern part of the}} Canal, under Major General H. A. Lawrence. Arrangements <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GHQ Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). Lawrence was too far away to control the battle, especially once the telephone lines were cut. Murray, in Ismailia, was even further back.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post-war}} boom, {{the methods used}} to set up {{business}} in South Australia were unique. Playford's government would charge little to no business tax, supply cheap electricity, land and water, and have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers' homes. Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide; mining, steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the 'Iron Triangle' towns of Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta. Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment, and South Australia was slower than the other states to abolish these wartime measures to increase its industrial competitiveness. The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden, as Adelaide and South Australia <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the markets where the goods would be sold.|$|E

5|$|For six years, Tamar was a co-ruler {{with her}} father upon whose death, in 1184, Tamar {{continued}} as the sole monarch and was crowned a second time at the Gelati cathedral near Kutaisi, western Georgia. She inherited a relatively strong kingdom, but the centrifugal tendencies fostered by the great nobles <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> being quelled. There was considerable opposition to Tamar's succession; this was sparked by a reaction against the repressive policies of her father and encouraged by the new sovereign's other perceived weakness, her sex. As Georgia had never previously had a female ruler, {{a part of the}} aristocracy questioned Tamar's legitimacy, while others tried to exploit her youth and supposed weakness to assert greater autonomy for themselves. The energetic involvement of Tamar's influential aunt Rusudan and the Georgian Catholicos-Patriarch Michael IV Mirianisdze was crucial for legitimizing Tamar's succession to the throne. However, the young queen was forced into making significant concessions to the aristocracy. She had to reward the Catholicos-Patriarch Michael's support by making him a chancellor, thus placing him at the top of both the clerical and secular hierarchies.|$|E
5|$|In 1667 Nicholas Steno wrote a {{paper about}} a shark head he had dissected. He {{compared}} {{the teeth of}} the shark with the common fossil objects known as tongue stones. He concluded that the fossils must have been shark teeth. Steno then took an interest in the question of fossils, and to address some of the objections to their organic origin he began studying rock strata. The result of this work was published in 1669 as Forerunner to a Dissertation on a solid naturally enclosed in a solid. In this book, Steno drew a clear distinction between objects such as rock crystals that really were formed within rocks and those such as fossil shells and shark teeth that were formed outside of those rocks. Steno realized that certain kinds of rock had been formed by the successive deposition of horizontal layers of sediment and that fossils were the remains of living organisms that had become buried in that sediment. Steno who, like almost all 17th century natural philosophers, believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old, resorted to the Biblical flood as a possible explanation for fossils of marine organisms that <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the sea.|$|E
5|$|Stay-at-home dads {{make up a}} {{very small}} portion of the Australian {{population}} although this appears to be rapidly changing. In 2003, 91% of fathers with children aged under 15 years were employed with 85% employed full-time. Because of this, there are few role models or resources that can help Australian fathers with the stay-at-home dad role. The Australian Bureau of Statistics show that approximately 7% of two parents families with {{children under the age of}} 14 have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full-time. Stay at home dads in Australia have almost doubled over the past decade from 57,900 to 106,000, and expected to increase in the future. Recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time and support to their children in comparison to the 19th century. The idea of a stay at home dad <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> mainstream, however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolt of}} the Batavi {{appears to have}} led to a {{significant}} change in the Roman government's policy on deployment of Auxilia. The revolt proved that in times of civil strife, when legions <b>were</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> their bases campaigning for rival claimants to the imperial throne, it was dangerous to leave provinces exclusively in the hands of auxiliary regiments recruited from the indigenous nation. During the Julio-Claudian period, auxiliary regiments had often been deployed away from their original home province. But in the Flavian period (69–96), this appears to have become standard policy. Thus in AD 70, 5 reconstituted Batavi regiments (one ala and four cohortes) were transferred to Britain under Petillius Cerialis, who had suppressed the Civilis revolt and then embarked on the governorship of the island. The great majority of regiments probably founded in the 1st century were stationed away from their province of origin in the second e.g. of 13 British regiments recorded in the mid-2nd century, none were stationed in Britain. Furthermore, it appears that in the Flavian era native noblemen were no longer permitted to command auxiliary units from their own tribe.|$|E
