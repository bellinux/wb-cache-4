Ben tells Lucas he <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> Jawad; he chose to become a bomber over seeing his family. Lucas receives a call from Marlin, who asks to meet with him. During the confrontation, Marlin admits {{he was forced to}} become Mr. Big when terrorists kidnapped his family. Now knowing he has failed, he commits suicide.|$|E

Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even provide him with {{the money to pay}} back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E

5|$|Rhonda Latimer, {{an aging}} {{reporter}} for Fox News Channel who is idolized by viewers {{because of her}} good looks, is dismissed when the network's first high-definition broadcast exposes her wrinkles, leaving a job opportunity open. Lois auditions for the part, ignoring Brian's warnings that Fox News is a heavily biased network, and she is chosen as the new reporter. On her first day reporting, she is assigned to do an exposé on Michael Moore {{to prove that he}} is a homosexual. When she spies on him outside his house, she sees Rush Limbaugh coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> them. The two decide to take the story into their own hands and confront who they expect to be Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that the both of them are portrayed by Fred Savage, who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career. A flabbergasted Lois ultimately decides to report his story instead.|$|E
5|$|The third era {{deviates}} {{from the}} original plot considerably. When Lara was young she travelled with her parents on many of their archaeological expeditions which helped to shape the woman she was becoming. It was {{on one of these}} expeditions that her mother vanished and was presumed dead and a few years later her father presumably took his own life, she was then left in the care of Conrad Roth. Even though she was left with a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London. This decision required her to pay her tuition and rent by working many jobs. Though this was a much tougher choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been. She also ended up meeting her best friend, Samantha Nishimura, during her time at UCL. It was because of Sam's free spirit and wild streak that Lara was able to experience much more of London than just the universities and museums that she loved so much. After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end up on an expedition to the Dragon's Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilisation of Yamatai. It is on this expedition that Lara is stranded on a remote island full of natural, human and supernatural dangers, which enables her to develop from a vulnerable girl to a survivor. And after experiencing the supernatural powers of the ancient world, she comes to realise her father <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> his theories and her hunger for adventure awakens.|$|E

Douglas advised the President regarding {{a course of action}} in response to The Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik I in October 1957. He also reaffirmed the 1925 court-martial verdict against air power advocate Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. He said the court was correct to have been found Mitchell guilty of publicly attacking his superiors, but noted that time had proved Mitchell <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> the unique value of air power.|$|E

He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. Summer explains that Tom <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E
25|$|Later on 11 June de Gaulle {{attended}} {{the meeting of}} the Anglo-French Supreme War Council at the Chateau du Muguet at Briare. The British were represented by Churchill, Anthony Eden, John Dill, General Ismay and Edward Spears, and the French by Reynaud, Pétain, Weygand and Georges. Churchill demanded that the French take to guerrilla warfare, and reminded Pétain of how he had {{come to the aid of}} the British with forty divisions in March 1918, receiving a dusty answer in each case. De Gaulle's fighting spirit made a strong impression on the British. At the meeting de Gaulle met Pétain for the first time in two years. Pétain noted his recent promotion to general, adding that he did not congratulate him, as ranks were of no use in defeat. When de Gaulle protested that Pétain himself had been promoted to brigadier-general and division commander at the Battle of the Marne in 1914, he replied that there was “no comparison” with the present situation. De Gaulle later conceded that Pétain <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> that much at least. De Gaulle missed the second day of the conference as he was in Rennes for a meeting (not mentioned in his memoirs) to discuss the plans for the Breton redoubt with General René Altmayer. He then returned to attend a Cabinet meeting, at which it was clear that there was a growing movement for an armistice, and which decided that the government should move to Bordeaux rather than de Gaulle’s preference for Quimper in Brittany.|$|E

500|$|In 1830–1833, Charles Lyell, in his Principles of Geology, {{carefully}} summarised Lamarck's theory (in about 6 pages, with cross-references to the Philosophie Zoologique) {{and then}} roundly criticised it. Lyell begins {{by noting that}} Lamarck gives no examples {{at all of the}} development of any entirely new function ("the substitution of some entirely new sense, faculty, or organ") but only proves that the [...] "dimensions and strength" [...] of some parts can be increased or decreased. Lyell says that with this [...] "disregard to the strict rules of induction" [...] Lamarck [...] "resorts to fictions".

[...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single.
