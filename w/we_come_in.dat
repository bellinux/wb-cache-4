500|$|Despite The Smiths's chart success, Marr {{left the}} group in August 1987 because of a {{strained}} relationship with Morrissey. Failing to find a replacement, The Smiths disbanded {{by the time of}} the release of their final studio album, Strangeways, Here <b>We</b> <b>Come,</b> <b>in</b> September that year. Strangeways, Here We Come climbed to number two in the UK and became the band's highest-charting release in the United States when it reached number fifty-five on the Billboard 200. In early 1992 WEA acquired the entire back catalogue of The Smiths and produced two compilations– Best... I and ...Best II– the first of which went to the top of the UK Albums Chart. WEA released two further singles compilations in 1995 and 2001, with a further compilation, The Sound of The Smiths, released in November 2008.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{just the}} other way, sir," [...] Bob said, [...] "and it is very lucky for us that <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> here, sir, instead of {{going up to the}} Common, as we intended. One of the ushers found out that we had gone, and sat up until <b>we</b> <b>came</b> back and, {{if it had not been}} for you, we should not only have got a thrashing, but should all have been expelled; so it is the luckiest thing {{possible}} that <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> here." ...|$|R
2500|$|Public {{schools are}} {{generally}} limited to students living {{within the school}} district boundaries. Private schools can enroll students regardless of where they live. A common misconception about Bolles is that they recruit and their teams are composed of blue-chip college prospects. They usually aren’t, so Rogers must maximize the potential of players with no chance of ever playing college ball. Rogers stated, [...] "As coaches, we don't {{do a lot to}} make Division I football players; they pretty much make themselves. Where <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> is to have more influence on the guy who struggles just to be competitive." ...|$|E

60|$|JAMES. What {{about that}} woman he was mixed up with? I saw some one uncommonly like her outside as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shall <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> {{and work}} havoc, and you too shall eat flesh?' And the dogs {{answered}} in their tongue: 'Come in, {{and for once}} we shall have enough to eat.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was very}} glad to get your letter before leaving Glasgow this morning. This is a poor return for it, but the post goes out early, and <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> late.|$|E
6000|$|... "If we'll pay {{whatever}} you think is right, may <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> an' stay a little while?" [...] Joe asked, falteringly. [...] "It's awful hot, an' the princess must be tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, it {{was quite}} unpremeditated, I assure you. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> together," [...] whispered Herbert, leading her to the door, [...] "and I"-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But my dear Lady Ware, {{who keeps}} you waiting? There is your stall, and {{why on earth}} should you stand here and call us all over as <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> like naughty schoolboys?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> this {{afternoon}} I found this note from Mrs. Burrage. You had better read it." [...] And she presented the document, open, to Verena.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir! I have {{a couple}} of Remingtons, and plenty of {{ammunition}} for them. I have two spears, also, which I picked up when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a {{lady in the}} house," [...] he observed. [...] "I {{caught a}} glimpse of her in the passage as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in.</b> Did you see her, Edward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The grey girl {{screwed up}} her shining eyes. [...] "Oh, {{do you mind}} if <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> a minute?" [...] she said. [...] "It would be so good of you. We're making a report." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be too sure," [...] {{answered}} James Morris. [...] "At {{this very}} minute {{they may be}} preparing to rush in and overwhelm us. I won't believe we are safe until <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> sight of Winchester." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> {{sight of}} the island we'll have to move with caution," [...] went on the lumberman. [...] "If we don't, Captain Langless may lay low and give us the slip in the dark." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{energy level}} was great tonight--the crowd was awesome. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> and hit our {{routines}} and {{did more than}} we expected tonight. I was really happy with my performance.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> {{sight of}} the island in question, just as Dr. Reasono {{concluded}} his interesting narrative; and, turning to Captain Poke, I solemnly asked that discerning and shrewd seaman,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am afraid}} {{it would be}} of no use. Ma'am,' said Lucy, firmly, but not daring to raise her eyes; 'we missed him when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> from walking, {{yesterday}} evening.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Pears to me Jack and Wetzel hev some redskins treed, an' didn't {{want us to}} spile the fun. Mebbe there wasn't scalps {{enough to}} go round. Anyway, <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> an' we'll hang up here to-day." ...|$|E

60|$|Thus having {{passed over}} his prayer, <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the next place to his GESTURES; for in my {{judgment}} the right understanding of them will give us yet more conviction of the Publican's sense and awakening of spirit under this present action of his.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It ain't fitty like,' {{said the}} old man confidentially to Susan, 'nor the ladies wouldn't like it when <b>we</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> with our old coats all of a muck with wet.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said Léon suddenly. [...] "I see no use <b>in</b> pretending. Before <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> here <b>we</b> heard sounds indicating--if I may so express myself--an {{imperfect}} harmony." ...|$|R
