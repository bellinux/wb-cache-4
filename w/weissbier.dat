50|$|Munich {{is famous}} for its breweries and the <b>Weissbier</b> (or <b>Weißbier</b> / Weizenbier, wheat beer) is a {{speciality}} from Bavaria. Helles, a pale lager with a translucent gold colour is the most popular Munich beer today, although it's not old (only introduced in 1895) and {{is the result of a}} change in beer tastes. Helles has largely replaced Munich's dark beer, Dunkles, which gets its colour from burnt malt. It was the typical beer in Munich in the 19th century, but today it is more of a speciality. Starkbier is the strongest Munich beer, containing 6-9 per cent alcohol. It is dark amber in colour and has a heavy malty taste. It is available and popular during the Lenten Starkbierzeit (strong beer season), which begins on or before St. Joseph's Day (19 March). The beer served at Oktoberfest is a special type of Märzen beer with a higher alcohol content than regular Helles.|$|E
5000|$|Weizenbier or Hefeweizen, in the {{southern}} parts of Bavaria usually called <b>Weißbier</b> (literally [...] "white beer", but the name probably derives from Weizenbier, [...] "wheat beer"), is a beer, traditionally from Bavaria, in which {{a significant proportion of}} malted barley is replaced with malted wheat. By German law, Weißbiers brewed in Germany must be top-fermented. Specialized strains of yeast are used which produce overtones of banana and clove as by-products of fermentation. <b>Weißbier</b> is so called because it was, {{at the time of its}} inception, paler in color than Munichs traditional brown beer. It is well known throughout Germany, though better known as Weizen ("Wheat") outside Bavaria. The terms Hefeweizen ("yeast wheat") or Hefeweißbier refer to wheat beer in its traditional, unfiltered form. The term Kristallweizen (crystal wheat), or kristall Weiß (crystal white beer), refers to a wheat beer that is filtered to remove the yeast and wheat proteins which contribute to its cloudy appearance.|$|E
