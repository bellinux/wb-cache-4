5|$|Water used in {{the steam}} cycle is taken from the local mains water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian <b>Water.</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> 300,000 tons of mains water per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E
5|$|Along the Odishan coast, the cyclone {{generated}} a 5–6m (16–20ft) storm surge that brought <b>water</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 35km (20mi) inland, inundating a large swath of coastal areas. The Indian Ministry of Urban Development estimated a peak storm surge height of 6.7m (22ft). One visually estimated storm surge of 9m (30ft) was reported; however, this estimate {{was determined to}} have been too high. Regardless, no in-situ measurement of the peak storm surge exists as all potential instruments were destroyed by the storm. Storm surge was responsible {{for a majority of}} the fatalities linked to the 1999Odisha cyclone, accounting for around 7,000deaths. The intense wave action sank 9,085fishing boats and caused the loss of 22,143fishing nets. Some fishing trawlers were carried and deposited 1.5–2.0km (0.9–1.2mi) inland. A 4km (2.5mi) stretch of road leading out of Paradip was covered by sand dunes measuring 1m (3.3ft) in height and 0.5km (0.3mi) in width. Paradip Port sustained severe damage to several components including various warehouses and its power transmission system, though its core infrastructure remained intact. Damage at the port was estimated at around ₹300million (US$6.9million). The storm surge destroyed nearly every house in Paradip near the point of landfall. In Gopalpur, 27villages were submerged by the surge. To the south in southern Andhra Pradesh, 48trawlers sank.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its primary}} effects were felt in a {{localized}} area of India, the outer {{fringes of the}} super cyclone impacted Myanmar and Bangladesh. Ten {{people were killed in}} the former, while two were killed in the latter by the storm's rainbands. The storm was the most severe to strike Odisha in the 20th century, raking the state and adjacent areas with high storm surge, powerful winds, and torrential rainfall. The storm's impacts exacerbated the damage caused by a very severe cyclone that struck the same region less than two weeks earlier. The 5–6m (16–20ft) surge brought <b>water</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 35km (20mi) inland, carrying along with it coastal debris and inundating towns and villages. The surge combined with heavy rains to produce widespread flooding, damaging around 1.6million homes and causing rivers to breach 20,005flood embankments. The storm's effects destroyed numerous crops, including sugar cane, rice, and other winter-time harvests. Although estimates of the death toll varied significantly—at times suggesting 30,000fatalities—the Government of India enumerated 9,887fatalities in the country, of which a majority were caused by storm surge; over 8,000deaths occurred in Jagatsinghpur. The total damage cost of the destruction wrought by the super cyclone amounted to US$4.44billion.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the <b>water</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> standards. The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E

25|$|Spawning {{occurs in}} a range of areas, {{depending}} on the geographic locality of the individual; some spawning in deeper <b>water</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 9 m deep, others in estuaries. May and June are the most common times for spawning, with some spawning events recorded as early as February and as late as July. Juvenile fish are recruited to areas by ocean currents, with studies showing the species is too weak a swimmer to be able to undertake long distance journeys. The location of spawning also has implications for the location of the juveniles, as with some estuary breeding individuals.|$|E
25|$|Pascal's work in {{the fields}} of the study of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics {{centered}} on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with <b>water</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal's barrel experiment.|$|E
25|$|Like all flies, {{mosquitoes}} {{go through}} four stages in their lifecycles: egg, larva, pupa, and adult or imago. In most species, adult females {{lay their eggs}} in stagnant water; some lay eggs near the water's edge; others attach their eggs to aquatic plants. Each species selects {{the situation of the}} water into which it lays its eggs and does so according to its own ecological adaptations. Some are generalists and are not very fussy. Some breed in lakes, some in temporary puddles. Some breed in marshes, some in salt-marshes. Among those that breed in salt water, some are equally at home in fresh and salt <b>water</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> about one-third the concentration of seawater, whereas others must acclimatize themselves to the salinity. Such differences are important because certain ecological preferences keep mosquitoes away from most humans, whereas other preferences bring them right into houses at night.|$|E

50|$|Dusky Flatheads {{are found}} in {{estuaries}} and coastal bays including Port Phillip Bay, from Cairns in Queensland to the Gippsland Lakes in Victoria. They occur over sand, mud, gravel and seagrass and can inhabit estuarine <b>waters</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the tidal limit.|$|R
25|$|Along the {{northern}} coast of Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula, high waves from the hurricane capsized a boat with two occupants, killing one of them. Many communes experienced significant coastal flooding from storm tides and active seas, which drove <b>water</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> half a kilometer inland. More than 100 homes in Artibonite were inundated, {{and the main}} road to Anse-Rouge was impassable. Strong winds brought down multiple trees in the commune of Grand-Saline, where severe flooding was also reported. In Nippes and Nord-Ouest, four emergency shelters housed nearly 300 individuals. Joaquin damaged banana and millet fields, killed {{a small number of}} livestock, and triggered several landslides. In the four hardest-hit departments, about 900 households were directly affected by the storm. The Haitian government distributed nearly 500 hygiene kits to 200 families in Nippes, while evacuees in Port-de-Paix received mattresses, bed sheets, hygiene kits, food kits, and clean water; Action against Hunger also donated water purification tablets.|$|E
25|$|If the {{distinction}} between confined and unconfined is not clear geologically (i.e., {{if it is not}} known if a clear confining layer exists, or if the geology is more complex, e.g., a fractured bedrock aquifer), the value of storativity returned from an aquifer test can be used to determine it (although aquifer tests in unconfined aquifers should be interpreted differently than confined ones). Confined aquifers have very low storativity values (much less than 0.01, and as little as 10−5), which means that the aquifer is storing water using the mechanisms of aquifer matrix expansion and the compressibility of water, which typically are both quite small quantities. Unconfined aquifers have storativities (typically then called specific yield) greater than 0.01 (1% of bulk volume); they release water from storage by the mechanism of actually draining the pores of the aquifer, releasing relatively large amounts of <b>water</b> (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> the drainable porosity of the aquifer material, or the minimum volumetric water content).|$|E
25|$|Retail water tariffs. The same retail tariff {{structure}} {{applies to the}} entire country. Water and sewer tariffs in Morocco follow an increasing-block {{tariff structure}}, under which the tariff per cubic meter rises as consumption increases. The residential tariff has four blocks, the lowest applying to consumption of less than 6 m³ per month and the highest to consumption above 40 m³ per month. However, the level of retail tariffs varies from one locality to another. Standpipe services, which are common for the urban poor, are typically free. Utilities send bills to local governments. In a few cases, standpipe management has been entrusted to a gardien/gérant, who operates the faucet and charges users. According to a World Bank report, free standpipe services are pro-poor. But they are also increasingly unsustainable for operators, {{both in terms of}} wasted <b>water</b> (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40 percent) and in terms of lack of revenues. Operators are in favor of promoting individual connections in order to strengthen their revenue base.|$|E
50|$|These cowries live on {{coral reef}} or in shallow lagoons in {{tropical}} intertidal and subtidal <b>waters</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30 m depth. They {{can be found}} under ledges and in small coral caves at night, as they start feeding at dusk.|$|R
