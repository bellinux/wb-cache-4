5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature {{has proved to}} be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins. The committee was of the view that the Boltzmann constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of <b>water,</b> <b>as</b> it overcame these difficulties.|$|E
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid <b>water</b> <b>as</b> a solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water {{is also more}} chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E

His works have been translated into Italian (Velvet <b>Waters</b> <b>as</b> Una Melodia) and Swedish (Inland as Inlandet, The Plains <b>as</b> Slätterna, Velvet <b>Waters</b> <b>as</b> Sammetsvatten and Barley Patch as Korntäppa).|$|R

They survive by grazing on marsh grasses, which supply them with <b>water</b> <b>as</b> well as food, supplemented by temporary freshwater pools.|$|E
5|$|An {{oxide layer}} forms around {{beryllium}} that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000°C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming {{a mixture of}} beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or <b>water</b> <b>as</b> this forms the oxide. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.|$|E
5|$|Argon has {{approximately}} the same solubility in <b>water</b> <b>as</b> oxygen and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than nitrogen. Argon is colorless, odorless, nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid, liquid or gas. Argon is chemically inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.|$|E

5|$|As Bonnie {{moved through}} the Bahamas, {{residents}} stocked up on food and <b>water</b> <b>as</b> a precautionary measure; however, no major preparations took place. Most businesses remained open during the system's passage and schools were already closed for the summer. Throughout the islands, the effects from Bonnie were relatively minimal. Heavy rain fell across a few islands and copious lightning was reported. No known damage or loss of life took place.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} {{the flow of blood}} to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much <b>water</b> <b>as</b> possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter <b>water</b> <b>as</b> it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, {{the first}} {{recorded}} use {{of toilet paper}} was made in 589 by the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531–591), and in 851 an Arab Muslim traveler commented on how he believed the Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness {{because they did not}} wash with <b>water</b> (<b>as</b> was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.|$|E

5|$|From its {{headwaters}} in the Coast Mountains, the Yukon River flows northwest, {{across the}} Yukon–Alaska border, until it intersects the Porcupine River at {{the settlement of}} Fort Yukon. At that point, the river turns west and southwest, flowing through the Yukon Flats, a low-lying wetland area containing thousands of ponds, streams, and other small bodies of <b>water.</b> <b>As</b> the river flows southwest, it intersects the Tanana and Koyukuk rivers before looping south, then north into Norton Sound in the Bering Sea.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{is a very}} {{important}} resource in the Sava River basin, generally used for public water supply of potable <b>water,</b> <b>as</b> a source of water for industrial use, but also as the mainstay of aquatic ecosystems. There are 41 identified significant groundwater bodies in the Sava River basin of basin-wide importance, ranging in area size from , as well as numerous minor ground water bodies. Even though most of them are transboundary waters, eleven are considered to be largely located in Slovenia, fourteen in Croatia, seven in Bosnia-Herzegovina, five in Serbia and four in Montenegro.|$|E
5|$|Hatchlings {{can lose}} up to 20% {{of their body}} mass due to {{evaporation}} of <b>water</b> <b>as</b> they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore. An iron compound, magnetite, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field, for navigation.|$|E

5|$|In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a {{design for a}} production reactor with water cooling. The choice of <b>water</b> <b>as</b> a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with <b>water,</b> <b>as</b> on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E
