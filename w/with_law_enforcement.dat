5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience <b>with</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience <b>with</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer {{found that it was}} {{relevant}} to the custody analysis. Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience <b>with</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> misleading; while experience <b>with</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> can be difficult to determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E

5|$|The Millennium Group is {{a fictional}} secret society {{featured}} in the crime thriller television series Millennium. Having begun life as a Christian sect {{at the end of}} the 1st century AD, the Group grew into a far-reaching network which, as the 3rd millennium approached, presented itself as a private investigative firm liaising <b>with</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> organizations. Despite being fraught with internal schisms, the Group tried on several occasions to artificially instigate the end of the world as the year 2000 approached.|$|E

His secret lover, public defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamel), appears to be his nemesis as she hounds him about a client who is the lost victim of police bureaucracy.

Black believes the murder to be the work of a serial killer, and is convinced there will be a message from him on the bodies.|$|E

5|$|On June 5, Aruban police {{detained}} Nick John and Abraham Jones, former {{security guards}} {{from the nearby}} Allegro Hotel (which was then closed for renovation) on suspicion of murder and kidnapping. Authorities have never officially disclosed the reason for their arrests, but according to news accounts, statements made by Van der Sloot and Kalpoe {{may have been a}} factor in the arrests of John and Jones. Reports also indicated that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women, and {{at least one of them}} had a prior incident <b>with</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement.</b> John and Jones were released on June 13 without being charged.|$|E
5|$|At around 7:00a.m. on 9 March 2014, the Mexican Army and Navy pinpointed Moreno González's {{whereabouts}} in Tumbiscatío, Michoacán. When {{they tried}} to apprehend him, the drug lord opened fire at the security forces before being killed in the fire exchange. Mexico's Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) officially confirmed his identity through DNA examinations and fingerprint identification. The results were consistent <b>with</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> files. While investigators conducted the autopsy {{at a hospital in}} Apatzingán, more than 150 law enforcement officers from the Army, Navy, Federal Police, and the PGR cordoned the area to prevent organized crime members from attempting to steal his body. Post-mortem reports indicated that Moreno González died of two gunshot wounds on his thorax. On 12 March 2014, his corpse was transferred to Morelia under tight security for further testing. At the time of his death, the drug lord was wanted by the Mexican government for charges relating to drug trafficking, organized crime, kidnapping, murder, and theft.|$|E
5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that <b>with</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly have expected to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, many colleges and school districts across Florida remained closed. President George W. Bush declared all of Florida a federal disaster area. Kennedy Space Center did not restore its complete work force until September 13 due to relief operations, as well as a lack of gasoline, ice, and water in the area. A total of 8000 members of the National Guard helped out with recovery efforts soon after the storm left the Florida peninsula. Residents in the areas of impact after the storm were under a boil water order, {{because of the lack of}} electricity to area water systems. Churches prepared meals for those without power and food themselves. Federal employees were granted excused absences if they helped <b>with</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> and the cleanup. Thousands of portable generators were sent to the state by Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement stores. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed blue tarpaulins on 41,556 damaged roofs statewide. Damage to the Florida citrus crop caused orange futures to rise four cents a pound due to Frances.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 2014, the admin of {{the page}} {{announced}} his retirement on Facebook.

The admin also announced that the pages Responsabilidad, Fortaleza, and Valor por la Huasteca would go under new management too. The new management would be composed of people who he deemed trustworthy given their long history of support or because they had suffered a loss {{as a result of the}} violence. In a closing statement, he bid farewell by thanking God for bringing happiness to his personal and professional life. In the comment section of the Facebook post, many people thanked the admin for his support.

5|$|Unidentified police sources {{alleged that}} Condit had {{admitted}} to {{an affair with}} Levy during an interview <b>with</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation {{and was surprised to}} find out that the lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor Connie Chung on the ABC News program Primetime Thursday. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media's coverage of the Levy case.|$|E
