500|$|Finally, from {{a purely}} {{linguistic}} point of view, {{there is the}} dichotomy that the IAU created between 'planet' and 'dwarf planet'. The term 'dwarf planet' arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet {{is a type of}} planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as not so being. By this formulation therefore, 'dwarf planet' and 'minor planet' are best considered compound nouns. Benjamin Zimmer of Language Log summarised the confusion: [...] "The fact that the IAU <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> think of dwarf planets as distinct from 'real' planets lumps the lexical item 'dwarf planet' in with such oddities as 'Welsh rabbit' (not really a rabbit) and 'Rocky Mountain oysters' (not really oysters)." [...] As Dava Sobel, the historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU's initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with National Public Radio, [...] "A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so it's a term no one can love, dwarf planet." [...] Mike Brown noted {{in an interview with the}} Smithsonian that, [...] "Most of the people in the dynamical camp really did not want the word [...] "dwarf planet," [...] but that was forced through by the pro-Pluto camp. So you're left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on an {{analysis}} of the results of more than 40 public opinion surveys taken during the period from 1989 through 2002; special attention is given to surveys taken during 2000 - 02.

Another two-fifths are moderately concerned; shifts in the opinions of this moderately concerned group would likely alter the future course of government policies.

INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND Medical student {{selection and}} performance outcomes have traditionally been based on academic merit. Medical schools now compete in a fierce global financial climate and are under pressure to produce graduates who can provide good returns on community investments. To date, no-one has explored what kind of doctors we are graduating; no-one has asked {{the question of what}} it is that makes a good doctor and the community's voice has been absent. The main author is currently undertaking a PhD study to explore this question from a stakeholder perspective. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES 1. Identify what we currently select for in medical schools here and abroad. 2. Explore conference participants' views on current methods of medical student selection. 3. Develop strategies to improve community engagement in defining the characteristics of a good doctor. ISSUES/QUESTIONS FOR EXPLORATION OR IDEAS FOR DISCUSSION Medical student selection will be explored in the following contexts: 1. What is the purpose of medical student selection? 2. Who has traditionally controlled this process? 3. Do current methods meet the needs of disadvantaged Australians? 4. Are medical student candidates educationally disadvantaged in an elitist system? 5. Is the community getting a good return on its investment? 6. Who should decide who 'the good doctor' is? 7. What do we think they might decide? 8. How do we improve the medical selection process? 9. What are consequences of poor selection and how do we avoid them?Griffith Health, School of MedicineNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Overview There are {{numerous}} {{studies in the}} current literature focusing on the intense emotions experienced by parents, following {{the birth of a}} preterm infant, (i. e., born prior to 37 weeks gestational age [GA]). Research findings have helped us understand the fear and anxiety they feel while attempting to navigate the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment. What happens in those early weeks and months at home after discharge, however, is surprisingly absent from the literature. It is well known that preterm infants are readmitted to the hospital during the first few months after discharge at a rate of 10 % - 35 %, for an average 4. 7 - 11. 7 day stay and a cost of approximately $ 376 million (Underwood, 2007; Escobar, et al., 2005). The most common reasons for readmission are respiratory, feeding and jaundice problems (Spicer, et al., 2008; Underwood, 2007; Escobar, et al., 2005; Brissaud, et al., 2005). What we don’t yet know is what transpired during those early days and weeks at home and how mothers established their day-to-day routines. This missing information could foster a better understanding of family needs and promote the development of strategies to share with mothers prior to discharge, with the result being healthier transitions for both mothers and infants and a possible reduction in the inflated readmission rates for this cohort. The purpose of this research was to help bridge the gaps in the literature on the topic of transitioning a preterm infant to home following NICU discharge. Eight mothers who met the criteria of having a preterm infant born between 24 and 34 weeks GA, admitted to a NICU for a week or more, and who had been discharged to home for 6 months or less, were purposefully chosen from a convenience sample. Each mother was interviewed and asked to describe those first few months at home, e. g., how she met her infant’s needs, what she learned, and how she learned it. Two follow up questions were included and asked the mother what she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>us</b> (HCPs) <b>to</b> know about her experience, and what she would say to other mothers whose infants were still in the NICU. Most mothers spoke at length of the fear they felt when bringing their infants home, and how inadequate they felt trying to provide care that had heretofore been provided by a team of specialists. They described the 2 difficulty and confusion associated with getting their infants to sleep in a quiet home environment until they thought to duplicate the noises of the NICU, and how the monitors, which all infants wore home from the NICU, were both friend and foe, alerting them to potential problems, but awakening the entire household in the process. Each mother also spoke of her determination to do whatever was necessary to ensure that her infant was not rehospitalized, and how thankful she was that her infant had made it to this point. Although each mother described a different approach to meeting the challenges associated with her infant, there was a consistency in the overall challenges each mother experienced. Most mothers wanted HCPs to know they were thankful for the part each had played in saving their infant’s life but they also wanted to impart their parental wisdom on the best ways to give information to a parent, the need for uniformity in what they called the “rules” of the NICU, and how a little encouragement from any HCP was sorely needed by most parents. These mothers were excited to be taking part in this study. They wanted to feel that something they saw, felt or did would make a difference for another mother with an infant in the NICU. Each thanked me for allowing them to share their experiences with me. The references for this document will appear {{at the end of each}} section...|$|R

5000|$|Explaining the {{inspiration}} behind the album, {{which is a}} deviation from previous releases that tended to celebrate his lyricism as a hip hop artist, he said, It has always been {{something that has been}} cultivated in me over the years, from a time when I became more and more aware of the context existing in today’s world, especially in Africa. You get to see a lot that is wrong with the state of affairs of our people with the mindset, our general lack of ownership and control. How many opportunities seem <b>to</b> miss <b>us</b> even though we are in the most resource blessed continent yet still poor? [...] His current offering is characterized by a heavy African influence and focuses less on braggadocio and more on content and messages. The name of the album is a reflective trip through the beautiful landscapes and variety that is Africa. According to Zeus the album title is a clever play on words: Usually when we say African time it means we are either late or things are not delivered on time hence we usually say, Hei African time! I think it is a very negative connotation and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> change it to make it more positive and say African time is our time. It is our time to start giving the world something instead of taking from the world. I feel Africa has given the world a lot of things. A lot of aspects of Africanism that find way to pop culture, whether it's the dashiki or the drum, have not always had us Africans at the forefront. Today international labels have more African print than African fashion houses. We need to start to own what is ours and take it out there and start saying it is our time to influence popular culture globally. [...] The 15-track album boasts heavyweight collaborations with renowned artists and producers including Tumi, Kwela Tebza, Mahotella Queens, Mzekezeke, Ross Jack, Nonku Phiri and Ammara Brown among others. Motswako artist Tebogo Mapine popularly known as Nomadic designed the album cover. [...] "I find him very understanding because he is a very proud African and an artist himself, so when I mentioned the album title he had a concept in mind," [...] Zeus said."When I read the book Capitalist Nigga years ago in my late teens, it really resonated with me and to this day I feel like it’s probably one of {{the inspiration}}al books that has formed my outlook on life. Therefore the inspiration of this album to me is Africanism and the biggest philosophy is how we do things. We see in other cultures, for example Chinese people, their business principles stem from their tradition. How come it seems as though there is no connection between what we were yesterday and what we are today? Obviously that leads to a concern of who we will we be tomorrow when we don’t have these identity cues." [...] The second single, [...] "Fast Five" [...] which also enjoyed airplay on local radio stations has kwasakwasa influence and when asked about the concept Zeus said, [...] "We need to understand that music is inspired by other music. I am a very big crossover artist; my track Imagination was dancehall fused and Dancing shoes is a house tune. I have never limited myself to just being a rapper. I consider myself as an artist. For me that kwasa sound is a very strong traditional rhythm and it does not matter where you are in Africa. It only makes sense to make sounds that our parents can also relate to hence bridging the gap between the young and old." ...|$|R
