50|$|The ACG has a {{research}} {{program that is}} intended to help researchers on their own scientific projects. The research program allows people to use the conservation area to study organisms and their habitat {{as long as they}} abide by the rules of protection. Any research project is <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> and at least 20 projects are started every year. There are two coordinators of the park who support and guide students, and researchers, on their individual projects. By working with researchers that study in Guanacaste, the people from the park gain new knowledge and scientific information in conservation efforts, as well as biodiversity, every year. A volunteer organization, known as Investigadores ACG (iACG), also helps individuals in their research process by providing online tools and information about the Conservation area. Other programs that {{are a part of the}} conservation area include the Fire Protection program and the Restoration and Forestry Program. The Fire Protection program works to protect the natural resources of the park, as well as stop intended fires on the protected areas. The purpose of the Restoration and Forestry program is to conserve different plant species and to reforest parts of the conservation area that have been burned or damaged by outside factors.|$|E

One of those developments has been a shift toward oufcomes evaluation, in an attempt to identify and measure program effects on client knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviors, or conditions. This shift has impacted virtually all not-for-profit organizations, who now need to demonstrate to donors, decision-makers, taxpayers, clients, and other stakeholders that a given program is achieving its intended goals and objectives. This focus on client change has been advocated by a host of individuals and organizations (see, e. g., Drucker, 1990; Hatry, et al., 1992; United Way of America, 1996). Schalock’s Outcome-Based Evaluation continues this shift by providing a primer on out-come evaluation, intended for both consumers and producers of program evaluations.

40|$|Community engaged {{learning}} (CEL) {{has been}} identified as a high impact educational practice that can have profound influence on learning and improve student engagement (Kuh, 2008). Despite <b>the</b> potential <b>to</b> provide a meaningful learning experience, CEL opportunities are not widespread at large research institutions, and most examples arise from optional co-curricular activities or small classes (Holander, 2011). Current realities of increasing class sizes and decreasing resources can make implementing CEL challenging. Creative thinking is required <b>to</b> modify <b>the</b> critical elements of successful CEL to suit broader educational needs. This paper provides a tangible model for CEL assignments that can be adapted to suit medium to large classes, with an honest discussion of the lessons learned in the process from student, faculty and community perspectives. Based on key concepts of reciprocity, shared decision-making and mutual benefit we designed a novel CEL assignment in a large 4 th year course (3 ̆e 100 students). Briefly, student teams researched one of five priority areas identified by Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health (WDGPH) to write an evidence-based literature review. Based on these findings, students worked with WDGPH experts to translate their research into practical recommendations and tools to advance WDGPH programming. An end-of-semester showcase was used to highlight these applied projects. Students identified real world relevance and <b>the</b> opportunity <b>to</b> be creative as the main advantages of the assignment. Surprisingly, community partners identified the opportunity for leadership and mentorship as an unintended but <b>welcomed</b> benefit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> From a faculty perspective, <b>the</b> time required <b>to</b> coordinate and grade the projects during the teaching semester was manageable although the quality of student projects varied significantly. Future offerings should consider strategies to provide more tailored feedback to all students and to encourage a balance of effort between the research and applied aspects of the CEL project...|$|R

40|$|Learning, Earning and Parenting (LEAP) is {{a policy}} {{directive}} under Ontario Works that outlines three specific components to ‘assist’ teenage parents complete their high school education and garner important employment and parenting skills while receiving social assistance. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Government of Ontario, the three components addressed in the directive include: first, Learning—involves offering particular benefits to teenage parents to facilitate their completion of high school. Financial supports are purportedly allocated to LEAP recipients to ‘enable’ them to attain their Ontario Secondary School Diploma. Second, Earning—focuses on the acquisition of employment skills through training courses and employment opportunities. Third, Parenting—requires the mandatory completion of thirty-five hours of parenting courses for teenage parents, allegedly to improve their parenting skills. LEAP is a program for all teenage parents {{between the ages of}} 16 - 17; <b>the</b> <b>program</b> is compulsory for all young parents receiving social assistance. Teenage parents between the ages of 18 - 21 are also <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> <b>program</b> voluntarily, if they have not yet completed high school and meet all of the required components of <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> <b>The</b> research conducted for the thesis was two-fold. The first section of the thesis explores the secondary literature resources pertaining <b>to</b> <b>the</b> evolution of welfare measures in Canada and teenage motherhood, including a review of the historical and moral regulation of women and unremitting existence of patriarchy in society. This section culminates with a policy critique and discussion of the health risks associated with teenage motherhood. The naturalistic and feminist paradigms were the two lenses through which the literature was collected, analyzed and interpreted. The second section involves a qualitative and descriptive study, incorporating the findings and analysis of three sets of focus groups with LEAP participants in Pembroke, Ottawa and Toronto. Recommendations follow highlighting what actions might be taken <b>to</b> improve both <b>the</b> Ontario Works and LEAP programs respectively. It is hoped that the findings generated in the thesis will promote changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>program(s)</b> <b>to</b> better <b>the</b> conditions for women and their children struggling <b>to</b> survive in <b>the</b> present challenging economy.

40|$|On {{behalf of}} the nursing faculty and staff, I would like <b>to</b> <b>welcome</b> you <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nursing <b>program.</b> Nursing is an {{exciting}} career. Nursing is thinking work. It’s not about doing a series of tasks; it’s about identifying and solving problems using scientific evidence to support our actions. This {{is a time of}} tremendous change in healthcare. With passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans will have access to healthcare who previously only sought care {{in the throes of a}} major health crisis. The lack of affordable health insurance put the focus on paying for serious illness rather than on prevention of illness and maintenance and improvement of health. The Act changes this focus. It also acknowledges the pivotal role that nurses play in helping people prevent illness and stay well. There have been several studies published recently that call for significant change in the preparation of the “Nurse of the Future. ” Improving patient outcomes is a function of a well-educated nursing workforce. A national effort is underway <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> percentage of nurses with bachelor’s degrees, in what has become known as the “ 80 / 20 ” target. This refers to meeting a goal of 80 % of nurses with bachelor’s degrees or higher by the year 2020. What this means for you is that you need to plan to enter a BSN program designed specifically for RNs after completing this program. There are many of them, some are very good, others not so much. We can advise you about what to look for in an RN to BSN completion program...|$|R
