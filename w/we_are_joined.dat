60|$|Yet {{this and}} nothing else is what is implied in all such talk of the {{aeroplane}} annihilating distinctions as well as distances; and an international aviation abolishing nationalities. This {{and nothing else}} was really implied in one speaker's prediction that such aviation will almost necessitate an Anglo-American friendship. Incidentally, I may remark, {{it is not a}} true suggestion even in the practical and materialistic sense; and the speaker's phrase refuted the speaker's argument. He said that international relations must be more friendly when men can get from England to America in a day. Well, men can already get from England to Germany in a day; and the result was a mutual invitation of which the formalities lasted for five years. Men could get from the coast of England to the coast of France very quickly, through nearly all the ages during which those two coasts were bristling with arms against each other. They could get there very quickly when Nelson went down by that Burford Inn to embark for Trafalgar; they could get there very quickly when Napoleon sat in his tent in that camp at Boulogne that filled England with alarums of invasion. Are these the amiable and pacific relations which will unite England and America, when Englishmen can get to America in a day? The shortening of the distance seems quite as likely, so far as that argument goes, to facilitate that endless guerilla warfare which raged across the narrow seas in the Middle Ages; when French invaders carried away the bells of Rye, and the men of those flats of East Sussex gloriously pursued and recovered them. I do not know whether American privateers, landing at Liverpool, would carry away a few of the more elegant factory chimneys as a substitute for the superstitious symbols of the past. I know not if the English, on ripe reflection, would essay with any enthusiasm to get them back. But anyhow it is anything but self-evident that people cannot fight each other because they are near to each other; and if it were true, there would never have been any such thing as border warfare in the world. As a fact, border warfare has often been the one sort of warfare which it was most difficult to bring under control. And our own traditional position in face of this new logic is somewhat disconcerting. We have always supposed ourselves safer because we were insular and therefore isolated. We have been congratulating ourselves for centuries on having enjoyed peace because we were cut off from our neighbours. And now they are telling us that we shall only enjoy peace when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> up with our neighbours. We have pitied the poor nations with frontiers, because a frontier only produces fighting; and now we are trusting to a frontier as the only thing that will produce friendship. But, as a matter of fact, and for a far deeper and more spiritual reason, a frontier will not produce friendship. Only friendliness produces friendship. And we must look far deeper into the soul of man for the thing that produces friendliness.|$|E

5000|$|In the Anglican Communion, All Souls' Day {{is known}} liturgically as the Commemoration of All Faithful Departed, {{and is an}} {{optional}} observance seen as [...] "an extension of All Saints' Day", the latter of which marks {{the second day of}} Allhallowtide. Historically and at present, several Anglican churches are dedicated to All Souls. During the English Reformation, the observance of All Souls' Day lapsed, although a new Anglican theological understanding of the day has [...] "led to a widespread acceptance of this commemoration among Anglicans". Patricia Bays, with regard to the Anglican view of All Souls' Day, wrote that: All Souls Day (November 2) is a time when we particularly remember those who have died. The prayers appointed for that day remind us that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> with the Communion of Saints, that great group of Christians who have finished their earthly life and with who we share the hope of resurrection from the dead. As such, Anglican parishes [...] "now commemorate all the faithful departed {{in the context of the}} All Saints' Day celebration", in keeping with this fresh perspective. Contributing to the revival was the need [...] "to help Anglicans mourn the deaths of millions of soldiers in World War I". Members of the Guild of All Souls, an Anglican devotional society founded in 1873, [...] "are encouraged to pray for the dying and the dead, to participate in a requiem of All Souls' Day and say a Litany of the Faithful Departed at least once a month".|$|E
5000|$|To them, baptism is the {{entrance}} into both the covenant and the [...] church. As {{a result of}} the covenantal union between the act of baptism and the work of the Holy Spirit, Federal Vision advocates affirm a form of baptismal regeneration that they argue is a return to Calvin's thought and the teachings of the historically Reformed. [...] Obviously, for Reformed Christians, the ultimate test of any doctrine is its fidelity to the whole counsel of God, revealed in the pages of Scripture. What does the Bible actually teach about the efficacy of baptism? ...In baptism, We are united (or married) to the crucified, buried, and risen Christ (Rom. 6:1ff), though we can be cut off (or divorced) from him if we are unfaithful (Rom. 11:17ff; cf. Jn. 15:1ff), We are forgiven (Acts 2:38, 22:16; cf. the Nicene Creed), We receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38), We are cleansed (Eph. 5:26), We are regenerated and renewed (Titus 3:5), We are buried and resurrected with Christ (Col. 2:11-12), We are circumcised in heart (Col. 2:11-12), <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> to the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13), We are clothed with Christ (Gal. 3:27), We are justified and sanctified (1 Cor. 6:11), We are saved (1 Pt. 3:20-21), We are ordained as priests with access to the heavenly sanctuary (Heb. 10:19-22).Of course, the ultimate proof of baptism's efficacy rests in the baptism of Jesus himself. Here, we have the ultimate paradigm for understanding God's work in baptism. Jesus received the Spirit in fullness at his baptism, and was declared to be the beloved Son of the Father. With appropriate qualifications, this is what God does in our baptisms as well: He pours out his Spirit upon us and declares us to be his dearly loved children. In context, none of these passages teach baptism automatically guarantees salvation. But they do teach that God does a great work in baptism, a work that may be considered the beginnings of salvation for those God has elected to persevere to the end.|$|E

As our discipline takes hold, we believe it is important to compare and contrast the different experiences from around the world. We have invited twenty experts in the fields of neurosurgery, neurophysiology, neuro-anesthesiology, and interventional neuro-radiology to give us a comprehensive update on the latest achievements in intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. This kind of multidisciplinary and international approach should not only validate and enhance our understanding of intraoperative neurophysiology, but it should also help us achieve our ultimate goal: prevention of intraoperative neurological injury. ...|$|E

40|$|While we {{appreciate}} a lively argument, Dr Berger {{seems to have}} misinterpreted our work [1] and its purpose. Our article {{did not address the}} choice of cluster versus individual as the unit of analysis in cluster randomized trials; thus, we find that many of his points are not apropos. Beyond this objection, we beg to differ from his opinion that it is somehow wrong to regard a cluster as made up of individu-als and study clustering from this vantage point. Of course, a cluster is composed of individuals, and if we can improve science by studying and understanding them, it behooves us to do so. Judging by the recent review of Eldridge et al. [2], <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> in this view by a large community of researchers who find ben-efit in studying the correlation between responses of individuals within clusters. The purpose of our work was to propose a new parametrization for intracluster dependence that has better properties and interpretation than the intraclass correlation coefficient. Any reparametri-zation of a model or its parameters is helpful if it simplifies the interpretation of the model or its parameters for a broad audience. The statistical lit-erature is replete with examples of such important contributions. We believe our work fits into this category, and additionally, our new reparametriza-tion facilitates elicitation of prior information on the parameters needed to construct a better design. We appreciate Dr Berger’s comments but respectfully disagree with his viewpoint. We main-tain our unique and valuable contribution to the literature. Reference...|$|E
