In 1887 their numbers increased by another 102 with The Hundred missionaries, and in 1888, Taylor brought 14 missionaries from the United States. In the US he travelled and spoke at many places, including the Niagara Bible Conference where he befriended Cyrus Scofield and later Taylor filled the pulpit of Dwight Lyman Moody as a guest in Chicago. Moody and Scofield thereafter actively supported the work of the China Inland Mission of North America.|$|E

This, for me, is a message of greatest importance. It is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered the great temptation of our times: the pretense that after the 'Big Bang' God retired from history.|$|E

But I think that's half the picture. It has as much as to do with the survival of temperament. There are few people still <b>working</b> <b>now</b> that started when I did. Not many people have the temperament to deal with that." ...|$|E

[...] Commenting on the TTP militant outfit behind the bombing, Sanaullah added: [...] "We aren't really sure if it is a new group of terrorists. It is the same old organisation <b>working</b> <b>now</b> from Afghanistan, probably since the North and South Waziristans have already been cleared." ...|$|E

6000|$|The final {{attainment}} {{of this great}} synthesis, like the social deliquescence and reconstruction {{dealt with in the}} earlier of these anticipations, has an air of being a process independent of any collective or conscious will in man, as being the expression of a greater Will; it is <b>working</b> <b>now,</b> and may work out to its end vastly, and yet at times almost imperceptibly, as some huge secular movement in Nature, the raising of a continent, the crumbling of a mountain-chain, goes on to its appointed culmination.
