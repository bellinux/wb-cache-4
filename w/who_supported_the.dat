5|$|Bradley {{was inaugurated}} December 10, 1895. During his term, Republicans {{controlled}} the Kentucky House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled the Kentucky Senate. This led to infighting {{between the two}} houses of the General Assembly and between the General Assembly and the governor. On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Democrats and another <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Republicans.|$|E

5|$|When {{it came to}} politics, Vogt was a {{conservative}} with many liberal opinions. He disagreed with Francis Hagerup, <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Union between Sweden and Norway. In his political articles, he championed the Riksmål written standard and the policies of Michelsen's Cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} like Surendranath Sen, Mohibbul Hasan, N. K. Sinha, and B. Sheik Ali, who have analysed Tipu's religious policies on Christians, conclude {{that he was}} not a religious bigot. They argue that forcible conversions to Islam were done purely for political, not religious reasons. Forced conversions were carried out as a punishment for Christians <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> British against their own native suzerain. The conversions came after many warnings by Tippu.|$|E
5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli {{found himself}} in {{political}} isolation. The triumvirate and the newspaper La Gazeta blamed him for the defeat at Huaqui, and sought punishment as a deterrent. His former supporters were divided between those <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> ideas of the Triumvirate and those {{no longer able to}} help. Castelli suffered from tongue cancer during the long trial, which made it progressively more difficult for him to speak. He died on October 12, 1812, while the trial was still underway.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> mediumship of Home {{stated that}} he was unusual in that he had four {{different}} types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits audibly speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (ability to see things {{that are out of}} view); and physical medium (moving objects at a distance, levitation, etc., which was the type of mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E

5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E
5|$|Hearings in {{both the}} U.S. Senate and the House {{continued}} through the summer of 1973 on both new bills and amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act. On July 13, an amendment calling for more study of the project—the Mondale-Bayh Amendment—was defeated. This was followed by another victory for pipeline proponents when an amendment by Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel {{was passed by the}} Senate. The amendment declared that the pipeline project fulfilled all aspects of NEPA and modified the Mineral Leasing Act to allow the larger right-of-way for the Alaska pipeline. Upon reconsideration, the vote was tied at 49–49 and required the vote of vice president Spiro Agnew, <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> amendment. A similar amendment was passed in the House on August 2.|$|E
5|$|However, Ober Ost, the German {{military}} administration, {{rejected the}} changes. On January 26, {{in compliance with}} the earlier request, the two versions of the notification were approved, but they did not include the changes of January 8. The texts were prepared based on the Act of December 11. These concessions to the Germans created tensions among the council members. Four members – Mykolas Biržiška, Steponas Kairys, Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis – resigned from the Council in protest. Chairman Antanas Smetona, <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Act of December 11, stepped down. Jonas Basanavičius, who would later be called the patriarch of independence, was elected chairman.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Kogălniceanu began {{printing}} {{the magazine}} Steaua Dunării in Iași: a unionist mouthpiece, it enlisted support from Alecsandri and his România Literară. Kogălniceanu encouraged Nicolae Ionescu {{to issue the}} magazine L'Étoile de Danube in Brussels, as a French-language version of Steaua Dunării which would also serve to popularize Partida Naționalăs views. By that time, he was in correspondence with Jean Henri Abdolonyme Ubicini, a French essayist and traveler who had played a minor part in the Wallachian uprising, and <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Romanian cause in his native country.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{may have}} {{remained}} in Rome, because he was present when the newly elected Pope Martin I convened the Lateran Council of 649 at the Lateran Basilica in Rome. The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may {{have been written by}} Maximus. It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from Constans II, <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.|$|E
5|$|Other {{theories}} include André Chastagnol's minimalist {{opinion that}} the author was a pagan <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the History are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven {{into the fabric of}} a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.|$|E

5|$|Questions of {{allegiance}} immediately arose amongst indigenous rulers. Central Javanese principalities, for example, immediately declared themselves Republican, while many raja ('rulers') {{of the outer}} islands, who had been enriched from their support of the Dutch, were less enthusiastic. Such reluctance among many outer islands was sharpened by the radical, non-aristocratic, and sometimes Islamic nature of the Java-centric Republican leadership. Support did, however, come from South Sulawesi (including the King of Bone, who still recalled battles against the Dutch from early in the century), and from Makassarese and Bugis raja, <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Republican Governor of Jakarta, a Menadonese Christian. Many Balinese raja accepted Republican authority.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{occupiers}} chiefly came in {{the form}} of helping Allied airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this effort; for instance the Comet line which evacuated an estimated 700 Allied servicemen to Gibraltar. The Comet Line had a series of safe houses throughout Belgium. Allied airmen were given civilian clothes and were frequently moved from house to house, staying with Belgian families <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> resistance. The resistance would aid the airmen by giving them false papers and guiding them to either neutral or Allied occupied territory.|$|E
5|$|The 1910s were a {{productive}} time for Du Bois. In 1911 {{he attended the}} First Universal Races Congress in London and he published his first novel, The Quest of the Silver Fleece. Two years later, Du Bois wrote, produced, and directed a pageant for the stage, The Star of Ethiopia. In 1915, Du Bois published The Negro, a general history of black Africans, and {{the first of its}} kind in English. The book rebutted claims of African inferiority, and would come to serve as the basis of much Afrocentric historiography in the 20th century. The Negro predicted unity and solidarity for colored people around the world, and it influenced many <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Pan-African movement.|$|E
