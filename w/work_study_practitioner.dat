40|$|Ergonomics is a cross {{discipline}} {{between the}} human sciences and engineering. It {{is concerned with}} the design of man/machine systems, using the characteristics of the operator as the frame of reference. The state of our technology is now such that almost any purposeful activity involves a man and a machine operating together. Thus the basic working or fighting unit is the man/machine system and the efficiency of the system is dependent on the weakest link. Until recently this has usually been within the machine, but we have reached the stage when it may now be in the man, or between the man and the machine. It thus becomes necessary for the engineering designer to build his "hardware" to suit the human operator as well as to meet the need which the system is required to fulfil. To achieve this objective the designer requires data and advice on human performance. The provision of this information is a difficult task because of the complexity and variability of human performance. There are, at present, few laws of human behaviour which can take quantitative forms, and to obtain numerical information it is often necessary to resort to direct manipulation of the relevant variables. Fortunately, there is a considerable body of knowledge and experience on the measurement of human performance which has been developed by psychologists, physiologists, anatomists and <b>work</b> <b>study</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Thus, ergonomics is based on statistically controlled experimentation and, in common with other experimental sciences, it can only be taught effectively by a combination of lectures and laboratory periods. The objective of the Cranfield Ergonomics Laboratory is to provide these facilities so that students can acquire a knowledge of experimental techniques and of the variables which they are manipulating. The students may be specialists in this field or may be engineers from other fields who wish to acquire some knowledge of the subject. The formal experiments require at least two students, one to act as a subject and the other as observer. Each experiment takes two or three hours to perform, and a similar period is required to read appropriate reference material and write a report...|$|R

40|$|The social {{cultural}} {{climate of}} the 19702 ̆ 7 s and 19802 ̆ 7 s has allowed for the emergent popularity of many contemporary alternative approaches to healing in the United States. Many alternative practitioners develop personal approaches to healing that may not reflect any institutionally legitimized or ideological system of health. They rely on an experience of knowing that has been generated from within to sanction their abilities. This experience the author calls personal legitimation. The way practitioners authenticate and operationalize their knowing to themselves and apply it in their practice is the legitimation process. ^ This study examines how contemporary alternative healing practitioners utilize the process of legitimation, or 2 ̆ 2 how knowing is done 2 ̆ 2. The social and historical context {{for the development of}} the epistemological basis for holistic, new age healing practices is explored. Distinctions in the legitimation process between conventional biomedical practitioners and contemporary alternative healing practitioners are drawn. ^ The study considers a select number of cases that demonstrate ways in which legitimation is practiced by alternative healing practitioners. Examples are drawn from a review of the literature and field work cases that best demonstrate the variety of personal legitimation strategies utilized. Two extended case <b>studies</b> of <b>practitioners,</b> Thomas J. Marsteller, homeopath, and Marion Brodsky, Body Synergist are included. Case material was derived by using an heuristic research methodology, recorded interviews, and participant observation. Results of this study demonstrate that contemporary alternative healing practitioners function as educators, assisting clients to reframe their experience of 2 ̆ 2 dis-ease 2 ̆ 2 into larger contexts of meaning. Practitioners used alternative legitimation strategies, including a highly developed ability on the part of practitioners to employ a variety of intuitive strategies. Personal legitimation through the development of self trust was the major component that directed these practitioners in their <b>work.</b> <b>Practitioners</b> <b>studied</b> acknowledged that a spiritual source ultimately created and directed the outcomes of their interventions with clients. ...|$|R
