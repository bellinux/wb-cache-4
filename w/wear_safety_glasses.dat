2500|$|Safety {{glasses are}} worn {{to protect the}} eyes in {{different}} situations. [...] They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to <b>wear</b> <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to <b>wear</b> <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also safety glasses for welding, which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full sized welding helmet is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called [...] "flash goggles", because they provide protection from welding flash. Nylon frames are usually used for protection eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular glasses, safety glasses often include protection beside the eyes {{as well as in}} front of the eyes.|$|E

The shooter apparently retrieved a handgun, shot the supervisor, then went back into the factory and shot five co-workers before turning the gun on himself. Subsequent reports indicate that Taylor had reprimanded Higdon twice before the shooting, once for talking on his cell phone too much and for not <b>wearing</b> <b>safety</b> <b>glasses,</b> then later for an altercation with co-worker Joshua Hinojosa at a convenience store {{across the street from the}} factory.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{technique}} {{is dependent upon}} the material used and good application technique will increase retention of sealants which means sealants can last longer on the teeth. Generally, each quadrant is treated separately by using four-handed technique with an assistant and to follow the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations. The patients should <b>wear</b> <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> for protection from chemicals and curing light. Once the patient is prepared, {{the surface of the}} tooth must be cleaned to allow maximum contact of the etch and the dental sealant with the enamel surface. A rubber dam may be used to prevent saliva from contaminating the intended site to be sealed, although often these are not used, especially for younger children. Moisture control is more of an issue with resin based sealants than with glass ionomer sealants. The surface is cleaned and dried.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine how much progress U. S. dental schools have made in providing eye protec-tion during restorative (adult operative and fixed prosthodontic) procedures since a 1979 survey. A seven-question survey was placed at a website, and fifty-five different U. S. dental schools were asked to complete the survey. Thirty-one schools responded (56 percent). Eighty-four percent of schools had safety glasses available for patients, but only 77 percent required usage during restorative procedures. Similarly, while 87 percent of schools required dental students working in restorative clinics to <b>wear</b> <b>safety</b> <b>glasses,</b> just 73 percent enforced the policy. Additionally, 84 percent provided blue light protection on curing lights and required students to wear eye protection while doing lab procedures. Compared to the 1979 survey, considerable progress has been made over the last twenty-seven years in protecting dental school patients and students from ocular injuries. Because one would hope to have 100 percent compliance on this issue, there is room for improvement in promoting patient eye safety and teaching good habits to dental students...|$|E
40|$|Chief Complaint: 50 {{year old}} man with {{penetrating}} globe injury OD History of Present Illness: A 50 year old Caucasian man sustained an injury to the right eye hours before presentation to the University of Iowa emergency department. He stated that he was sitting outside on his lawn while his son was mowing the grass. Suddenly, a hard object hit the patientâ€™s right eye at high velocity, knocking {{him out of his}} chair. He felt immediate pain that was 10 / 10 in severity and experienced loss of vision. The patient was not <b>wearing</b> <b>safety</b> <b>glasses.</b> He was seen at a local emergency room and then transferred to the University of Iowa for definitive care. Past Ocular History: He denied previous trauma or ocular surgery. He had no prior refractive error and wore over-the-counter readers only. He had no history of contact lens use. Past Medical History: Hypertension, cancer, hernia repair. He was currently being worked up for diabetes. He had stepped on a nail last year and received a Tetanus booster at that time. Medications: Tylenol Â® (acetaminophen) as needed. Family History: Unknown. Social History: The patient was a retired truck-driver. He reported smoking 3 - 4 cigarettes a day, occasional alcohol use, and a history of cocaine abuse. He denied intravenous drug use and current illicit drug use.

50|$|String {{trimmers}} can {{be dangerous}} tools {{due to the fact}} that they can cause debris, including rocks and stones, to go flying in several directions. For this reason, it is typical for the person who is using a string trimmer to <b>wear</b> either <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> or a visor to protect the face and particularly the eyes as a stone in the eye could cause a person to be blinded for life. This, however, does not offer any protection for passersby, or nearby people who may also be vulnerable to being hit by debris from a string trimmer. In addition to the safety risk posed to individual people, the debris from string trimmer also has the potential to cause damage to cars and buildings, with a particularly high risk of breaking glass on windows.|$|R
40|$|Ocular {{trauma is}} one of the most {{important}} preventable causes of visual impairment. The National Eye Trauma System was developed to provide optimal clinical care for severe ocular injuries, to foster research on eye injury, and to increase awareness of ocular trauma as a public health problem. From 1985 through 1991, the National Eye Trauma System Registry collected data on 2, 939 cases of penetrating eye injury reported by ophthalmologists at 48 collaborating eye trauma centers in 28 States and Washington, DC. Eighty-three percent of the cases involved men; the median age of the patients was 27 years, ranging from 1 to 92 years of age. Seventy-seven percent of the injuries were unintentional, 22 percent were the result of assault, and 1 percent were self-inflicted. In 62 percent of the cases studied, the injured person's initial best corrected visual acuity in the injured eye was the ability to perceive hand motion, or worse. The settings in which the injuries occurred included the home (28 percent), the worksite (21 percent), at recreation (11 percent), and in transportation (8 percent). At the time of the injury, 1. 5 percent of the injured persons were <b>wearing</b> <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> and 2. 9 percent were wearing nonsafety glasses. There was evidence of definite or possible alcohol use by at least 24 percent of the injured persons and illicit drug use by 8 percent. The most frequent types of tissue damage included corneal or scleral laceration, traumatic cataract, intraocular foreign body, vitreous hemorrhage, and prolapse of intraocular tissue.

30|$|Patients were {{randomly}} {{divided into two}} groups using a randomization software, where a blocked randomization was used to ascertain equal distribution of patients into each group (parallel-group study) (Vickers 2006). One group (12 patients) was irradiated with diode laser and the other group was treated with topical steroids. In the laser group, normal protective measures were taken, where patients and personnel <b>wore</b> laser <b>safety</b> <b>glasses.</b> OLP lesions were irradiated with a 970 -nm diode laser (SIRO Laser Advance class III b, SIRONA, Germany) with a 2 -W irradiation power in a continuous non-contact mode. The laser beam was delivered using a fiber-optic tip with a 320 -Î¼m diameter with defocused mode directed at the lesions plus 0.5 -cm peri-lesional tissues with a slight overlapping in order to evenly distribute energy covering all the lesional and peri-lesional tissues until blanching of the area was observed (Cafaro et al. 2014). Diode laser was calibrated to an output power of 3 Â W, frequency of 30 Â Hz, energy of 180 Â J, and time interval of 8 Â min divided into four sessions, 2 Â min each with 1 Â min rest in between to allow for tissue relaxation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{distinct}} body {{of literature}} supports the association between clinical postures of the dental practitioner and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMD). Several aids or devices have been tested to improve clinical posture {{in the interest of}} decreasing WRMD. The use of magnification lenses while performing dental procedures may increase the quality of work and decrease the likelihood of musculoskeletal problems. To date, only anecdotal and personal opinions had existed regarding the benefits of using magnification lenses, and no empirical evidence had authenticated the contention that use of magnification lenses exerts a positive change in operator posture. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the effect magnification lenses had on the posture of dental hygiene students. Using a randomized crossover design, researchers videotaped nineteen senior dental hygiene students performing an intra-oral procedure with and without the use of magnification lenses. The tapes were then evaluated by a panel of five dental hygiene educators calibrated in the use of Bransonâ€™s Posture Assessment Instrument (PAI). Results of a paired t-test indicate that the posture of the students while wearing magnification lenses was more acceptable (p=. 019) than when <b>wearing</b> traditional <b>safety</b> <b>glasses.</b> Results of this study indicate a quantifiable change in acceptability o...|$|R
