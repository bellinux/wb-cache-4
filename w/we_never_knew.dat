500|$|Christian Williams of Billboard {{magazine}} {{wrote that}} the pop sound of [...] "Halo" [...] should {{take it to the}} top of the charts. He added that comparisons could be made to Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] (2007), but concluded that [...] "Halo" [...] "hangs high on its own merits". Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly described [...] "Halo" [...] as [...] "an absolutely glorious and perfectly produced track", which had the potential to be as commercially successful as [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003) and [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] (2007). Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle wrote that it was an immediate standout on I Am... Sasha Fierce. Praising the [...] "big and wide" [...] melodies of [...] "Halo", Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club commented that Beyoncé has [...] "a real flair for grandeur". Jennifer Cady of E! Online {{wrote that the}} song could be included on a romantic mixtape, and James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the [...] "tear-jerking power" [...] of [...] "Halo" [...] reveals [...] "sides of Beyoncé <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> existed". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork wrote that Beyoncé's vocal delivery was [...] "strident and exposed", reminiscent of Céline Dion's style.|$|E
500|$|... "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{was widely}} {{acclaimed}} by contemporary music critics, who applauded Beyoncé's vocal performance {{and called the}} song her best yet. Billboard magazine's critic Chuck Taylor wrote that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] is Beyoncé's [...] "most affecting offering" [...] since [...] "Listen" [...] (2006). He praised her vocals as [...] "breathtaking, exquisitely emotive, mournful, and mature" [...] and added that the song [...] "exudes the fragrance of a Grammy Award". According to Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times, [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] is Beyoncé's Streisand moment and [...] "a tender, fairly simple ballad that [...] uses to prove she's a great vocal actress". Powers concluded, [...] "This isn't just another breakup song; it's an elegy for female empowerment, Beyoncé's admission {{that no amount of}} money, fame or skill can solve the basic inequity between her man's heart and her own." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] could become as commercially successful as [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] because of its radio-friendly appeal. James Montgomery of MTV News complimented the [...] "tear-jerking power" [...] of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] and noted that it reveals [...] "sides of Beyoncé <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> existed".|$|E
500|$|Comparing {{the video}} with works by Stevie Wonder, Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "compared to the {{over-the-top}} sensory overload of 'Countdown, ' the 'Love On Top' clip {{is very simple}} and straightforward, with the singer performing with backup singers and dancers in a spare room. Still, she changes wardrobe with every key change as the song reaches its euphoric climax." [...] Similarly, Leah Collins of Dose magazine wrote, [...] "New jack swing dance moves and costume changes are pretty much {{the focus of this}} one. [...] Still, Beyonce reveals a talent <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> she had: the ability to switch costumes every time she switches keys. (This, it turns out, is a good thing. That pantsless African dictator look in the first scene? Maybe we're the only ones, but we're not really feeling Idi Amin-chic this season.)" [...] Georgette Cline of The Boombox found similarities between the video for [...] "Love On Top" [...] and the earlier videos that Beyoncé made with Destiny's Child while Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post called the video fancy and an [...] "obvious homage to New Edition's 'If It Isn’t Love.'" [...] A more mixed review was given by Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine who wrote that [...] "The video will do nothing to silence Beyoncé plagiarism or baby bump conspiracy theorists; the first half borrows from an old New Edition video, and the entire thing was clearly filmed before her bump began to show." [...] However, she added, [...] "Still, Vulture salutes any artistic undertaking that requires a costume change with every key change." [...] The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards and in the category for Best Female Video at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. It won Best Dance Performance at the 2012 Soul Train Music Awards.|$|E

500|$|MTV's Deepa Lakshmin {{predicted}} that Kim [...] "will {{live on in}} our hearts forever". UGO.com ranked Kim 59th on the website's list of the 75 [...] "hottest" [...] animated characters, hailing her as the [...] "Disney Channel queen". In 2015, MTV published an article entitled [...] "13 Reasons Kim Possible is the Only Role Model You Need", citing the character's [...] "great friends, a great boyfriend and a kick-ass career". In Oh My Disney's article [...] "Why We Want To Be Kim Possible", the character was hailed as [...] "the best" [...] because [...] "Who else could be a straight-A student, captain of the cheerleading team, AND protect the world from bad guys? The answer is no one, because she’s Kim Poss-ib-le." [...] The same website also included the character in its article [...] "Disney Redheads: An Appreciation Post". Kim is also regarded as a fashion trendsetter, with Charmaine Simmons of Bustle crediting the character with popularizing [...] "all of the stylish looks that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> we'd {{be in love with}} over 10 years later", including crop tops, cargo pants and bodysuits. Also writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller penned, [...] "Her commitment to action is notable, even if she never wears a shirt longer than mid-lung, and she fights crime in her cheerleader uniform when she needs to." [...] Freymiller concluded, [...] "In the early 2000s, as Limited Too dominated the tween fashion scene, it was refreshing to see a girl decked out in functional black and army green attire." [...] The character's Kimmunicator ringtone is commonly associated with the series, and is also frequently imitated by fans. The Kimmunicator's inception preceded the creation of smartphones by several years. Upon Apple's release of the Apple Watch, several critics drew similarities between the real-life device and the Kimmunicator, especially when Kim's device was downsized to a wristwatch during the final season.|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{release in}} 2009, Aa Dekhen Zara {{failed to do}} well at the box office. Rohit Shetty's [...] {{performed}} well and her comic role was appreciated by fans. Later that year, Basu surprised everybody with Rituparno Ghosh's Bengali film, Shob Charitro Kalponik. [...] "I love saris and I'm wearing {{a lot of them}} in Ritu's film," [...] she said. She gave up her glamorous look and was praised by critics for her performance. Critic Subhash K. Jha spoke high of her. He said, [...] "Bipasha [...] pulls out all stops to deliver her career's best performance. Her moments of anguish before and after her screen-husband's death are expressed in tones of cathartic conviction that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> existed within Bipasha." [...] He also compared her with the multiple-award-winning actress, Shabana Azmi, commenting that Basu's anguished portrayal of bereavement can be equalled by Azmi only.|$|E
2500|$|Griffith also once hit {{all four}} balls (although Ford mistakenly wrote about six) of an over {{right out of}} the Hastings ground in 1864, when playing for a United Eleven. Standing at the ground's northern-most wicket, Griffith bludgeoned each of the {{deliveries}} into exactly the same spot, clean over the fence to the Goods Station Road tavern on the right-hand side of the ground, each of them counting as [...] "lost" [...] sixes. The unfortunate bowler was slow bowler Farmer Bennett of Kent—but his mood was in stark contrast to that of the crowd, recorded by the Hastings & St Leonards Observer to have been [...] "in a state of high excitement at such an unprecedented circumstance. General and oft-repeated applause showed the warmth of feeling that existed." [...] A hat was passed around {{at the end of the}} game and a large collection taken for Griffith's benefit. As the game was not a first-class match, his feat did not count as a record, but, as Pycroft recalled, [...] "This <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> equalled".|$|E

2500|$|Wanting {{to return}} to their sound from that {{particular}} era, after narrowing down the selection from twelve finished songs to ten that they wanted to record, the band sought to work with James [...] "Jimbo" [...] Barton, who had mixed and engineered the band's hit albums Operation: Mindcrime and Empire, and whom they had last worked with in the mid-90s, when he produced their album Promised Land. Deciding to work with Barton was [...] "a no-brainer", according to La Torre, and Rockenfield has said that Barton was really the only choice. Barton had stayed in contact with Wilton, who would often fill him in on {{what was going on in}} the band. Queensrÿche invited him to see them perform at the House of Blues in West Hollywood on November 24, 2012, where he reportedly said that the band [...] "had something really special here and he wanted to be a part of it." [...] In the studio in Seattle, he told the band: [...] "Look guys, let's just start where we left off, back in 1995". Rockenfield looks back on the collaboration, saying: [...] "Working with Jimbo [...] and the addition of Todd has revitalized the band in ways <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> until we heard the final results" [...] and: [...] "We had the best time, and he was such a great, perfect match to make this record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alex Lai of Contactmusic {{likewise}} noted that, [...] "Those who {{are familiar}} with the earlier work of NFG are in for a shock. Beginning in more relaxed fashion than expected, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is a grand love ballad, serious in tone but retaining the group's ability to produce a catchy hook. Far from being a one-off experiment, these are actually the characteristics to the album and like Blink-182 before going on hiatus, New Found Glory have allowed their music to mature." [...] Jack Foley of Indie London, gave the album four stars out of five and described it as [...] "utterly engaging". While mentioning standout tracks, he added, [...] "The low-key [...] "Make Your Move" [...] drops some beautifully cascading riffs, while, the chiming piano chords that open [...] "It’s Not Your Fault" [...] give way into an effortlessly inspiring song." [...] People magazine declared that Coming Home is [...] "their best album yet", while Dan Aquilante of The New York Post awarded a score of three stars out of four and wrote that the album is [...] "a smart, stylistic mix rich in vocal harmonies, it's driven by guitar and piano breaks. The notion of getting back to family, friends and better days connects the 13 tracks." [...] British rock publication Kerrang! awarded the album a [...] "great" [...] four K! rating. Rae Alexandra opined that Coming Home [...] "displays a new level of sensitivity and subtlety; a new take on harmonies and melodies." [...] He noted that while the album isn't as immediate as previous material, it will [...] "move you far more deeply in the long run. It's hopeful; learned; masterfully executed. It's everything New Found Glory have been leading to all this time; and it's everything <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> they had in them. Absolutely stunning." [...] Florida-based newspaper, The Palm Beach Post were also highly favorable and graded the album as an [...] "A-". They wrote, [...] "It's all written in beautifully vulnerable, snarkless, shout-it-out-loud terms, with an unself-conscious joy in the lyrics, the do-do-dos and the muted hand claps that find a sweet, genuine current of emotion without sacrificing edge. Pundik's delivery is never cloying, ironic or dumb. Underscored by drummer Cyrus Bolooki's strong beat, the songs are like a pre-made mix tape about {{the ups and downs of}} making yourself honestly vulnerable to another human being. Bravo." [...] Rock Sound journalist Tim Newbound rated the album at nine out of ten and particularly praised the band's progression. Writing that, [...] "New Found Glory have come of age. Their punchy punk-pop styling of old may have temporarily waned, but their knack of writing inducing melodies amid sincere delivery has only intensified. Pundik's nasal-edged vocals have now blossomed into a fuller pitch, perfectly complimenting his band's more tuneful and matured musicianship. Top notch." ...|$|E
