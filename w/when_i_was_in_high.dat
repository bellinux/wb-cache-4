She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent {{felt that she was}} too young. Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings.

And now these days they put on the same show...and there’s {{a sense of humor}} about the whole thing....there’s even a strange gentleness to the music to me now, even though {{at the time it was}} as edgy as you get. It’s celebrating immaturity and youth" [...] in a similar way to the character of Tony Stark.

30|$|It can {{be noticed}} that the values of m(i) are {{influenced}} by the position of i in the topology. In particular, nodes that are close to the periphery will have larger values compared to nodes that <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the center of the topology. This can be explained noting that <b>when</b> <b>i</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the periphery of the network, its average distance from the other nodes <b>is</b> larger than <b>when</b> <b>i</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the center, so m(i) is higher on the periphery. It is also easy to see that in this simple topology, if we compute t(i) excluding the packets that <b>are</b> generated by <b>i</b> itself, t(i) <b>is</b> constant. This would make the ratio t(i)/m(i) decrease for nodes close to the extreme ends of the network. In the figure, instead, we plot t(i) including also the packets generated by node i, which increases the values of t(i) on the periphery. This takes into account that in our scenario, each node is a gateway for its own subnet, so the first hop <b>is</b> counted <b>in</b> its own subnet. Even in this case, t(i)/m(i) is still larger for nodes that <b>are</b> central <b>in</b> the topology.|$|R
