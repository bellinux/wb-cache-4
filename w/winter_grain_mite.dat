40|$|The <b>winter</b> <b>grain</b> <b>mite</b> Penthaleus major (Dugés) is now {{occasionally}} observed as {{a summer}} pest in the cold temperate zone, especially in subarctic hayfields. The life cycle of the mite was studied from pitfall trappings in 19 hayfields at 10 farms in Eyjafjordur in northern Iceland throughout the summers of 1996 - 1998. Eggs, larval stage, three nymphal stages and the female adult stage were observed. Peak occur-rences of the nymph stages and young adults were registered in mid-June. Two annual generations were observed, a summer generation and a winter generation, which goes through winter hibernation and resumes activity in early spring when the snow melts. A model for the progression of stages and sizes throughout the year in a subarctic environment is presented...|$|E

NIRS calibrations were developed for <b>winter</b> <b>grain</b> samples collected over three years in the Western Cape region of South Africa. <b>Winter</b> <b>grains</b> used in the study include oats, barley, triticale and wheat. Calibrations were also developed for maize samples collected throughout South Africa. <b>Winter</b> <b>grain</b> samples were analysed for ash, dry matter (DM), crude protein content (CP), fat content, acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), lysine and methionine. The digestible energy (DE) content of <b>winter</b> <b>grain</b> samples was determined by the mobile nylon bag technique on pigs. Maize samples were analysed for ash, DM, CP, IVOMD and TDN (total digestible nutrients). Standard errors of prediction (SEP) and multiple correlation coefficients (r) for the different <b>winter</b> <b>grain</b> constituents were respectively; ash (0. 22 %; 0. 87), DM (0. 67 % 0. 68), CP (0. 60 %; 0. 93); fat (0. 19 %; 0. 99), ADF (0. 88 %; 0. 98), NDF (2. 13 %; 0. 97), IVOMD (2. 06 %; 0. 97), DE (0. 76 %; 0. 91), lysine (0. 04 %; 0. 93) and methionine (0. 01 %; 0. 90).

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{investigations}} {{were made to}} find the changes in different physical and chemical parameters of three wheat varieties (Lasani- 08, Faisalabad- 08 and Sehar- 06) infested by varying levels of stored <b>grain</b> <b>mites</b> (Rhizoglyphus tritici). Results showed that significant variations were observed in physico-chemical characteristics, mineral profile, amino acid profile and fatty acid profile of three wheat varieties. Mite population was significantly increased and reaches upto 7513 mites in Lasani- 08 after six months in the treatment initially treated with twenty pairs of mite. Maximum decrease in the thousand kernel weight was observed in Lasani- 08 {{out of all the}} three varieties after six months of storage which was from 38. 50 g in control to 26. 07 g in treatment with maximum number of mites. Wet and dry gluten were also found decreasing with increasing infestation of stored <b>grain</b> <b>mites</b> in three wheat varieties. Wet gluten ranged from 22. 65 % in T 3 after six months to 31. 74 % in T 4 after one month in Sehar- 06, while dry gluten ranged from 6. 17 % in T 3 after six months to 9. 92 % in T 4 after one month in Sehar- 06. Moisture content was found increasing with increasing mite population after different storage periods in three varieties. Maximum moisture was observed in Lasain- 08 after six months of storage in the treatment initially treated with twenty pairs of mites that was 18. 13 %. Crude protein and crude fat were found decreasing in three varieties and ranged from 10. 03 % after six months in T 3 of Faisalabad- 08 to 14. 43 % after one month in T 4 of Sehar- 06 and 0. 52 % after six months in T 3 of Faisalabad- 08 to 1. 38 % after one month in T 4 of Faisalabad- 08, respectively. Fiber and ash content showed a significant and positive correlation with mite population. Fiber ranged from 1. 03 % after one month in T 4 of Lasani- 08 to 4. 30 % after six months in T 3 of Sehar- 06. Ash ranged from 1. 23 % after three and six months in T 4 of Lasani- 08 to 3. 60 % after six months in T 3 of Sehar- 06. Maximum decrease in NFE of Sehar- 06 was observed after six months in the treatment having maximum mite population (T 3) that was 62. 12 % from 65. 64 % in control. Flour quality parameters such as falling number, water absorption, dough development time, dough stability, mixing tolerance index and softening of dough showed significant and negative correlation with mite population. Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Copper (Cu), Calcium (Ca), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na), Magnesium (Mg) and Zinc (Zn) in different wheat varieties were found increasing with increasing mite population after one, three and six months of storage, although this increase was just a proportion increase due to the depletion of other contents in grains. Different amino acids were found decreasing with increasing mite population in three wheat varieties after different storage periods and exhibited negative correlation with mite population. Different fatty acids were found decreasing with increasing mites infestation. After different storage periods Capric, Myristic, Palmitic and Palmitoleic ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 18 %, 0. 07 to 0. 19 %, 12. 25 to 16. 25 % and 0. 15 to 0. 40 %, respectively while Stearic, Oleic, Linoleic and Linolenic ranged from 0. 21 to 0. 62 %, 12. 15 to 15. 90 %, 55. 33 to 59. 82 % and 4. 80 to 7. 50 %, respectively under different treatments. Conclusively, it can be inferred that stored <b>grain</b> <b>mites</b> infestation deteriorate the quality of stored wheat...|$|R
