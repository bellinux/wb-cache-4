However, the [...] "Darien II" [...] brought now 160 legal refugees who could pay full price, to Palestine. The background of this company are not known. When she came back to the port of Sulina again, the refugees should on December 2 leave there and were embarked in Sabac on trains. Then came the transfer of the shipping company, the exit must on the one hand be avoided because of the advanced season, on the other hand because of the uncertain political conditions; only a transfer of the highest authorities could be swayed. However, the Yugoslav Prime Minister rejected the responsibility for the transport. Spitzer, who was busy since their arrival, to continually find new ways and means for further transport of the group of refugees, organized in mid-December a special train to Prahovo, to send them from there by Romanian trains to Sulina. However, when the train came with Greek flagging, he thought it too great a risk, that he would not go, as he wrote to the Mossad agent Ruth Klüger: For this <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> responsible institution. ...

40|$|This {{paper has}} three primary goals.

Second, through this discussion on foundational concepts, we hope {{to make it clear}} why people interested in collaborative public management and administration should care about open source and open source-like collaboration. After this argument is made, we provide a very condensed summary of where we are to date on open source collaboration research. The goal of that research is to learn about the factors that lead to successful or abandoned collaborations in the open source domain, in part to help us understand how “open source-like” collaborations can be deployed in areas outside of software. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> cover.

More precisely, they concentrate on the development of income inequality and poverty and those many factors that cause changes in income distribution within and between households. The essays also include the era of strong economic and structural turns in Finland, the 1990 s.
