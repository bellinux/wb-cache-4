5|$|The {{outbreak}} was {{the third}} instance of H5N1 detected in the United Kingdom. The first outbreak occurred in October 2005 among exotic birds imported from Taiwan and South America at a privately owned quarantine facility in Essex, England. The second instance involved a dead <b>whooper</b> <b>swan</b> found to have the virus in Cellardyke, Scotland in April 2006. A corresponding incidence {{on a farm in}} south-eastern Hungary was confirmed by the European Commission on 25 January 2007.|$|E
5|$|The bird life is {{dominated}} by species from the Siberian taiga, which are otherwise not common in Norway. Species inhabiting the park include Siberian jay, pine grosbeak, Bohemian waxwing, common crane and <b>whooper</b> <b>swan.</b> Several species of sparrow and charadriiformes are also common. There are also three species of Falconiformes—rough-legged buzzard, merlin and osprey, the latter which can be seen hunting over Ellenvatn and Ødevatn. The great grey owl and northern hawk-owl are common in years with good access to rodents.|$|E

25|$|Lough Leane, and {{the other}} lakes to a lesser extent, support {{wintering}} birds that travel south from higher latitudes. These species include redwing, fieldfare, golden plover and waterfowl such as teal, goldeneye, wigeon, pochard and <b>whooper</b> <b>swan.</b> The park's native bird populations are augmented by migrant species in both winter and summer. A small flock of Greenland white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons flavirostris) from the world population of approximately 12,000 migrates to winter on boglands in the Killarney Valley within the park. The numbers of this bird that stay in the park are currently low, at less than twenty individuals. This population {{is important because it}} is the most southerly in Ireland {{and one of the few}} remaining populations remaining that feed entirely on bogland, and whose habitat almost entirely lies within a protected area.|$|E
25|$|The trachea {{is an area}} of dead space: the oxygen-poor air it {{contains}} at the end of exhalation is the first air to re-enter the posterior air sacs and lungs. In comparison to the mammalian respiratory tract, the dead space volume in a bird is, on average, 4.5times greater than it is in mammals of the same size. Birds with long necks will inevitably have long tracheae, and must therefore take deeper breaths than mammals do to make allowances for their greater dead space volumes. In some birds (e.g. the <b>whooper</b> <b>swan,</b> Cygnus cygnus, the white spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia, the whooping crane, Grus americana, and the helmeted curassow, Pauxi pauxi) the trachea, which some cranes can be 1.5m long, is coiled back and forth within the body, drastically increasing the dead space ventilation. The purpose of this extraordinary feature is unknown.|$|E
500|$|Large {{numbers of}} bird species are {{resident}} or passage migrants here, including many ducks, geese and waders. [...] The {{wide range of}} species is mainly due to Brandon Marsh {{being one of the}} few extensive areas of water in the area (accounting for such local rarities as osprey and <b>whooper</b> <b>swan)</b> together with the existence of habitats such as reedbed and woodland in close proximity. 148 different species were recorded during 2009 aloneincluding one new record, a vagrant woodchat shrike which was the first recorded in Warwickshireand 66 species bred at the site. These figures have been assisted by a nest box scheme; in 2008 there were 49 occupied nest boxes which produced 270 fledged young, and by 2009 these numbers had increased to 65 and 352 respectively, including two owl species, barn owl and tawny owl.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} in natural populations of four species of swans (Cygnus bewickii, Cygnus olor, Cygnus buccinator and Cygnus cygnus) {{has been investigated}} by examining minisatellite loci using human DNA fingerprinting probes pSPT 19. 6 and pSPT 18. 15. It {{has been found that}} swan minisatellites are highly variable. However, the degree of variation depends on the population structure and species. Bewick's Swans at Slimbridge have the highest degree of minisatellite variation, <b>Whooper</b> <b>Swans</b> at Caerlaverock come second, and then Mute Swans, and Trumpeter Swans in Montana. Comparative study of DNA fingerprints among populations and among species suggested that swan minisatellites are subject to specific as well as population differentiation, although the function of minisatellites remains an unsolved mystery. Hypervariable minisatellites of swans that are detected by DNA fingerprinting are stably inherited as codominant markers. DNA fingerprinting has been used to study mating behaviour of Mute and <b>Whooper</b> <b>Swans</b> in the wild The results showed that the <b>Whooper</b> <b>swans</b> were almost strictly monogamous and Mute Swans exhibited an adaptable reproductive system. A genomic library from Cygnus olor was constructed and dozens of minisatellites were isolated.
