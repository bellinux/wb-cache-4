50|$|As {{professional}} audio {{evolved from}} analog magnetic tape to digital media, engineers adapted magnetic tape technology to digital recording, producing digital reel-to-reel magnetic tape machines. Before large hard disks became economical {{enough to make}} hard disk recorders viable, studio digital recording meant recording on digital tape. Mitsubishi's ProDigi and Sony's Digital Audio Stationary Head (DASH) were the primary digital reel-to-reel formats in use in recording studios from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s. Nagra introduced digital reel-to-reel tape recorders for use in film sound recording. Digital reel-to-reel tape eliminated all the traditional quality limitations of analog tape, including background noise (hiss), high frequency roll-off, wow and flutter, pitch error, nonlinearity, print-through, and degeneration with copying, but the tape media was even more expensive than professional analog open reel tape, and the linear nature of tape still placed restrictions on access, and <b>winding</b> <b>time</b> to find a particular spot was still a significant drawback. Also, while the quality of digital tape did not progressively degrade with use of the tape, the physical sliding of the tape over the heads and guides meant that the tape still did wear, and eventually that wear would lead to digital errors and permanent loss of quality if the tape was not copied before reaching that point. Still, digital reel-to-reel tape represented a significant advance in audio recording technology, and most who could afford to record using digital tape generally did.|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} and overall cost of {{brushless direct current}} (BLDC) motors can be significantly improved by implementation of an effective sensorless commutation control method. A recently proposed technique termed the 'equal inductance method' offers commutation control and starting performance equal to that obtained when using Hall sensors. However, the method applies to nominally symmetrical machines with high enough phase <b>winding</b> <b>time</b> constants. This study is about sensorless commutation of a class of motors which is characterised by significant asymmetry and relatively low-phase <b>winding</b> <b>time</b> constants. The motors in question are axial flux machines with ironless stators that may be wound or made up of printed circuits. The basic reason for the asymmetry is that the three-stator phases are stacked with {{each one of them}} located at a different axial distance from the rotor. The low-phase time constant is due to the ironless nature of the stator. The focus is on the printed circuit version of the motor. A new sensorless commutation technique has been developed, which is effectively a generalisation of the originally proposed equal inductance method. The theoretical basis behind the technique and practical results demonstrating its effectiveness are presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Robotized {{filament}} winding technology involves the deposition of a tape {{according to a}} planned robot trajectory and its polymerisation in a furnace for thermoset resin matrix. In this way {{it is possible to}} wind asymmetric or complex parts. The winding trajectory is a critical aspect of the robotized {{filament winding}} process, since the mechanical performances and the <b>winding</b> <b>time</b> of the manufac- tured composite part change according to winding trajectory geometry. This work presents an original method to optimize and to compare alternative winding trajectories for robotized filament winding. The proposed method uses a set of geometric parameters that characterize the winding process and, in the same time, that are easy to measure. Therefore, the implemented method is quick and user friendly. The designed method has been implemented and tested on two different trajectories that have been planned to wind a same composite part...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work we {{investigated}} {{the existence of}} low-dimensional deterministic chaos in <b>wind</b> <b>time</b> series. The time series {{were obtained from the}} New Anchialos (Greece) Air Base Measurement station. In a first place we used the raw data without any noise filtering. Characteristic times were extracted using power spectrum and average mutual information function. The estimation of invariant measures, such as the correlation dimension and Lyapunov exponents indicate the possible existence of a low-dimensional attractor. After noise removal {{with the use of the}} local projective method the analysis indicates in a more clear way the existence of a low-dimensional attractor. In addition, the null hypothesis was tested for the dynamical characteristics of the <b>wind</b> <b>time</b> series by using the surrogate data test and the corresponding results provide significant evidence for the existence of low-dimensional chaotic dynamics underlying the <b>wind</b> <b>time</b> series.

40|$|The {{decrease}} in Goldstone mode relaxation frequency with applied dc electric field in a deformed helix {{ferroelectric liquid crystal}} (DHFLC) is observed at room temperature. This decrement in relaxation frequency is observed at very low dc electric fields (below the threshold voltage, i. e. around 2 V). This behaviour is {{compared with that of}} conventional ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs) where the relaxation frequency increases with the applied dc electric field. It is observed that a low dc electric field is insufficient to unwind the helix completely due to the higher rotational viscosity of the DHFLC material. Moreover, the DHFLC molecules take more time in the winding (Smectic C–Smectic C) process, compared to the FLC molecules, which take comparatively less helix <b>winding</b> <b>time</b> because of their low viscosity. The {{decrease in}} relaxation frequency in DHFLCs with bias has been attributed to the critical balancing amongst the electric torque, elastic constraints and rotational viscosity in a certain regime of the electric field not exceeding the threshold field...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{progresses}} of {{the aviation}} industry toward the More Electric Aircraft {{have increased the}} demand for high performance Electro-Mechanical Actuators. In this context, extensive research is being conducted {{for the design of}} high torque density electrical machines able to meet the high reliability standards required. For low-rate duty applications (e. g. landing gear extension, retraction and steering; flight control surfaces), this can be achieved also by exploiting the characteristic that the motor does not reach a thermal equilibrium. In this work, the principal aim is to investigate the main limits in the design of low-rate duty, high torque density electrical machines and to propose methods for the improvement of the performance and reliability of such machines. This is achieved through detailed analysis of the motor design issues, of its thermal performance, {{as well as of the}} most critical ageing phenomena during operations. A structured design procedure for surface mounted permanent magnet machines is presented. A novel thermal model which features high accuracy and low computational cost is presented. A novel winding insulation lifetime consumption model which relates the <b>winding</b> <b>time</b> to failure to its temperature profile during operations is proposed. As vessel to address the thesis’ objectives, a fault tolerant electrical machine, which is an integral part of an actuator for the extension and retraction of a helicopter landing gear, is designed, built and experimentally tested. The tests are aimed at validating the design procedure and the thermal model accuracy. A series of accelerated ageing tests is conducted on samples of the motor windings, which serve to analyse the insulation degradation processes under different stress levels and to validate the proposed lifetime consumption model...|$|E

Numerous design issues are addressed and several issues are raised about the potential improvements a PM generation system can offer. A proposed 16 MW PM generation module design is presented along with a detailed design methodology. Eighty different machines and power conversion modules are sized, designed, and analyzed with a final design selected. Specifically, sizing and detailed machine design and analysis is performed examining the effects of numerous parameters including number of phases, number of poles, magnetic geometry, machine dimensions, and material types. Analytical models are developed to study rotor losses caused by stator <b>winding</b> <b>time</b> and space harmonics and slot space harmonics. Power electronics and conversion modules to connect the high-speed generator to a DC distribution system are designed and analyzed. In-depth simulation of the eighty complete systems is performed using the software programs MATLAB (Version 12. 0, Mathworks) and PSIM (Version 6. 0, Powersim, Inc.). The 16 MW permanent magnet generation module, consisting of the generator and associated power electronics, provides an excellent alternative to traditional wound rotor synchronous machines.

40|$|Structural {{responses}} and power output of a wind turbine are strongly {{affected by the}} wind field acting on the wind turbine. Knowledge about the wind field and its variations is essential not only for designing, but also for cost-efficiently managing wind turbines. Wind field monitoring collects and stores <b>wind</b> field <b>time</b> series data. Over time the amount of data can be overwhelming. Furthermore, the correlation among the wind field statistical features is difficult to capture. Here, we explore the use of online machine learning to study the characteristics of wind fields, while effectively condensing the amount of monitoring data. In particular, incremental Gaussian mixture models (IGMM) are constructed to represent the joint probability density functions for wind field features, whose parameters are continuously updated as new data set is collected.

Generally, there are physical models [3], auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models [4, 5], Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods [6], spatial models [7], Kalman filter techniques [8], Grey model [9], and volatility model represented by GARCH model [10] and hybrid approaches [11].
