5|$|DuMont {{programs}} were by necessity low-budget affairs, {{and the network}} received relatively few awards from the TV industry. Most awards during the 1950s went to NBC and CBS, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to out-spend other companies and draw on their extensive history of radio broadcasting in the relatively new television medium. DuMont, however, did win a number of awards during its years of operation.|$|E

5|$|A {{new wave}} of Armenian {{immigrants}} moved in the late 1940s, including Soviet Armenian prisoners of war <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> {{to make their way}} westward after being freed from Nazi camps. The Displaced Persons Act of 1948 allowed people displaced during the World War II to immigrate to the US. From 1944 to 1952, 4,739 Armenians migrated to the US, many with the help of George Mardikian's American National Committee to Aid Homeless Armenians (ANCHA).|$|E
5|$|During this period, Roman {{soldiers}} seem to {{have been}} modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves are believed to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.|$|E
5|$|Former {{students}} from Prague, including Constantine Menges, and Czech {{refugees from the}} crisis, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for human rights, religious liberty, {{freedom of speech and}} political asylum for Czech political prisoners and dissidents. Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and Red Army's continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of Communism in Moscow and Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|In October 1918, the regiment's {{part in the}} war now over; they {{returned}} to the Jordan Valley. However many men were now struck down with malaria. In the next few days those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> returned to Richon-le-Zion, where they established their camp. By November the regiment had eleven officers and 331 other ranks in hospital; twenty-two of those died of the disease. Only two men from the regiment had not been infected in any way.|$|E
5|$|In early 1813, Ernest was {{involved}} in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown {{to be one of}} three trustees <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to dictate who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to interfere in a Commons election, there was considerable controversy, and the Government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France. Though he saw no action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Saari {{initially}} {{opened fire}} {{on a group of}} students taking a business studies exam, and entered at least one other classroom. According to the three students <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to escape from the exam room (there were roughly 20 students taking the exam), Saari had approached his victims individually before shooting them. It was also said that he was revelling in the situation and was acting very aggressively. Saari encountered little resistance, and the massacre was concluded relatively quickly. He then covered the classroom in a flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, and set the room alight.|$|E

5|$|Texian troops confiscated the {{provisions}} they {{found at the}} fort. Although they found 300muskets, {{most of them were}} broken and unable to be repaired. Dimmitt hired two gunsmiths <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to bring the remaining weapons into service. The food, clothing, blankets, and other provisions were valued at US$10,000. The new quartermaster at the fort, John J. Linn, reported that 175barrels of flour were confiscated, along with a large supply of sugar, coffee, whiskey, and rum. For the next three months, {{the provisions}} were parceled out among companies in the Texian Army. The Texians also gained control of several cannons.|$|E
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
5|$|Before the Beatles {{achieved}} nationwide {{success in}} Britain, Epstein had permitted a company (run by his cousins and initially catering to fan club members), to produce Beatles' sweaters for 30 shillings (£1.50) and badges for 6 pence (6d) (2½p). It sold 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as the group's popularity grew. When Beatlemania swept the UK in November 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies desperate {{to use the}} Beatles' name on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and other merchandise. Epstein refused to allow the Beatles to endorse any product directly, but through NEMS Enterprises he granted discretionary licences to companies <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to produce quality products at a fair price, even though many companies were already selling products without a licence.|$|E

5|$|February saw the issuing of {{equipment}} and the commencement of training, however, this was punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi. A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the training of the battalion, as the unit was short of men <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers {{because the majority of}} personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, men for these roles had to be trained from scratch. The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, when the men were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was declared on active service. After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940. The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks.|$|E
5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because {{he had grown up}} in New Jersey, where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. To help make the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they brought back to the animation studio. At one point in the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers wanted them to be actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to provide them.|$|E
