The marquessate of Grey had become extinct on her mother's death in 1797 and when the Grey title was revived in favour of her daughter the style [...] "de Grey" [...] was used to distinguish it from the earldom of Grey which had been created in 1806; the Grey family was extremely distantly related to the Earl Grey).
