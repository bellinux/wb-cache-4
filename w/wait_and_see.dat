5|$|When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” {{whether or}} not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> attitude, and look what {{happened}} to him. Now we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear {{at the end of the}} show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks in, and says in a deep voice (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka. Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?”.|$|E

The statistics were much different among Māori, with 40% of Māori saying the police had over-reacted. The sample size was 750 people.|$|E

25|$|In {{general as}} {{we see in the}} graph below, high gas prices are {{typically}} associated to low storage periods. Usually when prices are high during the early months of the refill season (April–October), many users of storage adopt a <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> attitude. They limit their gas intake in anticipation that the prices will drop before the heating season begins (November–March). However, when that decrease does not occur, they are forced to buy natural gas at high prices. This is particularly true for Local Distribution and other operators who rely on storage to meet the seasonal demand for their customers. On the other hand, other storage users, who use storage as a marketing tool (hedging or speculating) will hold off storing a lot of gas when the prices are high.|$|E

On his first night there, Henry sneaks out of his attic bedroom to go to the bathroom. Instead, he discovers that the door is closed and the light is on. He <b>waits</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> a short man emerge from the bathroom and enter Grandfather's bedroom, a room that has been locked since Grandfather died two years previously.|$|R
25|$|Still {{trailing}} 3–0 {{and having}} only one hit {{to show for}} their outing so far, the New York bats came alive {{in the bottom of}} the sixth against Hurst. After recording the first out, pinch hitter Lee Mazzilli and Mookie Wilson recorded back to back hits and Tim Teufel drew a walk to load the bases. Keith Hernandez singled to drive in Mazzilli and Wilson, and Gary Carter followed with a liner to right that Evans dove to try to catch but could not come up with. Pinch runner Wally Backman, who came in to run for Teufel, scored the tying run but Hernandez, who had to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> if the ball was going to be caught by Evans, got a late jump and was thrown out as Evans was able to relay the throw to Spike Owen. Hernandez got into an argument with right field umpire Dale Ford, claiming that his delay in ruling on Evans' play caused him to wait too long before advancing. With two outs, Hurst faced Darryl Strawberry and retired him.|$|E

The door was left open by producers if Havers wanted to reprise the role of Lewis again in the future.|$|E

500|$|David Calvert-Smith, for the prosecution, {{alleged that}} the detectives' {{supposedly}} contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews. During the fifth, when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar, the notes show him saying: [...] "Those kids will never go to court. You <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> No one else will talk to you. You can't keep me away from them." [...] Silcott denied ever having said these words.|$|E
500|$|In The Flash episode, Caitlin and Harry {{create a}} drug called Velocity 6 to make Barry faster against Zoom. Kreisberg commented that [...] "It's {{safe to say}} that there'll be a few more {{iterations}} of that formula" [...] but viewers will have to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how everything plays out and the effects on those who use it. Teddy Sears who's character Jay Garrick uses the drug, which temporarily restores his speed said while his character is not fixated on restoring his speed, Velocity 6 presents an interesting fix that will tempt him due to his [...] "haunting memories" [...] of his previous life with powers.|$|E
500|$|Last Exile {{has been}} likened to Hayao Miyazaki's classic work Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind {{and the early}} steampunk novel trilogy A Nomad of the Time Streams. It {{received}} numerous praises for its artwork and production, placing {{it as one of}} Gonzo's best work. By integrating music and sounds of a European theme, the soundtrack contributed to the series' unique flavor. Anime News Network rated the series as [...] "a must-have for all anime fans." [...] However, the complex storyline tested viewers' patience because [...] "mysteries pile upon one another before the answers start spilling forth in the second half [...]" [...] Despite this complaint, Last Exiles action sequences and cliffhangers compelled viewers to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> these mysteries resolved.|$|E

500|$|Maria Theresa {{found herself}} in a {{difficult}} situation. She did not know enough about [...] matters of state and she {{was unaware of the}} weakness of her father's ministers. She decided to rely on her father's advice to retain his councillors and defer to her husband, whom she considered to be more experienced, on other matters. Both decisions, though natural, later gave cause for regret. Ten years later, Maria Theresa recalled in her Political Testament the circumstances under which she had ascended: [...] "I found myself without money, without credit, without army, without experience and knowledge of my own and finally, also without any counsel because each one of them at first wanted to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how things would develop." ...|$|E
500|$|The notes {{show him}} asking: [...] "Who told you that?" [...] When the detectives {{said they had}} witnesses, he {{reportedly}} said: [...] "They are only kids.

Those kids will never go to court. You <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> No one else will talk to you. You can't keep me away from them."

500|$|In the Kingdom of Holland, the British {{launched}} the Walcheren Campaign {{to open up}} a second front in the war and to relieve the pressure on the Austrians. The British army only landed at Walcheren on 30 July, by which point the Austrians had already been defeated. The Walcheren Campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed [...] "Walcheren Fever". Over 4000 British troops were lost in a bungled campaign, and the rest withdrew in December 1809. The main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the French and the Austrians. Emperor Francis wanted to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how the British performed in their theater before entering into negotiations with Napoleon. Once it became apparent that the British were going nowhere, the Austrians agreed to peace talks.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Lincoln, {{who had a}} close {{rapport with}} Seward, Johnson kept his own counsel, and {{generally}} did {{not take advantage of}} Seward's political advice as Congress prepared to meet in December 1865. Johnson had issued proclamations allowing for the southern states to reform their state governments and hold elections; they mostly elected men who had served as prewar or wartime leaders. Seward advised Johnson to state, in his first annual message to Congress, that southern states meet three conditions for readmission to the Union: repeal of secession, repudiation of the war debt incurred by the rebel governments, and ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. [...] Johnson, hoping to appeal to both Republicans and Democrats, did not take the suggestion. Congress did not seat southerners, but appointed a joint committee of both houses to make recommendations on the issue. [...] Johnson opposed the committee; Seward was prepared to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
500|$|In October 2016, in {{response}} to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with [...] "2016 is not over yet". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return {{by the end of the}} year: [...] "Those words did come out of my mouth, didn't they? [...] Just <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> what happens." [...] Three days later, Reznor announced an extended play entitled Not the Actual Events, along with reissues of Broken, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, with subsequent reissues of With Teeth, Year Zero, and The Slip being released later in 2017. Also announced was The Fragile: Deviations 1, which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. Not the Actual Events was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the oral}} argument, the Chief Justice {{assigned}} Justice John Paul Stevens {{to write the}} majority opinion and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. asked Justice Thurgood Marshall to write the minority or dissenting opinion, based on the initial count of the justices' views. [...] Since Justice Potter Stewart {{did not participate in}} the case, it would take a 5-3 vote to overturn the decision of the Circuit Court. [...] Stevens circulated a memorandum stating that his decision would be to invalidate the tax - Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice William Rehnquist immediately stated they would join his opinion. [...] Justice Byron White stated that he would <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> what the dissent said, and then indicated he would join the dissent in part. [...] It also appeared that Justice Harry Blackmun was also going to write a separate dissent, but he also stated that he would wait to see Marshall's opinion. [...] At this point, the tribe had the votes to win on a 4-4 vote, but the Court was close to being adjourned for the summer recess. [...] On July 3, 1981, the Court notified the parties to reargue the case on November 4, 1981.|$|E
