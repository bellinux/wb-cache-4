5|$|When {{a key to}} {{a room at the}} Marina View Hotel is {{delivered}} inside a jar of blood to the Homicide Department, Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) and Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) visit the hotel, where they find a room completely covered in blood. Dexter is sent in first to investigate, but seeing the blood-covered room brings back a repressed memory from his childhood— Dexter at the age of three years sitting in a pool of blood—and he collapses and runs from the room. The forensics team surmises that the blood in the hotel room came from at least five different bodies, although none <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Since there were only one set of footprints in the room, they assume that the victims were killed elsewhere and their blood spread around the room by the killer. Debra suggests that the Ice Truck Killer, who had five bloodless victims, may have been responsible.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with her and walking away.|$|E
500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston. The episode was inspired by an event that happened when Shiban and his future wife were visiting her father in the hospital. According to Shiban, he was very near death and kept looking around the room, {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> When his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he kept looking around the room. Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might be able to look through the cracks [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it just seemed right".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Jayson Rodriguez for MTV News, da Don explained how he conceptualized the song, saying [...] "I came from a Jerry Bruckheimer meeting after seeing the movie, and they were telling us all the music they needed for all the scenes and the characters. So that night I went to the studio and I was telling Chris about (the meeting). And he was like, 'Let's get on it.' It was crazy, because Jerry Bruckheimer's dream {{was to have a}} song from Rihanna (for the movie), and I delivered Rihanna and Chris Brown in 24 hours. So they were like, 'Wow, that's crazy. He continued to explain how he, Rihanna and Brown developed the song in the recording studio, saying [...] "When her, Chris and myself <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> it's fun. That's when the music isn't work at all. It's all freestyle. Chris comes up with an idea; I come up with one. Rihanna will weigh in. And we build." [...] The song leaked on January 6, 2009. Their version of the song was excluded from the soundtrack, in favor of a version performed by the American girl group The Pussycat Dolls.|$|E
2500|$|Following the leaking of {{a mobile}} phone footage of Saddam Hussein's execution, {{along with the}} {{detention}} on 3 January 2007, of a guard under the Justice Ministry headed by a Sunni Iraqi minister Hashim Abderrahman al-Shibli, suspicions have arisen that the ministry may have intended to inflame sectarian tensions. In an interview with La República on 19 January 2007, Muqtada al-Sadr said {{that the people who}} <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> during execution were [...] "people paid to discredit him" [...] and the purpose of the unofficial video was to [...] "make Muqtadá look like the real enemy of the Sunnis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her defence {{argued that}} there was no {{forensic}} evidence that the rifle was fired in the interrogation room. They noted the nine government witnesses offered conflicting accounts of how many people <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> where they were positioned and how many shots were fired. It said that her handbag contents were not credible as evidence because they were sloppily handled. According to Iranian PressTV, Carlo Rosati, an FBI firearms expert witness, doubted whether the M-4 rifle was ever fired at the crime scene; an FBI agent testified that Siddiqui's fingerprints were not found on the rifle. The prosecution argued that it was not unusual to fail to get fingerprints off a gun. [...] "This is a crime that was committed in a war zone, a chaotic and uncontrolled environment 6,000 miles away from here." [...] Gul's testimony appeared, according to the defence, to differ from that given by Snyder with regard to whether Siddiqui was standing or on her knees as she fired the rifle. When Siddiqui testified, she admitted trying to escape, but said she had not taken the rifle or fired any shots. She said had been [...] "tortured in secret prisons" [...] before her arrest by a [...] "group of people pretending to be Americans, doing bad things in America's name." ...|$|E
