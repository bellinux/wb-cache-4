5|$|On 5 August 1945, Tibbets {{formally}} {{named his}} B-29 Enola Gay after his mother. Enola Gay had been personally selected by him {{while it was}} still on the assembly line at the Glenn L. Martin Company plant in Bellevue, Nebraska. The regularly assigned aircraft commander, Robert A. Lewis, was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> aircraft on the morning of August 6 to see the aircraft he considered his painted with the now-famous nose art. Lewis would fly the mission as Tibbets's co-pilot.|$|E
5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fight in prime {{condition}} and with aggression, determination and desire. The {{first two rounds}} started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur {{in the third and}} silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E

5|$|This {{incident}} arose after Earp {{learned that}} one of his prize horses, stolen more than a year before, was in the possession of Ike Clanton and his brother Billy. Earp and Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Behan, who was riding in a wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton. Accounts differ as to what happened next. Earp later testified that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Clanton ranch, Billy Clanton gave up the horse even before being presented with ownership papers. According to Behan's testimony, however, Earp had told the Clantons that Behan {{was on his way to}} arrest them for horse theft. After the incident, which embarrassed both the Clantons and Behan, Behan testified that he did not want to work with Earp and chose Woods instead.|$|E
5|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{many of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Red Dog Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, {{was killed in a}} motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a flatbed truck carrying a lumber crane approached. The truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either {{the back of the truck}} or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle. The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing his internal organs. Though he was alive <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.|$|E

5|$|Nelson wrote dispatches to the Admiralty and oversaw {{temporary}} {{repairs to}} the Vanguard, before sailing to Naples {{where he was}} met with enthusiastic celebrations. The King of Naples, in company with the Hamiltons, greeted him in person <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> port and William Hamilton invited Nelson to stay at their house. Celebrations were held in honour of Nelson's birthday that September, and he attended a banquet at the Hamiltons', where other officers had begun to notice his attention to Emma. Jervis himself had begun to grow concerned about reports of Nelson's behaviour, but in early October word of Nelson's victory had reached London. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Earl Spencer, fainted on hearing the news. Scenes of celebration erupted across the country, balls and victory feasts were held and church bells were rung. The City of London awarded Nelson and his captains swords, whilst the King ordered them to be presented with special medals. The Tsar of Russia sent him a gift, and Selim III, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, awarded Nelson the Order of the Turkish Crescent {{for his role in}} restoring Ottoman rule in Egypt. Lord Hood, after a conversation with the Prime Minister, told Fanny that Nelson would likely be given a Viscountcy, similar to Jervis's earldom after Cape St Vincent and Duncan's viscountcy after Camperdown. Earl Spencer however demurred, arguing that as Nelson had only been detached in command of a squadron, rather than being the {{commander in chief of the}} fleet, such an award would create an unwelcome precedent. Instead, Nelson received the title Baron Nelson of the Nile.|$|E

25|$|During Alexander III's reign, the monarchy's opponents quickly {{disappeared}} underground.

However, later that night McMahon returned to the arena and stated that he would face Styles at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Styles defeated McMahon. On the April 4 episode of SmackDown Live, Styles made reconciliation with Shane McMahon via a handshake and thus turned back into a fan favorite in the process.|$|E
25|$|After conquering the city, Afonso I {{received}} {{information that}} the relics of Saint Vincent of Saragossa were buried in the Algarve. He made his way southward to reclaim the martyr’s remains. but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> village it had been totally destroyed {{and there was no}} sign of the burial site. A flock of crows was seen flying over the place when the remains were finally found in 1176, and according to legend, two crows accompanied the boat that was carrying them all the way to Lisbon. In commemoration of this story, the crow was chosen to adorn the city's coat of arms as a symbol of its faithful guardians; but the fearless birds are no longer found in the area.|$|E

25|$|Gee {{reported}} to the Giants' camp on April 1, 1945. He {{reported to}} camp late because the Groton high school basketball team that he was coaching had advanced to tournament play. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Giants' camp in Lakewood, New Jersey, Gee told reporters that the soreness in his arm was gone, and he believed {{he would be a}} winner. Two weeks later, he gave up only one hit in three innings as a relief pitcher in a pre-season exhibition game. However, the soreness in his arm returned, and on June 9, 1945, Gee again announced that he was again retiring from the game. During the 1945 season, Gee appeared in only two games and pitched three innings for the Giants, allowing three earned runs for a 9.00 ERA.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Luc Dehaene, Wilfried Martens and Philippe Moureaux {{were the}} first ministers of State to be {{received}} by the King.

25|$|In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Voldemort's manifestation is as {{a face on}} {{the back}} of Quirrell's head, an effect {{achieved}} by computer generated imagery. Ian Hart, the actor who played Quirrell in the same film, provided the voice and the facial source for this character. Voldemort also appears in a scene in the Forbidden Forest where he is seen drinking the blood of a unicorn. As Voldemort's face was altered enough by CG work, and Hart's voice was affected enough, there was no confusion by Hart's playing of the two roles. In that film, he was also shown in a flashback sequence <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> home of James and Lily Potter to kill them. In this scene Voldemort is played by Richard Bremmer, though his face is never seen. His next appearance would be in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the 16-year-old Tom Marvolo Riddle (portrayed by Christian Coulson).|$|E
