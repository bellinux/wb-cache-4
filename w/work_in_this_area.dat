5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> {{led to the development}} of the prime number theorem.|$|E
5|$|Gleason is {{also the}} namesake of the Gleason polynomials, a system of polynomials that {{generate}} the weight enumerators of linear codes. These polynomials take a particularly simple form for self-dual codes: in this case there are just two of them, the two bivariate polynomials x2+y2 and x8+14x2y2+y8. Gleason's student Jessie MacWilliams continued Gleason's <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area,</b> proving {{a relationship between the}} weight enumerators of codes and their duals that has become known as the MacWilliams identity.|$|E
5|$|Lapworth {{also had}} a {{prominent}} {{role to play in}} the fame of Dob's Linn, a small gorge in the Scottish Borders, which contains the 'golden spike' (i.e. the official international boundary or stratotype) between the Ordovician and Silurian periods. Lapworth's <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area,</b> especially his examination of the complex stratigraphy of the Silurian rocks by comparing fossil graptolites, was crucial in to the early understanding of these epochs.|$|E

5|$|Leoš Janáček's {{literary}} legacy {{represents an}} important illustration of his life, public work and art between 1875 and 1928. He contributed {{not only to}} music journals, but wrote essays, reports, reviews, feuilletons, articles and books. His <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> comprises around 380 individual items. His writing changed over time, and appeared in many genres. Nevertheless, the critical and theoretical sphere remained his main area of interest.|$|E
5|$|Much later, during World War I in 1916, a {{standardized}} and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, {{was developed by}} Henry Drysdale Dakin (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area).</b> Called Dakin's solution, the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment {{of a wide variety}} of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in modern times, where it remains effective against bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics (see Century Pharmaceuticals).|$|E
5|$|The modern form of {{a binary}} logarithm, {{applying}} to any number (not just powers of two) was considered explicitly by Leonhard Euler in 1739. Euler established the application of binary logarithms to music theory, long before their more significant applications in information theory and computer science became known. As part of his <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area,</b> Euler published a table of binary logarithms of the integers from 1 to 8, to seven decimal digits of accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{formation}} of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts. In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming. The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.|$|E
5|$|Many {{designers}} {{were involved}} in the construction of memorials, but some became particularly well known for their <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area.</b> Many of the sculptors active on the memorials were established, Victorian-era individuals; the war had disrupted the training of a new generation, and many young sculptors had been killed. Some attempts were made to give preference to designers who had fought in the war, but this was far from universal. In British circles, Edwin Lutyens, Herbert Baker, Reginald Blomfield and Charles Holden formed the core of the established artists; these were joined by Charles Sargeant Jagger, Gilbert Ledward and Eric Gill from the younger generation. Pietro Porcelli was a particularly prolific Australian designer. In Germany, Käthe Kollwitz memorial of a grieving mother at the Roggevelde cemetery particularly famous, and based on her own loss of a son during the fighting in the war.|$|E
