5|$|The 1985 Rajneeshee {{assassination}} plot <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> by a {{group of}} high-ranking followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as Osho) to assassinate Charles Turner, the then-United States Attorney for the District of Oregon. Rajneesh's personal secretary and second-in-command, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman), assembled the group after Turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at Rajneeshpuram. Turner investigated charges of immigration fraud and sham marriages, and later headed the federal prosecution of the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|The French {{authorities}} {{suspected that}} there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to murder Shaftesbury, when {{they discovered that}} Mme M'Barek transferred €150,000 into her brother's bank account the week following her husband's disappearance. The prosecution viewed this as payment for services rendered, although Mme M'Barek testified that she had given her brother the money in order for him {{to buy a house}} for their ailing mother.|$|E
5|$|Some of Garrison's staff {{begin to}} doubt his motives and {{disagree}} with his methods, {{and leave the}} investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz (Sissy Spacek) complains that he is spending {{more time on the}} case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> around Kennedy's death.|$|E

5|$|Kaul sent informers {{to spy on}} Manekshaw {{and based}} on the {{information}} gained, Manekshaw was charged and a court of inquiry was ordered. Meanwhile, two of his juniors—Harbaksh Singh and Moti Sagar—were promoted to lieutenant general and appointed as corps commanders. This incident resulted in the widespread implication that Manekshaw had almost been dismissed from the service. The court, presided over by the then-GOC-in-C Western Command, Lieutenant General Daulet Singh, known for his integrity, exonerated Manekshaw. Before a formal 'no case to answer' could be announced, war with China broke out. But due to the court proceedings, Manekshaw did not see any action during the war. During this war, the Indian Army faced a debacle, and many knew that Kaul and Menon were primarily responsible for the failure. Both were sacked immediately. In November 1962, Nehru asked Manekshaw to take over the command of IV Corps. Manekshaw told Nehru that the action against him <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy,</b> and that his promotion had been due for almost eighteen months. Nehru apologized, promoted Manekshaw to lieutenant general, and he moved to Tezpur to take over as the GOC IV Corps.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Clay Shaw {{takes place in}} 1969. Garrison {{presents}} the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory, and proposes a Dealey Plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and officer J. D. Tippit but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw {{died of lung cancer}} in 1974, but in 1979 Richard Helms testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.|$|E

25|$|The Great Phenol Plot <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> by the German Government {{during the}} early years of World War I to divert American-produced phenol away from the {{manufacture}} of high explosives that supported the British war effort, to the production of aspirin by the German-owned Bayer company, who could no longer import phenol from Britain.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} document accusing Freemasonry {{of being}} involved in a conspiracy was Enthüllungen des Systems der Weltbürger-Politik (“Disclosure of the System of Cosmopolitan Politics”), published in 1786. The book claimed that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> of Freemasons, Illuminati and Jesuits who were plotting world revolution. During the 19th Century, this theory was repeated by many Christian counter-revolutionaries, who saw Freemasons as being behind every attack on the existing social system.|$|E

25|$|Macmillan {{suggested}} {{on several}} occasions, including at {{his meeting with}} Lloyd to dismiss him as Chancellor, that he felt there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> within the party to replace him as Prime Minister. While the run of poor Conservative results led to informal talk among party MPs and ministers, no such conspiracy existed. His intimations of party disloyalty and the speed and surprise of the sackings were particularly hurtful to Lloyd, who was loyal to Macmillan, and remained so even after his dismissal.|$|E
25|$|Public {{opinion polls}} have {{consistently}} {{shown that a}} majority of Americans believe there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to kill Kennedy. Gallup polls have also found that only 20–30% of the population believe that Oswald had acted alone. These polls also show that there is no agreement on who else may have been involved. Former Los Angeles District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi estimated that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people had been accused in various Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories.|$|E

25|$|As {{documents}} in British and Canadian archives came {{available in the}} 1980s, {{it became clear that}} both Canada and the United Kingdom wanted Newfoundland to join Canada. Some have charged that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to manoeuvre Newfoundland into Confederation, in exchange for forgiveness of Britain's war debt and for other considerations, but most historians who have examined the government documents have concluded that while Britain engineered the inclusion of Confederation in the referendum, Newfoundlanders made the final decision themselves although it was a close vote.|$|E
25|$|On September 27, 1918, in Montreal, the NHA {{directors}} met again. Ottawa, Montreal Wanderers and Canadiens {{voted to}} again suspend {{operations of the}} league. This meant that the NHL would operate for a second season. Percy Quinn's purchase of the Quebec Bulldogs was approved but his franchise could not play. The action of the NHA directors led to Livingstone filing a lawsuit on October 1, 1918, charging that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> among the NHA owners, {{paid for by the}} Arena Company to suspend the NHA operations and asking the court to nullify the suspension.|$|E
25|$|Genghis {{then sent}} a 500-man caravan of Muslims to {{establish}} official trade ties with Khwarezmia. However Inalchuq, {{the governor of}} the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, had the members of the caravan that came from Mongolia arrested, claiming that the caravan <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> against Khwarezmia. It seems unlikely, however, that any members of the trade delegation were spies. Nor does it seem likely that Genghis was trying to initiate a conflict with the Khwarezmid Empire with the caravan, considering he was making steady progress against a faltering Jin empire in northern China at that very moment.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{found that}} the two {{versions}} of the manuscript transcripts disagreed with each other, and contained material not found in the official report of the court. He concluded that the report was an attempt by the Court to suggest that formal trials had been held, when the proceedings did not follow accepted procedures for trials and due process. Their proceedings had been held in secret and defendants could not confront their accusers. After Vesey and the first five conspirators were executed, the Court had another 82 suspects arrested in July, {{more than twice as many}} as had been arrested in June. Johnson suggested that, after public criticism, the Court was motivated to prove there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gustl Ferdinand Mollath (born 7 November 1956 in Nuremberg) is a German man who {{was acquitted}} during a {{criminal}} trial in 2006 {{on the basis of}} diminished criminal responsibility; he was committed to a high-security psychiatric hospital, as the court deemed him a danger to the public and declared him insane based on expert diagnoses of paranoid personality disorder. Mollath's forensic incarceration for seven years and the surrounding legal judgments became the basis of a public controversy in Bavaria and the whole of Germany when at least some underlying elements of his supposedly fabricated paranoid story about money-laundering activities at a major bank turned out to be true after all. Mollath himself had consistently claimed there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to have him locked up in a psychiatric care ward because of his incriminating knowledge; evidence turned up in 2012 made his claims appear plausible.|$|E
25|$|The failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> among a {{group of}} Roman Catholic gentry to re-establish Catholicism in England by assassinating the Protestant King JamesI and {{replacing}} him with a Catholic monarch. To this end, they placed large quantities of gunpowder beneath the House of Lords, which one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, would detonate during the State Opening of Parliament on 5November 1605. If successful, the explosion would have destroyed the Palace, killing the King, his family and most of the aristocracy. However, the plot was discovered and most of the conspirators were either arrested or killed while trying to evade capture. The survivors were tortured in the Tower of London, tried for high treason in Westminster Hall, convicted and gruesomely executed by hanging, drawing and quartering. Since then, the cellars of the Palace have been searched by the Yeomen of the Guard before every State Opening of Parliament, a traditional precaution against any similar attempts against the Sovereign.|$|E
