5|$|German {{military}} officers were {{disappointed by the}} limited extent of the attack, <b>which</b> <b>ultimately</b> achieved more political goals than strategic ones.

5|$|The {{project was}} {{cancelled}} in June 1967, when the French Government withdrew from participation. However, the cancellation {{was not the}} end of work on the proposed design.

5|$|After five {{successful}} {{seasons of}} The X-Files, series creator Chris Carter {{wanted to tell}} the story of the series on a wider scale, <b>which</b> <b>ultimately</b> meant creating a feature film: the 1998 X-Files movie. The film grossed US$83,898,313 in the US and $105,278,110 abroad, giving a total worldwide gross of $189,176,423. In its opening weekend, showing at 2,629 theaters, it earned $30,138,758 which was 35.9% of its total gross. Initially, the fifth season of The X-Files was supposed to be the show's last.

5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, <b>which</b> <b>ultimately</b> explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel. This created an illusion that the explosion was expanding. The sequence was divided into six different cuts; the first one consisted of the rupture glass of the building, while the last frame concluded {{with the collapse of}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research <b>which</b> <b>ultimately</b> {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E
