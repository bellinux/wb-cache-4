5|$|The Hurricane <b>Warning</b> <b>Service,</b> {{operated}} by the United States Weather Bureau and the predecessor to the National Hurricane Center, issued hurricane warnings from Fort Myers to Miami, including the Florida Keys on October4. Miami Weather Bureau chief Grady Norton urged residents to take precautions and concentrate on further advisories. On October5, the hurricane warning was revised to include Naples to Jupiter. Additionally, other warnings were issued for areas surrounding Lake Okeechobee due to flooding concerns. Four U.S. Navy wartime housing project areas in Key West were evacuated. About 100Seminoles fled the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation, with 95% of the property still inundated from the September hurricane. Two 25-car trains evacuated about 5,000people in the Lake Okeechobee area in Lake Harbor and transported them to Sebring. Many residents throughout South Florida boarded-up their windows and sandbagged their properties. The American Red Cross opened 143shelters, which 21,663people sought refuge in.|$|E

25|$|When Bomber Command began {{attacks by}} night in May 1940, the Germans had no {{adequate}} means of intercepting incoming formations of RAF bombers. Pre-war trials aimed at creating a night fighter defence {{had used a}} <b>warning</b> <b>service</b> based on sound detectors and searchlights. Night fighters orbited the beacons at altitude outside illuminated area, and when a bomber {{was caught in the}} light, the fighter engaged the aircraft. Any focusing of searchlights at altitude signaled the night fighter to enter the illuminated zone and attack. AAA units were ordered to fire at every given opportunity, other than when the fighters were in the combat zone. These experiments ceased in August 1939 and in 1940 were still reliant on searchlight-aided AAA with fighters in a subordinate role.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 {{report for}} DEFRA, {{conducted}} following the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, found that, discounting 'exotic {{events such as}} meteorite impacts', 'in most plausible circumstances {{it is likely that}} such an event would be contained by current defences, designed to resist storm surges, for all major developed areas', however the joint occurrence of events, such as a tsunami coinciding with a storm surge, was discounted. The report did, however call for additional more detailed modelling to be carried out, recommended that the Met Office should provide a tsunami <b>warning</b> <b>service,</b> and that detection devices should be upgraded. A follow-up report indicated that, of the three likely scenarios modelled, a Lisbon-type event would pose the greatest danger, potentially resulting in a tsunami wave exceeding the 1:100 year extreme sea level at the Cornish peninsula by up to 1.4m, but being within the range elsewhere. This conclusion is markedly different from the greater heights calculated by Bryant and Haslett as having been encountered in the Bristol Channel during the 1607 Bristol Channel floods.|$|E
500|$|A {{storm in}} 1859 {{that caused the}} loss of the Royal Charter {{inspired}} FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made, which he called [...] "forecasting the weather", thus coining the term [...] "weather forecast". Fifteen land stations were established to use the new telegraph to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times leading to the first gale <b>warning</b> <b>service.</b> His <b>warning</b> <b>service</b> for shipping was initiated in February 1861, with the use of telegraph communications. The first daily weather forecasts were published in The Times in 1861. In the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected. The [...] "Weather Book" [...] which FitzRoy published in 1863 was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time.|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{sulfur dioxide}} is an {{important}} indicator of volcanic activity. Space based atmospheric sensors like GOME- 2 on MetOp and OMI on EOS-Aura {{make it possible to}} detect the emissions of volcanic SO 2 and monitor volcanic activity and eruptions on a global scale. With GOME- 2, it is possible to detect and track volcanic eruption plumes and SO 2 from passive degassing in near-real time (NRT). This is particularly important for early <b>warning</b> <b>services,</b> as increases in SO 2 fluxes are an indicator for new episodes of volcanic unrest. The SO 2 daily measurements from space are used for several early <b>warning</b> <b>services</b> related volcanic risk (Exupéry, GlobVolcano) and for aviation warning purposes (GSE-PROMOTE) ...|$|R

500|$|The first {{hurricane}} <b>warning</b> <b>service</b> {{was set up}} in {{the early}} 1870s from Cuba with the work of Father Benito Viñes, who served as director of the Meteorological Observatory of the Royal College of Belén. [...] He established a network of observation sites and developed the first method to forecast tropical cyclone movement, with the oldest known forecast made for a hurricane in late August 1873. He would give track details days in advance, based upon clouds which progress well in advance of hurricanes. His hurricane <b>warning</b> <b>service</b> in Cuba continued until his death on July 23, 1893. Within the United States, the public was dissatisfied with the Signal Corp forecasts after the Hurricane of 1875. The immediate response by the Signal Corp was the creation of the hurricane warning flag, a pair of red flags ten by eight feet each in size, inset with black rectangles. Beginning on October 1, 1875, hurricane warning flags were hoisted in areas where hurricane warnings were in effect, and illuminated at night.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the season}} started, the United States Weather Bureau office in Miami began {{setting up a}} {{teleprinter}} to distribute hourly advisories to newspapers and the American Red Cross. The hurricane season officially began on June15, and lasted until November15. When the season started, the Lakeland Frost <b>Warning</b> <b>Service</b> sent four employees to assist the Miami Weather Bureau. The Hurricane Hunters flew daily to investigate potential storms in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. In addition, there was a set of radars from Texas to Maine to track storms. Beginning in 1958, the Weather Bureau predicted the change in tide due to a storm {{with the assistance of}} a tide specialist. During the season, a reporter [...] daughter of Weather Bureau director Gordon Dunn [...] flew into Hurricane Daisy, becoming the first woman to fly into a hurricane. Utilizing radars along the East Coast of the United States, the Weather Bureau tracked both Hurricanes Daisy and Helene for , which was the first such occurrence of that feat.|$|E
500|$|Less {{than six}} months after the station's first broadcast, WINC carried live {{descriptions}} of the attack on Pearl Harbor and President Roosevelt's [...] "Infamy Speech" [...] the following day. With the United States entry to World War II, WINC participated in the war effort on the air and at its studios. [...] The City of Winchester erected an Aircraft <b>Warning</b> <b>Service</b> station, manned by volunteers, beside the WINC facility. The station aired an hour-long special program called [...] "Virginia Schools at War Mobilization" [...] on February 22, 1943. The program involved approximately 618,000 schoolchildren and teachers from around the state, war-savings staff, and state and civic dignitaries. [...] The special, broadcast live from Mount Vernon, was carried on 13 other Virginia stations and on WWDC in Washington, D.C. [...] WINC participated in another wartime broadcast, this one in late January 1944, to encourage the public to buy War Bonds.

How do we capture the attention of novices and people venturing into potentially dangerous terrain {{on the spur of}} the moment without even the basic understanding of what they are getting into? We explored current state of bulletins, highlighted the essential elements and presented various practices in their implementation. We chose 4 representative concepts from European and North American <b>warning</b> <b>services</b> and modified them to present the situation in Slovenia. The resulting bulle-tins were presented to expert and advanced users for evaluation then compared to findings gathered in a concurrent usability study with lay people.

500|$|The United States Congress {{passed a}} bill to authorize the {{establishment}} and operations of weather stations across the West Indies and Caribbean Sea on July 7, 1889. [...] The ultimate outcome was {{the advent of the}} Weather Bureau in 1890, through the passing of the Organic Act which assigned the new organization to the Department of Agriculture. [...] The September 1896 hurricane led to an expansion of the Weather Bureau hurricane network through the Caribbean Sea. The Spanish–American War led to the United States establishing a hurricane warning office in Kingston, Jamaica in 1898, before shifting to Havana, Cuba after the war's end in 1899. After the 1900 Galveston Hurricane, a hurricane warning office was established at New Orleans, Louisiana to deal with hurricane warnings in the Gulf of Mexico. [...] The Hurricane <b>Warning</b> <b>Service</b> moved to Washington, D. C. in 1902. The use of radio by shipping, which began in 1905, added significantly more information for those tracking hurricanes. The first report from a hurricane was received in 1909, with the total of radio reports rising to 21,000 per hurricane season in 1935. Despite the issuance of hurricane watches and warnings, forecasting the path of tropical cyclones did not occur until 1920.|$|E

In lieu of working detection equipment and trained personnel, the <b>Warning</b> <b>Service</b> maintained a primitive system of 509 observation posts manned by 860 civilian watchers, unschooled in aircraft identification, who would report airplane movements by five radio, two telegraph, and ten telephone networks manned by members of all three U.S. military services, the Philippine Army and constabulary, the Philippine postal system, and civilian companies in the provinces. Interpreters were required for the many dialects used by the observers. Message processing encountered significant delays between the time of observation and time of report.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "RADAR" [...] {{was coined}} by the Navy in 1940 {{and agreed to}} by the Army in 1941. The first Signal Corps Field Manual on Aircraft <b>Warning</b> <b>Service</b> defined RADAR as [...] "a term used to {{designate}} radio sets SCR (Signal Corps Radio)-268 and SCR-270 and similar equipment". The SCR-268 and 270 were not radios at all, but were designated as such to keep their actual function secret. Although important offensive applications have since been developed, radar emerged historically from the defensive need to counter the possibility of massive aerial bombardment.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{snow cover}} model SNOWPACK simulates snow {{stratigraphy}} for {{the locations of}} automatic snow and weather stations. Based on the stratigraphy, snow stability is predicted by calculating three stability indices. We verified {{the performance of the}} skier stability index SK 38 in order to develop a supporting tool for avalanche <b>warning</b> <b>services.</b> Since stability depends on snow stratigraphy, modelled grain type, grain size, hardness and density were first validated. The skier stability index SK 38 performed poorly in terms of identifying potential weak layers. By introducing a new stability formulation (SSI) that combined the SK 38 with differences of hardness and grain size across layer interfaces – known indicators of structural instability – the model performance was substantially improved. For manually observed flat field profiles, the SSI was significantly related with stability test results. At the regional scale, a statistically significant relation between predicted and verified stability was found. Stability patterns at the mountain range scale were reproduced. With these improvements the snow cover model SNOWPACK will develop into a valuable supporting tool for stability evaluation as done by avalanche <b>warning</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|Initially {{plant disease}} models were {{developed}} as simple rules, graphs, or tables, {{and later as}} descriptive tools. Advances in environmental monitoring, automatic data processing, and botanical epidemiology enabled {{the development of a}} new class of mechanistic dynamic models, which are more accurate and robust. They explain mathematically the relations within a pathosystem (including both pathogens and host plants) by means of linked differential equations, and describe the way in which the system changes over time and space as an effect of external variables. Thus, the equation parameters do not have fixed values but vary according to the influencing weather conditions. These models require input data, particularly meteorological data, to be collected over time and space. Scales of time and space for inputs may differ according to the application of the model: from <b>warning</b> <b>services,</b> which use models to produce crop protection information at the collective level on a territorial scale, to precision agriculture which uses models at a within-plot scale. While the use of mechanistic dynamic models in <b>warning</b> <b>services</b> for crop protection is well established, their use in precision agriculture has yet to be developed. These models could be used to draw dynamic maps of current and future spatial distribution of both visible and latent infections within a plot, so that timing, active ingredients and rates of fungicides may be defined accordingly. The main challenge that needs to be overcome before this can be accomplished is the lack of meteorological inputs at the within-plot level...|$|R
