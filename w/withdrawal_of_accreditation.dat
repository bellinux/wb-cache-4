40|$|Background: Accreditation {{has become}} {{ubiquitous}} across the international health care landscape. Award <b>of</b> full <b>accreditation</b> status {{in health care}} is viewed, {{as it is in}} other sectors, as a valid indicator of high quality organisational performance. However, few studies have empirically demonstrated this assertion. The value <b>of</b> <b>accreditation,</b> therefore, remains uncertain, and this persists as a central legitimacy problem for accreditation providers, policymakers and researchers. The question arises as to how best to research the validity, impact and value <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> processes in health care. Most health care organisations participate in some sort <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> process and thus {{it is not possible to}} study its merits using a randomised controlled strategy. Further, tools and processes for accreditation and organisational performance are multifaceted. Methods/design: To understand the relationship between them a multi-method research approach is required which incorporates both quantitative and qualitative data. The generic nature <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> standard development and inspection within different sectors enhances the extent to which the findings of in-depth study <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> process in one industry can be generalised to other industries. This paper presents a research design which comprises a prospective, multi-method, multi-level, multi-disciplinary approach to assess the validity, impact and value <b>of</b> <b>accreditation.</b> Discussion: The accreditation program which assesses over 1, 000 health services in Australia is used as an exemplar for testing this design. The paper proposes this design as a framework suitable for application to future international research into accreditation. Our aim is to stimulate debate on the role <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> and how to research it. 10 page(s...|$|R
