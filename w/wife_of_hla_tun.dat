One of these works has appeared in two publications: Amar’s Modern Burmese Painting and Ranard’s Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History. These portraits, like those <b>of</b> M.T. <b>Hla</b> (U <b>Tun</b> <b>Hla)</b> (1874-1946) and Yatanabon Maung Su (1903-65), are of ethnic minorities, in Saung’s case often of the Shan.|$|R

5000|$|Wright's {{account is}} disputed by Professor Christopher Andrew in The Defence of the Realm: the {{authorised}} history of MI5. On {{the basis of}} MI5 files, Andrew states that Wright and another MI5 agent interviewed Floud {{in the autumn of}} 1966 and finally in March 1967, culminating in an interview on 20 March 1967 at which Floud was told that: [...] "because of lack of frankness about his past Communist associations, he was regarded as a 'full security risk' and could not therefore be given security clearance. Floud can have been in little doubt that his prospects of a ministerial career had gone." [...] Andrew suggests that this [...] "added to his despair" [...] arising from a long-standing depressive illness and his wife's death. Andrew concludes that [...] "Save for the personal tragedy with which it was associated, the investigation of Floud was of less importance than it seemed to the Security Service at the time. There was - and is - no evidence that he had any Communist contacts after 1952. His pre-war contacts with Soviet intelligence are also unlikely to have been of great significance, though {{it would have been very}} different" [...] if Jenifer Fischer Williams, later <b>wife</b> <b>of</b> <b>H.L.A.</b> Hart, whom Floud had recruited to the Communist cause, had decided to become a Soviet agent, instead of leaving the Party and pursuing a career with the Home Office and later Oxford University.|$|R

50|$|Sein Lin (Zaw Lwin) is {{the drummer}} for a {{traditional}} Burmese dance theater group in Rangoon, {{who is very}} passionate about Burmese music, art and cultural traditions. He gets frustrated when, in his opinion, one of the dancers dances against—not with—the beat, and he turns his back on his troupe, only to join another soon after, where he meet and {{falls in love with}} beautiful dancer Khin San (San San Aye). Yet Khin San is at first affronted by Sein Lin’s teachings. Although they argue incessantly, they cannot deny their attraction for one another. When she leaves the group to pursue a career as a film actress, he gives her a small figure as a keepsake, a symbol of traditional theater. He tells her to return it only when she is certain she wants to stay in film. After celebrating her first cinema successes and deciding to marry producer <b>Hla</b> <b>Tun</b> (Aung Pyae), Khin San finally gives the figure back to the heart-broken Sein Lin. The story takes a different turn however when Khin San realizes that <b>Hla</b> <b>Tun</b> has been keeping something significant from her, and she returns to her traveling theater group.|$|R
50|$|On {{his trip}} through Burma and the {{paintings}} he {{left of the}} country, Kelly {{had a significant impact}} on the early 20th century development of Burmese painting. In Burma, he is believed to have met and taught the basics of Western painting to a major painter <b>of</b> Burma, M.T. <b>Hla</b> (U <b>Tun</b> <b>Hla)</b> (1874-1946), and the paintings of Maung Maung Gyi (painter) (1890-1942) and Ba Ohn (c.1877-fl.1924) show clear influence of Kelly's style in certain works, to the point, in one case, of an exact replica. The latter two painters may possibly have met Kelly and received some instruction from him, but this would not have been necessary for Kelly's influence to have occurred. Kelly's two books were widely available in Burma, or so were postcard reproductions, which were sold in Burma, of the paintings in his books.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, Ba Thet settled upon {{painting}} as his favorite art medium and studied watercolor painting informally from Maung Maung Gyi, Ba Zaw, and Saya Saung, through observation and helping his teachers. It {{is said that}} Ba Thet and Ba Nyan {{were among the first}} Burmese painters to paint in the western style, but it must be acknowledged that other painters, such as his teachers or M.T. <b>Hla</b> (U <b>Tun</b> <b>Hla),</b> preceded him. He is an important painter because he encouraged individuality, creativity, experimentation and modern concepts in his art.|$|R
50|$|His {{father died}} {{before he had}} {{finished}} his schooling, and his mother sent him to Saya Nyan (not {{to be confused with}} Ba Nyan) to study pavilion decoration. By the age of 16, he had fair mastery of this art. He later studied under the professional painter M.T. <b>Hla</b> (U <b>Tun</b> <b>Hla)</b> (1874-1946), who had a background in Traditional art, but who became a pioneer watercolorist of Burma, mastering Western techniques <b>of</b> painting. M.T. <b>Hla</b> picked up these skills through exposure to paintings by Robert Talbot Kelly in his book Burma Painted and Described, or postcards of the paintings from this book which were sold in stores. Hla also had contact and instruction of some kind with the Irish painter Sir Gerald Kelly; both Kellys traveled to Burma in the early 1900s and painted its landscapes and people. Thus, M.T. Hla would likely have trained Saya Myit in both the Traditional and Western style <b>of</b> painting. M.T. <b>Hla</b> was also considered a master of glass painting and apparently passed on these skills to Saya Myit although it seems no works in the glass painting genre have survived by either M.T. Hla or Saya Myit.|$|R
50|$|After retiring, he was {{appointed}} an instructor at the Yangon Fine Arts school, teaching third-year students. His pupils included Min Wae Aung, Zaw Zaw Aung, <b>Hla</b> <b>Tun,</b> Zaw Win Pe and Kyaw Shein. Kyaw Hlaing was a handsome man with a wiry, towering frame. Two of his students, Min Wae Aung and Zaw Zaw Aung, painted portraits of him. One of these works by Zaw Zaw Aung, an ironic oil painting titled Portrait of U Kyaw Hlaing: Visit Myanmar Year 1996 (1995), was done when Kyaw Hlaing had passed the age of 80.

40|$|The impact <b>of</b> <b>HLA</b> DR on {{development}} and healing of cardiac allograft rejection Positive HLA DR reactions {{are found in}} biopsies with and without signs of rejection (in 96 % of biopsies with signs of rejection and 87 % of biopsies without signs of rejection). Evidently, the expression <b>of</b> <b>HLA</b> DR is associated with transplantation. Moreover, a positive correlation exists between the degree of rejection and the expression <b>of</b> <b>HLA</b> DR. A strong expression <b>of</b> <b>HLA</b> DR {{could be found in}} biopsies with signs of strong rejections. Thus, the degree <b>of</b> <b>HLA</b> DR expression could be regarded as an indicator of cell death. Antigen-presenting-cells like B-cells, macrophages, endothel cells express HLA DR. Endothel cells and endothelial dysfunction play a special role. Endothelial activation is found in cases where endothel cells are damaged or in cases where a heart transplantation results in increased functional activity of endothel cells. Thus, {{it could be argued that}} HLA DR expression in biopsies without signs of rejection could indicate the potential presence of arteriosclerosis in cardiac allograft. It is known that strong HLA DR expression enhances microvascular thrombogenicity and limits graft survival. HLA DR matching is important. A significant correlation has been found between increased HLA DR mismatch and rejection. In the preparation phase for heart transplantation, optimal HLA DR matching is <b>of</b> great importance. <b>HLA</b> DR matching effectively reduces the rejection episodes after heart transplantation...|$|R
