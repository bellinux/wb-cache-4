40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of dynamic excitation as a method for stiffness and strength grading of <b>wet</b> side <b>boards</b> of narrow dimensions. The need for such an investigation has previously been identified in an ongoing research project in which the possibility to use side boards as lamellae in wet glued glulam beams is investigated.      The assessment of the dynamic excitation method was carried out by means of experimental work and measurements [...] The approach was quantitative {{in the sense that the}} data was collected through experiments performed on a rather large population and that the results were analyzed using statistical methods.      To investigate the effect of moisture content on stiffness of narrow dimension, side boards, the stiffness was measured in three states: - in wet state, before splitting the <b>boards,</b> - in <b>wet</b> state, after splitting the boards, and - in dry state (splitted boards).      The conclusion, after calculations and analysis of all the results, was that the natural frequency and stiffness of <b>wet</b> <b>boards</b> could, with a high degree of reliability, be predicted by use of the dynamic excitation method. There was a strong correlation in stiffness between <b>wet</b> state split <b>boards</b> and dry state split boards, with a coefficient of determination of 0. 93...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the paper, Construction {{technology}} and equipment improvement of plastic drainage boards driven in land area are studied. Because overlying hardpan is thick in some areas, drainage plate can’t {{be driven by}} common vibratory <b>board</b> <b>machine.</b> In allusion to this instance, the machine was refitted to superficial drilling holes machine, a bore was drilled and then the drainage plate was driven {{to deal with the}} foundations covered with thick hardpan. Performance of this technology is researched and explored to deal with a complex foundation treatment by reclamation silt. Preface In complex foundation by reclamation at coastal area, its upper is varied thickness backfill material, lower is mucky soft soil foundation. Characteristics of muddy soil are high water content, low strength and bearing capacity. So, bearing capacity and stabilization can’t meet requirements and foundation is easy to be destroyed. The kind soft soil must be disposed to ensure bearing capacity, stabilization and eliminate overlarge settlement deformation. At present, prefabricated drains preloading is used to consolidate foundation[1, 2, 3, 4]. The difficulty of using ivertical drain is different because of complex foundation. The drain can be inserted the bottom of silt through soil layers by common <b>board</b> <b>machine</b> when backfilling thicknes...|$|R

However, the second set of dogs being heavier than the first and the lion more exhausted, it became a one-way contest.

He fell and showed symptoms of weakness, upon which the dogs were taken away. This termination, however, did not please the crowd, who cried out loudly that the dogs were not beaten.|$|R

30|$|A {{handheld}} capacitance-type {{moisture meter}} (Moco II, Kett Electric Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan) and an in-line microwave moisture meter (MM- 94 L, Kawasaki Kiko Co., Shizuoka, Japan) {{were used to}} measure MC of the boards. It {{should be noted that}} the moisture meters must be used correctly, and the calibration equation for the microwave moisture meter was obtained preliminarily as a function of microwave attenuation, moisture content and density in accordance with the manual of the manufacturer. First, meter readings were taken from the middle of the boards by setting the density value to the mean measured density of 355  kg/m 3. Second, meter readings were taken again by setting the density value to the NIR-predicted value obtained from the end surface of each board. Thereafter, the boards were oven-dried and their MC was calculated gravimetrically. Twelve boards had oven-dry MC above 30  % and were considered as “wet”. Therefore, the <b>wet</b> <b>boards</b> were eliminated and the remaining 108 boards were used for MC evaluation.|$|R
