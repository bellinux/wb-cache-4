40|$|In chronic {{infectious}} diseases, such as schistosomiasis, pathogen {{growth and}} immunopathology {{are affected by}} the induction of a proper balanced Th 1 /Th 2 response to the pathogen and by antigen-triggered activation-induced T cell death. Here, by using S. japonicum infection or schistosome antigens-immunized mouse model, or antigens in vitro stimulation, we report that during the early stage of S. japonicum infection, nonegg antigens trigger Th 2 cell apoptosis via the granzyme B signal pathway, contributing to Th 1 polarization, which is thought to be associated with <b>worm</b> <b>clearance</b> and severe schistosomiasis. Meanwhile, after the adult worms lay their eggs, the egg antigens trigger Th 1 cell apoptosis via the caspase pathway, contributing to Th 2 polarization, which is associated with mild pathology and enhanced survival of both worms and their hosts. Thus, our study suggests that S. japonicum antigen-induced Th 1 and Th 2 cell apoptosis involves the Th 1 /Th 2 shift and favorites both hosts and parasites...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian hosts often develop {{distinct}} {{immune response}} against the diverse parasitic helminths that have evolved for immune evasion. Interleukin- 25 (IL- 25), an IL- 17 cytokine family member, {{plays a key}} role in initiating the protective immunity against several parasitic helminths; however, the involvement and underlying mechanisms by which IL- 25 mediates immune response against Trichinella spiralis infection have not been investigated. Here we showed that IL- 25 functions in promoting protective immunity against T. spiralis infection. Mice treated with IL- 25 exhibited a lower worm burden and fewer muscle larvae in the later stage of T. spiralis infection. In contrast, mice treated with neutralizing antibody against IL- 25 failed to expel T. spiralis effectively. During T. spiralis infection, intestinal IL- 25 expression was rapidly elevated before the onset of IL- 4 and IL- 9 induc-tion. While antigen-specific Th 2 and Th 9 immune responses were both developed during T. spiralis infection, an antigen-spe-cific Th 9 response appeared to be transiently induced in the early stage of infection. Mice into which antigen-specific T cells defi-cient in IL- 9 were transferred were less effective in <b>worm</b> <b>clearance</b> than those given wild-type T cells. The strength of th...|$|R
40|$|Type 2 {{immunity}} is a stereotyped {{host response}} to allergens and parasitic helminths that is sustained {{in large part}} by the cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 13. Recent advances have called attention to the contributions by innate cells in initiating adaptive immunity, including a novel lineage-negative population of cells that secretes IL- 13 and IL- 5 in response to the epithelial cytokines IL- 25 and IL- 33. Here, we use IL- 4 and IL- 13 reporter mice to track lineage-negative innate cells that arise during type 2 immunity or in response to IL- 25 and IL- 33 in vivo. Unexpectedly, lineage-negative IL- 25 (and IL- 33) responsive cells are widely distributed in tissues of the mouse and are particularly prevalent in mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. These cells expand robustly in response to exogenous IL- 25 or IL- 33 and after infection with the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, and they are the major innate IL- 13 –expressing cells under these conditions. Activation of these cells using IL- 25 is sufficient for <b>worm</b> <b>clearance,</b> {{even in the absence of}} adaptive immunity. Widely dispersed innate type 2 helper cells, which we designate Ih 2 cells, play an integral role in type 2 immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Primary and {{secondary}} murine and human infections with Brugia malayi {{are characterized by}} substantial increases in levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE). To investigate whether this is necessary for <b>worm</b> <b>clearance,</b> IgE−/− mice were subjected to primary- {{and secondary}}-infection protocols. Following a primary infection, IgE−/− mice displayed a profound deficit {{in their ability to}} clear an intraperitoneal injection of L 3 infective-stage larvae in comparison to wild-type counterparts and maintained substantial worm burdens as late as 10 weeks postinfection. Although viable adult parasites were recovered at this late time point from IgE−/− mice, the majority of the mice remained free of microfilariae. IgE−/− cohorts subjected to a secondary-infection protocol were able to clear the challenge inoculation in an accelerated manner, with kinetics similar to that observed in the wild-type animals. Analysis of the humoral response in IgE−/− mice following infection demonstrates a defect in IgG 1 and IgG 2 a production, in addition to the expected lack of IgE. The IgG 1 deficiency is no longer evident following a secondary infection. These data imply that deficiencies other than IgE production (i. e., IgG 1 production) deficiency may be responsible for the increased permissiveness of IgE−/− mice as hosts following infection with B. malayi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractImmune {{responses}} elicited by {{allergic reactions}} and parasitic worm infections are characterised by the induction of T helper 2 (Th 2) cells. These cells secrete cytokines such as interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), IL- 5 and IL- 13, which induce {{the production of}} immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eosinophils [1, 2]. Previous studies using gastrointestinal nematodes to elucidate the role of Th 2 -cell-mediated immune responses have demonstrated a causal relationship between T cells and worm expulsion (reviewed in [3]). Although it has been proposed that IL- 4 {{played a central role}} in these responses, recent studies demonstrated that IL- 4 −/− mice expel the parasitic gastrointestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis normally [4], suggesting that another T-cell mediator is required for efficient <b>worm</b> <b>clearance.</b> Using IL- 13 −/− mice, we have demonstrated that, unlike wild-type and IL- 4 −/− mice, the IL- 13 −/− animals failed to clear N. brasiliensis infections efficiently, despite developing a robust Th 2 -like cytokine response to infection. Furthermore, treatment of the IL- 13 −/− mice with exogenous IL- 13 resulted in a reduction in the numbers of worms recovered. The IL- 13 −/− animals also failed to generate the goblet cell hyperplasia that normally occurs coincident with worm expulsion. This observation may link IL- 13 with the production of intestinal mucus which is believed to facilitate worm expulsion. These data support a unique role for IL- 13 in Th 2 -cell-mediated immune responses and demonstrate that IL- 13 and IL- 4 are not redundant...|$|R
40|$|Helminth {{infection}} is frequently {{associated with the}} expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and suppression of immune responses to bystander antigens. We show that infection of mice with the chronic gastrointestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus drives rapid polyclonal expansion of Foxp 3 (+) Helios(+) CD 4 (+) thymic (t) Tregs in the lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes while Foxp 3 (+) Helios(-) CD 4 (+) peripheral (p) Treg expand more slowly. Notably, in partially resistant BALB/c mice parasite survival positively correlates with Foxp 3 (+) Helios(+) CD 4 (+) tTreg numbers. Boosting of Foxp 3 (+) Helios(+) CD 4 (+) tTreg populations by administration of recombinant interleukin- 2 (rIL- 2) :anti-IL- 2 (IL- 2 C) complex increased worm persistence by diminishing type- 2 responsiveness in vivo, including suppression of alternatively activated macrophage and granulomatous responses at the sites of infection. IL- 2 C also increased innate lymphoid cell (ILC) numbers, indicating that Treg functions dominate over ILC effects in this setting. Surprisingly, complete removal of Tregs in transgenic Foxp 3 -DTR mice also resulted in increased worm burdens, with "immunological chaos" evident in high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 6 and interferon-γ. In contrast, <b>worm</b> <b>clearance</b> could be induced by anti-CD 25 antibody-mediated partial depletion of early Treg, alongside increased T helper type 2 responses and without incurring pathology. These findings highlight the overarching importance of the early Treg response to infection and the non-linear association between inflammation and the prevailing Treg frequency...|$|R
40|$|Foxp 3 + {{regulatory}} T cells (Tregs) have a well-characterized role in limiting autoimmunity and dampening deleterious immune responses. However, {{a potential}} {{consequence of the}} immunosuppressive function of Tregs can be the limitation of protective immunity to infectious pathogens. Parasitic infections are a potent stimulus for the generation of Treg responses, which may be beneficial to both the parasite and the host by promoting persistence of infection and limiting immune-mediated pathology, respectively. In this study, we explore the functional role of Tregs post–low-dose infection with the intestinal helminth parasite Trichuris muris, which yields a chronic infection because of inefficient induction of Th 2 responses. Early Treg depletion postinfection resulted in expedited <b>worm</b> <b>clearance,</b> and was associated with reduced Th 1 -mediated inflammation of the intestinal environment. Interestingly, this protective immunity was lost, and worm burden enhanced if Tregs were depleted later once the infection was established. Early and late Treg depletion resulted in enhanced Th 2 and reduced Th 1 cytokine and humoral responses. Blockade of the Th 2 cytokine IL- 4 resulted in a moderate increase in Th 1 but {{had no effect on}} worm burden. Our findings suggest that Tregs preferentially limit Th 2 cell expansion, which can impact infections where clear immune polarity has not been established. Thus, the impact of Treg depletion is context and time dependent, and can be beneficial to the host in situations where Th 1 responses should be limited in favor of Th 2 responses...|$|R
40|$|Our {{laboratory}} studies anti-filarial immune responses in mice. Wild type mice are naturally resistant to Brugia species and generate a florid immune response against these parasites. The immune response {{is characterized by}} two phases, acute and chronic. Macrophages accumulate in the peritoneal cavity in both these phases. Using a selective labeling protocol, we demonstrate that macrophages accumulate in both these phases by recruitment from blood. CCL 2 {{is important for the}} recruitment of macrophages in the acute, but not in the chronic phase. ^ Here we show by depletion strategies that macrophages are essential for the clearance of larvae. The formation of granulomas is inhibited in the absence of macrophages, demonstrating that these cells are necessary for their formation. Depletion of macrophages does not affect B or T cell responses, suggesting that the primary function of macrophages is as an effector cell. We demonstrate that macrophages adhere to larvae in vitro in the presence of antigen specific primed serum. This process of adhesion of macrophages to larva is dependent on IL- 4 dependent alternate activation. We know from published results from our lab that the process of adhesion of macrophages is dependent on the presence of IgM. Following alternate activation there is an increase in cytophilic IgM on the surface of macrophages. Experiments shown in here demonstrate a close correlation between cytophilic IgM and the ability of macrophages to adhere to larvae in the presence of primed serum. ^ Macrophages are known to express the Fcα/μR for monomeric IgM. Here we demonstrate that macrophages also express the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) which binds J chain containing polymeric IgM. The clearance of larvae and the presence of adequate amounts of IgM on the surface of macrophages are dependent on the presence of J chain containing IgM. IgM receptors (Fcα/μR and pIgR) are upregulated in the following alternate activation and perhaps responsible for the increased cytophilic IgM. Kinetic analyses demonstrate coordinate, progressive upregulation of markers of alternate activation and IgM receptors following infection, leading to granuloma formation and <b>worm</b> <b>clearance.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Filarial {{nematode}} parasites {{are responsible}} {{for a number of}} devastating diseases in humans and animals. These include lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis that afflict 150 million people in the tropics and threaten the health of over one billion. The parasites possess intracellular bacteria, Wolbachia, which are needed for <b>worm</b> survival. <b>Clearance</b> of these bacteria with certain antibiotics leads to parasite death. These findings have pioneered the approach of using antibiotics to treat and control filarial infections. In the present study, we have investigated the cell division process in Wolbachia for new drug target discovery. We have identified the essential cell division protein FtsZ, which has a GTPase activity, as an attractive Wolbachia drug target. We describe the molecular characterization and catalytic properties of the enzyme and demonstrate that the GTPase activity is inhibited by the natural product, berberine, and small molecule inhibitors identified from a high-throughput screen. We also found that berberine was effective in reducing motility and reproduction in B. malayi parasites in vitro. Our results should facilitate the discovery of selective inhibitors of FtsZ as a novel antibiotic approach for controlling filarial infection...|$|R
40|$|Filariae are tissue-invasive {{nematodes}} {{that cause}} {{diseases such as}} elephantiasis and river blindness. The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize the role of histamine during Litomo-soides sigmodontis infection of BALB/c mice, a murine model of filariasis. Time course studies demonstrated that while expression of histidine decarboxylase mRNA increases throughout 12 weeks of infection, serum levels of histamine exhibit two peaks—one 30 min-utes after primary infection and one 8 weeks later. Interestingly, mice treated with fexofena-dine, a histamine receptor 1 inhibitor, demonstrated significantly reduced worm burden in infected mice compared to untreated infected controls. Although fexofenadine-treated mice had decreased antigen-specific IgE levels as well as lower splenocyte IL- 5 and IFNγ pro-duction, they exhibited a greater than fourfold rise in eosinophil numbers at the tissue site where adult L. sigmodontis <b>worms</b> reside. Fexofenadine-mediated <b>clearance</b> of L. sigmo-dontis worms was dependent on host eosinophils, as fexofenadine did not decrease worm burdens in eosinophil-deficient dblGATA mice. These findings suggest that histamine release induced by tissue invasive helminths may aid parasite survival by diminishing eosin...|$|R
40|$|Although hookworms {{are known}} to stimulate {{inflammatory}} responses in the intestinal mucosa of their hosts, there is little quantitative data on this aspect of infection. Here we report the results of experiments conducted in hamsters infected with Ancylostoma ceylanicum. Infection resulted in a marked increase in goblet cells in the intestinal mucosa, which was dependent {{on the number of}} adult worms present and was sustained as long as worms persisted (over 63 days) but returned to baseline levels within 7 days of the removal of worms by treatment with ivermectin. Increased mast cell responses were also recorded. Levels were again dependent on the intensity of worm burdens and lasted as long as 63 days after infection. When worms were eliminated, mast cell numbers took over 2 weeks to return to normal. Paneth cell numbers fell soon after infection, the degree of reduction being dependent on the <b>worm</b> burden. After <b>clearance</b> of <b>worms,</b> Paneth cell numbers returned to normal within a week, but then rebounded and numbers rose to higher levels than those in control naıve animals. The time course of the response was similar whether animals experienced a chronic low-intensity infection without loss of worms or a higher intensity infection during the course of which worm burdens were gradually reduced. Clearly, A. ceylanicum was able to induce a marked inflammatory response in its host’s intestine which was sustained for over 9 weeks after infection, and which hamsters appeared able to tolerate well. Our data draw attention to the resilience of hookworms which, unlike many other nematodes, are able to survive for many weeks in a highly inflamed intestinal tract...|$|R
