50|$|With {{a carbon}} content between 0.5% and 1.5%, tool steels are {{manufactured}} under carefully controlled conditions {{to produce the}} required quality. The presence of carbides in their matrix plays the dominant role in the qualities of tool steel. The four major alloying elements that form carbides in tool steel are: tungsten, chromium, vanadium and molybdenum. The rate of dissolution of the different carbides into the austenite form of the iron determines the high-temperature performance of steel (slower is better, making for a heat-resistant steel). Proper heat treatment of these steels is important for adequate performance. The manganese content is often kept low to minimize the possibility of cracking during <b>water</b> <b>quenching.</b>|$|E

They are used in production of larger parts or parts that require minimal distortion during hardening. The use of oil quenching and air-hardening helps reduce distortion, avoiding the higher stresses caused by the quicker <b>water</b> <b>quenching.</b> More alloying elements are used in these steels, {{as compared to the}} water-hardening class. These alloys increase the steels' hardenability, and thus require a less severe quenching process and as a result are less likely to crack.
