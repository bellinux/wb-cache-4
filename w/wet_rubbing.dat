30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} dyeing and {{antimicrobial}} properties of jute fiber with natural dye henna after treatment with biopolymer chitosan. The treatment {{was carried out}} by applying chitosan solution on the fiber followed by dyeing with henna dye. Then, the performance was assessed in terms of the depth of shade by measuring K/S value and colorfastness properties of chitosan-treated dyed fabric samples. It has been observed that chitosan-treated fabrics showed a higher depth of shade compared to untreated dyed samples. As far as colorfastness is concerned, the dyed samples with and without chitosan pretreatment exhibited almost similar dry rubbing fastness. However, chitosan-treated fabrics showed inferior fastness ratings for <b>wet</b> <b>rubbing</b> and washing, particularly for the fabrics with higher chitosan concentrations. Again, the experimental results demonstrated that the combination of chitosan and henna dye can significantly enhance the antibacterial activity of jute fiber against the organism Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

30|$|The {{colorfastness}} ratings against {{washing and}} perspiration in Tables  3 and 4 show that polyester fabrics dyed with henna dye have an almost identical fastness ratings of ‘very good’ to ‘excellent’ (within numerical grade 4 – 5 and 5) {{with a very}} little variation in the depth of shades. Again, no or a little staining of color onto adjacent multifiber fabric due to washing or perspiration signifies remarkable colorfastness properties of polyester fiber dyed with henna. Moreover, no significant change in color was observed in case of dry and <b>wet</b> <b>rubbing</b> of dyed fabric (Table  5). The excellent colorfastness properties against washing, perspiration and rubbing demonstrated by polyester fiber dyed with henna {{may be attributed to}} its highly crystalline structure and hydrophobic nature (Bhuiyan et al. 2017 a). High crystallinity can trap the dye molecules inside the fiber strongly while hydrophobicity restricts any entry of water molecules into the polymer system combined with a limited swelling during washing for the removal of excess dye molecules from fiber interior.|$|E

Polyphenols and ellagitannins are the main coloring components of the dye extract. Assessment of the effect of pH on dye adsorption showed an increase in adsorption capacity with decreasing pH. Effect of temperature on dye adsorption showed 80 °C as optimum temperature for wool dyeing with T. chebula dye extract. Two kinetic equations, namely pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order equations, were employed to investigate the adsorption rates. Pseudo second-order model provided the best fit (R 2 = 0. 9908) to the experimental data. The equilibrium adsorption data were fitted by Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The adsorption behavior accorded well (R 2 = 0. 9937) with Langmuir isotherm model.

Moreover, in case of dry rubbing (Table  4), all types of dyed samples have shown almost similar ratings; however, chitosan-treated samples with higher concentrations represent a lower rating (3 – 4) compared to untreated samples (4 – 5) for <b>wet</b> <b>rubbing.</b> In general, deeper shade shows inferior fastness to washing and rubbing than a lighter one on a similar type of fabric for the same dyestuff (Bhuiyan et al. 2013), because in case of deep shade, dye molecules are more saturated and tend to move out from the interior of the fiber due to washing. As discussed earlier, the chitosan present in the fabric enhances the dyesite causing higher absorption of dye resulting in a higher depth of shade. Hence, as a general consequence of achieving deeper shade, the chitosan-treated fabric samples have shown a slightly lower fastness rating in comparison to lighter, untreated fabric.|$|E

The methods of application of mordants used includes; pre-mordanting, simultaneous mordanting and post-mordanting. The effects on cotton analyzed are color fastness to; light, washing, wet and dry rubbing and color characteristics on CIELab color coordinates. Aqueous extraction method was used to extract the dye. Some selected mordants were used for dyeing viz; alum, ferrous sulphate 1, and iron water. In the control dyeing {{without the use of}} mordants, very good fastness were registered with the following fastness ratings; for washing (4 - 5), dry rubbing (5), <b>wet</b> <b>rubbing</b> (5) and light (4). The natural dye is a substantive dye since it registered very good fastness grades without the use of mordants. The use of mordants improved color fastness to light from ratings of (4) to (5) and (6) for iron water and ferrous sulphate and a poor fastness of (3) was recorded for alum.
