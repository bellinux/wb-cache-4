5|$|Acclaimed Southern novelist William Gilmore Simms {{declared}} the work utterly false, while others called the novel criminal and slanderous. Reactions {{ranged from a}} bookseller in Mobile, Alabama, being forced to leave town for selling the novel to threatening letters sent to Stowe (including a package containing a slave's severed ear). Many Southern <b>writers,</b> <b>like</b> Simms, soon wrote their own books in opposition to Stowe's novel.|$|E
5|$|The Heart of a Woman is {{the first}} time Angelou {{identifies}} with another female African-American writer. Her early literary influences were men, including James Weldon Johnson, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and William Shakespeare. Angelou has stated that she always admired women <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> Anne Spencer, Jessie Fauset, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston. Her choice of title for this book is an acknowledgment of her legacy as a Black woman writer.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the third act, Bart argues that modern <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> Steven Bochco, one of the creators of the television series NYPD Blue, are more talented than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that he sent The Simpsons staff some NYPD Blue merchandise. After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart, he leaves Bart's room by flying through the wall, causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function.|$|E

5|$|While German and Norwegian sources mostly {{give the}} same number and names of ships {{destroyed}} in Operation Leader, English-language authors are more split in their estimates. While <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> British aviation author Christopher Chant, American military historian Eric M. Hammel, American historian James P. Levy, British military historian Chris Mann, and American aviation author Barrett Tillman, list five ships as destroyed, others like American military historians Kermit Bonner and Spencer C. Tucker write that six ships were sunk.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, Vanity Fair {{writers and}} Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting for lunch at The Algonquin. Alexander Woollcott, acerbic critic and war correspondent, {{received}} a warm welcome from literary friends in 1919. They gathered in the Rose Room that afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange of ideas and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Edna Ferber were {{also a part of}} this August assembly; these individuals influenced <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. They founded The New Yorker magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day.|$|E
5|$|During {{the pulp}} era, {{explicit}} sexuality {{of any kind}} was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published {{felt that they had}} to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.|$|E
5000|$|Goldstein {{writes that}} Coffin [...] "reads the {{tradition}} {{as one that}} virtually excludes a woman <b>writer</b> <b>like</b> herself... {{the situation of the}} woman <b>writer...</b> is something <b>like</b> the position of women in her poems and stories... it is precarious, contingent, often dependent on men for favors." [...] Coffin usually portrays events and people from a woman's perspective, and her work has been featured in an anthology of women's voices.|$|R
50|$|Tom Maidhc O'Flaherty was an Irish Communist {{politician}} {{in the early}} 20th century and {{a supporter of the}} Trotskyist James P. Cannon. He was also a <b>writer,</b> <b>like</b> his famous younger brother Liam O'Flaherty. His father, Maidhc Ó Flaithearta, was a well-known Irish nationalist.|$|R
5000|$|John Collier died of {{a stroke}} on April 6, 1980, in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California. Near {{the end of his}} life, he wrote, [...] "I {{sometimes}} marvel that a third-rate <b>writer</b> <b>like</b> me has been able to palm himself off as a second-rate writer." ...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel narrative that reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, it provided a model for Mary Shelley's work. Like her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women <b>writers.</b> <b>Like</b> Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore-based Indian Movie News {{stated in}} 1957 that when Ganesan heard of Vasan's {{attempt to make}} a film {{adaptation}} on Kattabomman, he personally requested that he abandon the project; Vasan assented, and lent Ganesan important research materials on Kattabomman. Film historian Randor Guy contradicted this in his 1997 book Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema by stating that <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> Kothamangalam Subbu and Veppathur Kittoo were employed by Vasan to conduct extensive research on Kattabomman's life, but the only eligible choice to portray Kattabomman was Ganesan, who by then had become popular after Parasakthi (1952). Guy noted that Ganesan was hesitant to take up the role under Vasan's direction as he was earlier rejected by him for the role of a bodyguard in Chandralekha (1948), leading to Vasan dropping the project. But later on, Ganesan acted in Irumbu Thirai (1960), which was produced and directed by Vasan, and Motor Sundaram Pillai (1966), which was produced by him.|$|E
5|$|Early 20th {{scholarly}} {{analysis of}} American music tended to interpret European-derived classical traditions {{as the most}} worthy of study, with the folk, religious, and traditional musics of the common people denigrated as low-class and of little artistic or social worth. American music history was compared to the much longer historical record of European nations, and was found wanting, leading <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> the composer Arthur Farwell to ponder what sorts of musical traditions might arise from American culture, in his 1915 Music in America. In 1930, John Tasker Howard's Our American Music became a standard analysis, focusing on largely on concert music composed in the United States. Since the analysis of musicologist Charles Seeger in the mid-20th century, American music history has often been described as intimately related to perceptions of race and ancestry. Under this view, the diverse racial and ethnic background of the United States has both promoted a sense of musical separation between the races, while still fostering constant acculturation, as elements of European, African, and indigenous musics have shifted between fields. Gilbert Chase's America's Music, from the Pilgrims to the Present, {{was the first major}} work to examine the music of the entire United States, and recognize folk traditions as more culturally significant than music for the concert hall. Chase's analysis of a diverse American musical identity has remained the dominant view among the academic establishment. Until the 1960s and 1970s, however, most musical scholars in the United States continued to study European music, limiting themselves only to certain fields of American music, especially European-derived classical and operatic styles, and sometimes African American jazz. More modern musicologists and ethnomusicologists have studied subjects ranging from the national musical identity to the individual styles and techniques of specific communities in a particular time of American history. Prominent recent studies of American music include Charles Hamm's Music in the New World from 1983, and Richard Crawford's America's Musical Life from 2001.|$|E

25|$|Muslim <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> Sami Ameri {{argued that}} the Greek word for {{wonderful}} (θαυμαστή) in Matthew 21:42 and Mark 12:11 has a similar meaning to the Arabic word for Ahmad in Qur'an 61:6.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>writers</b> look <b>like</b> <b>writers</b> {{whether they}} want to or not. It is hard to say why - for they model their exteriors whimsically on Wall Street brokers, cattle kings or English explorers - but they all turn out looking <b>like</b> <b>writers,</b> as {{definitely}} typed as 'The Public' or 'The Profiteers' in the cartoons.

25|$|The {{seventeenth century}} {{was marked by}} the {{introduction}} of the Baroque in Portugal and is generally regarded as the century of literary decadence, despite the existence of <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> Father António Vieira, Padre Manuel Bernardes and Francisco Rodrigues Lobo.|$|E
25|$|This {{attitude}} {{which was}} to prevail {{throughout most of the}} nineteenth century was typified by <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> the Rev. Richard Polwhele, in his poem The Unsex'd Females (1798), although she escaped his personal criticism, being considered to have the proper attitude.|$|E
25|$|Many new young writers appeared, {{but due to}} {{financial}} constraints, only those who have gained a strong reputation could get the financial backing to publish their works. The Writers Association, which should, in principle, support these writers' efforts, hasn't undergone much change since 1989 and there is much controversy surrounding its activity and purpose. The most successful <b>writers,</b> <b>like</b> Mircea Cărtărescu, Horia-Roman Patapievici, Andrei Pleşu, Gabriel Liiceanu and Mircea Dinescu, are respected personalities in Romanian life, {{but they have to}} devote some of their would-be writing time to other activities, mainly journalism. The ties with the Romanian diaspora are now very strong and even foreign-language Romanian <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> Andrei Codrescu (who now writes primarily in English) are very popular.|$|E
5000|$|Historian Andrew Cayton said, [...] "Chernow is no {{ordinary}} <b>writer.</b> <b>Like</b> his popular biographies of John D.

60|$|There is, of course, {{something}} a little trivial {{in some of the}} instances I have quoted; but in a <b>writer</b> <b>like</b> Herodotus, who stands on the borderland between faith and rationalism, one likes to note even the most minute instances of the rise of the critical and sceptical spirit of inquiry.|$|R
50|$|The {{movement}} of the Maltsvetians is treated by Eduard Vilde (1865-1933) in the novel Prophet Maltsvet. Published in 1908, this was the third book of a trilogy that established Vilde as a <b>writer.</b> <b>Like</b> the others, it mixed fact and fiction, but was based on letters and notes of interviews with Crimean Estonians.|$|R
25|$|<b>Writers</b> <b>like</b> Leone (2005) and Yi et al. {{have also}} {{recently}} {{suggested that the}} emergy sustainability index has significant utility. In particular, Leone notes that while the GRI measures behavior, it fails to calculate supply constraints the emergy methodology aims to calculate.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from their}} {{religious}} influence, the Provincial Letters were popular {{as a literary}} work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
25|$|The main {{theological}} {{authorities of}} Babai were Theodore of Mopsuestia and Diodorus of Tarsus. He also relied on John Chrysostomos, the Cappadocian fathers and on Ephrem the Syrian, which were also {{accepted in the}} West. In his exegetical methods he synthesized between the rational Theodore and mystical <b>writers</b> <b>like</b> Evagrius.|$|E

6000|$|Mere chronological order, indeed, {{is almost}} as {{arbitrary}} as alphabetical order. To deal with Darwin, Dickens, Browning, in the sequence of the birthday book would be to forge about as real a chain as the [...] "Tacitus, Tolstoy, Tupper" [...] of a biographical dictionary. It might lend itself more, perhaps, to accuracy: and it might satisfy that school of critics who hold that every artist {{should be treated as}} a solitary craftsman, indifferent to the commonwealth and unconcerned about moral things. To write on that principle in the present case, however, would involve all those delicate difficulties, known to politicians, which beset the public defence of a doctrine which one heartily disbelieves. It is quite needless here to go into the old [...] "art for art's sake"--business, or explain at length why individual artists cannot be reviewed without reference to their traditions and creeds. It is enough to say that with other creeds they would have been, for literary purposes, other individuals. Their views do not, of course, make the brains in their heads any more than the ink in their pens. But it is equally evident that mere brain-power, without attributes or aims, a wheel revolving in the void, would be a subject about as entertaining as ink. The moment we differentiate the minds, we must differentiate by doctrines and moral sentiments. A mere sympathy for democratic merry-making and mourning will not make a man a <b>writer</b> <b>like</b> Dickens. But without that sympathy Dickens would not be a <b>writer</b> <b>like</b> Dickens; and probably not a writer at all. A mere conviction that Catholic thought is the clearest as well as the best disciplined, will not make a man a <b>writer</b> <b>like</b> Newman. But without that conviction Newman would not be a <b>writer</b> <b>like</b> Newman; and probably not a writer at all. It is useless for the æsthete (or any other anarchist) to urge the isolated individuality of the artist, apart from his attitude to his age. His attitude to his age is his individuality: men are never individual when alone.|$|R
