5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>as</b> early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home.

When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town.

The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E
