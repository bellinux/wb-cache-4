5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, {{though there is}} some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including social behavior, diet and life history.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus {{are the result of}} lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.|$|E

His mother particularly encouraged {{him to become a}} doctor. Qandil simultaneously took an interest in writing, Arabic calligraphy and foreign languages.|$|E

5|$|On 5 August, Pash {{received}} a secret message from Washington, D.C., {{reporting that the}} French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie had been sighted at his holiday home at L'Arcouest in Brittany. Joliot-Curie <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Alsos's wanted list, so Pash and CIC Special Agent Gerry Beatson set out to investigate {{in the wake of}} the advancing U.S. Third Army. They searched the University of Rennes and found some documents there on 9 August. On 11 August they reached the homes of Joliot-Curie, Francis Perrin, and Pierre Auger in the L'Arcouest area. Joliot-Curie was not home, but German snipers fired on them, and they had to wait until 12 August before they could search the house.|$|E
5|$|Trollope {{established}} himself at The Shannon Hotel, a long bow-fronted Georgian building, which was over 100 {{years old at}} that time.

Next to the post office was a two-roomed bungalow which was used by the Postal Surveyor and his new deputy as their working headquarters. This building is often erroneously considered to have been the residence of Trollope himself.|$|E

25|$|Smith-Dorrien's qualities as a {{commander}} {{meant he was}} one of few British commanders to enhance his reputation during this war. Smith-Dorrien was mentioned three times in despatches in the “London Gazette” (including by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902), and Ian Hamilton later wrote highly of his performance and his grasp of the men's morale, whilst Roberts also thought highly of his South Africa performance. He <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a list (21 September 1901) of eighteen successful commanders of columns or groups of columns, including Haig and Allenby, whom French commended to Lord Roberts.|$|E

There were also rumours that McMenemy had charged the whole team of cheating after a 3–0 defeat by Aston Villa in April 1982 to which Keegan took great exception. Although Keegan joined Saints' next pre–season tour, he had already decided {{to move on to}} seek a new challenge, and {{a few days before the}} start of the 1982–83 season he signed for Second Division Newcastle United for a fee of £100,000.|$|E

He left the Party of European Socialists and joined forces with The Green Group in the European Parliament, becoming the first Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) MEP. At the June 1999 European Parliament election, with voting {{on the basis of}} proportional representation throughout the United Kingdom, Kerr <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the SSP's party list for Scotland's seven European seats but the party's share of the vote was too low to secure his re-election as an MEP.|$|E
25|$|Eston {{was born}} into slavery as the {{youngest}} son of the slave Sally Hemings. As {{she was one of}} the six mixed-race children of Betty Hemings and John Wayles (Jefferson's father-in-law), she and her siblings were half-siblings to Jefferson's wife Martha Wayles and were three-quarters European in ancestry, as their mother had a white father. The historians Philip D. Morgan and Joshua D. Rothman have written about the numerous interracial relationships in the Wayles-Hemings-Jefferson families and the region, often with multiple generations repeating the pattern. The large Hemings family, with Betty Hemings as matriarch, <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the slave hierarchy at Monticello; its members working as domestic servants, chefs, craftsmen and artisans.|$|E
25|$|After an {{indifferent}} reception to his {{solo show}} in London, featuring mostly his nocturnes, Whistler abruptly decided {{he had had}} enough of London. He and Trixie moved to Paris in 1892 and resided at n° 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio at the top of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs in Montparnasse. He felt welcomed by Monet, Auguste Rodin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and by Stéphane Mallarmé, and he set himself up a large studio. He <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> his career when it was discovered that Trixie had cancer. They returned to London in February 1896, taking rooms at the Savoy Hotel while they sought medical treatment. He made drawings on lithographic transfer paper of the view of the River Thames, from the hotel window or balcony, as he sat with her. She died a few months later.|$|E

25|$|During a tag team {{match on}} April 3, 1983 {{he was injured}} by Dynamite Kid; two days later, {{he was forced to}} vacate the NWA World Junior Heavyweight title after it became clear that he would need time off to recuperate. However, once the {{determined}} Tiger Mask recovered, he regained his NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship by defeating Kuniaki Kobayashi on June 2, 1983, making him a simultaneous NWA/WWF Jr. champion for the second time. By 1983, however, Sayama started feeling dissatisfied as he hated the politics behind-the-scenes. As a result, he announced his retirement from active competition on August 12, 1983. It was a shock to the wrestling world, as Tiger Mask was going to retire while he <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> his game and as the holder of two Junior Heavyweight Championships. Both titles were declared vacant, as he became a trainer to martial arts fighters.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Rumford {{introduced}} assembly bill 1240, the Fair Housing Bill. It {{became known}} as the Rumford Fair Housing Bill, and its purpose was to outlaw discrimination in housing. The bill <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Governor Brown's legislative agenda, and it had been endorsed by the NAACP and the California Democratic Party. Nonetheless, it faced strong opposition and was amended several times before being passed by a vote of 47 to 24. When it reached the state senate, members of the Congress of Racial Equality occupied the rotunda of the California State Capitol. Rumford asked them to leave, but they refused. The bill was held up for three months, and the committee didn't hold a hearing on it until {{the last day of the}} session. Despite the opposition of the California Real Estate Association, the Apartment House Owners Association, and the Chamber of Commerce, the bill passed the senate and was signed into law by Governor Brown.|$|E
