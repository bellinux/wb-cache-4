It would have room for 4,500 to 5,300 spectators.

Council's commitment to build the facility resulted in IceDogs' owner Bill Burke promising to sign a 20-year lease with the city after he threatened to move his team if the city chose not to build a new arena.|$|E
25|$|Another area of land next to Moor Street {{railway station}} which was freed {{up by the}} {{demolition}} of Masshouse Circus <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>home</b> to a development named City Park Gate. Originally designed by Richard Rogers {{as part of the}} scheme for the Library of Birmingham, it was to have several residential towers however the architects pulled out when the library scheme was shelved. MAKE Architects have since been appointed. Island House and the nearby pub will be retained in the development however Eurodiscount Megastore, a large warehouse store, was demolished in November 2006. The development will be mainly residential and will form a gateway into the Eastside from the city centre. Phase 1 will be the phase covering the largest area and has a subphase known as Phase 1a which includes Island House. This will be the first phase to begin construction and will also include the subphase, Phase 2a. Phase 2 will begin construction after and this is the smallest phase. Phase 3 will be constructed last and will see the tallest building constructed. Two public squares will be created, one directly in front of Island House will be called Island Place, and the second will be between Phase 2a and Phase 2 and will be called Freeman Place. There will be numerous green roof gardens. The outline planning application was submitted on 29 November 2006 and a consultation process began in late December and ended on 3 January 2007.|$|E
25|$|When Israel {{was first}} {{established}} in 1948, {{it had the}} third-largest Jewish population in the world, after the United States and Soviet Union. In the 1970s, Israel surpassed the Soviet Union as having the second-largest Jewish population. In 2003, The Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics reported that Israel had surpassed the United States as the nation with the world's largest Jewish population. The report was contested by Professor Sergio DellaPergola of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Considered the greatest demographic expert on Jews, Della Pergola {{said it would take}} another three years to close the gap. In January 2006, Della Pergola stated that Israel now had more Jews than the United States, and Tel Aviv had replaced New York as the metropolitan area with the largest Jewish population in the world, while a major demographic study found that Israel's Jewish population surpassed that of the United States in 2008. Due to the decline of Diaspora Jewry as a result of intermarriage and assimilation, along with the steady growth of the Israeli Jewish population, it has been speculated that within about 20 years, most of the world's Jews will live in Israel. In March 2012, the Israeli Census Bureau of Statistics reported on behalf of Ynet has forecast that in 2019, Israel <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>home</b> to 6,940,000 Jews, 5.84 million which are non-haredi Jews living in Israel, compared with 5.27 million in 2009. The number is expected to grow to anywhere between 6.09 million and 9.95 million by 2059, marking a 16%–89% increase with the 2011 population. The Bureau also forecasts that the ultra-Orthodox population will number 1.1 million people by 2019, compared with 750,000 in 2009. By 2059, the projected Haredi Jewish population is estimated to between 2.73 million and 5.84 million, marking a 264%–686% increase. Thus the total projected Israeli Jewish population by 2059 is estimated to between 8.82 million and 15.790 million. In January 2014, it was reported by demographer Joseph Chamie that the projected population of Israeli Jews is expected to reach between 9.84 million by the year 2025 and 11.40 million by 2035.|$|E

500|$|During {{his final}} {{months in the}} Army, Presley started to {{experiment}} with new material and thinking ahead to his anticipated return to recording.

His friend Charlie Hodge taught Presley techniques to improve his breathing and expand his range. For inspiration, Presley used Roy Hamilton's [...] "I Believe" [...] and his version of [...] "Unchained Melody", the traditional Irish song [...] "Danny Boy", and Tony Martin's [...] "There's No Tomorrow" [...] (an English adaptation of [...] "'O sole mio").

After Presley failed several times to achieve the full voice ending of the song, Porter offered to splice it for him. Presley refused and tried the song until he achieved the desired ending. [...] "Girl Next Door Went A-Walking", was recorded in ten takes, followed by [...] "Thrill of Your Love". The non-album cut [...] "Are You Lonesome Tonight" [...] was followed by [...] "I <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Home</b> Again"—a duet with Hodge.

The fifth track is [...] "Dirty, Dirty Feeling", a song characterized by its [...] "raunchy rock sound" [...] and satirical humor; it was written by Leiber and Stoller, and had been previously discarded from the soundtrack of King Creole. [...] The final track on side one is [...] "Thrill of Your Love", on which Presley is accompanied by Cramer on the piano.|$|E
