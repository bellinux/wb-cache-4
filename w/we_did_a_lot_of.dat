25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

[...] "Vampires", a song on the album, also earned the band a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2002. With the release of Awake, Godsmack toured Europe supporting Limp Bizkit. Erna said at the time, [...] "We've been touring nonstop since August 1998, So most of Awake was written on tour while we were ping-ponging between America and Europe, building up the band. [...] "Ozzfest" [...] was actually the only big tour where we rode under someone else's wings; <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> work on our own."

[...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists.

Also, she had such a warm, sweet voice. She was everything that we could've hoped for Anna." [...] Co-director Chris Buck shared Lee's ideas, commenting, [...] "Kristen Bell for Anna was the very first person that we saw. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> casting to find Anna, but she just hit it out of the park.

[...] Idina Menzel was also surprised by her co-star's singing ability, stating that, [...] "I didn't know how great a singer she was. I quickly found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down." [...] Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for [...] "the rest of [...] life" [...] if she could. Anna's animator Becky Bresee commented that Bell's voice [...] "lends itself well, so you are taking bits and pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. So we took a cyberscan of the guy's body, and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So we had to do a full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E
500|$|McFeely {{said the}} writing process began {{in the middle of}} 2011, around the release of The First Avenger, with him and Markus [...] "noodling on in hopes {{that there would be a}} second one and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> just {{throwing}} stuff at the wall and seeing what stuck". The first few months of writing were a back and forth process with Marvel, but after an outline was finished, the story did not change much. They opted to set the story in the present day, and, after [...] "experimenting with flashback elements for more period World War II stuff", decided to abandon the flashbacks as [...] "it became unwieldy." [...] The film would be [...] "Cap versus the world we all live in today", while averting excessive comedy regarding the hero's time displacement, as Markus considered the Captain [...] "the most adaptive man on the planet." [...] The tone would be more grounded in reality despite the advanced technology to contrast the fantasy elements from both the first Captain America and The Avengers. Despite that, the comic book origins guaranteed that the film would not have verisimilitude. This still proved a challenge in the reveal of Arnim Zola, that had to be extensively rewritten to convey how [...] "this grounded espionage paranoid thriller suddenly screeches to a halt and you switch gears really quickly with this ghost in the machine" [...] that introduces more science fiction elements.|$|E

500|$|A {{reporter}} for the Daily Planet newspaper and the love interest of Clark Kent. Adams was selected {{from a list of}} actresses that included Olivia Wilde and Mila Kunis. [...] "There was a big, giant search for Lois," [...] Snyder said. [...] "For us, it was a big thing and obviously a really important role. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> auditioning, but we had this meeting with Amy Adams and after that I just felt she was perfect for it." [...] Adams auditioned for the role three times: once for the unproduced Superman: Flyby, and the second time for Superman Returns before landing the current role. Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011. While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, [...] "We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today. Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful." [...] On portraying Lois Lane, Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an [...] "independent, feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world."

500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit.

2500|$|Gillespie was criticised for {{defacing}} a Make Poverty History poster {{signed by}} all the acts at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005.

They had to flee Austria to escape Nazi persecution, and she believes in the Palestinian cause. To say we're anti-Semitic is a smear, so you'd better watch what you're saying. Because you oppose one country's government's policies doesn't mean to say that you hate all the people from that country. I don't like Bush or Putin or Tony Blair, but I don't hate American, Russian or British people. Most people are just trying hard to get by."

2500|$|Elastic's Creative Director Patrick Clair [...] "came up {{with the}} idea of making a red world that was {{revealed}} by liquid." [...] Simulating the CG liquid, which was meant to be an ambiguous reference to poison and blood that behaved like [...] "something in between liquid chocolate and tar", was difficult, with Clair saying [...] "It's hard to make an algorithm act [...] "insidious"". CG Lead Andrew Romatz elaborated that [...] "Developing the right consistency and behavior of the fluids was definitely a tricky process. Getting the scale to feel right was something that we had to play with quite a bit in simulation and also in lighting and texturing. Patrick wanted the sculptures we were forming to feel like miniatures, so <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> experimenting with scene scale and with camera settings, simulating depth of field to achieve that look." [...] Fluids Lead Miguel A. Salek stated that [...] "Each shot required custom flow maps to be painted on the sculptures, along with small attraction fields and thousands of tiny adjustments to achieve the shapes and behavior Patrick was looking for. In the end I simulated hundreds of tests and thousands of frames of fluids to achieve just the right balance for each shot." [...] Due to time constraints, references to Murdock's boxing history such as a punching bag and boxing ring were cut from the final sequence.
