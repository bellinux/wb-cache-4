5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. When the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided {{they have the}} generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E
5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern Hemisphere (the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> in the opposite direction at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly when the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> towards the animals, indicating {{the sense of}} smell {{is more important than}} sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E

5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> from {{one side or the}} other. When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b> Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E
500|$|The surface {{air that}} flows from these {{subtropical}} high-pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected {{toward the west}} in both hemispheres by the Coriolis effect. [...] These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. [...] Because winds are named for the direction from which the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing,</b> these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the Southern Hemisphere. The trade winds of both hemispheres meet at the doldrums.|$|E

2500|$|Leeway Angle (...) : The leeway drift {{direction}} {{minus the}} direction towards which the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> with a deflection {{to the right}} of downwind being positive and to the left being negative. A leeway angle of zero degrees indicates that the craft drifts directly downwind. See figure 1 and figure 2.|$|E
2500|$|Energy {{harnessed}} by {{wind turbines}} is intermittent, {{and is not}} a [...] "dispatchable" [...] source of power; its availability is based on whether the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> <b>blowing,</b> not whether electricity is needed. Turbines can be placed on ridges or bluffs to maximize the access of wind they have, but this also limits the locations where they can be placed. In this way, wind energy is not a particularly reliable source of energy. However, it can form part of the energy mix, which also includes power from other sources. Notably, the relative available output from wind and solar sources is often inversely proportional (balancing). Technology is also being developed to store excess energy, which can then make up for any deficits in supplies.|$|E
