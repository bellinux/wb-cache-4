5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers for The Progressive voluntarily {{underwent}} {{security reviews}} and were granted Q clearances {{that allowed them}} to access restricted nuclear information. Morland and The Progressives editors declined to obtain clearances, as {{they would have had to}} sign non-disclosure agreements that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> them from publishing the article. This resulted in the lawyers being restricted in their communications with their clients.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E

5|$|In October 1961, Nasser {{embarked}} on a major nationalization program for Egypt, believing the total adoption of socialism was the answer to his country's problems and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> Syria's secession. In order to organize and solidify his popular base with Egypt's citizens and counter the army's influence, Nasser introduced the National Charter in 1962 and a new constitution.

5|$|On 12 February 2003, Dechaineux was {{operating}} near her maximum safe diving depth {{off the coast}} of Western Australia when a seawater hose burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before the hose was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the water <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> Dechaineux from returning to the surface. The RAN recalled the Collins-class submarines to base after the incident; after engineers were unable to determine any flaws in the pipes that could have caused the incident, the maximum safe diving depth of the class was reduced.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{specialized}} mandibles, {{scientists believe that}} the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (probably for feeding behavior), and the rugose projections {{may have played a}} major role in nest excavation because the mandibles <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions with food, and they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
5|$|During the 1992 campaign, it was {{revealed}} that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.|$|E
25|$|While Siri was a {{favourite}} {{for election}} before the conclave, {{he failed to}} secure enough votes from traditionalist cardinals once the conclave started, because at 52 a long pontificate <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been anticipated, and his election <b>would</b> <b>have</b> likely <b>prevented</b> other cardinals who wished to be pope from being elected.|$|R
25|$|J. C.

50|$|Although {{the initial}} {{derailment}} {{was caused by}} a rail breaking beneath the train, the subsequent collision could <b>have</b> been <b>prevented</b> if the crew had obeyed operating rules that state that a thorough inspection of the train be made in the 40 minutes after the initial derailment.

5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> their use.|$|E
5|$|The fire, {{caused by}} the {{malfunction}} of a backup solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between 90 seconds and 14 minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} modules were immovable. The fire occurred during a crew rotation, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three. Access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats was blocked, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> escape by half of the crew. A similar incident had occurred on an earlier Mir expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for only a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
50|$|Reversers {{have been}} used in New South Wales {{especially}} to put starting signals to stop.

50|$|Following Annan 5 {{plan the}} Greek Cypriots <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> {{been allowed to}} {{make up more than}} 6% of the {{population}} in any single village in the Turkish controlled areas in the north thus they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>prevented</b> from setting up their own schools for their children and <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> even been able to give birth once this quota was reached.|$|R
5|$|Zigrasimecia {{is known}} for its unusual morphology, and most likely had habits no longer seen in extant species. It has a highly movable head that {{suggests}} mobility was an important factor for them (this is probably for feeding behavior). The morphology of the mandibles <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> nest excavation, so the rugose projections on the head may have provided assistance. There is no evidence that Cretaceous ants exhibited nesting behavior, although the queen caste in Z. tonsora suggests that a dealate queen was needed for creating nests. Also, Zigrasimecia and Gerontoformica ants coexisted with each other; this is evident as a recovered piece of amber showed both genera trapped inside. This means that the two ants may have shared some of their ecological niches and possibly interacted with each other through fighting.|$|E
5|$|Miller was {{discharged}} from the RAAF on 26 June 1946, {{and returned to his}} job at Vacuum Oil. Miller resented {{the fact that many of}} his colleagues had avoided the hazards of war and moved steadily up the ladder and regarded his job as demeaning. Under such circumstances, Miller contemplated quitting Australian cricket and accepting a professional contract with Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League, valued at £1,000 per year, for three seasons. With advertising and commercial commitments likely to triple this figure, playing in England would have been approximately ten times more lucrative than continuing in Australia. However, Miller was worried that his impulsive style would be curtailed by the pressures of professionalism. At that time, the Board of Control's policy stipulated that any player that signed with a professional league in England could not represent Australia. Miller's contract would see him in England until he was 30, effectively ending his career for Australia. Furthermore, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented</b> him from playing Australian football during the winter. Miller weighed it up and opted to sign the contract that tied him to Rawtenstall, with his duties to start with the onset of the English season in April 1947.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>prevented.</b> Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
40|$|Objective: In 1991, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Vitamin Study {{demonstrated}} that folic acid taken before pregnancy and in early pregnancy reduced {{the risk of}} a neural tube defect (NTD). We aimed to estimate the number of NTD pregnancies that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>prevented</b> if flour <b>had</b> been fortified with folic acid in the UK from 1998 as {{it had been in the}} USA. Design: Estimates of NTD prevalence, the preventive effect of folic acid and the proportion of women taking folic acid supplements before pregnancy were used to predict the number of NTD pregnancies that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>prevented</b> if folic acid fortification had been implemented. Setting: Eight congenital anomaly registers in England and Wales. Main outcome measures: The prevalence of pregnancies with an NTD in the UK and the number of these pregnancies that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>prevented</b> if folic acid fortification had been implemented. Results: From 1991 to 2012, the prevalence of NTD pregnancies was 1. 28 (95 % CI 1. 24 to 1. 31) per 1000 total births (19 % live births, 81 % terminations and 0. 5 % stillbirths and fetal deaths ? 20 ?weeks’ gestation). If the USA levels of folic acid fortification from 1998 onwards had been adopted in the UK, an estimated 2014 fewer NTD pregnancies <b>would</b> <b>have</b> occurred. Conclusions; Failure to implement folic acid fortification in the UK has caused, and continues to cause, avoidable terminations of pregnancy, stillbirths, neonatal deaths and permanent serious disability in surviving children. <br/...|$|R
