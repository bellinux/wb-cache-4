I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of my}} breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that {{it seemed to me that}} they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{mastery and}} world renown, Crane {{found it hard}} to make a living solely playing pool, and in 1957 began working as a Cadillac {{salesman}} at Valley Cadillac Inc. 333 East Avenue in Rochester, New York. He continued there for 17 years. According to Crane's daughter, at Rochester's annual auto show his dealership's exhibit featured a pool table at which Crane would run balls while answering questions. [...] "Working" [...] for a living was purely a choice of survival. In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1969, Crane said, [...] "If I had to make a choice between selling cars and playing pool, I'd choose pool... The only time I've ever been really happy is <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> a pool table." ...|$|E

Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress, but the Obama transition team said {{there was nothing wrong}} with it.

500|$|Potter {{produced}} two books per annum for Warne, but by 1910 she was juggling {{the demands of}} aging parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and her literary and artistic productivity began to decline. The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse was the only book Potter published in 1910. She wrote a friend on New Year's Day 1911: [...] "I did not succeed in finishing more than one book last year ... I find it very difficult lately to get the drawings done. I {{do not seem to be}} able to go into the country for a long enough time to do a sufficient amount of sketching and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Bowness last summer I spent most of my time upon the road going backwards & forwards to the farm [...] which was amusing, but not satisfactory for work." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Warne's death and the purchase of Hill Top, Potter produced tales and illustrations inspired by her farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages. She provided Warnes with two books per annum, but, by 1910, she was juggling the demands of ageing parents {{with the business of}} operating Hill Top, and, as a result, her literary and artistic productivity began to decline.

500|$|The {{stewards}} elected not to {{take any}} action over the incident between Prost and Heidfeld on the race's 44th lap. Heidfeld believed {{the origins of the}} accident came from both Andretti cars being released under the minimum pit stop time, saying he drove onto the pit lane alongside Félix da Costa and ceded the position to the Andretti driver. He additionally stated that Bird was also involved and remained ahead of him. Prost was resolute that the contact was avoidable had he been given enough space by Heidfeld. He was confident the stewards would agree with his point of view. [...] "I was on the kerb and he did not leave me any room at all <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> his side", he said. Evans thought after he was hit by Rosenqvist, he could not finish the race and felt his Jaguar would not survive such a collision in a similar scenario. Nevertheless, he was delighted with his first points-scoring finish in the series, saying: [...] "Those first points are always the hardest. We know we've not got the best package but we're making great progress and everyone should be really proud." [...] Jaguar team principal James Barclay said the incident was the moment when [...] "our hearts sunk". He felt there was no possibility of finishing the race but praised the strength of the Jaguar's monocoque.|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead {{focusing}} on {{work in the}} studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success. The Kinks' next single, [...] "Wonderboy", released {{in the spring of}} 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers. In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called Village Green. In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was Peter Frampton's group The Herd. [...] "In general, the teenyboppers were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances", commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, [...] "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again." [...] At the end of June, the Kinks released the single [...] "Days", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. [...] "I remember playing it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", Ray said. [...] "I played it to Brian, who used to be our roadie, and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone." [...] "Days" [...] reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|An entirely {{different}} type of person was Virendranath Chattopadhyay, member of a famous family in India. Popularly known as Chatto {{he was a very}} able and a very delightful person. He was always hard up, his clothes were very much the worse for wear and often he found it difficult to raise the wherewithal for a meal. But his humour and light heartedness never left him. He had been some years senior to me during my educational days in England. He was at Oxford <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Harrow. Since those days he had not returned to India and sometimes a fit of homesickness came to him when he longed to be back. All his home-ties had long been severed and it is quite certain that if he came to India he would feel unhappy and out of joint. But in spite of the passage of time the home pull remains. No exile can escape the malady of his tribe, that consumption of the soul, as Mazzini called it ... Of the few I met, the only persons who impressed me intellectually were Virendranath Chattopadhyay and M.N. Roy. Chatto was not, I believe, a regular communist, but he was communistically inclined.|$|E

Both programs have been so wonderful to me long after I played. I am a member of both Hall of Fames and that is very special." [...] Daley said his one disappointment about his college football career was that he never played on a team that beat Notre Dame. [...] In 1943 Michigan lost to Notre Dame, 35-12. [...] Despite 135 yards on 24 carries by Daley (the most yards gained on Notre Dame by any back in 1943), Michigan suffered its only loss to Notre Dame.
