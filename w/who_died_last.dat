500|$|The mystery writer J.A. Jance {{wrote in}} the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Yes, it's {{a bit of a}} shock to {{discover}} that some of the TV series' characters <b>who</b> <b>died</b> <b>last</b> season or the season before are back among the living between the covers of Lindsay's new book. Rita, Dexter's long-suffering wife who died a terrible death in a bathtub in last year's season finale, is alive and well and having a baby in Dexter Is Delicious. But my advice to readers is this: Don't quibble. Get over it. After all, fiction is an alternate universe to begin with, and Lindsay's dark, comedic fiction is an alternate universe once removed. Patrick McCann and Colin Wrinn were very upset about her death in Season 4 of the hit TV show, Dexter, but Colin Whelan did not care for her." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Swedish-language {{national}} Finnish newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet {{reported on}} the front page of its 23 December 1988 issue — two days after the bombing — that a State Department spokesperson in Washington, Phyllis Oakley, confirmed the details of the bomb threat to the Helsinki Embassy. The newspaper writes that, [...] "according the spokesperson, the anonymous telephone voice also stated that the bomb would be transported from Helsinki to Frankfurt and onwards to New York on Pan-Am's flight to the US. The person transporting the bomb would not themselves be aware of it, with the explosives hidden in that person's luggage." [...] The same news article reports that the US Embassy in Moscow also received the same threat on 5 December, adding that Finland's foreign ministry has found no evidence in its investigations of any link to the Lockerbie crash. [...] "The foreign ministry assumes that an Arab living in Finland is behind the phone threat to the US Embassy in Helsinki. According to the foreign ministry's sources, the Arab has phoned throughout the year with threatening calls to the Israeli and US embassies ," [...] wrote the paper. [...] "The man who rang the embassies claimed to belong to Abu Nidal's radical Palestinian faction that has been responsible for many terrorist actions. The man said that a bomb would be placed on board a Pan-Am plane by a woman." [...] The article continues, [...] "This has led to speculation that a Finnish woman placed the bomb aboard the downed aircraft. One of Abu Nidal's highest operative leaders, Samir Muhammed Khadir, <b>who</b> <b>died</b> <b>last</b> summer in a terrorist attack against the ship City of Poros, had lived outside Stockholm. He was married to a Finnish-born woman." ...|$|E
