5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered <b>with</b> <b>distilled,</b> reverse osmosis, or rain water.|$|E
5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly <b>with</b> <b>distilled</b> water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|The restorers {{washed the}} {{surfaces}} {{using a variety}} of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed <b>with</b> <b>distilled</b> water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of dimethylformamide. The final step was the application of a weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.|$|E

5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four jumping species take nectar, either by sucking free nectar {{from the surface}} of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in cycles of two to four minutes, then groomed their bodies and {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. A more formal part of the test showed that 90juvenile jumping spiders, including P. fimbriata, generally prefer to suck from blotting soaked with a 30% solution of sugar rather than paper soaked <b>with</b> <b>distilled</b> water. The authors suggest that, in the wild, nectar may be a frequent, convenient way to get some nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom) of predation. Jumping spiders may benefit from amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals normally found in nectar.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacture}} of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric heater. Following this, all other waxes are added, usually by descending order of melting point. While this wax is held at a constant temperature, the emulsion—a mixture of the various oils and, if used, fats, is then heated separately, at around 85°C. The heated emulsion is then added to the waxes, along <b>with</b> <b>distilled</b> water. When the mixture reaches around 80°C, turpentine oil is added. This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred for half an hour. Dyes are added and mixed in turpentine oil if it is not a neutral polish. The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50°C, and as its viscosity increases, it is poured through a closed funnel into a cooling chamber. The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly, providing uniform distribution. The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).|$|E

25|$|Another {{example for}} Koon's early work is The Equilibrium Series (1983), {{consisting}} {{of one to}} three basketballs floating in distilled water, a project the artist had researched {{with the help of}} Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. The Total Equilibrium Tanks are completely filled <b>with</b> <b>distilled</b> water and a small amount of ordinary salt, to assist the hollow balls in remaining suspended in the centre of the liquid. In a second version, the 50/50 Tanks, only half the tank is filled <b>with</b> <b>distilled</b> water, with the result that the balls float half in and half out of the water. In addition, Koons conceived and fabricated five unique works for the Encased series (1983–1993/98), sculptures consisting of stacked sporting balls with their original cardboard packaging in glass display case. Also part of the Equilibrium series are posters featuring basketball stars in Nike advertisements and 10 bronze objects, representing lifesaving gear.|$|E

40|$|Aromatherapy {{is a kind}} of {{treatment}} that used aroma with aromatherapy essential oil. Extraction process from essential oil generally doing in three methods, there are <b>distilling</b> <b>with</b> water (boiled), <b>distilling</b> <b>with</b> water and steam, and <b>distilling</b> <b>with</b> steam. One of the most favorite aroma is lavender. The main content from lavender is linalyl acetate and linalool (C 10 H 18 O). Linalool is main active contents in lavender which can use for anti-anxiety (relaxation). Based on some research, the conclusion indicates that essential oil from lavender can give relaxation (carminative), sedative, reduce anxiety level and increasing mood. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{years that}} {{followed}} its formation saw some rationalisation, <b>with</b> <b>distilling</b> ceasing at Daly's Distillery in 1869, and at the Green in the 1870s. Though both continued {{to be used as}} warehouses by the Cork Distilleries Company for several years. The Watercourse Distillery was also mothballed in the mid-1880s, so that {{by the turn of the}} century, only two of CDC's five distilleries, the North Mall and Midleton -remained in production.|$|R
30|$|Synthesis of the {{affinity}} adsorbents {{was carried}} using a two-step procedure as follows: i) Activation of agarose: Sepharose CL- 6 B beads (5 g) were thoroughly washed <b>with</b> double <b>distilled</b> {{water in a}} glass filter funnel and drained. The washed beads were suspended in 1 M NaOH solution (5 mL) and shaken on a rotary shaker (140 rpm, 25 °C, 120 min). The beads were washed <b>with</b> double <b>distilled</b> water to remove excess NaOH and 1, 4 -butanediol diglycidyl ether (5 mL) {{was added to the}} Sepharose CL- 6 B. The mixture was shaken at 140 rpm, 25 °C for 12 h.

This top layer was kept separate from the bottom copper sulfate layer by its lower density and by the polarity of the cell.|$|E
25|$|After distillation, the unaged brandy {{is placed}} into oak barrels to mature. Usually, brandies {{with a natural}} golden or brown colour are aged in oak casks (single-barrel aging). Some brandies, {{particularly}} those from Spain, are aged using the solera system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed <b>with</b> <b>distilled</b> water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel aging.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} {{winemaking}} {{that would become}} associated with Maury {{has its roots in}} the work of the Catalan alchemist and physician Arnaldus de Villa Nova. He perfected the technique of stopping fermentation <b>with</b> <b>distilled</b> alcohol in the late 13th century and was given an exclusive patent on the process by King James II of Majorca. In 1872, Roussillo politician François Aragon convinced the French government to legally recognize the style of vin doux naturels as wines which had residual sugar and sweetness retained from having their fermentation stopped with grape spirits. In 1936, the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) established Maury as an officially recognized AOC.|$|E

25|$|Consistent with {{principles}} of good laboratory practice, calibration is performed {{with at least}} two standard buffer solutions that span the range of pH values to be measured. For general purposes, buffers at pH 4.00 and pH 10.00 are suitable. The pH meter has one calibration control to set the meter reading equal to the value of the first standard buffer and a second control to adjust the meter reading to the value of the second buffer. A third control allows the temperature to be set. Standard buffer sachets, available from a variety of suppliers, usually document the temperature dependence of the buffer control. More precise measurements sometimes require calibration at three different pH values. Some pH meters provide built-in temperature-coefficient correction, with temperature thermocouples in the electrode probes. The calibration process correlates the voltage produced by the probe (approximately 0.06volts per pH unit) with the pH scale. Good laboratory practice dictates that, after each measurement, the probes are rinsed <b>with</b> <b>distilled</b> water or deionized water to remove any traces of the solution being measured, blotted with a scientific wipe to absorb any remaining water, which could dilute the sample and thus alter the reading, and then immersed in a storage solution suitable for the particular probe type.|$|E
