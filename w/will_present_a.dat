5|$|The game {{incorporates}} {{an inventory}} system for items that Sam picks {{up during the}} course of the game. Items can be used on other entities in the game world, or can often be combined with other inventory items to provide a new object necessary for solving a puzzle. Although Max's character will walk around the game's areas by his own will, Sam can also use Max at various points by using an inventory icon of Max's head on game objects—usually on characters where the solution to a problem involves violence. Sam and Max travel to different locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which when clicked on in-game <b>will</b> <b>present</b> <b>a</b> map of the United States with all the available locations the pair can travel to shown. As the game progresses, the number of locations on the map increases.|$|E

25|$|When tuning {{instruments}} {{that can produce}} sustained tones, beats can be readily recognized. Tuning two tones to a unison <b>will</b> <b>present</b> <b>a</b> peculiar effect: when the two tones are close in pitch but not identical, the difference in frequency generates the beating. The volume varies like in a tremolo as the sounds alternately interfere constructively and destructively. As the two tones gradually approach unison, the beating slows down and may become so slow as to be imperceptible.|$|E
500|$|After Pennant's death, the French {{zoologist}} and naturalist Georges Cuvier {{wrote of}} him [...] "When {{the life of}} a man is entirely devoted to the sciences, it cannot be expected that it <b>will</b> <b>present</b> <b>a</b> variety of incident; it will be found most truly in the analysis of his works." [...] Pennant is cited as an authority by Thomas Bewick throughout his pioneering field guide, A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804). For example, under [...] "The Golden Eagle", Bewick writes that [...] "Pennant says there are instances, though rare, of their having bred in Snowdon Hills". Bewick cites him for facts about rare species like [...] "The Sclavonian Grebe": [...] "This species is not numerous in the British Isles. Pennant says, they inhabit and breed in the fens near Spalding, in Lincolnshire, and that the female makes a nest not unlike that of the Crested Grebe, and lays four or five white eggs." [...] On occasion, Pennant's knowledge could be highly specific: for [...] "The Great-Crested Grebe", Bewick records that the nest [...] "is made of various kinds of dried fibres, stalks and leaves of water plants, and (Pennant says) of the roots of bugbane, stalks of water-lily, pond-weed and water-violet; when it happens to be blown from among the reeds, it floats about upon the surface of the water".|$|E

40|$|The Annales School {{emerged in}} France as a {{reaction}} against traditional writing of history. The School argued against narratives of events and defending an interdisciplianary position emphasized structural analyses.

Ricoeur, has asserted that a recounting of an even {{in the past is}} in fact a narration. Just like Ricoeur, the Annales School to challanges many other theories of writing of history.

2500|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{possible to find}} a single character indexed under multiple radicals. [...] For example, many dictionaries list 義 under either 羊 or 戈 (the radical of its lower part 我). [...] Furthermore, with digital dictionaries, {{it is now possible}} to search for characters by cross-reference. Using this [...] "multi-component method" [...] a relatively new development enabled by computing technology, the user can select all of a character's components from a table and the computer <b>will</b> <b>present</b> <b>a</b> list of matching characters. This eliminates the guesswork of choosing the correct radical and calculating the correct stroke count, and cuts down searching time significantly. [...] One can query for characters containing both 羊 and 戈, and get back only five characters (羢, 義, 儀, 羬 and [...] 羲) to search through. The Academia Sinica’s 漢字構形資料庫 Chinese character structure database also works this way, returning only seven characters in this instance. [...] Harbaugh's Chinese Characters dictionary similarly allows searches based on any component. Some modern computer dictionaries allow the user to draw characters with a mouse, stylus or finger, ideally tolerating a degree of imperfection, thus eliminating the problem of radical identification altogether.|$|E
2500|$|By 1985, {{there was}} a {{considerable}} amount of conflicts between band members. Lead singer Joey Ramone {{went so far as to}} withdraw from the writing process despite being a vital part of it on previous records. Joey recalled, [...] "I'd had it with the Ramones. 'Mental Hell' is about that. Part of it came from breaking up with [...] Angela. The other part of it was that I had really had it with the band." [...] In later interviews, however, Joey stated that it was not the conflict that made him stop writing, but rather he had [...] "ideas on the backburner." [...] Bassist Dee Dee Ramone said lead guitarist Johnny Ramone was the reason for much of the stress, supposedly not wanting to do songs Joey would write for multiple reasons. Dee Dee related: [...] "Joey <b>will</b> <b>present</b> <b>a</b> great tune and Johnny won't do it because it's this or it's that. 'I'm not going to play minor chords. I'm not going to play lead. I'm not going to come to England.' For God's sake! That's why Joey gotta do his solo album." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{estimates}} for the regular support of this branch of the service {{for the next year}} amount to a little less in the aggregate than those made for the current year; but some additional appropriations are asked for objects not included in the ordinary maintenance of the Navy, but believed to be of pressing importance at this time. It would, in my opinion, be wise at once to afford sufficient means for the immediate completion of the five double-turreted monitors now undergoing repairs, which must otherwise advance slowly, and only as money can be spared from current expenses. Supplemented by these, our Navy, armed with the destructive weapons of modern warfare, manned by our seamen, and in charge of our instructed officers, <b>will</b> <b>present</b> <b>a</b> force powerful for the home purposes of a responsible though peaceful nation.|$|E
60|$|One {{travelled}} {{through a}} choking dust under the blue sky, {{and above the}} steady incessant dusty succession of lorry, lorry, lorry, lorry that passed one by, one saw, looking up, the tree tops, house roofs, or the solid Venetian campanile {{of this or that}} wayside village. Once as we were coming out of the great grey portals of that beautiful old relic of a former school of fortification, Palmanova, the traffic became suddenly bright yellow, and for a kilometre or so we were passing nothing but Sicilian mule carts loaded with hay. These carts seem as strange among the grey shapes of modern war transport as a Chinese mandarin in painted silk would be. They are the most individual of things, all two-wheeled, all bright yellow and the same size it is true, but upon each there are they gayest of little paintings, such paintings as one sees in England at times upon an ice-cream barrow. Sometimes the picture <b>will</b> <b>present</b> <b>a</b> scriptural subject, sometimes a scene of opera, sometimes a dream landscape or a trophy of fruits or flowers, and the harness--now much out of repair--is studded with brass. Again and again I have passed strings of these gay carts; all Sicily must be swept of them.|$|E
60|$|Until {{the people}} who try to help realise this, their well-intentioned efforts will be futile, and they <b>will</b> <b>present</b> <b>a</b> {{spectacle}} fit only to set Olympus laughing. I have gone through an exhibition of Japanese art, got up for the poor of Whitechapel with the idea of elevating them, of begetting in them yearnings for the Beautiful and True and Good. Granting (what is not so) that the poor folk are thus taught to know and yearn after the Beautiful and True and Good, the foul facts of their existence and the social law that dooms one in three to a public-charity death, demonstrate that this knowledge and yearning will be only so much of an added curse to them. They will have so much more to forget than if they had never known and yearned. Did Destiny to-day bind me down to the life of an East End slave {{for the rest of my}} years, and did Destiny grant me but one wish, I should ask that I might forget all about the Beautiful and True and Good; that I might forget all I had learned from the open books, and forget the people I had known, the things I had heard, and the lands I had seen. And if Destiny didn't grant it, I am pretty confident that I should get drunk and forget it as often as possible.|$|E
