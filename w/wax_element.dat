50|$|Paraffin wax is an {{excellent}} material for storing heat, with a specific heat capacity of 2.14-2.9 J g−1 K−1 (joules per gram kelvin) and a heat of fusion of 200-220 J g−1. This property is exploited in modified drywall for home building material: {{a certain type of}} wax (with the right melting point) is infused in the drywall during manufacture so that it melts during the day, absorbing heat, and solidifies again at night, releasing the heat. Paraffin wax phase-change cooling coupled with retractable radiators was used to cool the electronics of the Lunar Rover. Wax expands considerably when it melts and this allows its use in <b>wax</b> <b>element</b> thermostats for industrial, domestic and, particularly, automobile purposes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wax</b> {{thermostatic}} <b>elements</b> transform {{heat energy}} into mechanical energy using the thermal expansion of waxes when they melt. This wax motor principle also finds applications besides engine cooling systems, including heating system thermostatic radiator valves, plumbing, industrial, and agriculture.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wax</b> {{thermostatic}} <b>element</b> {{was invented}} in 1936 by Sergius Vernet (1899-1968). Its principal application is in automotive thermostats used in the engine cooling system. The first applications in the plumbing and heating industries were in Sweden (1970) and in Switzerland (1971).|$|R
25|$|Handcrafted waxworks mostly {{focuses on}} {{decorative}} and scented candles. Decorative candles are those surrounded by sculpted <b>wax</b> decorative <b>elements,</b> which can overwhelm the actual candle itself. These elements {{come in a}} wide variety of shapes and colors, and the pieces are created for special events, often religious. In the State of Mexico, these are mostly made in Amecameca, Tenango del Valle and Toluca.|$|R
5000|$|Roman {{military}} {{tactics and}} strategy evolved from that {{typical of a}} small tribal host seeking local hegemony, to massive operations encompassing a world empire. This advance was affected by changing trends in Roman political, social and economic life, {{and that of the}} larger Mediterranean world, but it was also undergirded by a distinctive [...] "Roman way" [...] of war. This approach included a tendency towards standardization and systematization, practical borrowing, copying and adapting from outsiders, flexibility in tactics and methods, a strong sense of discipline, a ruthless persistence that sought comprehensive victory, and a cohesion brought about by the ideal of Roman citizenship under arms - embodied in the legion. These <b>elements</b> <b>waxed</b> and waned over time, but they form a distinct basis underlying Rome's rise.|$|R
40|$|The Copernicia prunifera (Miller) H. E. Moore or â€œcarnaubaâ€ {{generates a}} {{material}} from the leaves used in the wax production, raw material of countless industrial products. Brazil is the only producer of carnauba wax {{and the state of}} PiauÃ­, an important influential. In this, the natural conditions of the district of Campo Maior favor the incidence of the carnauba and its historical tradition in the wax production, turned it a regional pole. The general goal is to analyze, in the carnauba <b>wax</b> production, the <b>elements</b> and the eco-efficiency indicators - economical efficiency associated with low environmental impact. The specific goals are: to evaluate, qualitatively, the materials and energy consumption, toxic substances emissions, existence of recycling of materials and use of renewable resources; to build and to analyze eco-efficiency indicators. The information and data originated from direct research in a wax industry that represented the technical pattern and the participation in the market in the State. The results show that the industrial production of wax affect the environment with intensive use of water, use of wood and diesel as energy source, chemical products consumption and pollutants emissions, however, it attends important eco-efficiency elements as the recycling of materials and consumption of renewable materials.

30|$|Whilst the {{presence}} of a synthetic wax must be ascribed to the conservation of the fragments, {{the presence}} of beeswax is a somewhat complicated affair, as it is difficult to say whether this is a remnant of an original coating or a material added during conservation activities. It is known that beeswax was occasionally added to the artefacts after excavation as part of their conservation [46]. Petrie describes [69], p. 84 how he uses fresh beeswax to preserve the excavated mummy portraits from Fayum: “Many of the portraits were injured by damp but, by putting a coat of fresh beeswax on them, the old colour was revived and safely fixed, so that it would not drop away. In later years, paraffin wax was used for this purpose.” In another instance, he writes that he secured the stucco on a lid by coating it with melted beeswax [69]. It appears that Petrie tended to use paraffin wax (invented in the 1850 s) for this purpose rather than pure beeswax. He attests the use of paraffin wax on the Fayum mummy portraits in 1911 : “There is no preservative so satisfactory as flooding over with melted paraffin wax; this must be hot enough to penetrate the cracks freely, but not so hot to melt the ancient wax paint.” Petrie also used beeswax and paraffin wax to re-attach flaking gesso [70]. Several conservators have since used similar wax coatings for the conservation of wooden antiquities and mummy portraits, and the phenomenon is thus not exclusively related to Petrie. For example, A. Lucas recommends using paraffin wax for the consolidation of wooden antiquities [71, 72]. Paraffin wax was also used for Egyptian architecture: The Shrine of Taharqa (excavated in Nubia in 1931) in the Ashmolean was treated by conservators who removed as much of the previously applied cellulose nitrate as possible and replaced it with a thin coating of paraffin wax [73]. The paraffin wax was applied by either sprinkling, immersion or by brush in its molten state or as a solution in benzol wherever organic artefacts required consolidation. In fact, it became the standard field consolidation technique and remained so until the advent of synthetic polymers [74]. Since the use of beeswax as a consolidant is only attested for the mummy portraits, it appears likely that Petrie would rather have used paraffin <b>wax</b> for architectural <b>elements</b> such as the fragments from the Palace of Apries, however the use of beeswax obviously cannot be excluded, since he does not mention anything on the consolidants used on the finds from this particular site.|$|R
