5|$|The {{developers}} {{tried to}} redefine Lara Croft's actions by questioning {{what they felt}} the character was capable of. While previous games used hand-animated movement for the character, Underworld introduced motion capture-based animation to display more fluid, realistic movement and facial expressions. Stuntwoman and Olympic Gold medalist Heidi Moneymaker was the motion capture actress, and advised the designers on practical movements. Animators adjusted and blended the recorded animation to create seamless transitions between the separate moves and their simultaneous combinations. The blends and additional animations give the character more flexible movement. Actions were overlapped to allow for multitasking, such as aiming at two separate targets and shooting <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> the other holds an object collected from the environment. Other additions include more melee attacks, as well as contextual offensive and climbing manoeuvres. Crystal Dynamics sought to make the visual appearance of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions identical, although the systems use different techniques to achieve this. In response to Underworlds lackluster sales figures, Eidos reportedly considered altering the character's appearance to appeal more to female fans.|$|E
25|$|The fire {{became so}} intense that Rose was forced to crawl from {{position}} to position in order to treat the wounded, giving words of encouragement and directing the fire of the inexperienced and terrified Vietnamese and Montagnard troops. Over the next few days, the company marched west and deeper into Laos, fending off incessant attacks from elements ranging from squad-sized to company-sized, covered by Air Force gunships. On 12 September, during an assault by a NVA company-sized element, one of the Montagnards was wounded 40 to 50 meters outside the perimeter. Dodging enemy fire, Rose ran and crawled {{his way to the}} wounded man, shielding him with his own body while he treated him. He dragged the Montagnard back to the company <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> firing at the enemy with his gun in his other hand.|$|E
25|$|Shaw and Edwards (aged 18 and 17, respectively, at {{the time}} Alpha started) were skilled amateur magicians who managed to fool the {{researchers}} with fairly simple tricks during the first stages of investigations. The project had originally started with spoon bending, so the two quickly developed a way to accomplish this. Contrary {{to one of the}} caveats Randi noted in his letter, the test setup included not one, but many and all sorts of spoons on the table, labeled with paper on a loop of string instead of some permanent marking. When starting to bend a spoon, they would actually pick up two or more and remove the labels, which they were allowed to do, because they claimed they were in the way. They would then simply switch the labels when putting them back and wait. The spoons were measured before and after the experiment, and since all sorts of spoons were used, simply switching the labels would produce different measurements, causing the scientist to believe that something paranormal had occurred. In other cases, they would drop one of the spoons in their lap and bend it below the table <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>while</b> pretending to bend a spoon in their other hand, distracting the scientists.|$|E

500|$|Manual gas {{tungsten}} arc welding {{is a relatively}} difficult welding method, due to the coordination required by the welder. [...] Similar to torch welding, GTAW normally requires two hands, since most applications require that the welder manually feed a filler metal into the weld area <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> manipulating the welding torch in the other. Maintaining a short arc length, while preventing contact between the electrode and the workpiece, is also important.|$|E
500|$|... in {{line with}} {{orthodox}} animal rights theory, animals are owed some utility-trumping rights—a right not to suffer and a right not to be killed; but, {{in line with}} utilitarianism, [...] wants to promote well-being without giving animals a right to liberty {{in the sense of}} outright protection from ownership and use by humans. Cochrane thus successfully ‘decouples’ the rights-utilitarian dichotomy and locates his theory in the middle ground between the two. You might say he gives <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> taking away with the other.|$|E
500|$|American kestrels are bred {{in captivity}} {{for use in}} falconry, and are among the easier falcons to breed. [...] They are also {{sufficiently}} common that [...] "passage" [...] birds {{in their first year}} are relatively easy to trap. [...] Wild caught kestrels [...] "tame down" [...] fairly quickly. [...] They will usually be eating from a falconer's hand the day after capture, be training within a week, and be ready to hunt in three to five weeks. [...] A very tame American kestrel will allow itself to be picked up around the body <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>while</b> accepting tidbits from the other hand. Such tameness is very useful when checking or treating the bird for injury or illness.|$|E

500|$|Moving {{forward with}} his platoon, Derrick {{attacked}} a Japanese post {{that had been}} holding up the advance. He destroyed the position with grenades and ordered his second section around to the right flank. The section soon came under heavy machine gun and grenade fire from six Japanese posts. Clambering up the cliff face under heavy fire, Derrick held on <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> lobbing grenades into the weapon pits with the other, like [...] "a man... shooting for [...] goal at basketball". Climbing further up the cliff and {{in full view of}} the Japanese, Derrick continued to attack the posts with grenades before following up with accurate rifle fire. Within twenty minutes, he had reached the peak and cleared seven posts, while the demoralised Japanese defenders fled from their positions to the buildings of Sattelberg.|$|E
500|$|Although less {{dangerous}} than work below ground, some bal maidens suffered poor health. Tuberculosis and bronchitis were endemic in the mining communities, {{and would be}} exacerbated by constant exposure {{to high levels of}} mineral dust. Constant work with damp ore might have led to rheumatic problems. The extraction of arsenic from the tin and copper ores sometimes led to exposure to arsenic fumes. Constant bending, lifting, and carrying often led to muscular strains. The need to hold chunks of ore <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> hammering them with the other led to some bal maidens suffering permanent damage to their left hands. The noise generated by industrial machinery, particularly after the introduction of the steam engine, could cause hearing difficulties, with some groups of bal maidens developing private sign languages. Noxious fumes, notably arsenic, lead and antimony could cause [...] digestive problems, bowel disorders and amenorrhoea and other disruptions of the reproductive system. Barley hoggans also caused digestive problems.|$|E
500|$|Scenes of Hollywood cityscapes, {{as well as}} {{shots of}} heaven {{at the end of}} the film, were {{achieved}} through the creation of miniature sets that were filmed in long shots to give the appearance that they were large and expansive. A total of 45 sets were built in total, none larger than about two square feet, with the most expensive costing $1.67. It took days to prepare these sets. Florey cut cardboard from laundered shirts and shaped them into squares while Vorkapić painted them impressionistically to resemble buildings. The elevated trains in the cityscape scenes were actually toy trains Florey purchased and mounted on pasteboard runaways. He would pull them along the track on a string <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> he shot the scene with the other. Movement on the miniature sets was simulated by moving lamps and casting shadows. To make the miniature sets look more realistic and to conceal defects, prisms and kaleidoscopes were placed in front of the camera lens and moved during filming, and cylinder lens systems were used and rotated during shooting to magnify the image to the desired diameter. Florey said this was useful in [...] "giving the scenes the rhythms which we thought they required".|$|E
60|$|Claude Locker, {{his arms}} folded around a mass of thorny roses, {{and a pair of}} {{scissors}} dangling from one finger, stood and gazed with savage intensity at the dapper little man--black eyes, waxed mustache, dressed in the height of fashion--who, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> outstretched, <b>while</b> the other held his hat, advanced with smiles and bows to meet the lady of the house. Locker had seen him before; he had met him in Washington; and he had received forty dollars for a poem of which this Austrian young person was the subject.|$|R

Price struggles with day-to-day things, like learning to unbutton her clothing <b>with</b> only <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>while</b> trying to resume her job as a crippled P.E. teacher and basketball coach. Yates is unemployed, having lost his job at a gun shop during his deployment.

She raised her head, and then, touching the strings with both her hands, she poured forth tones of deep, yet thrilling power.|$|R
500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, but I bet you that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E

50|$|The chipan (also spelled cipan or jipan) is a battle-axe, the weaponised {{form of the}} {{domestic}} kapak (axe) or beliong (hatchet).

5000|$|Historically, khridoli was a name of one-handed boxing, {{especially}} {{popular in}} old Tbilisi as documented by the writer Ioseb Grishashvili in his historical dictionary of the city. In {{one type of}} khridoli dueling, the challenger had to fight <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> tied, <b>while</b> the challenged man had a privilege to use both of his hands. After Georgia became independent of the Soviet Union, a revived interest in old martial arts led to the foundation of Khridoli Federation in 1993. In 2014, khridoli, along with lelo burti, a local variant of rugby, was inscribed {{by the government of}} Georgia as a [...] "nonmaterial monument" [...] of culture.|$|R

2500|$|The theorbo is a plucked string {{instrument}} of the lute family, with an extended neck and a second pegbox. Like a lute, a theorbo has a curved-back sound box (a hollow box) with a wooden top, typically with a sound hole, and a neck extending out from the soundbox. As with the lute, the player plucks or strums the strings <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> [...] "fretting" [...] (pressing down) the strings with the other hand; pressing the strings in different places on the neck produces different pitches (notes), thus enabling the performer to play chords, basslines and melodies.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{proceeded}} to Beijing and used all his influence to ensure peace. Gordon clashed repeatedly with Prince Chun, {{the leader of}} the war party in Beijing who rejected Gordon's advice to seek a compromise solution as Gordon warned that the powerful Russian naval squadron in the Yellow Sea would allow the Russians to land at Tianjin and advance on Beijing. At one point during a meeting with the Council of Ministers, an enraged Gordon picked up a Chinese-English dictionary, looked up the word idiocy, and then pointed at the equivalent Chinese word 白痴 <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> pointing at the ministers with the other.|$|E
2500|$|His {{nickname}} [...] "Pipette" [...] was {{a reference}} to his smoking habits, which at several stages saw him smoking on the field. Quite famously {{in a game against}} Wigan (which was played in a snowstorm), he actually caught the ball <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> holding a cigarette in the other hand. While he often had unusual habits for a sportsman, there was no denying his talent, he was a master at kicking in play and in overall attack he was both unorthodox and unpredictable. Aside from his playing skill, he developed a reputation based on his somewhat eccentric attitude or charismatic manner. He was known to not tackle a player if he believed it would demonstrate the fault of his team-mates for not previously making the tackle, a cause of some controversy during his career.|$|E

As he stood there, clad in a leather suit, with his pliers and other tools dangling from his brown belt, he was a figure to please the eye of an artist. The man was very tall and gaunt, with great straggling limbs and every appearance of giant strength. His face was a remarkable one, noble and yet sinister, with dark eyes and hair, a prominent hooked nose, and a beard which flowed over his chest. He steadied himself <b>with</b> <b>one</b> knotted <b>hand,</b> <b>while</b> the other held a steel hammer dangling by his knee.|$|R
50|$|It {{is highly}} {{questionable}} whether Guan Yu actually wielded the Green Dragon {{or whether it}} was merely part of the myths surrounding him. Valid historical texts from his time period made no mention of him or anyone wielding a similar weapon. Because the guandao was known not to be widely used until the Song Dynasty, there is some doubt as to whether the guandao existed during Guan Yu's time. The guandao may not have been very widely used because it was both difficult to wield and heavy (Guan Yu, reportedly, was able to wield it with agility <b>with</b> just <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>while</b> most people would have trouble using it effectively even with both hands). However, {{this may be due to}} the legend of the weight surrounding the blade, whereas in reality, it was much lighter.|$|R

2500|$|Van Halen used {{a volume}} {{technique}} in the instrumental [...] "Cathedral". He hammered {{notes on the}} fretboard <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> rolling the volume knob with the other. [...] This altered the attack and decay of the notes so they mimicked the sound of keyboards. [...] This [...] "volume swells" [...] sound (also known as [...] "violining," [...] because of the sound) was originally popularized by 1970s progressive rock bands like Genesis (Steve Hackett), Focus (Jan Akkerman), Yes (Steve Howe), and Rush (Alex Lifeson), but it was usually performed with a volume pedal at a slower pace. Cathedral also employs an electronic delay, set at 400 ms, and the delayed note set at the same amplitude as the original note. [...] Most of the composition's notes come from hammering on the notes of a major fifth string barre chord (ascending and then descending) and replicating this pattern {{up and down the}} neck of the guitar. The end result of this technique make the composition sound as if it is being played on a church or cathedral organ.|$|E
2500|$|A lute [...] ( [...] , or [...] ) is any plucked string {{instrument}} with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) {{and a deep}} round back enclosing a hollow cavity, usually with a sound hole or opening in the body. More specifically, the term [...] "lute" [...] can refer to an instrument from the family of European lutes. The term also refers generally to any {{string instrument}} having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the Hornbostel–Sachs system). The strings are attached to pegs or posts {{at the end of}} the neck, which have some type of turning mechanism to enable the player to tighten the tension on the string or loosen the tension before playing (which respectively raise or lower the pitch of a string), so that each string is tuned to a specific pitch (or note). The lute is plucked or strummed <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>while</b> the other hand [...] "frets" [...] (presses down) the strings on the neck's fingerboard. By pressing the strings on different places of the fingerboard, the player can shorten or lengthen the part of the string that is vibrating, thus producing higher or lower pitches (notes).|$|E
2500|$|A fly reel is a single-action reel, {{normally}} {{operated by}} stripping line off the reel <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>while</b> casting the rod {{with the other}} hand. [...] The main purpose of a fly reel is to store line, provide smooth uninterrupted tension (drag) when a fish makes a long run, and counterbalance the weight of your fly rod when casting. [...] When used in fly fishing, the fly reel or fly casting reel has traditionally been rather simple in terms of mechanical construction, and little has changed from the design patented by Charles F. Orvis of Vermont in 1874. Orvis first introduced {{the idea of using}} light metals with multiple perforated holes to construct the housing, resulting in a lighter reel that also allowed the spooled fly line to dry more quickly than a conventional, solid-sided design. [...] Early fly reels placed the crank handle {{on the right side of}} the reel. [...] Most had no drag mechanism, but were fitted with a click/pawl mechanism intended to keep the reel from overrunning when line was pulled from the spool. [...] To slow a fish, the angler simply applied hand pressure to the rim of the revolving spool (known as [...] "palming the rim"). [...] Later, these click/pawl mechanisms were modified to provide a limited adjustable drag of sorts. [...] Although adequate for smaller fish, these did not possess a wide adjustment range or the power to slow larger fish.|$|E

We are developing a handheld, dexterous surgical robot that can be controlled <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> only, <b>while</b> standing at the operating table. The instrument is composed of a master part (the handle) and a slave part (the tip). This work compares the performance of different control modes, i. e. different ways to map the degrees of freedom of the handle to those of the tip. We ask users to drive the tip along complex trajectories in a virtual environment, using the real master to drive a simulated slave, and assess their performance. Results show that, concerning time, users with no training in laparoscopy prefer a direct mapping of position and orientation, like in free hand motion. However, users trained in laparoscopy perform equally fast with our hand-held robot and, concerning precision, make a smaller number of errors...|$|R

60|$|At {{this moment}} an {{incident}} befell him {{which must have}} been trying to his self-command. The new American ship Nipsic entered Laulii Bay; her commander, Mullan, boarded the Adler to protest, succeeded in wresting from Knappe a period of delay in order that the women might be spared, and sent a lieutenant to Mataafa with a warning. The camp was already excited by the news and the trophies of Fangalii. Already Tamasese and Lotoanuu seemed secondary objectives to the Germans and Apia. Mullan's message put an end to hesitation. Laulii was evacuated. The troops streamed westward by the mountain side, and took up the same day a strong position about Tanungamanono and Mangiangi, some two miles behind Apia, which they threatened <b>with</b> the <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>while</b> <b>with</b> the other they continued to draw their supplies from the devoted plantations of the German firm. Laulii, when it was shelled, was empty.
