By the 1860s things changed, as water fetched from Årstaviken, the waters south of Södermalm, was treated in the first <b>water-purifying</b> <b>plant</b> at Skanstull and from there distributed through water mains.|$|E

On top, <b>water-purifying</b> <b>plants</b> (as Iris pseudacorus and Sparganium erectum) are placed. Usually, around 1/4 of the dimension of lavastone is required to purify the water and just like slow sand filters, a series of herringbone drains are placed (with lava filters these are placed at the bottom layer).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>water-purifying</b> <b>plants</b> {{used with}} {{constantly}} submerged, planted, lavafilters (e.g. treatment ponds, self-purifying irrigation reservoirs, ...) include {{a wide variety}} of plants, depending on the local climate and geoographical location. Plants are usually chosen which are indigenous in that location for environmental reasons and optimum workings of the system. In addition to <b>water-purifying</b> (de-nutrifying) <b>plants,</b> plants that supply oxygen, and shade are also added in ecologic water catchments, ponds, ... This to allow a complete ecosystem to form. Finally, in addition to plants, locally grown bacteria and non-predatory fish are also added to eliminate pests. The bacteria are usually grown locally by submerging straw in water and allowing it to form bacteria (arriving from the surrounding atmosphere). The plants used (placed on an area 1/4 of the water mass) are divided in 4 separate water depth-zones; knowingly: ...|$|R
50|$|When being {{designed}} {{there are}} several factors that go into planning the build such as climate of the region, cost {{and the best way}} to process the waste in the water. Once the pond has been designed the next thing that must be considered is the location of the pond. The size depends on the type of wastewater entering the pond, the type of pond and location in order to begin to size it. Depths usually range from between four and twenty feet deep with the type of bacteria and total amount of waste the plant must treat being the determining factor in the design of depth. With a key factor in determination of size being how much wastewater is going to be treated by the pond the question of how much surface area is needed varies from a few thousand feet to many acres. Anaerobic ponds must be designed to be far deeper than either aerobic or facultative ponds, this is in order to decrease the oxygen levels in the deeper parts of the ponds so the bacteria can do their jobs, eating the waste. Aerobic ponds must be shallower with a great surface area so that more oxygen can dissolve into the water giving the bacteria enough oxygen to properly function. Facultative ponds meet somewhere in the middle in their design with a large surface area and a fairly deep design to allow for both bacteria to function properly.Usually, common reed or Phragmites australis are used in treatment ponds (e.g., in greywater treatment systems to purify wastewater). In self-purifying water reservoirs (used to purify rainwater), other plants are used as well. These reservoirs need to be filled with 1/4 lavastones and <b>water-purifying</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
