This is the titular prophecy of the series (A Vision of Shadows). When receiving this prophecy, Jayfeather sees Alderkit (Alderpaw's former name) in his dream, {{as well as the}} other medicine cats. Later him, Leafpool, and Bramblestar decide that Alderpaw should become a medicine cat apprentice. Further into the book, Alderpaw has a vision of the far-off SkyClan. After deciding that Alderpaw's vision relates to the prophecy, Bramblestar sends Alderpaw on a quest to help SkyClan along with his ex-mentor, Molewhisker, Sandstorm, his sister Sparkpaw, and her mentor Cherryfall. While on the quest, they're joined by ShadowClan apprentice Needlepaw. Sandstorm dies along the way. When they reach the gorge where SkyClan lives, they find that they have been run out of their territory by a group of rogues. They decide that they arrived too late to help SkyClan and return back to the lake. On the way back Alderpaw and Needlepaw find two female kits (Twigkit and Violetkit) who lost their mother. Needlepaw suggests that the kits could be [...] "what you find in the shadows". They then take the kits back to the lake and at a full moon Gathering, the clan leaders decide that ShadowClan should take one kit and ThunderClan should take the other.

Chen {{would go into}} the Chinese countryside and attempt to make small farmers [...] "banking-conscious", as observed by a Chartered Bank manager who accompanied Chen on one of his stints. [...] "Don't go to Sinkiang. It's a very hard tripâ€”even dangerous. And when you come back, no one will believe <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> there."

6000|$|... 'And <b>what</b> do <b>you</b> <b>find</b> {{to do with}} {{yourself}} here?' Mrs. Swancourt said, after a few remarks about the wedding. 'You ride, I know.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But I don't see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> to like in it, Joe," [...] {{she said}} softly, the note of insistence {{in her words}} betraying recent and {{unsatisfactory}} discussion.|$|E
60|$|Dom. You take {{a mighty}} {{pleasure}} in defamation, colonel; but I wonder <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> in running restless up and down, breaking your brains, emptying your purse, and wearing out your body, with hunting after unlawful game.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not! And tell me <b>what</b> {{connection}} <b>you</b> <b>find</b> {{between these}} fancies of yours and that room? Why {{do you come}} and listen here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Polly's? Oh, yes; she {{is really}} steady-going. That is just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will <b>find</b> her. This is a charming room, sister; thank you very much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Presently, Janet, presently. But now, {{take this}} key, {{go up to}} the black chest in the garret, and bring me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will <b>find</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We found {{indications}} of gold, copper, {{and one or}} two other metals, besides petroleum, but didn't see anything that looked worth taking up. Considering the cost of transport, you want to strike it pretty rich before <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> will pay as a business proposition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lupex! But hush, never mind. I {{should not}} have allowed myself to be betrayed into an {{expression}} of feeling. Here's your friend Mr Cradell. Do you know I sometimes wonder <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> in that man to be so fond of him." [...] Miss Spruce saw it all, and heard it all, and positively resolved upon moving herself to those two small rooms at Dulwich.|$|E

[...] "And for that matter, I don't see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> in me compared with him. This is honest.

6000|$|... "It is not lost, Little Flower. I see it; {{you have}} it now. Put your hand {{into the pocket of}} your dress. <b>What</b> do <b>you</b> <b>find</b> there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you will}} not, either of you, be {{disappointed}} in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> in that packet.

6000|$|... "How {{well you}} read me, you witch!" [...] {{interposed}} Mr. Rochester: [...] "but <b>what</b> did <b>you</b> <b>find</b> in the veil besides its embroidery? Did <b>you</b> <b>find</b> poison, or a dagger, {{that you look}} so mournful now?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "He didn't {{tell me this}} {{himself but}} I'm 98% sure the reason is this: <b>what</b> would <b>you</b> <b>find</b> behind a camel? A monumental pile of shit." [...] Nigel Gray ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Bloom stooped {{and turned}} over {{a piece of paper}} on the strand. He brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go. Better. I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and pebbles. Who could count them? Never know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find.</b> Bottle with story of a {{treasure}} in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children always want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters. What's this? Bit of stick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes!" [...] she replied, graciously. [...] "I have {{an answer}} ready for you. You are so abrupt. Listen to what I propose. We will go {{together}} to your office and see whether {{it is true that}} Mr. Weatherley has not returned. If he has really disappeared, and I think that anything which I can tell you will help, perhaps then I will do as you ask. It depends a great deal upon <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> in those papers. Shall we go now, or would you like to stay here a little longer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} young, my boy," [...] he said, [...] "very young indeed. Perhaps {{that is my}} fault for not having let you {{see more of the}} world. You have got some very queer ideas into your head. A little too much novel reading lately, eh? I might treat you differently. I might laugh at you and send you out of the room. I won't. I'll tell you what you ask. I'll explain <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> so mysterious. The person to whom I have been {{speaking}} is my stockbroker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come here," [...] I said to him. [...] "Come here {{while my}} friend trusses {{you up in}} proper fashion. <b>What</b> can <b>you</b> <b>find</b> there to tie him with, Jim?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Give it me, for <b>what</b> did <b>you</b> <b>find</b> {{in the bag}} [...] But {{the straw}} and the broken delf and the bits of dirty rag [...] You'd taken for good money? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I inquire," [...] I asked politely, [...] "in <b>what</b> respect <b>you</b> <b>find</b> my {{presence}} there undesirable? We are not bound, I presume, to come much {{into contact with}} one another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{found myself}} {{now in a}} haven of peace. I was among worthy kind-hearted people, who felt for my distresses, and treated me most indulgently. Indeed, through all my troubles, I must say I have found one thing hold good. In my experience, I have {{observed}} that people are oftener quick than not to feel a human compassion for others in distress. Also, that they mostly see plain enough what's hard and cruel and unfair on them in the governing of the country which they help to keep going. But once ask them to get on from sitting down and grumbling about it, to rising up and setting it right, {{and what do you}} find them? As helpless as a flock of sheep--that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have a {{favor to}} ask," [...] she said, [...] "and a proof of {{confidence}} in you to offer. Will you be so good as to look over <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> in my portfolio? I am unwilling {{to give up the}} hopes that I had founded on our interview, when I asked for it. The letters will, I venture to think, plead my cause more convincingly than I was able to plead it for myself. I wish to forget what passed between us, to the last word. To the last word," [...] she repeated emphatically--with a look which sufficiently informed me that I had not been betrayed to her father yet. [...] "Will you indulge me?" [...] she asked, and offered her portfolio for the second time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope I am!" [...] said Miss Fane, {{in rather}} a serious tone. [...] "I wish I could also he mistaken in my suspicions of the mode in which Albert spends his time. He is sadly changed. For {{the first month}} that we were here he seemed to prefer {{nothing in the world}} to our society, and now--I was nearly saying that we had not seen him for one single evening these three weeks. I cannot {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> at this house of such absorbing interest. Although I know you think I am much mistaken in my suspicions, still I feel very anxious. I spoke to Albert to-day; but he scarcely answered me; or said that which it was a pleasure for me to forget." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you want}} of us?" [...] cried Mr. Harding. [...] "If it's money, take <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can <b>find</b> aboard us, and go on your way. No one will hinder you." ...|$|R
60|$|Flo.

6000|$|... "One disbelieves {{in nothing}} up yonder," [...] Thirlwell tactfully replied. [...] "It's {{a country of}} surprises; <b>you</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> may <b>find.</b> Besides, there is some silver--I'm now sinking a shaft--" ...|$|R
