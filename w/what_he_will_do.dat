500|$|Reagan {{appeared}} {{as an actor}} and spokesperson on spoken word recordings as early as 1958 and was first pictured on album covers in the early 1960s. One notable recording was Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine, a 1961 Cold War propaganda piece sponsored by the American Medical Association. In his speech, Reagan purports that Social Security is a socialist attempt to supplant private savings, and eventually concludes that, [...] "Pretty soon your son won't decide when he's in school, where he will go or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> for a living.

500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Two Weeks" [...] {{within a week}} of the episode's original release. In one minute-long clip, Michael asks Darryl for warehousing advice for his new paper company; Darryl gives Michael encouraging words about the new business venture before admitting, [...] "I'm messing with you. This doesn't sound like a good idea." [...] In a second one-minute clip, Michael tries stealing office supplies from the Dunder Mifflin office for his new company, until he is caught by Charles, who literally chases him out of the office; Charles then tries to describe what Michael's like to the camera but finds himself shocked into silence. In a final 38-second clip, Kelly visits Michael's office to ask <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> with his life, then starts talking about her own fantasy of running off to Mexico with Charles. B. J. Novak wrote a talking-head segment for Toby, where he compares Michael to a movie on a plane because [...] "it's not great, but it's something to watch, and when it's over you're like, how much longer is this flight? Now what?" ...|$|E
500|$|Lincoln's {{declared}} philosophy on court nominations {{was that}} [...] "we cannot ask a man <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>do,</b> {{and if we}} should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known." [...] Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. Noah Haynes Swayne, nominated January 21, 1862, and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. Samuel Freeman Miller, nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862, and appointed December 8, 1862, had {{also served as a}} judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863, and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.|$|E
500|$|Many {{have given}} {{suggestions}} as Jason's motivation for killing. Ken Kirzinger refers to Jason as a [...] "psychotic mama's boy gone horribly awry...very resilient. You can't kill him, but he feels pain, just not like everyone else." [...] Kirzinger {{goes on to}} say that Jason is a [...] "psycho-savant", and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and not anything personal. Andrew O'Hehir has stated, [...] "Coursing hormones act, of course, as smelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of William Bennett-style values." [...] Todd Farmer, writer for Jason X, wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life. Whatever his motivations, Kane Hodder believes there is a limit to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>do.</b> According to Hodder, Jason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when Jason Takes Manhattan called for Hodder to kick the lead character's dog, Hodder refused, stating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he is not bad enough to hurt animals. Another example from Jason Takes Manhattan, involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife, however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting up his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in Jason Lives, stating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child.|$|E

2500|$|Wolverine will {{sometimes}} lapse into a [...] "berserker rage" [...] while in close combat. In this state he lashes {{out with the}} intensity and aggression of an enraged animal and is even more resistant to psionic attack. Though he loathes it, he acknowledges that it has saved his life many times, it being most notably useful when he faced the telepathic 'Mister X', as X's ability to read his mind and predict his next move in a fight was useless as not even Wolverine knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> next in his berserk state. Despite his apparent ease at taking lives, he mournfully regrets and does not enjoy killing or giving in to his berserker rages. Logan adheres to a firm code of personal honor and morality.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Micky {{takes the}} {{occasional}} {{phone call from}} an angry Rudi, now returning from a boxing match in Birmingham (where all his fighters lost). Paige gets increasingly fearful of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> to her when he returns, but Micky refuses {{to change his mind}} – not because he wishes this on her, but because he is doing his job. In spite of this, Paige rescues Micky when Arabella takes an interest in his boxing career, claiming he was brilliantly successful when in fact he was a dismal failure. After Arabella falls and breaks fourteen glasses, the evening starts to fall flat. Derek makes a few lame jokes that his family find hilarious, then attempts to start a couple of racist jokes. Undeterred, Julie-Ann insists on Justin's speech. Justin attempts to start with [...] "It's with great pleasure ..." [...] but keeps stalling on [...] "It's ...", and instead breaks into It's a Long Way to Tipperary.|$|E
2500|$|Noting {{that the}} array of curses in [...] dwarf the {{catalogue}} of blessings preceding them, the 20th century Reform Rabbi Gunther Plaut argued that this imbalance should not be surprising, for specific negative commandments far outnumber specific positive ones in the Torah, and forbidden behaviors were generally more common in law codes. Plaut taught that the Torah promises and threatens based on the realistic assumption that, while pure love of God and the commandments is the highest rung, such devotion {{for its own sake}} can be scaled only by the very few, while the majority will need earthly rewards and punishments held up before their eyes. Plaut reported general scholarly agreement that the vassal treaties of the Assyrian King Esarhaddon influenced these curses. Noting that in the Assyrian model, the suzerain lays down conditions and states <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> if the vassal complies or fails to comply, Plaut concluded that the Torah's adoption of this treaty form can be seen as part of the Torah's ever-present view of Israel as a covenanted community.|$|E

2500|$|According to Venezuelan {{political}} analysts, Carmona {{was always}} a [...] "moderate" [...] and [...] "conciliatory" [...] figure, but {{in the years before}} the 2002 coup he [...] "became more aggressive as Chávez did." [...] Margarita Lopez Maya of the University of Central Venezuela said that as Carmona rose through the ranks of Fedecámaras, [...] "he became more aggravated, a situation which got worse because the government was provoking everyone." [...] Upon Carmona's taking office, Juan Calvo, a Venezuelan businessman, said, [...] "He always surrounds himself with capable people, and I'm sure that's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> now." [...] Upon being sworn in, Carmona told supporters that [...] "We must go about returning {{to the rule of law}} ... Strongman rule will be left behind. I will act in the most open manner, working with all sectors of the country." [...] He also said that he required plenty of support [...] "to obtain the conditions required to rebuild confidence in the country and improve its international image." [...] In addition, he vowed that [...] "justice would be done" [...] for the survivors of those who had been massacred.
