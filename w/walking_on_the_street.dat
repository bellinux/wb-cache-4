500|$|His humor {{caused him}} trouble {{during his time}} in Washington. He was known to greet {{citizens}} walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them, [...] "If you look on me as a wild animal, be kind enough to throw peanuts at me". This prompted Wilson to move Marshall's office to the Senate Office building, where {{he would not be}} disturbed by visitors. In response to a proposal to the board of the Smithsonian Institution to send a team to excavate for ruins in Guatemala, Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington. When asked why, he replied that, judging by the looks of the people <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> {{they should be able to}} find buried cave-men no more than six feet down. The joke was not well received, and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring {{at herself in the mirror}} with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Bother" [...] {{was directed by}} Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously collaborated with Shakira on the video for [...] "No", and was released on 15 November 2005. The video begins with a man parking his sports {{car in front of}} a house and proceeding to enter it. Shakira is seen lying on a bed {{in the house and the}} man comes up and lies beside her, indicating that they are a couple. As soon as the man falls asleep, Shakira wakes up and lies atop the man and begins to caress him and bite and whisper in his ear a few times, although he does not wake up. Shakira takes the keys of the man's car and drives it to a wrecking yard. The video then interludes to scenes of Shakira sexually romancing the man in a shower. The scene then changes back to the wrecking yard, where Shakira begins playing a pink guitar. After the spoken bridge of the song, Shakira places her partner's car in a car crusher, which soon commences demolishing it. The man reacts in a similar manner to the car being crushed and begins experiencing continuous body jerks and spasms, indicating a connection between his car and his body. After the car is fully destroyed, Shakira leaves the man unconscious on the bed, exits the house, and begins <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> triumphantly. Shakira explained the usage of the car symbolism in the video, saying that [...] "A man's car is like an extension of their ego and their manhood. I thought this would be a video that would make women say, 'Yeah, yeah!' and it would make men feel".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Red Blooded Woman" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, an English film director who had previously worked with artists like Beyoncé and Kelis. It was filmed in Los Angeles, California, in December 2003. It begins with a scene of a congested traffic jam in which Minogue is caught. She is shown seated in her car singing to the song in a sensual manner, with the camera repeatedly focusing on her eyes and lips. Her outfit is composed of {{a black and white}} singlet, a satin waist cincher, jeans with chain fringes, and a black sheepskin shrug (this outfit was donated by Minogue to the Arts Centre Melbourne and is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). A few seconds later, she gets down from her vehicle and playfully makes her way to a tank. Climbing up on its ladder, Minogue dances seductively to the chorus of the song. She then resumes <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and is accompanied by two doberman puppies who escape from a nearby car. After entering into the backseat of another car, Minogue begins unwrapping a red dress and proceeds to change into it as she is watched by various onlookers. As the second chorus starts, Minogue is seen dancing with a group of backup dancers at a different location. Her attire consists of a fluorine yellow bustier worn underneath a pastel pink dress designed by French fashion house Balenciaga. The scene changes back to the street, where Minogue is shown entering a truck. She dims the lights and then dances in a different outfit, consisting of a black bikini, red leggings, and laced gloves. However, she exits the truck in the same red outfit she donned earlier. The rest of the video rapidly intersperses scenes of Minogue dancing inside and in front of the truck, on a car, with the backup dancers, and near a gang of motorcyclists.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{its many}} {{institutional}} forms, the function {{and structure of}} ideology is unchanging and present throughout history; as Althusser states, [...] "ideology has no history". All ideologies constitute a subject, even though {{he or she may}} differ according to each particular ideology. Memorably, Althusser illustrates this with the concept of [...] "hailing" [...] or [...] "interpellation". Drawing heavily from Jacques Lacan and his concept of the Mirror Stage, he compares ideology to a policeman shouting [...] "Hey you there!" [...] toward a person <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Upon hearing this call, the person responds by turning around and in doing so, is transformed into a subject. The person is conscious of being a subject and aware of the other person. Thus, for Althusser, being aware of other people is a form of ideology. Within that, Althusser sees subjectivity as a type of ideology. The person being hailed recognizes himself or herself as the subject of the hail, and knows to respond. Althusser calls this recognition a [...] "mis-recognition" [...] (méconnaissance), because it works retroactively: a material individual is always already an ideological subject, even before he or she is born. The [...] "transformation" [...] of an individual into a subject has always already happened; Althusser here acknowledges a debt to Spinoza's theory of immanence. To highlight this, Althusser offers the example of Christian religious ideology, embodied in the Voice of God, instructing a person on what his place in the world is and what he must do to be reconciled with Christ. From this, Althusser draws the point that in order for that person to identify as a Christian, he must first already be a subject; that is, by responding to God's call and following His rules, he affirms himself as a free agent, the author of the acts for which he assumes responsibility. We cannot recognize ourselves outside ideology, and in fact, our very actions reach out to this overarching structure. For Althusser, we acquire our identities by seeing ourselves mirrored in ideologies.|$|E
