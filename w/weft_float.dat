50|$|Wool yarn is {{the most}} used for weaving and usually makes the finest material. For grave {{textiles}} they were usually done in cotton and wool weft, supplementary <b>weft</b> <b>float</b> pattering and plain weave techniques.

40|$|Based on {{abundant}} archeological evidences, {{this paper}} systematically discusses the weave and motif of twill damask of the Song and Liao dynasties. Categorized {{according to the}} weave, twill damask of the Song and Liao dynasties can be described as: twill in same direction, twill in different direction, twill with <b>weft</b> <b>floats</b> and brocaded twill; and the motifs adopted by twill damask of the Song and Liao dynasties mainly contain geometrical motif, floral motif, fauna motif (including birds and animals) and figural motif (including boys at play and Taoists) ...|$|R
50|$|Ornamental {{features}} in brocade are emphasized and wrought as {{additions to the}} main fabric, sometimes stiffening it, though more frequently producing on its face the effect of low relief. In some, but not all, brocades, these additions present a distinctive appearance {{on the back of}} the material where the supplementary <b>weft</b> or <b>floating</b> threads of the brocaded or broached parts hang in loose groups or are clipped away. When the <b>weft</b> is <b>floating</b> on the back, this is known as a continuous brocade; the supplementary weft runs from selvage to selvage. The yarns are cut away in cutwork and broché. Also, a discontinuous brocade is where the supplementary yarn is only woven in the patterned areas.|$|R
5000|$|Satin is a weave that {{typically}} has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave {{is characterized by}} four or more fill or <b>weft</b> yarns <b>floating</b> over a warp yarn or vice versa, four warp yarns floating over a single <b>weft</b> yarn. <b>Floats</b> are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies {{on top of the}} weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are [...] "floated" [...] over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a satin, although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.|$|R

40|$|Usually, {{a fabric}} weave pattern is {{recognized}} using methods which identify the warp <b>floats</b> and <b>weft</b> <b>floats.</b> Although these methods perform well for uniform or repetitive weave patterns, {{in the case}} of complex weave patterns, these methods become computationally complex and the classification error rates are comparatively higher. Furthermore, the fault-tolerance (invariance) and stability (selectivity) of the existing methods are still to be enhanced. We present a novel biologically-inspired method to invariantly recognize the fabric weave pattern (fabric texture) and yarn color from the color image input. We proposed a model in which the fabric weave pattern descriptor is based on the HMAX model for computer vision inspired by the hierarchy in the visual cortex, the color descriptor is based on the opponent color channel inspired by the classical opponent color theory of human vision, and the classification stage is composed of a multi-layer (deep) extreme learning machine. Since the weave pattern descriptor, yarn color descriptor, and the classification stage are all biologically inspired, we propose a method which is completely biologically plausible. The classification performance of the proposed algorithm indicates that the biologically-inspired computer-aided-vision models might provide accurate, fast, reliable and cost-effective solution to industrial automation...|$|R
50|$|The sheen and softer feel of sateen is {{produced}} through the satin weave structure. Warp yarns are <b>floated</b> over <b>weft</b> yarns, for example four over and one under. (In a weft-faced satin or sateen, the <b>weft</b> yarns are <b>floated</b> over the warp yarns.) Standard plain weaves use a one-over, one-under structure. The long floats produce a surface that is smooth {{to the touch}} and reduces light scattering to increase shine. This weave structure is more susceptible to wear than other weaves.|$|R
5000|$|Charmeuse (...) is a {{lightweight}} fabric woven with a satin weave, {{in which the}} warp threads cross over four {{or more of the}} backing (<b>weft)</b> threads. These <b>float</b> threads give the front of the fabric a smooth finish—lustrous and reflective—whereas the back has a dull finish. It can be made of silk or a synthetic lookalike such as polyester. Silk charmeuse is more expensive and delicate but is softer and a better insulator. [...] Polyester charmeuse is cheaper and can often withstand machine washing, but it does not breathe as well as silk. Charmeuse differs from plain satin in that charmeuse has a different ratio of float (face) threads.|$|R
