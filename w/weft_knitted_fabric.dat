In this work, a plug-in is developed using Python script and incorporated in Abaqus/CAE for the prediction of porosity of plain weft knitted fabrics. The Plug-in is able to automatically generate 3 D solid and multifilament <b>weft</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> models and accurately determine the porosity of fabrics in two steps. In this work, plain weft knitted fabrics made of monofilament, multifilament and spun yarn made of staple fibers were used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the developed plug-in. In the case of staple fiber yarn, intra yarn porosity was considered in the calculation of porosity. The first step is to develop a 3 D geometrical model of plain <b>weft</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> and the second step is to calculate the porosity of the fabric by using the geometrical parameter of 3 D <b>weft</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> model generated in step one. The predicted porosity of plain <b>weft</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> is extracted in the second step and is displayed in the message area.

40|$|The impact {{properties}} of <b>weft</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites {{have been investigated}} based on their fracture toughness and tensile properties. The fracture toughness of knitted fabric composites was investigated by using double cantilever beam (DCB) tests. The delamination resistance of knitted fabric composites was studied by using the measured fracture toughness values in a simplified delamination model. As forces required to create a delamination are higher than the ultimate impact force, knitted fabric composites do not fail in delamination failure mode. Knitted fabric composites tend to fail in flexural mode, either in compression at the impacted area or in tension at the bottom side, opposite to the impacted area. Therefore, {{it is interesting to}} compare the {{impact properties}} of <b>weft</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> composites with their tensile properties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Purpose: The wear {{resistance}} and friction reducing properties of polymer fibres {{can be improved}} with negative Poisson’s ratio behaviour. Poisson’s ratio {{is defined as the}} ratio of transverse contraction strain to longitudinal extension strain in the direction of stretching force. Large number of materials have positive Poisson’s ratio, however there are some materials which exhibit negative Poisson’s ratio, they are termed auxetic materials. Auxetic materials present unique property that they expand in all directions when they are stretched and contract when compressed. This paper has highlighted, compared and discussed the variation between the modelling, theoretical and practical differences of auxetic materials wear behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: For the purpose of this work, auxetic and conventional fibres were produced by the melt spinning mechanism using extruder. The fibres physical properties were evaluated such as Poisson’s ratio, fibre count, elongation, force and tenacity. Mono-filament fibres were used for fabrication of <b>weft</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics; plain (1 x 1) structure was employed for <b>knitting</b> <b>fabric.</b> The {{wear resistance}} of the <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> were tested by using Nu-Martindale Abrasion and Pilling Tester and comparison were made.
