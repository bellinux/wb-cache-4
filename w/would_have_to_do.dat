Peter then suggests that his son <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{a better job than}} God when he created actresses Ellen Barkin and Kelly McGillis.|$|E
5|$|Coming off {{a loss to}} Minnesota the {{preceding}} week, Penn State looked to defeat Purdue, which they had in every meeting since 2004. Though expected to beat an overmatched Purdue squad that was reeling, having lost 38–14 the prior week against Iowa, and 56–0 the week before that against Ohio State, and entering {{the game with a}} 1–8 record, the Lions <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so with even less depth than normal. At his mid-week press conference, Bill O'Brien announced at the midweek press conference that Ben Kline would miss the remainder of the season with a shoulder injury, for which he sustained surgery. There was also some pregame concentration surrounding the receiving corps – Allen Robinson was listed on the injury report with a shoulder injury, and Geno Lewis, who had proved to be a potential big play threat early in the season when he caught a 54-yard touchdown pass against Syracuse, but had recently been relegated to special teams, was also expected to receive increased playing time in Penn State's second-to-last home game of the season.|$|E

5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{dominant}} run was derailed in Abu Dhabi {{when his}} car {{was found to have}} insufficient fuel after qualifying and he was subsequently moved {{to the back of the}} grid. As Lewis Hamilton led the race away from the start, Vettel started from pit lane and took advantage of a chaotic opening corner that saw Nico Hülkenberg, Paul di Resta, Romain Grosjean and Bruno Senna tangle; Hülkenberg was forced out, while di Resta and Grosjean pitted with damage. Vettel began to round up the HRTs, Marussias and Caterhams, but his early progress came at the expense of his front wing endplate when he made contact with Senna at Turn 8 switchback. He chose not to pit for the time being, as the race was interrupted by the intervention of the safety car. Nico Rosberg, who had been forced to pit with damage to his front wing, was in the process of overtaking Narain Karthikeyan as Karthikeyan's car began to fail and the Indian quickly slowed. Rosberg, caught unawares by Karthikeyan's troubles, was launched over the back of the HRT and into the barrier. During the safety car period, Vettel was forced to pit when he swerved to avoid Daniel Ricciardo and crashed into the polystyrene bollard marking the start of the DRS zone, further damaging his wing. Red Bull Racing took the opportunity to pit him early, with the downside being that Vettel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> 42 laps on the soft tyre when supplier Pirelli predicted they could only do 36. Meanwhile, Hamilton suffered another mechanical failure while leading the race, and was once again forced out, handing the lead to Kimi Räikkönen while Fernando Alonso inherited second. Vettel began to work his way through the field again, but was forced to make a second stop when his tyres started losing grip. He was saved by the second appearance of the safety car moments later, brought about when di Resta forced Sergio Pérez wide; as Pérez rejoined the circuit, he cut back across the front of Grosjean and the two made contact, which in turn forced Grosjean into the path of Mark Webber. Grosjean and Webber retired, whilst Pérez was given a stop-go penalty. When racing resumed, Räikkönen began to rebuild his lead over Alonso, who was being harried by Jenson Button; Button himself was being harried by Vettel in fourth. Button and Vettel's duel allowed Alonso to break free, and he started chasing down Räikkönen in the last five laps. Räikkönen held on to secure his – and Lotus F1's – first victory of the season. Alonso was second, while Vettel caught and passed Button to complete the podium, keeping a ten-point championship lead in the process. With both Alonso and Vettel finishing on the podium with him, Räikkönen's win was not enough to keep him in contention for the World Drivers' Championship, leaving the title to be fought out between Alonso and Vettel over the final two races of the season.|$|E

The band was conceived in 1998, when Chiwaki mentioned to Chara {{that she thought}} {{it would be good to}} start up a girls' rock band. One of the tenets of the band was that all members <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something they'd never tried before, landing Chara on drums. The band first practiced in 1999, and continued to sporadically practice throughout 2000, despite different members' schedules.|$|E

25|$|Nels Rasmussen told Nuttall about Lazarus' {{continued}} {{contact with}} his daughter, which {{had not been in}} the files, despite him mentioning it frequently during Mayer and Hook's interviews. Realizing that Lazarus was now their prime suspect, the detectives informed their superiors of this and arranged to discreetly collect a voluntarily discarded DNA sample from her, knowing they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so without getting a warrant, which would have let Lazarus know she was under investigation for the murder. While off-duty running errands, Lazarus discarded a cup from which she had been drinking, which police retrieved. A sample was taken from it, and it matched the DNA from the bite mark on Sherri Rasmussen.|$|E
25|$|His army's {{numbers were}} also low, only about 1,500 men at first, with two third on cavalry, {{and only a}} little more than 600 had firearms. Bayonets were in short supply, so they had to improvise by adding lances to their arsenal. Those {{officers}} that could not bring their own saber <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> without. The scarcity of arms and supplies forced them to impose a strict control and organization. Belgrano spent the first months of his command in establishing a hospital, military tribunal, supply corps, reconnaissance company and in negotiating the manufacturing of ammunition and clothing. The relative hostility of the local population over the demands of the porteños did not make his job easy. He utilized the few friendships with the locals, La Madrid among them, to help with troop recruiting. Crucial in this task was Güemes, who with his troubled personal relations with Belgrano would force the latter to release him in June before even having had a chance to do combat.|$|E
500|$|The writers did {{not want}} {{to spend a lot of}} time {{covering}} Jason's childhood experiences, which they felt would remove the sense of mystery from the character. They tried to write scenes that would add verisimilitude, like the audience finding a deer carcass lying on the ground as they follow Jason through his underground tunnels. Fuller told the writers they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> without it because it would cost [...] $100,000. [...] Because of budget constraints, certain character deaths and the ending of the film were also scaled back from what Shannon and Swift originally envisioned.|$|E

500|$|Despite Travolta's earlier statements, {{plans for}} a sequel never came to fruition. According to James Robert Parish's Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, the {{disastrous}} performance of Battlefield Earth {{and the collapse of}} Franchise Pictures made it very unlikely that a live-action sequel will be made. In a 2001 interview, Travolta stated that a sequel was not planned: [...] "Ultimately the movie did $100million when you count box office, DVD sales, video, and pay per view… But I don't know what kind of number it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to justify filming {{the second part of the}} book. And I don't want to push any buttons in the press and stir anybody up about it now." [...] Author Services announced in 2001 that Pine Com International, a Tokyo-based animation studio, would produce 13one-hour animated television segments based on the book and rendered in a manga style. The plans appear to have fallen through, and according to Parish, [...] "little has been heard of the series since." ...|$|E
500|$|The Israeli General Staff {{called for}} a {{full-scale}} assault on the Egyptian positions, but backed out {{at the last minute}} due to ceasefire talks. The General Staff's order, sent among others to the Givati, 7th and Negev brigades, estimated that the Egyptian forces consisted of 2,000 troops between Ashdod and the bridges to the north. The order called for the annihilation of the force on the night of June 1–2, first by staging a major attack on the supply lines, and later by assaulting and capturing Isdud. The command was officially given to Givati. The forces outlined were: seven Givati companies (of them three from the Irgun), three infantry companies and one Jeep regiment from Negev, three companies from Yiftach, a 65mm artillery battery, and 4.2" [...] and 25-pounder platoons. The order also said, however, and if all forces and equipment were not assembled by zero hour, Givati <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the forces that were mustered.|$|E
500|$|The {{geographer}} Thomas Krabacher of the University of California {{undertook a}} review of The Man-Eating Myth for the journal Human Ecology. Believing that a critical study of cannibal claims has been long needed, he was nevertheless perturbed that Arens' work failed to be either comprehensive or objective. Although concurring that reports of cannibalism have been all too readily accepted without being properly scrutinized, Krabacher nonetheless argues that he has used a [...] "careless and selective" [...] approach to the literary sources. He also sees problems in Arens' approach {{to the nature of}} the evidence, stating that the anthropologist has not given sufficient thought to what would constitute reliable testimony in the case of cannibalism. Drawing comparisons with sexual behaviour, he notes that it would not always be possible for a western anthropologist to directly view cannibalism, which would likely be hidden from their view by many practitioners, and that as such, second-hand accounts <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He then critiques Arens' writing style, believing it to be [...] "contentious and possibly offensive", and highlighting a number of typological errors.|$|E

500|$|On 6 July 1948, Jinnah {{returned}} to Quetta, {{but at the}} advice of doctors, soon journeyed to an even higher retreat at Ziarat. [...] Jinnah had always been reluctant to undergo medical treatment, but realising his condition was getting worse, the Pakistani government sent the best doctors it could find to treat him. Tests confirmed tuberculosis, and also showed evidence of advanced lung cancer. Jinnah was informed and asked for full information on his disease and for care in how his sister was told. He was treated with the new [...] "miracle drug" [...] of streptomycin, {{but it did not}} help. Jinnah's condition continued to deteriorate despite the Eid prayers of his people. He was moved to the lower altitude of Quetta on 13 August, the eve of Independence Day, for which a statement ghost-written for him was released. [...] Despite an increase in appetite (he then weighed just over [...] ), it was clear to his doctors that if he was to return to Karachi in life, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so very soon. Jinnah, however, was reluctant to go, not wishing his aides to see him as an invalid on a stretcher.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} the NASA {{scientists}} give Arroway the [...] "cyanide pill" [...] caused some controversy during production {{and when the}} film came out. Gerald D. Griffin, the film's NASA advisor, insisted that NASA has never given any astronaut a cyanide pill [...] "just in case," [...] and that if an astronaut truly wished to commit suicide in space, all he or she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is cut off their oxygen supply. However, Carl Sagan insisted that NASA did indeed give out cyanide pills {{and they did it}} for every mission an astronaut has ever flown. Zemeckis said that because of the two radically different assertions, the truth is unknown, but he left the suicide pill scene in the movie as it seemed more suspenseful that way and it was also in line with Sagan's beliefs and vision of the film. [...] Along with being NASA Technical Consultant for the project, Griffin had a cameo in the role of [...] "Dynamics" [...] in Mission Control. [...] He had previously been technical advisor for Ron Howard's 1995 film Apollo 13. [...] While working for NASA during the Apollo Program, he had been the actual flight director for that mission, among others, and during the 1980s was the director of the Johnson Space Center.|$|E
500|$|During testing, Nordby and {{the special}} effects teams {{realized}} that getting Fox {{in and out of}} the appliance used to create Jennifer's murderous jaw would be too time-consuming.

He said that [...] "when it came time to shoot any of these jaw moments, [...] would act out in rehearsal how she was going to attack her victim and [...] fine tune that blocking so it was relatively locked". The camera accompanied them in the same way, as [...] "it would roll and she would put her dentures in, and they would really distort her face" [...] in a way that would produce a satisfying and nice side effect. Additionally, the team would have Fox wear contact lenses and go through exactly the same motions as normal Jennifer. [...] "But then I would shoot all the key poses that existed in whatever moves the digital double was doing, so that we had as much of that appliance in that lighting condition that we could get", said Nordby. [...] "KNB also created a hairless but high detailed head of the stage five Jennifer that had an articulating jaw." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E
