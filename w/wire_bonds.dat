40|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>bonding</b> is {{a widely}} used {{interconnection}} technology in electronic packaging. Due to the advantages of fast bonding process, high productivity, good electrical and thermal performance, Au <b>wire</b> <b>bonding</b> has been widely applied to various electronic packaging applications, such as Multi chip module (MCM), B all grid array (BGA) and Chip-on-board (COB). The organic substrates for Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) have a low glass transitional temperature, Tg, typically 130 °C. This imposes limitations on the <b>wire</b> <b>bonding</b> process because <b>wire</b> <b>bonding</b> must be performed at temperatures far below the Tgof the substrate to avoid softening of the materials. Meanwhile, a substrate with a high Tg incurs additional cost arising from material and fabrication processes. The objective of this thesis is to optimize metallization and process variables to enhance wire bondability and product yields of low temperature Au wedge thermosonic <b>bonding.</b> The <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> strength with various metallization characteristics were correlated to establish the process window for successful low temperature <b>wire</b> <b>bonding.</b> The technological understanding acquired in this thesis {{can be used as}} a practical guideline for PCB metallization plating and processing conditions. The research was carried out in four stages. The first stage examined the surface characteristics of various metallization schemes on conventional FR- 4 PCBs. The second stage investigated the interrelation between the metallization characteristics and the <b>wire</b> <b>bonding</b> process variables. The third stage studied the improvement in <b>wire</b> <b>bonding</b> by plasma cleaning. The last stage was a study of high temperature <b>wire</b> <b>bonding</b> on Bismaleimide triazine (BT) substrate.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{life time}} prediction of <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> structure {{in a power}} electronic module based on computational approach that integrates methods for high fidelity analysis, reduced order modelling, and life time prediction using reduced order model. This methodology is demonstrated {{for the design of}} a <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> structure in a power electronic module with aim of reducing the chance of failure due to the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> lift off in power electronic module when a random load is applied to the aluminium wire. In particular, <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> reliability of the power module related to the thermal fatigue material degradation of aluminium wire {{is one of the main}} concerns. In the power electronic module reliability, understanding the performance, reliability and robustness of <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> is a key factor for the future development and success of the power electronic module technology, because <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> lift off failure ignites other catastrophic failures. The main focus in this study is on the application of reduced order modelling techniques and the development of the associated models for fast evaluation and analysis. The discussion is on methods for approximate response surface modelling based on interpolation techniques using Kriging and radial basis functions. The reduced order modelling approach uses prediction data for the electro-thermo-mechanical behaviour of the power module wirebond design obtained through non-linear transient finite element simulations, in particular for the fatigue life-time of the aluminium wire attached to the silicon chip of the wire in the module. The reduced order models are used for the analysis of predicting the life time of the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> structure under random load. One of the widely used cycle counting algorithm, so called rainflow counting algorithm is utilised to count the cycles of temperature profile at the a specific point of the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> structure in a power electronic module. Using the cycle results from rainflow algorithm mean life time of the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> structure is predicted by a linear cumulative damage model such as Palmgren–Miner rule.

50|$|E-Material, {{also called}} E Material, is a metal matrix {{composite}} consisting of beryllium matrix with beryllium oxide particles. It has high thermal conductivity (210-230 W/m K), and its thermal expansion can be adjusted to match other materials, e.g. silicon and gallium arsenide chips and various ceramics. It is chiefly used in microelectronics as substrate for power semiconductor devices and high density multi-chip modules, where it aids with removal of waste heat. E-materials have low weight and high strength, making them especially suitable for aerospace technology. Their high elastic modulus is favorable for absorbing vibrations and lowering material fatigue of attached modules and <b>wire</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of electronic parts failures are packaging-related. Packaging, as the barrier between electronic parts and the environment, is very susceptible to environmental factors. Thermal expansion produces mechanical stresses that may cause material fatigue, {{especially when the}} thermal expansion coefficients of the materials are different. Humidity and aggressive chemicals can cause corrosion of the packaging materials and leads, potentially breaking them and damaging the inside parts, leading to electrical failure. Exceeding the allowed environmental temperature range can cause overstressing of <b>wire</b> <b>bonds,</b> thus tearing the connections loose, cracking the semiconductor dies, or causing packaging cracks. Humidity and subsequent high temperature heating may also cause cracking, as may mechanical damage or shock.|$|E
50|$|To make {{connections}} between an integrated circuit and the leads of the package, <b>wire</b> <b>bonds</b> are used, with fine wires connected from the package leads and bonded to conductive pads on the semiconductor die. At {{the outside of}} the package, wire leads may be soldered to a printed circuit board or used to secure the device to a tag strip. Modern surface mount devices eliminate most of the drilled holes through circuit boards, and have short metal leads or pads on the package that can be secured by oven-reflow soldering. Aerospace devices in flat packs may use flat metal leads secured to a circuit board by spot welding, though this type of construction is now uncommon.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of microstructural gradients, especially crystallographic texture gradients, after ultrasonic <b>wire</b> <b>bonding</b> process and after active power cycling (APC) of high purity, heavy aluminum (Al) wires is studied by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and nanoindentation.

In initial CIS applications, TSVs were formed on the backside of the image sensor wafer to form interconnects, eliminate <b>wire</b> <b>bonds,</b> and allow for reduced form factor and higher-density interconnects. Chip stacking came about only with the advent of backside illuminated (BSI) CIS, and involved reversing the order of the lens, circuitry, and photodiode from traditional front-side illumination so that the light coming through the lens first hits the photodiode and then the circuitry. This was accomplished by flipping the photodiode wafer, thinning the backside, and then bonding it on top of the readout layer using a direct oxide bond, with TSVs as interconnects around the perimeter.|$|E

50|$|Copper wire does pose some {{challenges}} {{in that it}} is harder than both gold and aluminum, so bonding parameters must be kept under tight control. The formation of oxides is inherent with this material, so storage and shelf life are issues that must be considered.

Palladium coated copper wire is a common alternative which has shown significant resistance to corrosion, albeit at a higher hardness than pure copper and a greater price, though still less than gold. During the fabrication of <b>wire</b> <b>bonds,</b> copper wire, as well as its plated varieties, must be worked in the presence of forming gas nitrogen and 5% hydrogen or a similar anoxic gas in order to prevent corrosion. A method for coping with copper's relative hardness is the use of high purity 5N+ varieties.|$|E
