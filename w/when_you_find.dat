The rule should be changed so that a rider with no chance of winning can give his bike to his leader, or {{there should be a}} car with several spare bicycles. You lose the Tour de France <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> someone better than you are. You don't lose it through a stupid accident to your machine. Next year Desgrange modified the rules.|$|E

500|$|In April 2010, Rowling {{published}} an article in The Times, in which she criticised Cameron's plan to encourage married couples to stay together by offering them a £150 annual tax credit: [...] "Nobody who has ever experienced the reality of poverty could say 'it's not the money, it's the message'. When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and your child is hungry, it is the money. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> yourself contemplating shoplifting to get nappies, it is the money." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "If It Makes You Happy", {{underwent}} {{several different}} arrangements before {{being turned into}} a rock song. According to musician Jeff Trott, who co-wrote the song along with Crow, [...] "It started off as a twangy, David Lynch-esque sort of thing. Then [...] we played it like punk rock, really fast, as well as country and funky. You know, you get a song and put clothes on it to see what looks good and what doesn't, and usually <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> the right one it's pretty obvious. With that song it was real obvious!" [...] Trott initially wrote the song {{when he was a}} member of Pete Droge's backing band, but Crow added a second verse and strengthened the melody. Sheryl Crow also has contributions by notable musicians. For example, [...] "Sweet Rosalyn" [...] features saxophone by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, while [...] "Everyday Is a Winding Road" [...] features harmony vocals by Neil Finn of Crowded House.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E

500|$|The album {{introduces}} {{also more}} instruments than Ihmisten edessä; Vartiainen starts the album by playing {{piano in the}} dark introitus [...] "Koti" [...] (Home). The second song [...] "Seili" [...] is also dark-themedthe song is about the namesake island located in the archipelago {{off the coast of}} Turku where leprotic and mentally ill patients were sent from 17th century onwards, along with boards they could build their own coffins with. The third song and the lead single [...] "En haluu kuolla tänä yönä"in English, I Don't Wanna Die Tonightgoes on with the theme, though with an electronic dance beat that [...] "emphasizes the will to live". The fifth song and the third single [...] "Missä muruseni on" [...] (Where My Sweetheart Is) was written by Mariska who got the inspiration for the song while reading Indian erotic literature on her balcony on a hot summer's day. The song is a ballad where the singer talks about being far away from her loved one and asks the wind to blow to the place [...] "where [...] sweetheart is"by November2010, the lyrics had even found their way to Finnish obituaries and gravestones. The sixth, dance-influenced song and first promotional single [...] "Duran Duran" [...] is about discovering one's soulmate as the lyrics wonder whether [...] "this is how it feels like <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> the right one" [...] along with saying [...] "Jenni can't escape this new feeling". Vartiainen entered new musical territories also by playing piano and kantele in the song [...] "Kiittämätön" [...] (Ungrateful), which is written by Vartiainen and Paula Vesala and deals with agony Vartiainen suffered from while growing up during high school.|$|E
2500|$|The {{geographer}} Strabo {{and many}} others came down squarely on the skeptical side: he reported what the great geographer Eratosthenes had said in the late third century BCE: [...] "You will find the scene of Odysseus's wanderings <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> the cobbler who sewed up the bag of winds." ...|$|E

Kennedy's cousin, Anthony Stanislas Radziwill, told the press that if Kennedy was still alive [...] "he'll {{find a way to}} get out. He possesses the will to survive, enough will for all three of them". Officials were not optimistic about finding Kennedy alive after several pieces of debris from his plane were recovered in the Atlantic Ocean. [...] "There is always hope", Coast Guard Lt.

2500|$|Boros {{also studied}} pitchers, looking for tipoffs that they {{intended}} to throw to first base. He said, [...] "There's always some tipoff. The head, the shoulder, the hip, the knee, the toe – every pitcher has something that gives away his pickoff move. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> it, you've got the upper hand on the base baths." [...] With the benefit of Boros' scientific approach, the Royals led the American League in stolen bases in both 1978 (216) and 1979 (207). The 1978 team had eight players (led by Willie Wilson, Freddie Patek, Amos Otis, George Brett, and Hal McRae) who stole at least 10 bases and won the American League West pennant {{with a record of}} 92–70.|$|E
2500|$|Apollonius' {{successor}} {{as head of}} {{the library}} of Alexandria, Eratosthenes, wrote a detailed investigation into Odysseus' wanderings. Eratosthenes takes a cynical view, regarding Homer as an entertainer, not an educator: [...] "You will find the scene of the wanderings of Odysseus <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> the cobbler who sewed up the bag of the winds." [...] This does not mean that he refuses any and all identifications. He conjectures that Hesiod's information about the wanderings (see below on Hesiod) came from historical inquiries that Hesiod had made. The 2nd century BC poet-historian Apollodorus of Athens sympathises with Eratosthenes, believing that Homer imagined the wanderings as having taken place in a kind of fairyland in the Atlantic; he actively criticises the standard identifications in and around Sicily, and refuses to offer any identifications of his own.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005, at {{a conference}} at the National Academy of Sciences, Tyson responded to a {{question}} about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists.
