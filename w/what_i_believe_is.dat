2500|$|In March 2012, Greg Smith, then-head of Goldman Sachs US equity {{derivatives}} sales {{business in}} Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), resigned his position via a critical letter printed as an op-ed in The New York Times. In the letter, he attacked Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein for losing {{touch with the}} company's culture, which he described as [...] "the secret sauce that made this place great and allowed us to earn our clients' trust for 143 years." [...] Smith said that advising clients [...] "to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> right for them" [...] was becoming increasingly unpopular. Instead there was a [...] "toxic and destructive" [...] environment in which [...] "the interests of the client continue to be sidelined", senior management described clients as [...] "" [...] and colleagues callously talked about [...] "ripping their clients off". In reply, Goldman Sachs said that [...] "we will only be successful if our clients are successful", claiming [...] "this fundamental truth {{lies at the heart}} of how we conduct ourselves" [...] and that [...] "we don't think [...] reflect the way we run our business." [...] Later that year, Smith published a book titled Why I left Goldman Sachs.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the other}} units of the Mid-Ulster Brigade soon affirmed their loyalty to the leadership. Wright ignored an order to leave Northern Ireland by 1 September 1996, and hours before the {{deadline}} attended a Royal Black Preceptory march and a celebration at a club in Portadown's Corcrain estate, receiving a hero's welcome at both events. On 4 September, at least 5,000 loyalists attended a rally in Portadown in support of Wright. The rally was addressed by Reverend William McCrea (a DUP Member of Parliament) and Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge). McCrea made a speech critical of David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson for what he felt was their involvement in the death threats. McCrea's sharing of the stage with a militant such as Wright caused uproar, although he argued that he was merely supporting Wright's entitlement to freedom of speech. Ignoring the threat, Wright, in a public show of defiance, formed the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), taking members mainly from the officially-disbanded Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to writers John Robert Gold and George Revill, Wright's [...] "mythical stature" [...] amongst loyalists [...] "provided him with the status necessary to form the LVF" [...] in the traditional UVF stronghold of Portadown. Appearing at a Drumcree protest rally, Wright made the following statement: [...] "I will not be leaving Ulster, I will not change my mind about <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> happening in Ulster. But all I {{would like to say}} is that it has broken my heart to think that fellow loyalists would turn their guns on me, and I have to ask them, 'For whom are you doing it?'". Wright's hardline stance won the support of a number of leading loyalists, including UVF colleague Jackie Mahood, Frankie Curry of the Red Hand Commandos and Alex Kerr of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Kerr, another key figure at the Drumcree standoff, had also been ordered by the Combined Loyalist Military Command to leave Northern Ireland on pain of execution.|$|E

God has called me to the fellowship of his Son, surely it is that I may be with him in the next world. God has given me the spirit of faith and prayer; surely it is that I might hope for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is,</b> and wait for what I pray for.
