5|$|Each {{level has}} set {{goals in the}} fields of {{financial}} attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one. If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{key points}} {{stressed}} in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> the ultimate destruction intended by God. Gawain was written {{around the time of}} the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E

Jebali referred to the occasion as [...] "a divine moment in a new state, and in, hopefully, a 6th caliphate," [...] and that [...] "the liberation of Tunisia <b>will,</b> God <b>willing,</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> the liberation of Jerusalem." [...] While the tone was said do be sharply in contrast to official statements of the party, Jebali was appointed Prime Minister of Tunisia a mere month later.|$|R
5|$|During a hailstorm in Washington state, {{university}} students run to find shelter. One girl, Lauren (Kristi Angus), {{stands in the}} rain, lights a cigarette, and goes up in flames. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question—Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> {{the end of the}} world. Hoffman believes that this cataclysm will be preceded by strange events and weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|In the 26th century, space-faring {{humanity}} (organized {{under the}} United Nations Space Command, or UNSC) comes {{under attack from}} a splinter faction of the former Covenant, an alien collective of species that worships the Forerunners as gods. This Covenant faction believes that activating the Halos <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> salvation, not destruction. The human supersoldier Master Chief John-117, along with his artificial intelligence companion Cortana, are instrumental in stopping the Halos from being activated, and the Flood from once again menacing the galaxy. At the end of Halo 3, Chief and Cortana are left stranded in unknown space aboard {{the remains of the}} vessel Forward Unto Dawn. Much of Halo 4s campaign and Spartan Ops' missions take place on or near the Forerunner planet Requiem. Part of the game also takes place on Ivanoff Research Station—a human base in orbit around the Halo ringworld Installation 03—and in Earth's orbit.|$|E

25|$|The Pakistani theologian Javed Ahmad Ghamidi blames Muslim madrasas that indoctrinate {{children}} with Islamic supremacist views, {{such as that}} Muslims are legally superior to unbelievers (particularly former Muslims), and that jihad <b>will</b> eventually <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> a single caliphate to rule the world.|$|R

25|$|It is too simplistic to {{say that}} a certain measure of {{dopamine}} <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> a specific delusion. Studies show age and gender to be influential and it is most likely that HVA levels change during the life course of some syndromes.|$|E
25|$|Gordon B. Hinckley saw a {{trend in}} {{national}} politics by which city-states and nation-states have unified and suggests that the international arena will eventually follow suit. Many countries such as China, Italy, the United States, Australia, Germany, India and Britain have unified into single nation-states with others like the European Union following suit, suggesting that further globalization <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> a world state.|$|E
25|$|Some Fundamentalist Christians {{believe that}} the Second Coming of Jesus Christ cannot occur until the Third Temple is {{constructed}} in Jerusalem, which requires {{the appearance of a}} red heifer born in Israel. Clyde Lott, a cattle breeder in O'Neill, Nebraska, United States, is attempting to systematically breed red heifers and export them to Israel to establish a breeding line of red heifers in Israel in the hope that this <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> the construction of the Third Temple and ultimately the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|One common tactic among consequentialists, {{particularly}} those committed to an altruistic (selfless) account of consequentialism, is to employ an ideal, neutral observer from which moral judgements can be made. John Rawls, {{a critic of}} utilitarianism, argues that utilitarianism, in common with other forms of consequentialism, relies on the perspective of such an ideal observer. The particular characteristics of this ideal observer can vary from an omniscient observer, who would grasp all the consequences of any action, to an ideally informed observer, who knows as much as could reasonably be expected, but not necessarily all the circumstances or all the possible consequences. Consequentialist theories that adopt this paradigm hold that right action is the action that <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> the best consequences from this ideal observer's perspective.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{the city}} has been working on new {{projects}} to restore itself as the strategic capital within the country. Rapid urban growth, including the mass migration of peasants to the main cities, attracted by economic development, has led to the demand of numerous proposals to accommodate such growth. Barranquilla has always been famous for its chaotic urban planning, understandable given its spontaneous origin as a port and the reality of high administrative corruption which has hampered the channeling of resources for building an urban centre of greater structure and dimensions. The presentation of a new infrastructure, changes in local and regional administration, decentralization since 1991, international pressure to open markets, and competition between the other major Colombian cities <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> considerable development in Barranquilla into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|To {{work around}} the budget, as well as Beneaths {{seemingly}} definitive ending, the film took the series {{in a new direction}} by transporting Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall, returning to the role after being absent from Beneath) back in time to the contemporary United States, reducing the need for expensive sets and ape make-up effects. In the film, Zira and Cornelius are initially accepted by American society, but fears that their child <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> the domination of the human race by evolved apes leads to conflict. Jacob's wife Natalie Trundy, who appeared as a mutant in Beneath and later played the ape Lisa in the next two sequels, was cast as Dr. Stephanie Branton. Bradford Dillman played Dr. Lewis Dixon, Ricardo Montalbán played Armando, and Eric Braeden portrayed the villain, the President's Science Advisor Otto Hasslein.|$|E

25|$|Houston {{is home to}} the Johnson Space Center, NASA's largest {{research}} and development facility, employing nearly 3,000 federal civil service workers and more than 14,000 contract personnel. Program offices for Project Constellation, Orion, and other new space vehicle projects will create new jobs at the center. The city's burgeoning aerospace industry heralded its second growth spurt, which solidified with the 1973 oil crisis. The majority of the contractor work force related to the projects will also be located at the center. Texas Governor Rick Perry recently announced a $7.5 million Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF) grant to Lockheed Martin, which <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> 1,000 jobs to the Houston area. The grant ensures that Lockheed Martin will create these jobs in the Houston area after they earned a multibillion-dollar contract from NASA to build the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. Houston is also home to the United Space Alliance, which employs well over 10,000 people.|$|E

500|$|Requiem for a Species: Why We Resist the Truth about Climate Change is a 2010 non-fiction book by Australian {{academic}} Clive Hamilton which explores {{climate change}} denial and its implications. It argues {{that climate change}} <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> large-scale, harmful consequences for habitability for life [...] on Earth including humans, which {{it is too late}} to prevent. Hamilton explores why politicians, corporations and the public deny or refuse to act on this reality.

The book builds on the author's fifteen-year prior history of writing about these subjects, with previous books including Growth Fetish and [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} the first in the series to mention the concept of walk-ins, a plot device that would later be used five seasons later, when the truth about Samantha's {{abduction}} was finally revealed to Mulder. It {{should also be noted that}} the adherents of the Red Museum believed that the year 2012 <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> the dawning of The New Age. In the series' finale, [...] "The Truth," [...] it is revealed to Mulder by the Cigarette Smoking Man that the alien colonists plan to colonize the earth on December 22nd, 2012. Despite the developments in the show's mythological plot arc, this 2012 reference {{is the first}} explicit reference to the date of the planned colonization, a date that is only finally confirmed in the series finale—both to Mulder and the audience—seven seasons later." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the events}} of Lightning Returns, forced {{to protect the people}} as the [...] "Shadow Hunter" [...] after the Order of Salvation take over Luxerion, Noel becomes obsessed with a {{fabricated}} prophecy that if he kills Bhunivelze's savior, he <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> a new world where he can live in peace with Yeul. Ultimately, he has become burdened by guilt because of his actions in causing the world to fall into its current state. Noel's belief in the prophecy is reinforced when Lightning appears as the savior. They briefly ally to rout an extremist sect of the Children of Etro, who have been killing women who resemble Lightning. They later fight at Noel's hideout. Lightning provokes Noel into fully expressing his rage and engaging him in battle. After the battle, Noel destroys the oracle drive playing the fabricated prophecy, finally freeing himself from his guilt. After Bhunivelze's defeat, Noel offers his life to give Yeul a chance to live in the new world, and Caius allows the final incarnation of Yeul to go with him.|$|E
