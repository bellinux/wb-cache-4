The letter written by Mr. Gladstone to the son of his veteran chief is long, but it deserves reproduction.(64) As a writer, though an alert and most strenuous disputant, he was apt to be diffuse and abstract. Partly, these defects were due to the {{subjects}} with which, in his literary performances, he mostly chose to deal. Perhaps one secret was that he forgot the famous word of Quintilian, that the way to <b>write</b> <b>well</b> <b>is</b> not to write quickly, but if you take trouble to write well, in time you can write as quickly as you like.(65) His character of Lord Aberdeen, like his beautiful letter in a similar vein about Hope-Scott,(66) where also his feelings were deeply moved, is very different from his more formal manner, and may claim high place among our literary portraits. It is penetrating in analysis, admirable in diction, rich in experience of life and human nature, and truly inspiring in those noble moralities that are the lifeblood of style, and of greater things than mere style can ever be.|$|E

In an effort to identify effective instructional practices for teaching writing to adolescents, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of the writing intervention literature (Grades 4 – 12), focusing their efforts on experimental and quasi-experimental studies.

40|$|The {{ability to}} <b>write</b> <b>well</b> <b>is</b> not a {{naturally}} acquired skill. It is learned in formal instructional settings or other environments.

Social and cognitive factors of a learner also affect the rate of second language learning which ultimately affect the writing ability. This Case Study investigates the factors that affect the writing ability of Year Six pupils in English. This study was carried out in a school where 95 percent of the class population who come from the same speech community and they share common problems pertaining to composition writing.

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine a}} {{theoretical}} perspective on reciprocal peer reviewing of writing {{that could be}} a more common form of peer collaboration for writing. The traditional approach, called Learning Writing by Writing, focuses on opportunities for practicing writing with feedback. The alternative approach, called Learning Writing by Reviewing, considers reviewing as an important method for learning writing skills, because reviewing is a problem solving activity that engages problem detection, diagnosis, and solution generation. We empirically evaluated the Learning Writing by Reviewing hypothesis with 87 students in three physics courses that were using SWoRD (Cho & Schunn, 2003, 2005, 2007), a reciprocal peer review system. In support of the hypothesis, the reviewers ’ own writing skills improved according to the helpfulness of their review comment-giving work. The Context: A Writing Crisis in the U. S. In spite of extensive efforts for the past three decades under the Writing-Across-Curriculum (WAC) and the Writing-in-the-Disciplines (WID) movements, being able to <b>write</b> <b>well</b> <b>is</b> a fundamental skill that most students in the U.

The National Assessment of Educational Progress in 2002 found that 69 % of 8 th grade students and 77 % of 12 th grade students were found to have only basic or lower levels of writing skills (Persky, Daane, & Jin, 2003). Other age group students also performed poorly. Not surprisingly, a great number of high school graduates in the U. S. remain at a lower level of writing skill (Kamil, 2003) than is expected by colleges an...|$|E
40|$|Ortega y Gasset's {{assertion}} that 'to <b>write</b> <b>well</b> <b>is</b> to make continual incursions into grammar, into established usage, and into accepted linguistic norms' finds resonance {{in the work}} of a number of sub-Saharan Francophone African writers, most notably in texts by Ahmadou Kourouma, Veronique Tadjo, Werewere Liking, Henri Lopes and Sony Labou Tansi. The types of incursions that are most characteristic of these authors include the incorporation of visible and quasi-invisible traces of African languages, the exploitation of stylistic features associated with orality, including sustained use of colloquialisms and vulgarisms, and experimentation with various kinds of wordplay. Taking as its corpus all of the novels by these authors that are available in English translation, the thesis seeks to set the translations in their publishing context and to analyse {{the ways in which the}} translators treat the linguistic innovation of the originals. It reveals the dominance of translation strategies that normalise the linguistically or generically innovative features of the original texts, or, where these are retained to any significant degree, that separate them from the 'standard' language through typographical variation. When the post-colonial context of the original texts is taken into account, such normalising and exoticising strategies can be seen to have significant implications, diminishing the ability of the texts to carry broader cultural and political significance. For this reason, a number of critics have argued the need for a 'decolonised translation practice'. The thesis outlines the type of translation practice that might be viewed as 'decolonised', engaging in debates over the untranslatability of layered language, and drawing comparisons with other translation theories developed at the interface with post-colonial studies such as foreignising translation, the space between, and metametonymics.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of cohesion in the essays of Writing IV Faculty of Letters? students. The researcher thinks {{that the ability to}} <b>write</b> <b>well</b> <b>is</b> very important for the students, for example in making their thesis. So, it is necessary for the students to know about cohesion. That is why the researcher decided to analyze Writing IV essays. She chose Writing IV essays because although the students already have enough experience in writing, the researcher still find mistakes in their essays. This reason also motivates her in analyzing Writing IV essays. In her thesis, she wants to find out the types of cohesion which are correctly and incorrectly used by the students. She hopes that the result of her research will be useful for the students of Faculty of Letters who major in Linguistics and who is interested in cohesion. In her analysis, the main theory that is used by the researcher is the theory of cohesion by Halliday and Hasan (1976). The theory talks about grammatical cohesion, which can be conveyed through Reference, Substitution, Ellipsis, and Conjunction; and lexical cohesion through Reiteration and Collocation. She applies this theory to analyze the data. She collects the data by photocopying the students? writing essays and she analyzes the essays thoroughly to find the cohesion types that occur in the essays. From the research, she finds that in all cohesion types, the correctly used types have higher number of occurrences than the incorrectly used ones. The fulfillment mostly happens in Conjunction and the mistake mostly occurs in Reference. In her analysis, the researcher also finds avoidance effect happens in certain cohesion types and mostly in Ellipsis. So, from the whole research, the researcher concludes that the students can apply cohesion well...|$|E

40|$|As a lawyer, {{you spend}} much of your time writing – so why not do it well. You may think you are an {{excellent}} lawyer, but {{you will not be}} a successful practitioner unless you can communicate the law effectively in writing to the person who must read and act on your letter or document. If you use these guidelines, your writing will be clearer and more effective. Good lawyers use plain English and avoid jargon and legalese. Good writing is effective communication and a sign of professionalism that enhances your reputation. There is no one formula for writing well. However here are two that might help: (A) KISS: "Keep It Short and Simple", ie where possible, use short words, short sentences, short paragraphs, active voice and avoid repetition.; (B) APLE: Consider the Audience, the Purpose, the Language and Effectiveness as you write. Context is always important. What works for one letter or document or type of reader or purpose may not work for another. You need to decide when and how to apply the guidelines outlined in this chapter. The guidelines aim to help you think about what you are doing, including why you are writing your document and to remind you of things to look out for as you write. If this is new to you, aim to apply each guideline one at a time rather than all at once. However, keep in mind the best way to learn to <b>write</b> <b>well</b> <b>is</b> to read a lot, and write often. The advent of email has changed the way many lawyers communicate. It has led to informal styles and heightened risk of inaccuracies and ill-considered comments or replies sent without pause for review. Other risks of email involve the ease of forwarding messages to others not intended by the writer, and permanent storage for future use. On the other hand, the speed of email can enable quick resolution of disputes if handled carefully in appropriate situations. Good lawyers need to decide when and how to use email rather than letters for professional communications...|$|E
40|$|I got {{my first}} camera when I was in third grade—a Brownie Hawkeye flash model with a snazzy little camera case. The {{instruction}} manual provided six simple steps for taking successful pictures. Hold the camera steady, supporting it underneath. Then, with the sun behind your back or over your shoulder, locate the subject in the finder. At the instant of exposure, hold your breath and press the shutter release with a gentle squeezing action (Brownie Hawkeye Instruction Manual). The camera came with two rolls of film, each with 16 frames. I eagerly used them up and sent the exposed film off for developing and printing. Maybe because I didn’t hold my breath or squeeze the shutter release quite gently enough—I don’t know—but when the prints came back, I had (according to the manual) “fumbles”: double-exposures, complete blurs, specks on the images, a few close-ups of my finger or the camera strap, and plenty of shots where the subject was cut-off. I did have pictures, but not one that was good. Cameras now are nothing like my Brownie Hawkeye, but if you still point and shoot like I do, you have surely noticed that the beautiful sunset you see with your own eyes is nothing like the digital image you end up with. That’s because creating breathtaking photography {{is up to the}} photographers who are, in the words of Ansel Adams, blazing the poetry of the real (1930) – using shadow and light, focus, compositional elements, perspective, texture, and tone to illuminate what we see (and sometimes don’t see). For the longest time, we have used a point and shoot mentality in writing, too. You remember [...] . follow the directions for writing a paper, hold your breath when you turn it in, then get it back in a few days with your “fumbles” clearly marked in red pen. Think about it. How much better would your writing have been if you had known how to create the illusion of motion or sound, manipulate the volume or inflection in a reader’s voice, make the reader your accomplice, or persuade her to think like you? That is the work of writing after all—to hold its own {{in the absence of the}} author, blazing the real of time and space. Knowing how to <b>write</b> <b>well</b> <b>is</b> not just the province of published authors anymore. It can’t be—too much is at stake. Workshop teachers take seriously this call to action, teaching the qualities of good writing every single day. In Blazing the Real, their students demonstrate that good writing comes from a deeper understanding of craft, of what writers know and do. These young writers understand that very specific, tangible details help them effectively express big, sometimes abstract concepts. They understand the power of creating intimacy with a reader by using second-person address. They understand that reflecting on topics immediately relevant to their own lives, stirs emotions that resonate broadly. And, they even understand how to manipulate the conventions of writing to provoke their audiences to respond in particular, intended ways. Breathe in the beauty of Blazing the Real—the splendor of meticulously crafted photographs inspired by the writing in each of four chapters, the artistry of language both written and drawn that is influenced by the work of real writers. And know, we are a very long way from point and shoot. -Susan C. Adamson[URL]...|$|E
