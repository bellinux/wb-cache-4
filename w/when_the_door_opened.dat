He led Bosco through many streets to a block of flats, rang the doorbell, and at once, went away. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> John Bosco found that within, there was a dying man who was desperately asking for a priest to make his last confession. Later, John Bosco asked Dominic how he had known about that man. However, since the question made Dominic uncomfortable, John Bosco did not press the matter.|$|E
2500|$|Natan-Zada {{boarded the}} Shefa-'Amr-bound bus on Thursday, 4 August 2005. He {{was dressed in}} full IDF uniform, {{carrying}} his IDF-issued M16 rifle, and, according to observers, wearing the skullcap, beard, and sidelocks of an observant Jew, {{as well as an}} orange ribbon hanging from his pocket. According to witnesses, the bus driver was initially surprised to see a religiously-observant Jewish soldier making his way to Shefa-'Amr (an overwhelmingly Arab city) via public bus, so he asked Natan-Zada if he was certain he wanted to take his current route. [...] Upon arriving in Shefa-'Amr's primary Druze neighborhood, Natan-Zada stood up and approached the front door as if to disembark the bus. [...] <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> Natan-Zada turned around and shot the driver. He then fatally shot a man sitting behind the driver, and fired into the rest of the bus, killing two young women and wounding twenty-one passengers. When he paused to reload his weapon, a passenger grabbed the barrel of his gun, sustaining burn injuries, and he was subdued by streetgoers gathered around the scene of the bus shooting. When the police arrived at the scene he was tied up but still alive, but the small force of police officers on the scene could not prevent the crowd from lynching him, and nine police officers were injured attempting to protect him. It took the police four hours to remove his body from the scene.|$|E

50|$|An {{event driven}} {{architecture}} is extremely loosely coupled and well distributed. The great distribution of this architecture exists because an event can be almost anything and exist almost anywhere. The architecture is extremely loosely coupled because the event itself doesn’t {{know about the}} consequences of its cause. e.g. If we have an alarm system that records information <b>when</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door</b> <b>opens,</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> itself doesn’t know that the alarm system will add information <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens,</b> just that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> has been <b>opened.</b>|$|R
