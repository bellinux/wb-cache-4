5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no single}} {{accepted}} portrayal of Mussie's age, its gender, or even <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> single, long-lived creature or a species. Some residents claim that a single, very old Mussie—or a member of its species—first arrived in the area, then covered by the ocean, about 10,000 years ago. In this tale, glaciers and, later, solid landmasses built up around it, forming the lake, and Mussie was trapped. Mussie's diet, according to self-proclaimed observer Donnie Humphries, consists at least partially of cattails found {{near the edge of}} the lake.|$|E
5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel. Some {{are believed to have}} formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope {{does not appear to be}} primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7AU. It is not yet clear whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{subspecies}} {{have been}} named, but are generally {{no longer considered}} valid. Most are intergrades that occur where the ranges of various subspecies meet. These include: S. v. ruthenus Menzbier, 1891 and S. v. jitkowi Buturlin, 1904, which are intergrades between vulgaris and poltaratskyi from western Russia; S. v. graecus Tschusi, 1905 and S. v. balcanicus Buturlin and Harms, 1909, intergrades between vulgaris and tauricus from the southern Balkans to central Ukraine and throughout Greece to the Bosporus; and S. v. heinrichi Stresemann, 1928, an intergrade between caucasicus and nobilior in northern Iran. S. v. persepolis Ticehurst, 1928 from southern Iran's (Fars Province) {{is very similar to}} S. v. vulgaris, and it is not clear <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> distinct resident population or simply migrants from southeastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and {{is very important in}} Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E
