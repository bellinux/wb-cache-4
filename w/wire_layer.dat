Due to its simple struc-ture, a wide-area power floor of 3. 52 m 2 (1. 6 m × 2. 2 m) could be fabricated as a prototype. Three pickups with evenly displaced angle and space are adopted, considering the limited bottom area of the free-moving mobile robot. The size and position of each pickup are appropriately selected for the given subwinding size of the power floor and magnetic pole arrangement. Experiments for the prototype show that the proposed multiple pickup structure lowers the spatial output power variation and that enough output power of 10 W can be obtained for the mobile robots.

The process was based on the doubly-planarized all-refractory technology for superconductive circuits (DPARTS) process currently used to fabricate these devices at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and streamlined by removing or replacing the most time-consuming steps and several optical layers. In addition, 248 -nm (deep-UV) photolithography was employed {{for the first time in}} a Nb-based process, with the goal of improving resolution past that achievable by standard i-line lithography. The process has five optical <b>layers,</b> two <b>wiring</b> <b>layers,</b> and a via layer, and is intended to be used for rapid-turnaround evaluation of simple circuits requiring only two <b>wiring</b> <b>layers.</b> Anodization was used to produce a 50 nm film of NbOx to isolate the <b>wiring</b> <b>layers,</b> replacing the time-consuming oxide deposition and planarization used in the DPARTS process.

These measurements can be made from a distance of 15 cm. The sensor consists of commercially available laser pointers, lenses, color filters and photodiodes. In our application we have used this laser sensor together with an automated 3 dimensional coordinate table. For a single position measurement, the laser sensor is moved by the 3 -dimensional coordinate table in a plane and determines the coordinates at which the wires intersect with this plane. The position of the plane itself (the third coordinate) is given by the third axis of the measurement table which is perpendicular to this plane. The control and readout of the table and the readout of the laser sensor were realized with LabVIEW. The precision of the position measurement in the plane was determined with wires of 0. 2 mm and 0. 3 mm diameter.

The benefit of using composite material with metal <b>wire</b> <b>layers</b> imbedded is that these metal <b>wire</b> <b>layers</b> may be welded to the steel superstructure of a Naval Vessel resulting in maximum joint strength.

For all the structures, current-voltage and external quantum efficiency measurements were performed to examine the effect of absorption and power conversion of the intermediate band solar cell (IBSC).

The quantum efficiency measurements revealed that the quantum wires extend the absorption spectrum in the infrared and produce a photocurrent by absorption of photons with energies below the GaAs band gap energy.
