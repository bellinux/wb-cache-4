5|$|Since {{the first}} World Championship Grand Prix in 1950, red flags {{have been shown}} in seventy races, with the latest one being at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix on 25 June 2017. Twenty-six were {{restarted}} on the first lap. Thirteen races were not restarted, nine because of rain and four due to accidents involving drivers. Five races were stopped due to incidents that resulted in fatalities: The 1975 Spanish Grand Prix was stopped on lap twenty-nine and not restarted after Rolf Stommelen's car crashed into a spectator area, killing five people. The 1978 Italian Grand Prix was red-flagged after a massive crash that ultimately contributed {{to the death of}} Ronnie Peterson. The 1982 Canadian Grand Prix was halted on the first lap after Riccardo Paletti was killed when his car collided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> Didier Pironi's Ferrari. The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was red-flagged on lap five following the fatal accident of Ayrton Senna, in which his car crashed into a wall at the Tamburello curve. The 2014 Japanese Grand Prix was red-flagged for a second time following a serious collision between Jules Bianchi and a recovery vehicle which would ultimately prove to be fatal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Rosberg {{retained}} his lead ahead of Ricciardo, followed by Vettel and Räikkönen. Sergio Pérez gained two places and was fifth, while Esteban Gutiérrez damaged his front wing when he made contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> Nico Hülkenberg's car. Hamilton remained tenth until he overtook Kvyat for ninth place on lap four. One lap later, both Bottas and Hamilton seized an opportunity to overtake Max Verstappen, as he ran wide into turn two. As a reaction, Red Bull decided to change tyres on Verstappen's car on the following lap. Another lap later, Ricciardo followed suit. At Red Bull's sister team Toro Rosso, Daniil Kvyat retired on lap eight. On lap ten, Hamilton overtook Bottas for fourth place, but was more than twenty seconds behind teammate Rosberg. He went into the pit lane for a tyre change on lap 15. Force India reacted two laps later and brought Pérez in and he emerged back from the pit lane just ahead of Hamilton. Meanwhile, the order at the front was Rosberg, Vettel, Bottas, Ricciardo and Räikkönen. On lap 18, Räikkönen took fourth place by overtaking Ricciardo on the start/finish straight. Pérez moved ahead of Massa into seventh on lap 20, and Hamilton followed through one lap later, while Bottas pitted and returned to the track in ninth place.|$|E
25|$|Kotomitsuki was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, and his {{favourite}} {{grip on the}} mawashi was migi-yotsu, {{with his}} left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms (although he was also capable of fighting in the reverse position, hidari-yotsu). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri, the force out, followed by oshi-dashi (push out) and hataki-komi (slap down). He was fond of dashinage (pulling throws, both overarm and underarm), and {{was also one of the}} few rikishi to employ uchi-muso, a technique which involves tapping the opponent's inner thigh <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the hand to off-balance him, before twisting him down.|$|E

25|$|On September 18, 2017, {{during the}} morning rush hour, a private tour bus moving at a high speed {{collided}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a Q20 bus turning from Main Street onto Northern Boulevard in Flushing. The bus then plowed into a Kennedy Fried Chicken restaurant {{at the corner of}} the intersection. The accident killed 3 people including the tour bus driver, and injured at least 17. The private charter bus company had been repeatedly cited for reckless driving. The charter driver was a former MTA bus driver, until he was fired in April 2015 after a crash in his personal automobile in which he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and leaving the scene of the crash.|$|E
25|$|When {{the column}} of {{vehicles}} stopped suddenly during this exchange, T1 Patrol's Breda-carrying truck collided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the wireless truck, wrecking its radiator; the truck {{had to be}} stripped and abandoned and the crew joined other trucks. While the wireless truck was able to continue {{the loss of the}} Breda's firepower was a setback to the unit. In addition a G1 Patrol vehicle wrecked its sump after hitting a rock and this too was stripped and abandoned. T1 Patrol's wireless truck separated from the column and parked in a field at Sidi Selim (about 12km south-east of Barce) to act as a rendezvous point after the attack; this truck was also to keep a constant radio watch for messages from Lt Col David Stirling's SAS unit operating that night against Benghazi ("Operation Bigamy").|$|E
25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium lock bar, milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium lock bar comes in direct contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|E

25|$|The dental series th, nh, lh {{are always}} laminal (that is, {{pronounced}} by touching with {{the surface of}} the tongue just above the tip, called the blade of the tongue), but may be formed in one of three different ways, depending on the language, on the speaker, and on how carefully the speaker pronounces the sound. These are interdental with the tip of the tongue visible between the teeth, as in th in English; dental with the tip of the tongue down behind the lower teeth, so that the blade is visible between the teeth; and denti-alveolar, that is, with both the tip and the blade making contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the upper teeth and alveolar ridge, as in French t, d, n, l. The first tends to be used in careful enunciation, and the last in more rapid speech, while the tongue-down articulation is less common.|$|E
25|$|The drum {{is usually}} {{played in a}} seated position, held {{vertically}} on the player's thigh and supported {{by his or her}} upper body and arm (usually on the left side, for a right-handed player), with the hand placed {{on the inside of the}} skin where it is able to control the tension (and therefore the pitch and timbre) by applying varying amounts of pressure and also the amount of surface area being played, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the hand against the crossbar, if present. The drum is struck with the other arm (usually the right) and is played either with the bare hand or with a tipper. There are numerous playing styles, mostly named after the region of Ireland in which they originated. The most common is Kerry style, which uses a two-headed tipper; the West Limerick style uses only one end of the tipper.|$|E
25|$|On October 25, 1995, at 7:10am CDT, Metra {{train number}} 624, {{traveling}} approximately 60mph (96km/h) {{at the time}} of impact, collided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> a school bus carrying students to Cary-Grove High School at the intersection of Algonquin Road, Northwest Highway (U.S. Highway 14) and a double-tracked mainline belonging to the Union Pacific Railroad. The impact separated the body from the chassis of the bus and catapulted the wreckage into the intersection. Five students were instantly killed and two later died from their injuries. Another 21 were injured, some critically. Most victims suffered blunt trauma and head injuries. The most seriously injured suffered skull fractures, lacerations and internal injuries. Police Officers arrived on scene in less than one minute due to the location of the crash being almost directly across from the former Fox River Grove Police Department, as reported by the former police chief and several reporting officers.|$|E

25|$|The main {{facade of}} the monastery complex is to the west, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> it facing the main plaza and {{municipal}} palace of the town. The town clock is visible from the main plaza; the clock was placed {{on one of the}} monastery’s back towers by Father Evaristo Nava in the early 20th century. The main plaza is sometimes called the Plaza de Tributación, referring to its pre-Hispanic and early colonial period function as a place to collect tribute such as crops and handcrafted items from the area which is now eastern Morelos state. During the early colonial period, this plaza was part of the monastery complex and continued its tribute collecting function. (forteleza) While the San Juan Bautista Church dominates both the town of Yecapixtla as well as the surrounding municipality, {{there are a number of}} other churches such as San Sebastián Mártir, Santiago Apóstol, de la Virgen de Guadalupe, Santo Tomás Apóstol, San Agustín, Nuestro Padre Jesús, Santa Lucía, San Nicolás, San Miguel, Los Reyes, San Marcos, La Santa Cruz, San Pablo, Santa Mónica, La Inmaculada Concepción, Santa Cruz Ecatepec and San Francisco Calapa.|$|E

500|$|Ælfheah was {{the first}} Archbishop of Canterbury to die a violent death.

Some sources record that the final blow, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> an axe, was delivered as an act of kindness by a Christian convert known as [...] "Thrum." [...] Ælfheah was buried in St Paul's Cathedral. In 1023 his body was moved by King Cnut to Canterbury, with great ceremony. Thorkell the Tall was appalled at the brutality of his fellow raiders, and switched sides to the English king Æthelred the Unready following Ælfheah's death.|$|E

500|$|... "The Snowmen" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode Coleman shot as her character; however, it did not begin filming until the week of 6 August 2012, after Coleman had worked on later episodes while Moffat was writing the Christmas special. The read-through had taken place on 2 August 2012. This was the first Christmas special to be filmed in BBC Wales' new Roath Lock studios. Scenes featuring Coleman and several guest stars in a Victorian setting were filmed in Newport, Wales, while Coleman and Smith were also spotted filming in Bristol two weeks later on 21 August. Some scenes which used snow props were filmed in Portland Square, Bristol, where filming took place overnight on 21–22 August 2012. Bristol was chosen because it had Victorian-era architecture.

500|$|The {{weather and}} {{conditions}} on the grid were before dry for the race. The air temperature was [...] with signs of a breeze which could blow sand onto the track and impede the cars' grip. Massa got the best start of the frontrunners off the line, as he passed Kubica into the first corner to take the lead. Hamilton's poor start caused his anti-stall system to kick in, and he was passed by six drivers to fall back to ninth. Räikkönen benefited from Hamilton's start by moving up to third, ahead of Kovalainen, Trulli and Heidfeld. As Massa extended his lead {{at the front of}} the race, Hamilton, who trailed Alonso, collided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the Renault, knocking the McLaren's front wing off the car. Suffering handling difficulties, Hamilton returned to the pit-lane for a new nose section, and rejoined in 18th place. Räikkönen took second place when he passed Kubica on lap three; Heidfeld took fourth when he passed Trulli and Kovalainen in separate manoeuvres. Further down the field, Vettel retired from the race on the first lap after twice colliding with other cars; Button, Sutil and Coulthard pitted to repair early damage.|$|E
500|$|Percussive {{effects in}} {{imitation}} of drumming had been introduced to bowed-string instruments by early in the 17th century. The earliest known use of col legno (tapping on the strings <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the bow) is found in Tobias Hume's First Part of Ayres for unaccompanied viola da gamba (1605), in a piece titled Harke, Harke. Carlo Farina, an Italian violinist active in Germany, also used col legno to mimic {{the sound of a}} drum in his Capriccio stravagante for four stringed instruments (1627), where he also used devices such as glissando, tremolo, pizzicato, and sul ponticello to imitate the noises of barnyard animals (cat, dog, chicken). Later in the century, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, in certain movements of Battalia (1673), added to these effects the device of placing a sheet of paper under the A string of the double bass, in order to imitate the dry rattle of a snare drum, and in [...] "Die liederliche Gesellschaft von allerley Humor" [...] from the same programmatic battle piece, superimposed eight different melodies in different keys, producing in places dense orchestral clusters. He also uses the percussive snap of fortissimo pizzicato to represent gunshots.|$|E
