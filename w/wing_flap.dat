5|$|The {{developers}} {{created the}} game using 96K of memory, which limited the file size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use. The memory limits also prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters. The graphics were created at the pixel level and hand-animated. To animate the birds, Hendricks used Eadweard Muybridge's book Animals In Motion as a reference. Given the limited memory, {{she had to}} balance the number of frames to minimize file size, while maintaining realistic animation. Hendricks originally picked gray for the buzzards, but chose green instead to optimize the color palette as the developers had only 16colors to create the visuals. Once the colors were decided for the character sprites, Newcomer finalized {{the look of the}} platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically required larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy. Though Newcomer prioritized the <b>wing</b> <b>flap,</b> other sound effects like those related to the pterodactyl, collisions, and hatching eggs were considered important as well.|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The {{objective of}} this work {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of head only waterbath stunning as a means of generating immediate and long lasting unconsciousness while preventing <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> and avoiding carcass damage. This paper reports on the unconsciousness and <b>wing</b> <b>flapping,</b> while carcass quality results are reported elsewhere. 2. EEG measurements showed that immersion of broilers heads' for one second in a waterbath containing water of conductivity 2. 5 mS/cm and a 50 Hz electric field of 10 V/cm resulted in a immediate unconsciousness, and that increasing the electric field strength extended the duration of unconsciousness. 3. Observations showed that the passage of a 25 - 30 mA alternating current of frequency 2000 Hz through the broilers' bodies suppressed the <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> which follows a stun. 4. When the body current and electric field were applied simultaneously, <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> was prevented and EEG signals were suppressed for over 30 seconds indicating that the immediate unconsciousness was long lasting enough to facilitate humane slaughter...|$|R
25|$|In qualifying, a front <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> {{fell off}} Roland Ratzenberger's car, causing major {{suspension}} damage and worsened aerodynamics. On his next lap the front wing broke off entirely and became lodged underneath the car, causing Ratzenberger {{to lose control}} and crash into the wall at the Villeneuve kink at over 180mph. His Simtek S941 was severely damaged, and he suffered a basal skull fracture caused by the impact and was pronounced dead at Bologna's Maggiore Hospital shortly afterwards.|$|E

500|$|The last B-52A (serial 52-0003) was {{modified}} and redesignated NB-52A in 1959 {{to carry the}} North American X-15. A pylon was fitted under the right wing between the fuselage and the inboard engines with a 6feet x 8feet (1.8m x 2.4m) section removed from the right <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> to fit the X-15 tail. Liquid oxygen and hydrogen peroxide tanks were installed in the bomb bays to fuel the X-15 before launch. Its first flight with the X-15 was on 19 March 1959, with the first launch on 8 June 1959. The NB-52A, named [...] "The High and Mighty One" [...] carried the X-15 on 93 of the program's 199 flights.|$|E

2500|$|V1 is the {{critical}} engine failure recognition speed or takeoff decision speed. It is the speed above which the takeoff will continue even if an engine fails or another problem occurs, such as a blown tire. The speed will vary among aircraft types and varies according to factors such as aircraft weight, runway length, <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> setting, engine thrust used and runway surface contamination, thus it must {{be determined by the}} pilot before takeoff. Aborting a takeoff after V1 is strongly discouraged because the aircraft will by definition not be able to stop {{before the end of the}} runway, thus suffering a [...] "runway overrun".|$|E
2500|$|The second {{incident}} occurred on 20 July 1975. It involved {{another of the}} company's Handley Page Dart Heralds (registration: G-APWF) in a runway accident while departing London Gatwick on a scheduled flight to Guernsey. According to eye-witness reports, the aircraft lifted off from runway 26 after a ground run of [...] and appeared airborne for [...] with its landing gear retracting before the rear underside of the fuselage settled back on to the runway. None of the 45 occupants, including the 41 passengers who were safely evacuated via the aircraft's crew entrance door by the two cabin crew members on the instructions of the flight's commander, were hurt in that accident. The subsequent investigation concluded that this accident had been caused by the landing gear being retracted before the aircraft had been properly established in its initial climb. Other contributory factors included a mistaken <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> configuration and the resulting inadequate airspeed at rotation. The aircraft itself sustained substantial damage and required extensive repairs {{in order to be}} restored to an airworthy condition.|$|E

40|$|Multi-wing {{hovering}} and gliding flapping Micro Air Vehicles (�MAV�) are disclosed. The MAV {{can have}} independent wing control to provide enhance {{energy efficiency and}} high maneuverability. Power to each wing can be controlled separately by varying the amplitude of the <b>wing</b> <b>flapping,</b> {{the frequency of the}} <b>wing</b> <b>flapping,</b> or both. The flapping frequency can be controlled such that it is at or near the natural frequency of the wings for improved energy efficiency. The wings can be controlled by a gear train, coil-magnet arrangement or many other actuation systems that enable variable frequency flapping, variable amplitude flapping, or a combination of both. The gear train mechanism provides gyroscopic stability during flight. The <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> can include a rotation, or feathering motion, for improved efficiency. The wings can be transitioned between flapping flight and fixed wing flight to enable gliding and hovering in a single configuration. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Numerous tudies on the {{aerodynamics}} {{of insect}} <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> {{were carried out}} on different approaches of flight investigations, model experiments, and numerical simulations, but the theoretical modeling remains to be explored. In the present paper, an analytic approach is presented to model the flow interactions of <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> in air for small insects with the surrounding flow fields being highly unsteady and highly viscous. The model of <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> is a 2 -D flat plate, which makes plunging and pitching oscillations as well as quick rotations reversing its positions of {{leading and trailing edges}}, respectively, during stroke reversals. It contains three simplified aerodynamic assumptions: (i) unsteady potential flow; (ii) discrete vortices shed from both leading and trailing edges of the wing; (iii) Kutta conditions applied at both edges. Then the problem is reduced to the solution of the unsteady Laplace equation, by using distributed singularities, i. e., sources/sinks, and vortices in the field. To validate the present physical model and analytic method proposed via benchmark examples, two elemental motions in <b>wing</b> <b>flapping</b> and a case of whole flapping cycles are analyzed, and the predicted results agree well with available xperimental nd numerical data. This verifies that the present analytical approach may give qualitatively correct and quantitatively reasonable results. Furthermore, the total fluid-dynamic force in the present method can be decomposed into three parts...|$|R
