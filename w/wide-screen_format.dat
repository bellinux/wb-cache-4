25|$|Fair City's {{original}} opening sequence {{was designed}} by Carol Coffey. The second opening sequence was introduced in 1995 when the then executive producer John Lynch decided that the opening needed modernising. It {{was designed by}} John Hayes in collaboration with John Lynch. For 10 years, the opening remained unchanged, aside from the digital insertion of the Millennium Bridge. In order to be compatible with <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format</b> and show {{the changing face of}} Dublin, a new opening, designed by Michael McKeon, was introduced in 2005. The present opening, designed by Paul Gibney, was introduced in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disaster}} {{was again}} {{the subject of}} an episode in the documentary series Mayday (Air Crash Investigation) on 2 March 2009 entitled [...] "Sight Unseen", in a <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format</b> with sophisticated computer animations on National Geographic Channel.|$|E
50|$|Gundam F91 was Sunrise's {{first movie}} that used <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format</b> {{materials}} for its production. Until then, all of Sunrise's movie productions had used normal-sized paper, {{which were then}} cut off {{at the top and}} bottom in order to adapt it to wide-screen.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately Warner sharply curtailed {{feature films}} using <b>wide-screen</b> <b>formats</b> in 1957, using Technirama {{for only the}} most {{expensive}} productions. The studio’s declining interest in CinemaScope, along with the shrinking market for short films, prompted an abrupt end to the series. During this same period, the concurrently released Joe McDoakes, Robert Youngson documentaries, Looney Tune and Merrie Melodie animated cartoons were released in the more standardized ratio but were equally successful at the box office.|$|R
5000|$|In the San Francisco Chronicle, Edward Guthmann said, [...] "The Fantasticks doesn't try {{to reinvent}} the screen musical, as Cabaret did in 1972, but revives the {{conventions}} of the '50s, when big-screen musicals were opened up for <b>wide-screen</b> <b>formats</b> and actors still broke spontaneously into song [...] [...] [...] it has slow patches and requires a generous suspension of disbelief. But it's also sweet and optimistic - a welcome antidote to gloom." ...|$|R
50|$|Scope Gem was a {{marketing}} series title that Warner Brothers used for documentary film shorts produced in Warnercolor and the <b>wide-screen</b> CinemaScope <b>format.</b> Most {{of these were}} travelogues.|$|R
50|$|Time Stood Still is a 1956 Warner Brothers Scope Gem travelogue, filmed the {{previous}} year in Dinkelsbühl, and presented in the <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format</b> of CinemaScope. Filmmaker André de la Varre handled {{a great many of}} that studio’s documentary shorts of the forties and fifties.|$|E
50|$|Hell's Island is a 1955 American Technicolor {{film noir}} {{directed}} by Phil Karlson starring John Payne and Mary Murphy. The film {{was shot in}} the VistaVision <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format.</b> Hell's Island was re-released in 1962 under the title South Sea Fury. The working titles of this film were Love Is a Weapon and The Ruby Virgin.|$|E
50|$|Slade in Flame {{has been}} {{released}} in VHS and DVD form, and was re-mastered and released in its original Cinemascope <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format</b> on DVD {{for the first time}} in 2007. The set also featured the soundtrack album. In 2015, Salvo Sound & Vision issued a repackaged CD + DVD version of the album and film.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly {{all of the}} Baim titles {{released}} after 1957 are in colour using Eastman-color film stock and were produced for distribution by United Artists in the UK. Many are in <b>wide-screen</b> <b>formats.</b> Baim was keen to use wide screen and the paper archive shows he rented Camera-scope lenses from Adelphi Films in the mid 1950s. A project to restore and digitise the surviving films was started in 1999 by The Baim Collection Limited. After fifteen years work over eighty of the surviving one-hundred and thirty titles have been restored. More than seventy films are thought lost http://www.baimfilms.com/lost.asp [...]|$|R
50|$|The first WWE {{event to}} be shown in <b>wide-screen</b> (16:9) <b>format</b> on Sky Sports was No Way Out on 18 February 2008 at 1 am on Sky Sports 1. Although after this, other WWE {{programming}} were still in standard (4:3) format however due to complaints all WWE programming will now be airing in widescreen from a down-scaled HD feed.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} first {{released}} in the VHS format in the early 1980s in a limited version from Allied Artists Home Video. It was issued again by CBS/Fox video in 1985, 1987 and 1992, and by Warner Home Video in 1997. In 2007, Tickle Me was released {{for the first time}} on DVD, in the <b>wide-screen</b> letterbox <b>format.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Indian Hills Theater in Omaha, Nebraska, United States, {{was built}} in 1962 as a movie theater {{showcasing}} films in the Cinerama <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format.</b> The theater's screen was the largest of its type in the United States. Despite the protests of local citizens, Hollywood legends, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the theater was demolished in 2001 by Nebraska Methodist Health System for a parking lot.|$|E
50|$|Kings of the Road {{was shot}} in black and white, <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format,</b> which is {{explicitly}} mentioned in the titles. Only the first scene of the film where Winter and Lander meet was scripted; everything else was improvised by the actors. Wim Wenders shot 49,000 meters of film and the final cut was 4,760 meters. The camera used was an ARRI 35 BL. The negative material from Kodak (Plus-X and Four-X) copied to Orwo positive.|$|E
5000|$|The movie's exteriors were filmed on {{location}} in Berlin, while interiors were filmed at the Geiselgasteig Studios in Munich over a five-week period {{in the summer of}} 1953, at a cost of $800,000, shot in the new <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format</b> of Cinemascope. Filming was sometimes made difficult by the tensions existing in Berlin between the United States and the Soviet Union. In one scene filmed near the Brandenburg Gate with realistic props, the film crew came under close scrutiny by numerous armed Russians suspicious of the activity.|$|E
2500|$|Mathieu {{celebrated the}} fortieth anniversary {{of her career}} at the Paris Olympia on 24 November 2005, and {{released}} her thirty-eighth French album: Mireille Mathieu 2005. The performance, and an interview, were recorded and released in <b>wide-screen</b> DVD <b>format</b> in 2006; however, the DVD was in European video format only. Mathieu joined with [...] and his Orchestra for this concert, and has worked with him ever since.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} shot in {{black-and-white}} by Loyal Griggs, who composed his scenes in a <b>wide-screen</b> Panavision <b>format</b> often using deep focus. Griggs {{was nominated for a}} Best Cinematographer Academy Award for his work. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is also notable, as is the work of Saul Bass in the credit titles sequence (this sequence actually comes {{at the very end of}} the film, an interesting departure from the norm in a major Hollywood production at the time).|$|R
50|$|Vast is my Native Land (1958), {{also known}} as Great is my Country, (Широка страна моя родная), from {{the song of the}} same name, which is {{featured}} in the film, by the Russian composer Isaac Dunaevsky) was the first film shot in the Soviet <b>wide-screen</b> film <b>format</b> known as Kinopanorama. The film was directed by Roman Karmen, known for various documentary films produced in the Soviet Union. The music was composed by Kirill Molchanov, a noted composer of music for ballet and opera.|$|R

5000|$|Thúy Nga DVDs include {{digitally}} mastered {{sound and}} picture quality. Most Thúy Nga DVDs {{are presented in}} a <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format.</b> All DVDs are mastered in either Dolby Stereo sound or Dolby Surround sound. Normally, major companies produce [...] "regional" [...] DVDs, which is either DVD-1 or DVD-2. However, as Thuy Nga is an international company with headquarters in the US, Canada, France, and Australia, Thúy Nga chooses to produce the DVD-9 NTSC international format, which causes major piracy problems in Vietnam, where it is officially banned by the communist regime, which deems them as [...] "reactionary material", for their anti-communist position. Beginning with In Paris By Night 105: The Lovers, the company began producing Blu-Ray format discs that cost $24.95.|$|E
50|$|After {{serving in}} World War I, Ryder studied physics and {{mathematics}} at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1924. He {{went to work}} at Pacific Telephone & Telegraph where he developed an improved technique for transmitting images over telephone lines, using light valves. In 1928, Ryder joined Paramount Pictures where he worked in the emerging field of talking pictures. From and 1936 until 1957 he served as the studio's chief engineer and sound director. Some of his achievements included the development of the VistaVision <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format</b> and the production of the first full-length film using magnetic audio recording. Ryder was part of the production team who received an Academy Honorary Award at the 11th Academy Awards for their efforts on the Paramount film Spawn of the North.|$|E
50|$|When Twentieth Century Fox {{introduced}} <b>wide-screen</b> CinemaScope <b>format,</b> {{the head}} of production Darryl Zanuck repeatedly reminded his directors {{to take full advantage}} of the screen width by staging action all the way across the frame - in his words, 'keep the people spread out'. He wanted the audience to experience the full width of the new screen shape. The 'washing line' staging demanded by Zanuck not only was a commercial imperative, it also was a practical solution for the lack of color film sensitivity as well for inability to employ deep staging.|$|R
50|$|Charro! was {{released}} to DVD {{in the summer}} of 2007. It marked the very first time that an uncut release of the film was presented to the retail market, and in its original <b>wide-screen</b> letterbox <b>format.</b> This DVD version underwent an extensive re-mastering process to restore the original 35mm film-print quality. Previous VHS issues of the film, notably the 1990 Warner Home Video release, were of an inferior standard, mainly due to poor picture quality and minor edits throughout the movie. An oddity concerning Charro! is the film's classification. Despite containing violence and partial nudity (the latter a scene in which Ina Balin's character is shown exiting a bath tub), it {{was released}} with an MPAA G rating, even though other Presley films from the 1968-69 period carry PG ratings. These latter releases are somewhat less 'adult' than Charro!.|$|R
40|$|Discover Florida's {{story from}} the prehistoric to the present with life-sized casts of Ice Age mammals, {{realistic}} dioramas, and fossil exhibits that explain how Florida was formed, all at the South Florida Museum and Planetarium. The Bishop Planetarium is an all digital full dome planetarium/theater, featuring astronomy presentations, sound and light shows and <b>wide-screen</b> large <b>format</b> programming. Also part of the Museum is the Parker Aquarium, designated by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{as part of the}} Manatee Rehabilitation Network. The Aquarium has hosted a succession of young manatees being readied for re-release to their natural habitats. The resident manatee, Snooty, came to the Museum in 1949 and has been helping to educate visitors about the conservation of manatees and the ecosystem of the Bayou. Educational programming includes hands-on classroom programming, homeschool science courses, as well as programs for adults that include tours of the museum’s permanent and temporary exhibits, and an educational presentation on manatees in the Parker Manatee Aquarium. Educational levels: Informal education...|$|R
50|$|Wenders and Robby Müller {{had hoped}} to shoot in 35 mm with the Arri BL, which had just come out at the time, {{but it was too}} {{difficult}} {{to get a hold of}} one, a common problem with newly issued cameras. Combined with their budgetary limitations, they were left with no other option than to switch to 16 mm. They filmed with a 1:1.66 <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format,</b> a common European format at the time, and drew it on the viewfinder. According to Wenders and Müller, that was the format they preferred, but due to television broadcast demands, they had to provide a 3:4 full frame format of the film, even though they never composed for it. This would create some problems in later years before everything was rectified with a definitive restoration in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|It {{became known}} as the [...] "Water Ski Capital of the World" [...] because it was the site of many of the sport's {{landmark}} firsts and over 50 world records were broken there. During World War II, soldiers visited and waterskiing was introduced for their entertainment. Numerous movies were filmed at the park, including portions of This is Cinerama, the first feature filmed in the <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format,</b> and a string of Esther Williams films and TV specials in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s the Southern Belles attraction was introduced, in which young women dressed in the crinolines reminiscent of the Antebellum South. During the American Civil War Centennial young men dressed in Confederate uniforms would be photographed with the Southern Belles. In the early 1960s a custom photography boat named Miss Cover Girl was introduced, and the park became a popular site for the filming of television commercials.|$|E
5000|$|The {{curved screen}} was {{designed}} {{to take advantage of}} the effect of peripheral images in the viewer's eye and create the feeling that the viewer was in the picture. A state-of-the-art, multi-track stereo sound system heightened the sense of realism. Prior to the first Cinerama production, movies were projected on a nearly-square flat screen and the sound was one-channel monophonic. As a result of Cinerama the film industry adopted the single-projector <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format</b> and stereophonic sound as the norm. At the peak of Cinerama's popularity, there were over 200 theaters in the world capable of projecting Cinerama films. Most of these were existing theaters adapted to use the Cinerama process. Ten theaters, however, were built specifically for Cinerama films. The Martin Corporation built such theaters in New Orleans, Seattle, and St. Louis. Others were located in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Cuba, and Japan. Of the ten theaters designed for Cinerama, three near-identical [...] "Super-Cineramas" [...] were built in Denver (Cooper Theater) (1961), Minneapolis (Cooper Theater) (1961), and Omaha (Indian Hills Theater) (1962). Only three (3) theaters remain that are configured to show Cinerama. These theaters are located in Seattle (Martin Cinerama Theater), Los Angeles (Cinerama Dome), and Bradford, England (National Media Museum). Only the theater in England has regular showings of Cinerama films.|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of optical flow estimation algorithms has been improving steadily {{as evidenced by}} results on the Middlebury optical flow benchmark. The typical formulation, however, has changed little since the work of Horn and Schunck. We attempt to uncover what has made recent advances possible through a thorough analysis of how the objective function, the optimization method, and modern implementation practices influence accuracy. We discover that "classical'' flow formulations perform surprisingly well when combined with modern optimization and implementation techniques. One key implementation detail is the median filtering of intermediate flow fields during optimization. While this improves the robustness of classical methods it actually leads to higher energy solutions, meaning that these methods are not optimizing the original objective function. To understand the principles behind this phenomenon, we derive a new objective function that formalizes the median filtering heuristic. This objective function includes a non-local smoothness term that robustly integrates flow estimates over large spatial neighborhoods. By modifying this new term to include information about flow and image boundaries we develop a method that can better preserve motion details. To {{take advantage of the}} trend towards video in <b>wide-screen</b> <b>format,</b> we further introduce an asymmetric pyramid downsampling scheme that enables the estimation of longer range horizontal motions. The methods are evaluated on Middlebury, MPI Sintel, and KITTI datasets using the same parameter settings...|$|E
