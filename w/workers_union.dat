40|$|This {{research}} shows that several factors have caused the unavailability of <b>worker</b> <b>union.</b> The factors include the government, the companies, the laws and the workers. The government does not actively socialize and supervise <b>worker</b> <b>unions.</b> Moreover, employers prefer an unofficial <b>worker</b> <b>union</b> rather than the official one. The Indonesian Industrial Relationship Law and <b>Worker</b> <b>Union</b> Law regard <b>worker</b> <b>union</b> as a right rather than an obligation. However, the workers do not {{fully aware of the}} benefit of the <b>union.</b> Rather, the <b>workers</b> consider the requirement of providing article of association and financial autonomy as burdens in establishing the union.

5|$|A Roman Catholic, Dacey was {{influenced}} in his political opinions by protectionism and the rerum novarum, which supported people's {{right to join}} trade unions. He combined these beliefs with his experience with the Wool and Basil <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> and the Labor platform. He was an anti-billite, meaning that he was against Federation, and spoke against it, for example at Coraki, New South Wales on 15 June 1899, based on his opposition to free trade.|$|E

5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw the parties involved agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E

5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistrust of}} Standard Oil was {{partially}} {{the result of}} a suspicion toward carpetbaggers, which ironically was also the source of skepticism regarding labor unions. Union organizers were frequently seen as attempting to support a Northern agenda of promoting opportunities for African Americans {{at the expense of the}} white population. Because of the situation this created, labor reform was slow to develop. Despite the anti-union sentiments, groups like the International Oil <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> attracted membership and held some influence in the industry and state government.|$|E

5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier the Fisheries {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant overturn at the ministerial level. In {{less than three years}} Dunderdale had appointed her fourth Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. Keith Hutchings became that fourth minister after his appointment on October 9, 2013. Following his appointment a representative with the Fish, Food and Allied <b>Workers</b> <b>union</b> said he hoped to see the minister stay in his portfolio {{for a longer period of}} time, as he was the seventh minister in the portfolio in ten years. Dunderdale's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman, who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier. Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election, when Darin King took over the portfolio. Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year. Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the overturn in ministers showed that there was no plan for the fishery.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} printed {{pictures of}} Arsenal fans {{alleged to have}} been part of the violence. It later arose that the majority of the people in the photos were either not involved or had been acting in self-defence. The photos led to some postmen working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, even though they had not been arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication <b>Workers</b> <b>Union,</b> and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round. The union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full-time workers being made redundant and {{a significant increase in the}} number of part-time staff. The Communication <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail stopped talking to staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not stopped talking to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|E

5|$|Senator Robert F. Wagner {{proposed}} the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no {{stand on the}} legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to Henry Ford, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise (supporting the auto <b>workers</b> <b>union,</b> yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|After the January 11 congressional hearing, Ross delayed {{enforcement}} of the FEPC directive to await {{the outcome of the}} upcoming union elections. The PRTEU contract with the PTC was expiring on February 11, 1944 and a union election was called for March 14, 1944. Apart from PRTEU, which was still staunchly opposed to promotions of black employees, there were two other unions competing for the right to represent PTC workers: the Transport <b>Workers</b> <b>Union</b> (TWU), which was a Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) affiliate, and the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, an American Federation of Labor (AFL) affiliate. The TWU said that it would allow promotions of black employees while the Amalgamated Association stayed silent on the matter. The PRTEU leadership tried to campaign on the race issue during the union elections, but the topic was overshadowed by other issues, such as the details of a new contract with the PTC. After a bitter campaign, the TWU won the union elections, receiving more votes than both of the other unions combined. At the time of the elections many white workers perceived the contract issue to be more important, where the TWU was promising more attractive terms, and they did not consider promotions of black employees a realistic possibility. Despite the TWU victory, animosities from white workers towards the black employees remained and were largely unabated. The negotiations between the TWU and the PTC on a new contract dragged on, {{and in the absence of}} a contract the company continued to resist implementing the FEPC directives.|$|E
