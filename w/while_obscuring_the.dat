This action effectively destroyed the Harzburger Front as Hugenberg had not been consulted before-hand. In the first round of the presidential election on 13 March 1932, the DNVP supported Theodor Duesterberg, and after he withdrew from the race following his dreadful showing, endorsed no candidate for the second round on 10 April 1932.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article aims to {{elucidate}} the strategies used in media discourses {{to create a}} favorable social imaginary of ethanol manufacturing, {{as well as to}} promote the environmentalization of production. Based on the analysis of advertisements, we seek to demonstrate how the meanings of nature conservation, combatting global warming, protecting biodiversity and producing clean energy are used. In a scenario of increasing environmental concern these elements have gained visibility and importance for consumers, businesses, governments and legislators. This paper suggests that the industry has produced a chimerical image of ethanol production which associates itself to the idea of sustainability, <b>while</b> <b>obscuring</b> <b>the</b> existence of conflicts...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original study of Australian journalistic professionalism as observed during the Iraq War, 2003. Through {{an analysis of}} both in-depth interviews conducted with Australian Iraq War journalists and news discourse produced by Australian journalists at Central Command and ‘embedded’ during the Iraq war, {{it is argued that}} professionalism provides the framework of intelligibility used by war journalists to produce accounts of war. Professionalism also serves as a ‘regime of truth’, through which the centrality of professional norms in journalism are articulated. The paper then demonstrates that professionalism, however, serves to justify and legitimate journalistic practice and meaning construction <b>while</b> <b>obscuring</b> <b>the</b> co-opted, functional role played by journalism within contemporary war administration and military strategy. Drawing on discourse analytic concepts, this paper argues professionalism operates as a form of ‘ideological fantasy’, which both militarises journalism and conversely journalises the military...|$|E

40|$|Since the 1990 s, politicising the {{environment}} has often involved the development of green concepts of citizenship. Informed by these concepts, cultural anthropology is used to examine prevailing ideas and practices of stakeholder citizenship. Of central concern are conditions wherein heightened individuation coincides with increased awareness of environmental issues. In the prevalence of stakeholder citizenship norms, the social task of addressing the ecological challenge is represented as individual opportunities and personal responsibilities. One upshot of this is that, as stakeholders, citizens are led to feel personally responsible for resolving socially created problems. In such contexts, increased awareness of environmental issues has the paradoxical effect of compromising citizens&# 039; ethical commitments within the ecosphere. By privileging managed consultation over motivating citizens politically, the normalising of stakeholder citizenship poses a problem for green politics by {{making it difficult to}} put sustainability into practice, <b>while</b> <b>obscuring</b> <b>the</b> unsustainability of much social activity...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} two online comics about Australia’s policies of detaining asylum seekers, one {{created by the}} Australian government’s Customs and Border Protection Service (CBPS), and one published by the experimental journalism site The Global Mail. Through {{an analysis of the}} way online readers responded to these comics, this article shows how digital comics use visual style to imply particular kinds of relationships between their authors and their audience, while generating audience engagement through abstracted emotions and narrative gaps. These features have political dimensions, as in the CBPS’s comic, which elides crucial details about the government’s policies while suggesting (but never directly stating) its disregard for the human rights of asylum seekers, while The Global Mail’s comic uses a hand-drawn visual style to generate reader sympathy for the detainees and opposition to the government’s policies. Both comics use visual language to obfuscate key elements about the sources of their messages <b>while</b> also <b>obscuring</b> <b>the</b> voices of the refugees that their images represent.

40|$|Since the {{declaration}} by the United Nations that awareness raising {{should be a}} key part of efforts to combat human trafficking, government and non-government organisations have produced numerous public awareness campaigns designed to capture the public’s attention and sympathy. These campaigns represent the ‘problem’ of trafficking in specific ways, creating heroes and villains by placing the blame for trafficking on some, <b>while</b> <b>obscuring</b> <b>the</b> responsibility of others. This paper adopts Carol Bacchi’s ‘What is the problem represented to be?’ framework for examining the politicisation of problem representation in 18 anti-trafficking awareness campaigns. It is argued that these campaigns construct a narrow understanding of the problem through the depiction of ‘ideal offenders’. In particular, a strong focus on the demand for commercial sex as causative of human trafficking serves to obscure the problematic role of consumerism {{in a wide range of}} industries, and perpetuates an understanding of trafficking that fails to draw a necessary distinction between the demand for labour, and the demand for ‘exploitable’ labour. This problem representation also obscures the role governments in destination countries may play in causing trafficking through imposing restrictive migration regimes that render migrants vulnerable to traffickers...|$|E
40|$|The Wire {{has been}} praised for its {{particular}} realist aesthetic style {{that is a}} radical departure from the traditional television police procedural and that takes many of its cues from the film noir. The Wire’s unique use, and functioning, of sound extends beyond the limits of visual representation which privileges audio detail. It relies on listening as its central thematic to propel the story <b>while</b> <b>obscuring</b> <b>the</b> gaze. The series explores the specificities of Baltimore’s West Side vernacular and how its use complicates power, knowledge, and meaning while simultaneously remapping its urban spaces. It expertly demonstrates how complex vernacular, along with foreign languages, codes, dialects and accents, can complicate listening and understanding. The Wire’s representation of urban spaces and experiences allows for meaningful consideration of Edward Dimendberg’s seminal work on the representation of the city in the film noir, as well as Michel Chion’s work on film sound studies. Employing Dimendberg’s framework, and considering Henri Lefebvre’s concept of modern spatial practices, I analyze representations of The Wire’s urban spaces and experiences, taking into account the crucial role that sound and surveillance play in constituting its urban spaces and lived experiences. Employing Chion’s work, I explore how The Wire’s use of sound demands the active perception of its complex acousmatic imaginary, in order to achieve a rich understanding about different spaces within the same city. The Wire invites active engagement in order to promote complex understanding about modern American urban...|$|E
40|$|Protection {{of digital}} data from {{unauthorized}} access is of paramount importance. In {{the past several}} years, much research has concentrated on protecting data {{from the standpoint of}} confidentiality, integrity and availability. Software is a form of data with unique properties and its protection poses unique challenges. First, software can be reverse engineered, which may result in stolen intellectual property. Second, software can be altered with the intent of performing operations this software must not be allowed to perform. With commercial software increasingly distributed in forms from which source code can be easily extracted, such as Java bytecodes, reverse engineering has become easier than ever. Obfuscation techniques have been proposed to impede illegal reverse engineers. Obfuscations are program transformations that preserve the program functionality <b>while</b> <b>obscuring</b> <b>the</b> code, thereby protecting the program against reverse engineering. Unfortunately, the existing obfuscation techniques are limited to obscuring variable names, transformations of local control flow, and obscuring expressions using variables of primitive types. In this paper, we propose obfuscations of design of object-oriented programs. We describe three techniques for obfuscation of program design. The class coalescing obfuscation replaces several classes with a single class. The class splitting obfuscation replaces a single class with multiple classes, each responsible for a part of the functionality of the original class. The type hiding obfuscation uses the mechanism of interfaces in Java to obscure the types of objects manipulated by the program. We show the results of our initial experiments with a prototype implementation of these techniques...|$|E
