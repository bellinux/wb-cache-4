40|$|We model {{polymers}} by a {{chain of}} connected disks placed on the horizontal porous bronze <b>working</b> <b>plate</b> of an air table. Spatial and temporal fluctuations of the air stream at the bronze <b>working</b> <b>plate</b> act as a heat source for the polymer causing it to move and curl in a random fashion. The quenched randomness of the polymer's environment is modelled by placing heavy objects on the bronze plate. We find that the average radius of gyration of the chain, r, scales with the chain length N as r∝Nν, where ν= 0. 68 ± 0. 03, for three different densities of heavy objects.

40|$|Continuous tone printing, either {{collotype}} or screenless lithography, are {{processes that}} are in limited use. The halftone method of reproduction {{is still the most}} economical way to reproduce a continuous tone original. This study dealt with the mechanism of screenless lithography, more specifically on how to make the use of negative working plates a feasible alternative to positive working plates. It is known that the positive <b>working</b> <b>plate</b> can print a longer range of tones than a negative <b>working</b> <b>plate.</b> So the main point of the experiment dealt with how to extend the range of a negative <b>working</b> <b>plate.</b> A negative plate is of high contrast, and so multiple negative working plates were used to print one image. Each plate in itself can print three to four steps of a continuous tone step wedge. In this experiment, three plates were used in the hopes of printing twelve steps in a continuous gradation. A continuous tone step wedge along with a black and white photograph were divided among the three plates. Twelve steps on the step wedge were identified, and so each film had four of the possible thirty steps which existed on the step wedge. These films were exposed to plates, and mounted on the press. Each image was run in registration with one another, and the solid ink density was varied to produce the continuous tone effect. From the press sheets examined, in which there are examples in this report, a high contrast image was produced. One of the main problems in the experiment was differences in emulsion coating on each individual plate. Which resulted in inconsistent exposure times from one plate to another. From repeated plate testing using a. 15 density increment continuous tone step wedge as a control guide, it was found that for the same exposure a hardening of the plate coating (and consequently of ink receptivity) corresponding to two steps equaling. 30 density difference was to be expected. This made it virtually impossible {{to get a handle on}} the correct exposure time needed for the plate. Results from this experiment show, that it is not possible to effectively print a continuous tone image with a negative <b>working</b> <b>plate</b> and or multiple negative plates. This is due to the high contrast of the negative <b>working</b> <b>plate,</b> thus making it suitable for mainly halftone lithographic purposes...|$|E

The position of the screws can influence construct stiffness, plate strain and cyclic fatigue of the implants. Studies have not investigated these variables in implants utilized for long bone fracture fixation in dogs and cats. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of <b>plate</b> <b>working</b> length on construct stiffness, gap motion and resistance to cyclic fatigue of dog femora with a simulated fracture gap stabilized using a 12 -hole 2. 4 mm locking compression plates (LCP). Femora were plated with 12 -hole 2. 4 mm LCP using 2 screws per fracture segment (long working length group) or with 12 -hole 2. 4 mm LCP using 5 screws per fracture segment (a short working length group). Results: Construct stiffness did not differ significantly between stabilization techniques. Implant failure did not occur in any of the plated femora during cycling. Mean ± SD yield load at failure in the short <b>plate</b> <b>working</b> length group was significantly higher than in the long <b>plate</b> <b>working</b> length group. Conclusion: In a femoral fracture gap model stabilized with a 2. 4 mm LCP applied in contact with the bone, <b>plate</b> <b>working</b> length had no effect on stiffness, gap motion and resistance to fatigue.

40|$|Temperature, {{plastic strain}} and heat {{generation}} during the plunge {{stage of the}} friction stir welding (FSW) of high-strength aluminium alloys 2024 T 3 and 2024 T 351 are considered in this work. The plunging of the tool into the material is done at different rotating speeds. A three-dimensional finite element (FE) model for thermomechanical simulation is developed. It is based on arbitrary Lagrangian– Eulerian formulation, and Johnson–Cook material law is used for modelling of material behaviour. From comparison of the numerical results for alloys 2024 T 3 and 2024 T 351, {{it can be seen}} that the former has more intensive heat generation from the plastic deformation, due to its higher strength. Friction heat generation is only slightly different for the two alloys. Therefore, temperatures in the <b>working</b> <b>plate</b> are higher in the alloy 2024 T 3 for the same parameters of the plunge stage. Equivalent plastic strain is higher for 2024 T 351 alloy, and the highest values are determined under the tool shoulder and around the tool pin. For the alloy 2024 T 3, equivalent plastic strain is the highest in the influence zone of the tool pin. Key words: friction stir welding, numerical simulation, temperature fields, hea...|$|E
40|$|The liquid {{desiccant}} dehumidification system (LDDS) {{is promising}} by removing extra air moisture effectively with absorption. By significantly affecting the film wetted area, the desiccant contact {{angle of the}} liquid/air interface on the <b>working</b> <b>plate</b> is critical for the system performance. Its value accuracy also seriously impacts the prediction accuracy of theoretical models. However, previous research on the liquid desiccant contact angle was limited, {{and the results of}} current predictions were questionable. This paper tested the contact angle of commonly used desiccants, Lithium Chloride (LiCl) and Lithium Bromide (LiBr) aqueous solution, on the stainless steel plate, and developed empirical formulas for predicting the angle. For both desiccants, the contact angle increased with the solution mass concentration and decreased with temperature. With the increase of plate surface roughness, the angle first increased and then decreased. These parameters showed much obvious effects on the angle of LiCl. For the effect of roughness, the maximum changing rate of LiCl was 0. 13 °/nm compared with 0. 07 °/nm of LiBr. Errors between new formulas and experiment ones were acceptable, showing an average absolute error of 12. 3 % for LiCl and 9. 4 % for LiBr. Furthermore, the effects of contact angle on the film wetted area were investigated experimentally with a single channel regenerator. When the plate surface was hydrophilic, the initial film width was significantly enlarged, with a rate of - 2. 0 × 10 - 3 m per degree, and film contraction along the flow direction was restrained due to the small contact angle. So, the film wetted area increased with an average changing rate of - 9. 7 × 10 - 4 m 2 per degree, and the mass transfer was effectively enhanced by 2 - 3 times. Effective measures to reduce the contact angle were also proposed. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Dark {{reaction}} {{is a condition}} in which the plate acts as if it is exposed to a low level of active light, even though it is being stored in the dark. The Stouffer scale or the sensitivity guide is used to measure this dark reaction which takes place also as a result of high temperature and relative humidity. If there is much dark reaction taking place, more solid steps will show up on a negative <b>working</b> <b>plate.</b> For the purpose of this experiment diazo and photopolymer presensitised, negative working, lithographic plates were chosen. These plates were cut into small sections to eliminate plate variables. They were then subjected to different levels of temperature and relative humidity in a temperature controllable oven. The relative humidity being controlled by using various super- saturated salt solutions. A light integrator was used to expose the plates to the same amount of light energy, with a sensitivity guide. The plates were then developed by hand and the critical or solid step determined visually to measure the dark reaction undergone by the plates due to variations in temperature, relative humidity, and time. With the results obtained curves were drawn to study the relationship between dark reaction and temperature, dark reaction and relative humidity, and dark reaction and time. The curves show an increase in dark reaction with an increase in temperature, relative humidity, and time in the case of diazo plates. The photopolymer plates, on the other hand, seemed to be more stable at higher temperatures, but a high relative humidity destroys the plate coating. A statistical analyses was done on the results and the percentage dependence of dark reaction on temperature, relative humidity, and time were determined. It is concluded that dark reaction does occur in diazo and photopolymer presensitized plates. And that these plates would last longer if stored under the optimum temperature and relative humidity as suggested by analyzing the data. The results obtained disprove the assumption that photopolymer presensitized plates are not influenced by temperature and relative humidity...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies and}} {{investigations}} {{have been conducted}} to test the new Toray plate. The studies revealed that the new plate eliminated {{many of the problems}} that used to hinder the progress and development of the driographic plate system. The two major problems with this plate were short run lengths and toning in the non-image areas. This study investigates toning problems in negative <b>working</b> Toray <b>plates.</b> Toning is a term that refers to the non-image areas of the driographic plate that are accepting ink. Previous studies have shown that ink tack and flow do not affect toning in any way. However, printing speed, nip pressure, printing density and ink temperature were found to have some effect on toning. To investigate the effect that different percentages of oil in the ink has on toning in the non-image areas of Toray negative <b>working</b> <b>plates,</b> this study uses five ink samples, each containing a different percentage of oil, and measures with a densitometer the density of toning in the non-image areas. The hypothesis tested in this study states that the amount of toning in the non-image areas of negative Toray plates increases as the amount of oil contained in the ink increases. Upon analyzing the data collected, it was found that when using the special driographic ink no scumming occured. However, the hypothesis proved to stand true because it was found that a strong positive relationship exists between the amount of oil contained in the driographic ink and the amount of toning in the non-image areas of negative Toray plates...|$|R

A second technique using ink tack-reducer to alter ink tack was performed as an alternative test to support the initial method results. During the course of the study a number of variables could have altered the test results. These variables were monitored and kept constant during testing.

Locking compression plates with bicortical screws (LCP-Bi) were also tested. Screw configurations {{with two or three}} screws per fragment modelled long (8 -hole), intermediate (6 -hole), and short (4 -hole) <b>plate</b> <b>working</b> lengths. Responses to axial compression, biplanar four-point bending and axial load-to-failure were recorded. Results: LCP-Bi were not significantly different from LCP-Mono control for any of the outcome variables. In bending, LCPR- 20 were not significantly different from LCP-Bi and LCP-Mono. The LCPR- 30 were stiffer than LCPR- 20 and the controls. The LCPR- 40 constructs were stiffer than all other constructs. The addition of an intramedullary pin of any size provided a significant increase in axial stiffness and load to failure. This effect was incremental with increasing intramedullary pin diameter. As <b>plate</b> <b>working</b> length decreased there was a significant increase in stiffness across all constructs.

Locking compression plates with monocortical locking screws were tested with no pin (LCP-Mono) and intramedullary pins of 20 % (LCPR- 20), 30 % (LCPR- 30) and 40 % (LCPR- 40) of intramedullary diameter. Two screws per fragment modelled a long (8 -hole) and short (4 -hole) <b>plate</b> <b>working</b> length. Strain responses to axial compression were recorded at six regions of the plate via three-dimensional digital image correlation. Results: The addition of a pin of any size provided {{a significant decrease in}} plate strain. For the long working length, LCPR- 30 and LCPR- 40 had significantly lower strain than the LCPR- 20, and plate strain was significantly higher adjacent to the screw closest to the fracture site.

Plate strain was significantly lower for the short working length compared to the long working length for the LCP-Mono and LCPR- 20 constructs, but not for the LCPR- 30 and LCPR- 40 constructs. Clinical significance: The increase in plate strain encountered with a long working length can be overcome by the use of a pin of 30 – 40 % intramedullary diameter. Where placement of a large diameter pin is not possible, screws should be placed as close to the fracture gap as possible to minimize plate strain and distribute it more evenly over the plate...|$|R

This paper developed {{a new model of}} plate dehumidifier concerning the shrinkage shape and the variable film thickness of falling film. The new model was validated by experiments and compared with existing models. The results indicated that the effect of contact angles on dehumidification performance can be accurately predicted. The moisture removal rates increased rapidly from 2. 0 g/kg to 2. 56 g/kg as the contact angles decreased from 85 ° to 5 °, while the wetting area increased from 0. 145 m 2 to 0. 176 m 2. The distribution of the humidity ratio of process air along flow direction with different contact angles was also simulated. Besides, the average film thickness decreased from 0. 952 mm to 0. 889 mm as the contact angles decreased from 85 ° to 5 °. The annual electricity consumption of plate LDACS with different contact angles for a typical building in Hong Kong was estimated and analysed by using the newly developed model.
