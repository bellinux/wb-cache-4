25|$|The merle allele, which {{produces}} a mingled or patchwork combination of {{dark and light}} areas, is the coat pattern most commonly associated with the breed. This merle (M) is dominant, so heterozygous dogs (Mm) show the pigmentation pattern; however, when two merles are bred, the statistical risk is 25% of the offspring <b>will</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the two copies of the merle gene (homozygous). These dogs usually have a mostly white coat and blue irises, and are often deaf, blind, or both. In this case, the deafness and blindness are linked to having two copies of the merle gene, which disrupts pigmentation and produces these health defects.|$|E

25|$|During the turnaround, the {{traveling}} twin {{is in an}} accelerated reference frame. According to the equivalence principle, {{the traveling}} twin may analyze the turnaround phase as if the stay-at-home twin were freely falling in a gravitational field and as if the traveling twin were stationary. A 1918 paper by Einstein presents a conceptual sketch of the idea. From the viewpoint of the traveler, a calculation for each separate leg, ignoring the turnaround, leads to a result in which the Earth clocks age less than the traveler. For example, if the Earth clocks age 1day less on each leg, the amount that the Earth clocks will lag behind amounts to 2days. The physical description of what happens at turnaround has to produce a contrary effect of double that amount: 4days' advancing of the Earth clocks. Then the traveler's clock <b>will</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a net 2-day delay on the Earth clocks, in agreement with calculations done {{in the frame of}} the stay-at-home twin.|$|E

The degree of belief has been interpreted as, [...] "the price at which you would buy or sell a bet that pays 1 unit of utility if E, 0 if not E." [...] The most popular version of subjective probability is Bayesian probability, which includes expert knowledge as well as experimental data to produce probabilities. [...] The expert knowledge is represented by some (subjective) prior probability distribution. [...] These data are incorporated in a likelihood function.
