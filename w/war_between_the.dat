5|$|Basically, the {{parallels}} concern {{the presence of}} first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir.

The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of Proto-Indo-European society were fused only after a <b>war</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> first two against the third.|$|E
