5|$|On 3 November, a {{batch of}} three {{companies}} was deployed to the Badgam area on patrol duties. Their objective <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the infiltrators moving toward Srinagar from the north. As there was no enemy movement, {{two of the three}} deployed companies returned to Srinagar at 2:00pm. However, Sharma's D Company, was ordered to stay in position until 3:00pm. At 2:35pm, Sharma's company was fired upon from the local resident houses in Badgam but counter-fire was not ordered to avoid injuring or killing innocent civilians. Suddenly, a tribal lashkar (English: militiamen) of 700 infiltrators approached Badgam from the direction of Gulmarg. D Company was soon surrounded from three sides and sustained heavy casualties from mortar fire. Sharma realized the importance of holding onto his position as both the city of Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if lost. Under heavy fire, and outnumbered by a ratio of seven to one, he urged his company to fight bravely, often exposing himself to the enemy fire as he ran from one post to the other.|$|E

25|$|The 1960s {{offered little}} {{stability}} {{to the family}} with moves to Blois, Orléans, Compiègne, Rouen and back to Compiègne, following Seel's career. This instability put further strains on his marriage. In 1968, Seel found himself trapped for four days in the besieged Sorbonne when he was sent as observer by his local Parents Association. He then went down to Toulouse where he <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the family's new flat attached to his wife's new job in the administration. There, he was arrested under suspicion of stirring the young demonstrators. The family finally settled in Toulouse.|$|E
25|$|Pilots, {{including}} {{the present day}} pilots of the Commemorative Air Force’s Fifi, {{one of the last}} two remaining flying B-29s, describe flight after takeoff as being an urgent struggle for airspeed (generally, flight after takeoff should consist of striving for altitude). Radial engines need airflow to keep them cool, and failure to get up to speed as soon as possible could result in an engine failure and risk of fire. One useful technique <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the magnetos while already on takeoff roll rather than during a conventional static engine-runup before takeoff.|$|E
25|$|From 1635 to 1748, Richelieu and Louis XIV {{undertook}} {{an expansion}} of the frontiers of the kingdom towards the north and towards the Rhine. Their aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the aspiration of the Austrian royal house towards its own predominance in Europe. The loss of French Flanders (1526) had brought the frontier dangerously close to the French capital. Alsace, Artois and Franche-Comté were annexed between 1648 and 1697. The Duchy of Lorraine remained some time an enclave in the French kingdom before it too was incorporated in 1766. This and the purchase of Corsica in 1768 brought the territory of the kingdom into a consolidated block.|$|E

This scratch force became known as [...] "Berryforce". His mission <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the enemy advance in the Merdjayoun area. Berryman decided {{that the best way to}} do this would be to recapture Merdjayoun. This presented considerable difficulty, for although his force contained two infantry battalions, the 2/25th and 2/33rd, and a pioneer battalion, the 2/2nd, his headquarters was not equipped to control a battle in the manner of an infantry brigade, as it lacked appropriate staff and communications. Moreover, while he was supported by [...] mechanised cavalry and 22 artillery pieces, [...] the opposing French forces had tanks.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season Shero led the Flyers to a 50–16–12 record, {{first place}} in the Western Division. The 112 point total also placed the Flyers just one point behind the Boston Bruins for first overall in the NHL. It also marked the first time in franchise history that the Flyers posted a winning percentage over 0.700. The division title and high winning percentage accompanied by a 27-point increase from the previous season led to Shero winning the inaugural Jack Adams Award for coach of the year. In the 1974 playoffs the Flyers' first round match-up was against the Atlanta Flames. Following a game three win in which the Flyers went up 3-0, Shero was involved in an infamous incident. Known for taking late night walks and stopping at local bars and pubs for a drink, Shero decided to go for one of those walks following the game three victory. Though {{no one knows for sure}} what happened, Shero was allegedly mugged. Shero didn't divulge any information about what really happened but police responded to a disturbance call at 2 a.m. outside the Flyers hotel. Shero was found with a broken thumb and cuts and bruises to his face. Flyers' management sent him home to recuperate and assistant coach Nykoluk coached the team in the series winning game. In the Semi-final round the Flyers were considered underdogs to the New York Rangers. However, the Flyers had home ice advantage. In the seven game series the home team won every game, giving the Flyers a 4-3 series win. It marked the first time an expansion team defeated an Original Six team in a playoff series. The Flyers advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they played the Boston Bruins. Prior to game one Shero devised an unconventional game plan. The Flyers were to dump the puck to Bobby Orr's side of the rink. Orr was considered to be one of the league's best players, and the plan was to make him skate hard back to get the puck. In addition the team was to be physically hard on him. Any player who had the opportunity <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>check,</b> bump or put a stick on Orr, in an attempt to wear him down. Bobby Clarke later recalled that the strategy did work although it did take some time. Clarke stated that Orr was the best player on the ice in game five, but in game six Orr wasn't the factor he had been in other games. Going into game six, the Flyers had a chance to win the Stanley Cup. Prior to the game Shero wrote his famous quote [...] "Win today, and we walk together forever" [...] on the dressing room blackboard for inspiration to the players. The quote is still used today. The Flyers went on to win game six and the series, thus becoming the first expansion team to win the Stanley Cup. Following the series Flyers' goaltender Bernie Parent was named Conn Smythe as playoff MVP. During the official presentation Parent was given a new car, which he promptly gave to Shero.|$|E

2500|$|Cardinal de Richelieu {{was often}} {{known by the}} title of the king's [...] "Chief Minister" [...] or [...] "First Minister". He sought to {{consolidate}} royal power and crush domestic factions. By restraining the power of the nobility, he transformed France into a strong, centralized state. His chief foreign policy objective <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the power of the Austro-Spanish Habsburg dynasty, and to ensure French dominance in the Thirty Years' War that engulfed Europe. Although he was a cardinal, he did not hesitate to make alliances with Protestant rulers in attempting to achieve his goals. While a powerful political figure, events like the Day of the Dupes (Jour des Dupes) show that in fact he very much depended on the king's confidence to keep this power.|$|E

He first {{received}} submission of the ruler of Pegu (Bago). But the Thaton Kingdom refused to submit. Anawrahta's armies, led by the [...] "Four Paladins", invaded the southern kingdom in early 1057. After a 3-months' siege {{of the city of}} Thaton, on 17 May 1057, (11th waxing of Nayon, 419 ME), the Pagan forces conquered the city. According to Burmese and Mon traditions, Anawrahta's main reason for the invasion was Thaton king Manuha's refusal to give him a copy of the Theravada Buddhist Canon. (Anawrahta had been converted to Theravada Buddhism from his native Ari Buddhism by Shin Arahan, a monk originally from Thaton.) In reality, it was merely a demand for submission couched in diplomatic language, and the real aim of his conquest of Thaton <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the Khmer Empire's conquests in the Chao Phraya basin and encroachment into the Tenasserim coast.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, Schellenberg met Reinhard Heydrich {{and worked}} {{for him in the}} {{counter-intelligence}} department of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). Besides his native German, Schellenberg also spoke French and English fluently. Correspondingly, his first foreign-intelligence assignment was to Paris in 1934, where his role <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> up on the political views of a professor. Then in 1937, Schellenberg was sent to Italy for a police assignment which included security duties for an upcoming visit by Mussolini; his outstanding work in providing security garnered positive attention from Heydrich, who then tasked him with additional organizational responsibilities, some of which later helped give birth to the RSHA. The official SS personnel report on Schellenberg described him as [...] "open, irreproachable, and reliable"; the file also delineated him as [...] "firm, tough, possesses energy" [...] and one who was [...] "very sharp thinking"; and his National Socialist worldview was labeled, [...] "thoroughly fortified." [...] Many of the SS street-brawling types despised men like Schellenberg, considering them effete, {{but for the most part}} Schellenberg made a good impression on the Nazi elite.|$|E
2500|$|The Court's [...] "commitment to Apprendi in {{this context}} {{reflects}} not just respect for longstanding precedent, but the need to give intelligible content {{to the right of}} jury trial. [...] That right is no procedural formality, but a fundamental reservation of power in our constitutional structure." [...] Just as citizens participate in the legislative process by electing representatives to the legislature, they participate in the judicial process by serving on juries. [...] The Apprendi rule ensures that [...] "the judge's authority to sentence derives wholly from the jury's verdict. [...] Without that restriction, the jury would not exercise the control that the Framers intended." [...] Justice Scalia, as the author of the majority opinion, reasoned that those who reject [...] Apprendi [...] "are resigned to one of two alternatives." [...] First, a jury might be allowed only to pass on a small part of criminal activity, and then allow the judge to determine the punishment for the full range of conduct the government seeks to punish, as by letting the jury determine whether an accused murderer illegally possessed a firearm and then allowing the judge to impose a life sentence because the defendant had used the firearm to kill someone. [...] Second, the legislature could establish judicial limits that were not too excessive, a necessarily subjective standard that would be hard for the Court to monitor and adjust as necessary. [...] But this claim was not plausible, since the entire purpose of the jury-trial requirement <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> judicial authority.|$|E
