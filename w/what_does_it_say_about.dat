5000|$|As {{a related}} anecdote, in 1984, A.Q. Khan wrote that President Zia had {{appointed}} two Major Generals, Zahid Ali Akbar Khan and Anis Nawab, whom Peter Griffin {{had met in}} London in 1977 over dinner at the Kundan Restaurant, to oversee all operations. Khan's reference was to a dinner meeting in which Peter Griffin says he met a Brigadier General Anis Nawab who was described as running a project on industrializing Pakistan. [...] However, Brigadier General Anis Nawab was obviously a fictitious name, for Brigadier General {{is not even a}} rank in the Pakistan Army and there was no Brigadier or General by the name of Anis Nawab at the time. Khan has been unwilling to reveal the true identity of the mystery Brigadier General. In addition, Peter's account also has its problems. For example, why would any general travel all the way from Pakistan to meet Griffin, then jeopardize his operation by introducing himself with a fake rank that didn't even exist in his own army? Also why did he make up a rank that suggested he wasn't a general, yet allow his team to address him as a general? Also, why would Peter go ahead with the deal after it was obvious that the man had a fake rank and name? It is a very odd story and requires clarification. In addition, it is unclear how Khan knew which Generals and how many were appointed by Zia to oversee operations. After all, if General Zia had managed to conceal the identity of EME's Director General who was running the show and allowed Khan to think Director ITD was Director General EME <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Khan's knowledge of who was overseeing operations? Khan was a director (rather than a director general) at the time, the equivalent of a Brigadier in the army or a middle management executive at a large corporation. In addition he had just moved from Europe. So, it is quite unlikely that Gen Zia or anyone else would have shared with Khan how many generals were overseeing the operation or their identities. Essentially, both A.Q. Khan and Peter Griffin were misled into thinking they were dealing with a Brigadier / Brigadier General rather than a general officer with a different name.|$|E
5000|$|Responding to the {{controversy}} Ridley defended the play, describing {{what he felt}} were double standards within the theatrical establishment, {{in that it is}} acceptable for there to be scenes of violence in classical drama but not within contemporary plays: [...] "Why is it that it is fine for the classic plays to discuss - even show - these things, but people are outraged when contemporary playwrights do it? If you go to see King Lear, you see a man having his eyes pulled out; in Medea, a woman slaughters her own children. The recent revival of Iphigenia at the National was acclaimed for its relevance. But when you try to write about the world around us, people get upset. If I'd wrapped Mercury Fur up as a recently rediscovered Greek tragedy it would be seen as an interesting moral debate like Iphigenia, but because it is set on an east-London housing estate it is seen as being too dangerous to talk about. What does that say about the world we live in? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> theatre today?"Ridley also explained that he felt critics had disliked Mercury Fur because of its subject matter and not for the theatrical experience the play is trying to create for its audience: “I don’t think there is anything wrong with people being disturbed within the theatre at all… I think theatre is fifteen years behind any other art form... It’s still perceived as a kind of subject matter based art form. You wouldn’t go along and look at a Suzanne painting and criticize it just on the choice of apples she’s chosen to paint, you’d criticize it, and you’d judge it and experience it for the use of paint… Because we come from a basic literal tradition we still view stage plays as kind of glorified novels and we judge them purely on their subject matter, regardless of the theatrical experience of sitting there and watching the play.” Ridley also defended the depiction of violence within the story, arguing that is used for a moral purpose and that the play is more about love than violence:"The things that happen in Mercury Fur are not gratuitous, they are heart-breaking. The people may do terrible things but everything they do is out of love, in an attempt to keep each other safe. The play is me asking, 'What would I do in that position?' If you knew that to keep your mother, brother and lover safe, you would have to do terrible things, would you still do them? That's the dilemma of the play. It asks us all, 'What lengths would you go to to save the people you love?'" ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedIn 2007, the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) emerged after the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) aligned itself with Al-Qaeda.
