25|$|The {{reliability}} of decoding can be low since {{the degree of}} freedom is not increased by signal relaying.

Thus, in the following we consider the cooperative scheme which decodes the combined signal of both the direct and relayed signals.|$|E
25|$|After the {{introduction}} come {{the words of}} Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake {{of life in the}} present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>can.</b> The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.|$|E

It was unveiled by King Carl XVI Gustaf, at a ceremony attended by then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and his wife Nane Maria Annan, Wallenberg's niece. At the unveiling, King Carl XVI Gustaf said Wallenberg is [...] "a great example {{to those of us}} who want to live as fellow humans". Kofi Annan praised him as [...] "an inspiration for all of us to act <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> and to have the courage to help those who are suffering and in need of help".

(Incidentally several actors and actresses connected to Disney {{have appeared in the}} Disney-produced Grey's Anatomy, broadcast on a Disney-owned network.)

500|$|Hazlitt's {{essay on}} Hamlet was later used by David Bromwich in an {{extensive}} comparison of Coleridge's and Hazlitt's critical views in general. Although, to Bromwich, Coleridge's criticism of Hamlet contained {{a greater number}} of original ideas, including the general assessment of Prince Hamlet's character, Hazlitt's view is notable in that it does not, like Coleridge, reduce that character to a single dominating flaw, his inability to act. In one of his lectures on Shakespeare, Coleridge claimed that [...] "Shakespeare wished to impress upon us the truth that action is the chief end of existence—that no faculties of intellect, however brilliant, can be considered valuable, or indeed otherwise than as misfortunes, if they withdraw us from or render us repugnant to action, and lead us to think and think of doing, until the time has elapsed <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do anything effectually." [...] Hazlitt, on the other hand, instead of applying this moral, pointed to the necessity of each reader's identifying with Hamlet to understand him (which, he believed, occurred more readily than with any other of Shakespeare's characters) and the reader's judging of Hamlet in part {{on the basis of what}} that reader then saw in himself. This made it unlikely that Hamlet's entire character would be reduced to a single flaw that would provide the reader with a moral lesson.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Inside Soap, Kirkwood said that Anthony and Tyler would bring a new element to EastEnders, [...] "There's been no shortage of brilliant and sexy women in EastEnders {{over the past few}} years and it was about time there were some blokes to join them. Tony and Matt are great actors, and the fact that they're easy on the eye is a great advantage". [...] "What the brothers bring is romance and fun, because that's something we've been a little short-changed on in EastEnders recently. The Moons are a very interesting family to work with– they're all big characters. It's a great new era for that clan". Kirkwood added that [...] "there is more to the pair than meets the eye" [...] saying that there [...] "are a couple of buried secrets between Eddie and his sons" [...] confirming it will be [...] "a big story for the summer". He finished, [...] "there'll be consequences for all concerned". Kirkwood later added, [...] "What I hope we've created in Tyler and Anthony are blokes you might see in the pub on a Friday night with an appetite for life– and for women." [...] When Anthony was introduced, it was revealed that he was a gambling addict. Of this, Lapinskas said, [...] "it's a great thing that our executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and the EastEnders team came up with for Anthony– that he does have this gambling problem and various insecurities connected with it. It adds some more depth to the character and it's brilliant <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> explore that. With every topic and every storyline that crops up, I think Anthony's background will always have an effect and impact on it. That's really nice to play." ...|$|E
500|$|The 13th season also {{featured}} or spoofed real-life songs and bands.

[...] "Gay Fish" [...] satirizes the rapper's tendency {{to rely on}} audio processing to correct his mistakes in pitch. After [...] "Fishsticks" [...] aired, the full song was made available for download on South Park Studios.
