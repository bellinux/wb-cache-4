She's certainly a very tough lady, and it's not my first waltz {{with this type of}} character. However, I was able {{to spend some time with}} Anne, a great technical advisor <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> set.

500|$|After {{finishing}} film school, Australian director James Wan and Australian writer Leigh Whannell {{wanted to}} write and fund a film. The inspiration that they needed came after watching the low-budget independent film The Blair Witch Project. [...] Another film that inspired them to finance the film themselves was Darren Aronofsky's Pi. The two thought the cheapest script to shoot would involve two actors in one room. Whannell said, [...] "So I actually think the restrictions <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> our bank accounts at the time, {{the fact that we}} wanted to keep the film contained, helped us come up with the ideas in the film." [...] One idea was to have the entire film set with two actors stuck in an elevator and being shot in {{the point of view of}} security cameras.|$|E

Upon discovery of copies {{of the game in}} Sunsoft's headquarters in Japan, Gaijinworks' founder Victor Ireland said: [...] "I was blown away when I saw these.

500|$|The Philadelphia Mint {{released}} the new cents {{to the public}} on May 25, 1857. In anticipation of large popular demand, Mint authorities built a temporary wooden structure {{in the courtyard of}} the Philadelphia facility. On the morning of the date of release, hundreds of people queued, one line for those exchanging Spanish silver for cents, the other for those bringing in old copper cents and half cents. From 9 am, clerks paid out cents for the old pieces; outside the Mint precincts, early purchasers sold the new cents at a premium. Snowden wrote to Guthrie, [...] "the demand for them is enormous… <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> hand this morning $30,000 worth, that is three million pieces. Nearly all of this amount will be paid out today." [...] The 1856 specimen became publicly known about the time of issuance, and had the public checking their pocket change; 1856 small cents sold for as much as $2 by 1859. The public interest in the new cents set off a coin collecting boom: in addition to seeking the rare 1856 cent, some tried to collect sets of large cents back to 1793, and found they would have to pay a premium for the rarer dates.|$|E

2500|$|The two new {{tracks were}} {{produced}} by Brandon Friesen, {{who has also}} been overseeing sessions for the band's next studio album. Consisting of songs written by Pritchard while the other band members spent time with their families, the new album is deemed {{to be more of}} a band effort, as opposed to Listen which was constructed individually. [...] "This one’s very much 'us' – all rehearsing songs, all arranging songs, all playing together. It’s got the same sort of energy that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> our first couple of albums, which we were probably running away from a little bit for a while, but now we’ve gone back to it," [...] said Pritchard.

[...] The Malta event has traditionally been observed on 7 February since 1994, making it the longest running local IMD observation in the world. As the February date is not celebrated by other participating countries and did not qualify as an internationally observed date, discussions were undertaken within the Maltese Association for Men's Rights, and on 17 January 2009, the committee voted unanimously to shift their celebrations to 19 November to coincide with all the others around the world.|$|E

He's stated [...] "We did the Who's Next tour {{for a year and a}} half, across the US, to Europe and back here again." [...] The tour created a bond between Heil and Who guitarist Pete Townshend, who commissioned Heil to create the quadraphonic sound system he had envisioned for the live tour after the release of their Quadrophenia LP. According to Heil, [...] "We set up two 15-channel Midas consoles together, put speakers in four corners and we were able to fly Roger's [...] voice around the room. When we did Madison Square Garden with Quadrophenia, the PA was enormous. I think <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> each side six to eight 15-inch speaker bins, six to eight radial horns, and about a dozen tweeters. We could get about 110dB to 115dB on that stage before feedback. And the Who loved it, man, because it was loud, and they loved loud." ...|$|E
