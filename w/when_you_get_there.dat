5000|$|Escaping the explosion, Allie leads {{his family}} and Mr. Haddy through the jungle to Sico River, {{determined}} to move even further from civilization, and become less dependent on technology. They borrow a boat from a Miskito and float down to Brewers Lagoon where Mr Haddy's mother lives in a nearby village. Mr Haddy gave directions to the Laguna Miskita, 'it so small, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>gets</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> ain't believe you there', which sounds ideal to Allie. On arrival they convert an abandoned dugout into a hut, beachcombing for materials (including an outboard motor which Allie repairs) and planting crops on the shore; total self-sufficiency. Then the rainy season starts, and a storm surge from a tropical cyclone washes away all their work. Mr Haddy arrives under cover of night and gives Charlie a drum of gasoline and spark plugs, which he knows Allie would not accept; Charlie hides them on the shore. Allie finds them and determines to use the supplies to sail upstream, against the flow [...] "that Mosquito Coast is a dead loss...there's death down there...Everything broken, rotten and dead is on that stream and being pulled down to the coast... I've been fighting the current all along". Charlie and Jerry {{want to return to}} America, but Allie tells them that it has been destroyed.|$|R

5000|$|Slovik, {{wearing a}} uniform {{stripped}} of all insignia with a GI blanket across his shoulders against the cold, was {{led into the}} courtyard of a house chosen for the execution because it had a high masonry wall. The commanders {{did not want the}} local French civilians to witness the proceedings. Soldiers stood him against a six inch by six inch post. The soldiers strapped him to the post using web belts. One went around and under his arms and hung on a spike on {{the back side of the}} post to prevent his body from slumping following the volley. The others went around his knees and ankles. Just before a soldier placed a black hood over his head, the attending chaplain, Father Carl Patrick Cummings, said to Slovik, [...] "Eddie, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> up <b>there,</b> say a little prayer for me." [...] Slovik answered, [...] "Okay, Father. I'll pray that you don't follow me too soon." [...] Those were his last words.|$|R
5000|$|Kohl made {{a call to}} the White House {{days before}} Reagan's visit to make sure the President was not {{wavering}} in the face of criticism, not to mention pressure from wife, Nancy. The Chancellor's aide, Horst Teltschik later said: [...] "Once we knew about the SS dead at Bitburg - knowing that these SS people were seventeen to eighteen years of age, and knowing that some Germans were forced to become members of the SS, having no alternative - the question was, Should this be a reason to cancel?" [...] Reagan aide Robert McFarlane later said: [...] "Once Reagan learned that Kohl would really be badly damaged by a withdrawal, he said 'We can't do that; I owe him.'" [...] Prior to sending Deaver back to West Germany for the third time, just two days before the scheduled visit, Reagan told his deputy chief of staff: [...] "I know you and Nancy don't want me to go through with this, but I don't want you to change anything <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> over <b>there,</b> because history will prove I'm right.

"The road {{all the way}} is like a circus," [...] {{the young}} soldier observed, [...] "and there isn't a thing to be seen <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> The naval airmen {{were all over the}} place at daybreak, and Captain Griffiths wasn't far behind them.

500|$|Musically, [...] "Superstar" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop song, that {{features}} influences of electronic and pop music. The track was mixed by Demacio 'Demo' Castellon for The Demolition Crew, and recorded by Angie Teo. Editing for the track {{was completed by}} Stephen 'The Koz' Kozmeniuk for The Demolition Crew. The song makes references to historical figures including Marlon Brando, James Dean, Al Capone, Bruce Lee, Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln and John Travolta. Billboards Keith Caulfied noted dubstep influences during the bridge, and like other songs on MDNA, [...] "Superstar" [...] takes time to change the composition into a fast-paced track. According to Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph, the composition features a [...] "shimmering ambiance built up from a ringing guitar loop and echoing tom-tom pattern {{that might have been}} constructed from Beatles' drum fills." [...] Along with the looping music, the lyrics are simple and obtuse in nature, which McCormick believed was done deliberately like [...] "You can have the password to my phone / I'll give <b>you</b> a massage <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> home". <b>There</b> are also references to her older songs like [...] "Into the Groove" [...] (1985) with the line, [...] "You're Travolta getting into your groove".|$|R
5000|$|A {{music video}} was {{directed}} by D.J. Webster. The video was edited by Scott C. Wilson.According to Webster, the video's main idea {{was to create a}} picture of the relationship that everybody wants. Grant added, [...] "I think <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> film where <b>there</b> is {{a good sense of humor}} and mutual respect and people are just having a good time, everybody wants a piece of that". Its beginning features Grant receiving attention from other men, and her staying loyal to her lover, portrayed by model Jme Stein (who also appeared in her other video from that album [...] "Good for Me"). At some point Stein is seen singing along with Grant and at the end lip-syncing to the words [...] "Baby I'm so glad". The rest of the video is all about the couple having fun together.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} map editor {{by holding}} 'Ctrl' and {{clicking}} on the main menu, where players can create and edit their own maps. Cossacks II also includes a gameplay mode called Battle for Europe in which your orders are to capture everything on the vast map of Europe that range from major cities, such as Moscow, Paris, and London, to smaller provinces such as Nantes and Toulouse that you must capture {{in order to gain}} experience, which in turn gives you access to more squads and more elite infantry to be able to capture the capital cities. Also, you can move up in rank and experience levels every time you win some battles or skirmishes in this mode. For example, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first start the game, you are a 1st Lieutenant. However, if on your first skirmish, you gain a victory, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to the battle report menu, it will tell you how much experience <b>you</b> gained and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> past that <b>there</b> will be promotion and rewards messages and you are likely to become a captain, etc.|$|R
