5|$|The Nintendo 64 version {{features}} two game types: Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch, {{where the}} objective is to kill as many opposing players as possible; and Frag Tag, in which one random player is transformed into a monkey with no attacks and very little health. The monkey's task is to go to a specific point to return to their normal form and transform another random player into the monkey. Players gain points by killing the monkey and lose points if they die as the monkey. The Microsoft Windows version features three game types: Rok Match, which is the same as Deathmatch; Arena, where two players or teams must battle against each other in an arena setting. The winning player or team will have to face a new opponent. If the player or team loses, they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in line and wait for their next turn to fight again; and Capture the Flag, where the goal is to capture opposing flags and return it to a team's base.|$|E
500|$|A {{review by}} Graham Staplehurst in White Dwarf magazine, issue #60, gave the module an 8 out of 10 overall, {{and noted that}} the lack of things such as gold and clerics in the {{adventure}} world [...] "don't destroy the feel of the scenario, whilst creating a very novel atmosphere". Staplehurst felt that the adventure was [...] "...very much taken off from Lord of the Rings with a powerful magic item to be taken at all costs to the aggressor's innermost defences and through them. The characters <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> past a nice new race of humanoids as well as a couple of other monster-concepts. The artwork (aside from the cover) is good and usable in the adventure. Another good product." ...|$|E

By 1922, the Fitzgeralds had employed a nurse for their daughter, a couple to clean their house, and a laundress. When Harper & Brothers asked her to contribute to Favorite Recipes of Famous Women she wrote, [...] "See {{if there is any}} bacon, and if there is, ask the cook which pan to fry it in. Then ask if there are any eggs, and if so try and persuade the cook to poach two of them. It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns very easily. Also, in the case of bacon, do not turn the fire too high, or you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the house for a week. Serve preferably on china plates, though gold or wood will do if handy." ...|$|E

Seven letters about Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle are extant. Mrs. Josephine Rabbit writes to complain of starch in her handkerchiefs, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle responds with apologies, Mrs. Rabbit then writes to compliment Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle on the [...] "getting up of the children's muslin frocks" [...] and promises not to seek another laundress. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle writes Master Fayle warning him that [...] "verything has got all mixed up in wrong bundles" [...] and wondering if he has received Mr. Jeremy Fisher's shirt or Mrs. Flopsy Bunny's apron? Mrs. Bunny writes Master Drew that she is looking for her apron. She has received a shirt marked J.F. that is 3-inches long. Jeremy writes twice to Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Once, to complain that he has received an apron marked F.B. and then to complain in a letter dated January 22, 1910:Mr. J. Fisher regrets to have to complain again about the washing. Mrs. T. Winkle has sent home an enormous handkerchief marked 'D. Fayle' instead of the tablecloth marked J.F. If this continues every week, Mr. J. Fisher <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married, so as to have the washing done at home.|$|E
2500|$|Finally Kurzweil {{addresses}} {{identity with}} futuristic scenarios involving cloning a nonbiological version of someone, or gradually turning that same person into a nonbiological entity one surgery at a time. In {{the first case}} {{it is tempting to}} say the clone is not the original person, because the original person still exists. Kurzweil instead concludes both versions are equally the same person. He explains that an advantage of nonbiological systems is [...] "the ability to be copied, backed up, and re-created" [...] and this is just something people <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to. Kurzweil believes identity [...] "is preserved through continuity of the pattern of information that makes us" [...] and that humans are not bound to a specific [...] "substrate" [...] like biology.|$|E
2500|$|Coonan {{spoke to}} David Brown from Radio Times about the crash, {{where it was}} said that Carl would [...] "show just how evil he can be" [...] by causing it. Coonan said that Carl causes the crash because he wants to depose Phil as [...] "top boy" [...] in Albert Square, saying it is [...] "such an insane thing to do. You get to see how nuts Carl is. He doesn't care if Phil dies yet he risks {{damaging}} himself as well. [...] He realises he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of him." [...] He also said that Phil is a [...] "major barrier" [...] for Carl getting what he wants, so he could either go into business with Phil or eliminate him. On filming the crash, Coonan explained that he was inside the car when the glass was detonated, and he suffered cuts on his leg and hand. Brown said the crash looks [...] "visceral and intense" [...] on screen, and said that Phil is not scared of Carl because he sees him as a [...] "wannabe" [...] and a [...] "young pretender", but added that [...] "there is obviously more to [...] than [...] realises." ...|$|E

2500|$|On May 22, 2009, a video went viral of Hamilton freestyling, {{and then}} getting {{assaulted}} by his former girlfriend/fellow rapper Briana Latrise, the stepdaughter of Mary J. Blige, due to Hamilton rapping, [...] "OK, call me irresponsible and immature, but you're beautiful, {{what the hell}} else would I hit it for? Now I can say that I hit it raw, but {{that would mean that}} you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an abor, or I just not need to go there", clarifying at some point at that past time that Hamilton had got Latrise pregnant but for undisclosed reasons Latrise would have an abortion. On May 25, 2009, during an interview, they both publicly apologized to each other, with Hamilton stating, [...] "I apologize honestly for putting some things out there that shouldn't have been out there. I understand it; it was the heat of the moment, and I didn't get the chance to really talk to you about it. I {{just wanted to tell you}} I apologize because I know what I shouldn't have said", and with Latrise remarking, [...] "I'm going to thank you for your apology.

2500|$|The Canbys next {{moved to}} Portland, Oregon where the general became {{commander}} of the Department of Columbia. This Pacific Northwest command encompassed Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. In 1872 the Modoc War broke out, involving both Oregon and northern California. On April 11, 1873, Modoc leader Kintpuash (also known as Captain Jack) killed the unarmed Canby and several members of his party during peace talks. Canby had written frankly to Louisa about his misapprehensions over the negotiations with the Modocs. A chief concern (which proved to be prophetic) was that Captain Jack so feared treachery {{that he might be}} capable of committing treachery preemptively. On the day of his death Canby received a letter from his wife in Portland. She had written, [...] "I think over all sorts of Modoc treachery till I am becoming a nervous, hysterical woman and <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from Oregon to get over it." [...] Louisa found her husband's death so unbearable that she spent a week in bed. His body was shuttled from place to place {{for more than a month}} before it reached Indianapolis, Indiana, and was finally buried at Crown Hill Cemetery. With the support of her brother, Colonel John Hawkins, Louisa devoted the last sixteen years of her life to promoting the memory of her husband.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1902 Petipa {{began work}} on a ballet {{adaptation}} of the tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs titled The Magic Mirror. Petipa mounted the work for his own benefit performance, which was to mark a [...] "semi-retirement" [...] for the Ballet Master. The ballet, set {{to the music of}} the avant-garde composer Arsenii Koreshchenko, was given on [...] at the Mariinsky Theatre to an audience composed of the whole Imperial Family and many members of the St. Petersburg nobility. The production boasted bizarre décor and costumes that were considered to be unsuited for a classical ballet. In spite of this Petipa received a roaring ovation from the audience {{at the end of the}} performance. Le Miroir magique was given , and was considered to be an all-around failure, though Petipa's choreography was not mentioned among the criticisms. Not long afterward rumour began to circulate that Petipa was to be replaced, and Telyakovsky even made an announcement to the Stock Trade Bulletin, a St. Petersburg newspaper, that [...] "...the ballet company <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to a new Balletmaster – Alexander Gorsky. He will stage his own versions of 'The Little Humpbacked Horse' and 'Swan Lake'. He has staged both ballets (for the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre) entirely differently and in a much more original manner." [...] In the end Gorsky never succeeded Petipa as premier maître de ballet. The coveted post would later go to Mikhail Fokine.|$|E

2500|$|Chemistry {{was largely}} praised by {{contemporary}} music critics upon its release. Talia Kraines of BBC Music {{decided that the}} album was [...] "quirky, modern and dripping with attitude" [...] and [...] "holds no disappointments." [...] Virgin Media gave the album five stars, saying it was [...] "bursting [...] with invention, quirky lyrics, tongue-in-cheek sauciness and [...] appeals to grown-up pop fans and music critics {{as well as to}} the teenyboppers." [...] Yahoo! Music concurred by declaring that Chemistry was [...] "as devilish and quirky and downright uplifting as anything else released by anyone this year." [...] The Guardian was extremely positive in its review, saying it [...] "spends 45 minutes doing the last thing you expect it to." [...] The New York Times referred to the album as [...] "endlessly entertaining". In comparison to Girls Aloud's previous albums, Entertainment.ie referred to Chemistry as their [...] "best offering yet [...] overflowing with pop hooks, sassy production and choruses just waiting to take up permanent residence in your head." [...] The Daily Telegraph said that Girls Aloud have [...] "simply got much, much better [...] albums <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better in order to survive. It's happened here.
