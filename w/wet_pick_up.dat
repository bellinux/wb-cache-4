50|$|To {{produce a}} {{miniature}} gourmet look-alike, first choose the pre-dyed clay in the desired colour. Use your palms {{to soften the}} clay and roll the clay to the desired shape. Cook the clay in the oven, let the clay cool down in the oven until it is cool enough to be handled again. After it is cooled, take the razor blade and shave off a tiny pile of white powder from chalk. Spray or paint a layer of Varathane sealer. While the sealer is still <b>wet,</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> some of the white chalk powder with your finger tip and dab it sparingly onto a few areas of the clay. The general shape of the model is thereby finished. Lastly, one may utilize different paints and colouring tools to finish the process.|$|E

50|$|Primarily a browser, the {{mountain}} nyala may switch to grazing occasionally. It feeds on low-height herbs, bushes, shrubs and general foliage. They might even eat lichens, ferns and aquatic plants. Grasses are specially preferred {{during the early}} <b>wet</b> season. They <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> fallen leaves and use their horns to reach higher branches. Favoured species include Artemsia afra (sage brush), Hypericum revolutum, Kniphofia foliosa, Solanum sessilistellatum and Hagenia abyssinica leaves. They prefer Alchemilla rotti, Helichrysum splendidum and lower foliage of Lobelia rynchopetalum.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>wet</b> <b>picking</b> and <b>wet</b> repellence of offset {{papers were}} studied using IGT-gst 2 {{printability}} tester according to change printing conditions as printing speed {{and the amount}} of fountain solutions. It was showed that the phenomena of <b>wet</b> <b>picking</b> and <b>wet</b> repellence occurred in turn on the surface of offset papers with increased printing speed {{and the amount of}} fountain solution. In addition, in contrast with fountain solutions, printing speed had greater influence on the phenomena of <b>wet</b> <b>picking</b> and <b>wet</b> repellence of offset papers...|$|R
30|$|The <b>wet</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> was {{calculated}} by calculating the weight difference of wet and dry fabric and expressed in percentage {{on the basis of}} weight of dry fabric. The padding mangle pressure of 4.5  bar, was used to get 80 % pick up in the application of water repellent chemical.|$|E
30|$|For the {{application}} of synthesized Titanium nano dispersion, {{the most widely used}} method of application pad-dry-cure process was used. The plasma treated polypropylene nonwoven fabric was coated with 1 % nano dispersion with material to liquor ratio of 1 : 20 and 0.5 % anionic binder. The fabric samples were immersed in the bath followed by padding through squeezed rollers at a pressure of 147  N/cm 2 to remove the excess liquid. Each fabric sample was padded with the solution twice to ensure even distribution of solution. After padding, the fabric was dried naturally and then cured at 150 °C for 2  min. The <b>wet</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> was 89 %. The add-on of the titanium nanoparticles was 87 %. Pore size of the plasma enhanced nano finished outer nonwoven fabric was characterized using tri-nocular microscope.|$|E
40|$|<b>Wet</b> <b>pick</b> {{is thought}} to be caused by the {{presence}} of water used in lithography. The quantity of the wetting fluid, surface tension of the wetting fluid and the time interval between wetting and printing were tested to see if they affect the paper surface strength. Two rolls of web paper are pre-sampled from the RIT press room. One was found to exhibit the problem of <b>wet</b> <b>pick</b> while the other did not exhibit this defect. These papers were tested on the IGT Printability Tester {{in a manner similar to}} that predicted on press when a moisture film of 0. 2 micrometer is applied with no delay between application of ink and water. This method can be used to predict the defect referred to as <b>wet</b> <b>pick.</b> Adding to the moisture film thickness results in an increased <b>wet</b> <b>pick</b> in both good and bad paper with a delay between dampening and inking of 0. 3 and 0. 6 seconds. This researcher hypothesized that for a wetting fluid, the factors that contribute to picking are the quantity, the evaporation rate, and the wetting characteristic...|$|R

40|$|Technical Area- 18 (TA- 18), {{also known}} as Pajarito Site, is located on Los Alamos National Laboratory {{property}} and has historic buildings that {{will be included in}} the Manhattan Project National Historic Park. Characterization studies of metal contamination were needed in two of the four buildings that are on the historic registry in this area, a “battleship” bunker building (TA- 18 - 0002) and the Pond cabin (TA- 18 - 0029). However, these two buildings have been exposed to the elements, are decades old, and have porous and rough surfaces (wood and concrete). Due to these conditions, it was questioned whether standard wipe sampling would be adequate to detect surface dust metal contamination in these buildings. Thus, micro-vacuum and surface wet wipe sampling techniques were performed side-by-side at both buildings and results were compared statistically. A two-tail paired t-test revealed that the micro-vacuum and wet wipe techniques were statistically different for both buildings. Further mathematical analysis revealed that the <b>wet</b> wipe technique <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> more metals from the surface than the microvacuum technique. Wet wipes revealed concentrations of beryllium and lead above internal housekeeping limits; however, using an yttrium normalization method with linear regression analysis between beryllium and yttrium revealed a correlation indicating that the beryllium levels were likely due to background and not operational contamination. PPE and administrative controls were implemented for National Park Service (NPS) and Department of Energy (DOE) tours {{as a result of this}} study. Overall, this study indicates that the micro-vacuum technique may not be an efficient technique to sample for metal dust contamination...|$|R
