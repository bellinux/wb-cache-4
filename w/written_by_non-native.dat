40|$|ABSTRACT Coherence {{is one of}} the {{characteristics}} of good academic writing, including abstract that represent the whole content of research article in order to show what messages want to be expressed in the abstract. This study investigated the English abstracts in International conference in applied linguistics written by Indonesian speaker in their coherence by analyzing the theme and rheme. This study focuses on (1) identifying the theme which are dominantly used in 2015 International conference article abstracts <b>written</b> <b>by</b> <b>non-native</b> speaker of English (2) identifying thematic progressions which are dominantly used in 2015 International conference article abstracts <b>written</b> <b>by</b> <b>non-native</b> speaker of English (3) finding out coherences’ quality of the research article abstract in 2105 International Conference article abstracts in applied linguistic based on thematic progression. This study was designed by using descriptive qualitative with content analysis approach. The results show that the type of theme dominantly used in 2015 International conference article abstracts <b>written</b> <b>by</b> <b>non-native</b> speaker of English was topical theme, not all non-native speakers of English used textual theme, and just a few of them used interpersonal theme. In addition, Zig Zag pattern in thematic progression was dominantly used then followed by reitaration theme, and the last Multiple (Split) pattern, none of the abstracts used Derived TP pattern. Most of the research article abstract section in International Conference abstracts in applied linguistic had fair quality, just a few included to less quality, none of them was catagorized as good and poor quality. It can be concluded that English abstracts of International conference in applied linguistisc written by Indonesian speakers can be catagorized as fair abstract based on their coherence...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} German posture verbs has {{attracted}} {{the interest of}} many linguists, e. g. Berthele (2004 and 2006), Fagan (1991), Kutscher-Schultze-Berndt (2007) and Serra-Borneto (1996). It is surprising that most studies disregard the posture verb sitzen ‘to sit’. The present paper aims at looking at this neglected area of description. A corpus study of sitzen allows us to get a differentiated picture of the different uses of that verb and to show that sitzen is not restricted to the concrete sitting position but {{is also used to}} express more abstract senses, e. g. Er sitzt in der Falle, lit. ‘He sits in the trap’(= ‘He has problems’), or Das Kleid sitzt nicht, lit. ‘The skirt does not sit’ (= ‘The skirt does not fit’). A further look at learner corpora of German essays <b>written</b> <b>by</b> <b>non-natives</b> indicates that foreign learners of German seem to have difficulties with the more abstract or metaphorical uses of the verb sitzen. Interestingly enough, most teaching manuals for German do not describe the semantic uses of sitzen either. The study aims at making up for these deficits. With examples from the German corpora from the Digitales Wörterbuch der Deutschen Sprache (DWDS) it first describes the different uses of the verb sitzen. It then offers a brief critical overview of teaching manuals for German. Based on essays from learner corpora, e. g. Falko, and translation tests by French students it further presents the difficulties encountered by foreign learners of German with the more abstract or metaphorical uses of sitzen. In the framework of Cognitive Linguistics the study also proposes some ‘conceptual tools’ to facilitate the acquisition of the more abstract uses of the verb sitzen. These tools are semantic networks, visuals, and conceptual metaphors. Spatial distinctions such as those between container and contact are extended to more abstract areas of experience, especially in the context of situations describing abstract states. Here one of the main issues for the learner is to find out whether the abstract goal is conceptualized as a container, a contact or still another basic spatial relation. The efficiency of these conceptual tools is tested with a cloze test conducted with French-speaking students...|$|R
