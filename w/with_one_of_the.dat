5|$|All Upanishads are {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four Vedas—Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda (there are two primary versions or Samhitas of the Yajurveda: Shukla Yajurveda, Krishna Yajurveda), and Atharvaveda. During the modern era, the ancient Upanishads that were embedded texts in the Vedas, were {{detached from the}} Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of Vedic text, compiled into separate texts and these were then gathered into anthologies of Upanishads. These lists associated each Upanishad <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four Vedas, many such lists exist, and these lists are inconsistent across India in terms of which Upanishads are included and how the newer Upanishads are assigned to the ancient Vedas. In south India, the collected list based on Muktika Upanishad, and published in Telugu language, became the most common by the 19th-century {{and this is a}} list of 108 Upanishads. In north India, a list of 52 Upanishads has been most common.|$|E
